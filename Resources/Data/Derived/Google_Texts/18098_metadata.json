What might happen, then, in a slightly longer period of time? A mere three minutes was all it took for children to feel close to an unknown partner, a team of researchers say.\n\nAfter playing a simple computer game in unison, pairs of unacquainted 8-year-olds reported feeling a greater sense of similarity and closeness, yet pairs who played the exact same game asynchronously did not report these same feelings, say Dr. Tal-Chen Rabinowitch of the Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences at University of Washington and Dr. Ariel Knafo-Noam, a professor of psychology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.\n\n\u201cSynchronicity is a special form of interaction,\u201d Rabinowitch and Knafo-Noam told Medical Daily in an email. \u201cIt can range from completely unintentional and passive to fully intentional and active, but in any case it involves at least some level of sensory-motor interaction between participants.\u201d\n\nTheir experiment began when 74 children came to the lab and spent a few minutes side by side in front of a video screen playing a game together. All the children were 8-years-old and all were twins. In every case, each was paired with a previously unknown same-sex boy or girl.\n\nThe simple game involved tapping their fingers in response to a soccer ball bouncing on a video screen. Some children tapped in response to synchronous bouncing balls, others tapped out of sync, as seen in the video below:\n\nAfter the game, the children filled out questionnaires about how similar and close they felt to the other unknown child in their pair. Children in the synchronous group reported a greater sense of similarity and closeness than those children who did not play a game with their partner or those who played the game out of sync. Synchrony, Rabinowitch explained, \u201cis a glue that brings people together \u2014 it's a magical connector for people.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is interesting that even implicit and passive synchronous interaction is sufficient to shift social attitudes,\u201d Rabinowitch and Knafo-Noam told Medical Daily. When asked whether the experiment might yield different results if the children were not twins \u2014 since twins being twins may have a greater inherent feeling for synchronicity than other children \u2014 the researchers said they believed non-twins or only children would respond similarly to the game since the twins showed individual differences in their response levels.\n\n\u201cThere is a possibility that on average, twins or children that have many siblings may be more susceptible and sensitive to changes in synchrony than other children (although we are not aware of any evidence for this),\u201d said Knafo-Noam and Rabinowitch, whose past work showed how music lessons build empathy in children. Going forward, Rabinowitch hopes to reveal how synchrony is able to guide and improve social and emotional interactions between humans, keeping us all \u201cin tune.\u201d\n\nSource: Rabinowitch TC, Knafo-Noam A.
