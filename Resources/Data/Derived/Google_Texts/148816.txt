Because of a steep drop in the teen birthrate, there are 4 million fewer smartphone-hugging young people in the U.S., according to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Between 1991 and 2013, the teen birthrate fell by 57 percent, decreasing for all races and Hispanic ethnicity groups. Non-Hispanic black teens saw the largest decline. Birthrate is the amount of births per 1,000 teenagers.

The change translates into an estimated 4 million fewer births by teen mothers between 1992 and 2012 and an estimated $12 billion in savings to taxpayers in 2010 alone. Researchers at The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy estimate the average cost to taxpayers for teen births to be $1,700 per year from when the child is born to age 15.

The U.S. has one of the highest teen birthrates among developed countries, even with continued declines over the last two decades. Only two other developed countries had a teen birthrate that exceeded that of the U.S. – Bulgaria at 41.7 and Romania at 35.2. Denmark, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland had birthrates that were one-fifth of the most recent U.S. rate of 26.6.

Cutting the teen birthrate is important for better health outcomes in infants and increased economic possibilities for teens. Babies born to teens have a greater risk for many complications, which are associated with high health costs. Teen mothers are also more likely to smoke during pregnancy. Eleven percent of teen mothers in 37 states and the District of Columbia smoked during pregnancy in 2012. For mothers 20 and older, 8.5 percent of women smoked during pregnancy.

The teen birthrate varies widely among states based on differences in culture, education, availability of birth control, economics and state population.

The drop in teen birthrates accompanies drops in many other measures related to births, sex and contraception among the U.S. population.

Birthrates for all women have been decreasing and women are having babies later on average.

There also are fewer unwanted or mistimed births among the U.S. population in general since 1982, as reliable birth control has become more widespread. In 1995, 26.9 percent of women using birth control were using condoms as their main form of protection. From 2006-2010, 16.4 percent relied on condoms, while more women relied on methods with higher effectiveness such as the pill, hormonal methods or intrauterine devices. Male condoms have a 8.7 probability of pregnancy during the first 12 months of typical use.

Fewer women relied on the rhythm method as well. The greatest change was in the prevalence of intrauterine devices, which jumped from 0.8 percent to 5.6 percent.

Teenage sexual behavior also saw many changes between 1991 and 2013, which contributed to the decreased birthrate. Teens in high school are less likely to say they ever had sexual intercourse – 54.1 percent of teens said so in 1991, while 46.8 percent of teens said the same in 2013. For sexually active teens, fewer had sex with multiple partners. Fewer teenagers also had sex for the first time before age 13.

Teens additionally are somewhat smarter about birth control, possibly due to education or the massive amount of Internet resources available on the subject. A simple Google search for "how to put on a condom" returns many correct resources, including informational videos. (One answer to the question, "What did people do before the Internet?" might be "get pregnant more often.") Fewer teens report having sex without a condom than in 1991, and fewer teens are having unprotected sex than in 1999 – however, the number has been increasing since a dip in 2001.

The statistics for teenage contraception are somewhat incomplete. The CDC only began checking for IUD and implant use among teens in 2013, when less than 2 percent used that method. In 2011, it began checking for dual use of birth control methods among teens. In 2011, 9.5 percent of sexually active teens used two methods and in 2013, 8.8 percent used two methods.
