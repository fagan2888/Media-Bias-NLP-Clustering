A 2013 Anthem Film Festival grand prize winner, America's Longest War uses archival footage and personal stories to demonstrate how the war on drugs has eviscerated civil liberties, strained the prison system to its breaking point, saddled Americans with billions in debt, and left more than 60,000 Mexicans dead. With your support, we hope America\u2019s Longest War will help spur change in America\u2019s misguided drug laws.\n\nThe Cato Institue will be hosting a screening of the film on Thursday, September 19 at 4 p.m. ET in the Hayek Auditorium.
