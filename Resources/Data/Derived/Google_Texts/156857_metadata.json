I invited him to stay and we talk about what he would like to see in Flemington.\n\n\"The 90 Main Street project came to life when we approached Councilman Velella about the use of the Borough\u2019s empty space at 90 Main. Since its opening at the May car show, the building has been an active art gallery and performance venue with showings of independent films, open mic nights, local and regional bands, and recently a twenty-four hour creative writing marathon. The project has been a tremendous success and has attracted much attention within the state,\u201d Jones-Holt added.\n\nThe first ever Popup Art and Performance Gallery was created to revitalize Main Street by repurposing the empty storefront with an affordable space for local artist to show and sell their art. The 90 Main Street project, as it is called, reflects the address of the space donated by the Borough of Flemington to provide a safe and creative space for the community of all ages to engage in a burgeoning local arts scene the BID is establishing. Both Jeff and Mike, who manage the space under the name of Flemington DIY, accepted the award along with Executive Director Megan Jones-Holt and Chairman Robert Shore.\n\nTim Delorm of Terra Noble Design also was present to acknowledge his working relationship with the BID and Borough for the Strategic Plan created for six areas of redevelopment.\n\n\u201cThe project\u2019s purpose was to create a vision for the future of Flemington,\u201d Robert Shore, Chairman indicated. \u201cThe Strategic plan is meant to serve as a vision of what can happen in Flemington for redevelopment. It is not an approved plan in progress, but rather a vision to consider. The FBID took the strategic vision as a proactive approach to its mission and vision plans, Shore added.\n\nThe organization\u2019s mission works toward recruiting, revitalizing and retaining businesses in the Borough of Flemington. The strategic plan has been used to attract investors to identify possible areas to develop. The planning board is now reexamining its master plan and it has created conversations with organizations to implement specific elements identified. Transportation has been identified as a key element and several meetings have taken place with NJTPA and NJ Transit to bring connectivity to Hunterdon. The Plan is also in line with the County Of Hunterdon\u2019s Economic Development Plan for Downtown Centers and the BID and Borough of Flemington have been working with the county\u2019s planning board. A web based planning tool through Placeways, LLC and the County Planning Board has selected the BID as a pilot to incorporate the strategic plan.\n\nEach year Downtown New Jersey recognizes New Jersey\u2019s best downtown projects and programs completed within the last 2 years. Winning submissions are considered models worthy of emulation and are promoted on DNJ\u2019s website.\n\nDowntown New Jersey is non-profit corporation comprised of individuals, business leaders, government and non-profit representatives that are passionate about downtowns.
