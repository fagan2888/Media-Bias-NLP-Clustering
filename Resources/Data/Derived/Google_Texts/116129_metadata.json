Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, in 2013 created the Healthcare Quality and Payment Policy Advisory Committee to review rules related to the program.\n\nMembers of the committee weren't appointed until last fall, and Friday was the first time the committee has reviewed rules implementing new episodes.\n\nThe members recommended changes to a few details.\n\nFor instance, the committee recommended that, in addition to having low costs, hospitals be required to use chest X-rays on at least 75 percent of pneumonia patients who are age 6 months to 4 years to be eligible for bonuses.\n\nAs currently written, the rules call for the Medicaid program to track X-ray use, but they don't make X-ray use a requirement of eligibility for bonuses.\n\nInstead, the draft rules call for hospitals to be disqualified from receiving bonuses if they prescribe antibiotics to more than 80 percent of children with pneumonia. The committee recommended that the Medicaid program track antibiotic use but not tie it to the bonuses.\n\nWilliam Golden, the Medicaid program's medical director, said most cases of pediatric pneumonia are caused by viruses and aren't affected by antibiotics.\n\nJacqueline Gorton, a Medicaid episode design manager, said staff members at the state Department of Human Services will either make the changes recommended by the committee or issue a written statement outlining the reasons the department is not making a change, as required by the 2013 law.\n\nGolden called the discussion \"extremely constructive.\"\n\n\"There were many suggestions here that were very useful,\" he said.\n\nThe episodes of care program is part of the state's Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative, which is aimed at curbing the growth of spending in the state's Medicaid program.\n\nUnder another part of the initiative, known as the patient-centered medical home program, Medicaid and private insurers make upfront payments to doctors who agree to take steps to better coordinate patient care.\n\nArkansas designed the programs with help from a $42 million grant from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' Innovation Center, which was created by the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The grant was awarded in 2013 and expires at the end of this year.\n\nThe Medicaid episodes already in place are for upper respiratory infections, maternity care, congestive heart failure, knee or hip replacement, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, gall bladder removal, colonoscopy, tonsillectomy, oppositional defiant disorder, coronary artery bypass grafting, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nArkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield and QualChoice Health Insurance have also implemented some of the episodes along with Medicaid.\n\nThe Human Services Department will hold a public hearing in July on the rules implementing the four episodes reviewed by Healthcare Quality and Payment Policy Advisory Committee on Friday, Gorton said.\n\nThe rules will then go to the Arkansas Legislative Council for approval.\n\nShe said the department hopes to give health care providers information in October on their costs associated with the episodes over the previous year.\n\nThe first bonuses or penalties for those episodes, in connection with care provided in 2017, would likely be awarded in April 2018, she said.\n\nMembers of the committee are appointed by the speaker of the House and Senate president pro tempore.\n\nDavy Carter, speaker of the House from 2013-14, and Michael Lamoureux, who was senate president pro tempore during that period, said Friday that they didn't remember why they didn't appoint members.\n\n\"I didn't even know [the committee] existed until you just told me,\" said, Lamoureux, who left the Senate to work for the governor's office.\n\nJonathan Dismang, who has been Senate president pro tempore since January 2015, said he didn't recall a reason for the delay in the appointments.\n\nJeremy Gillam said he had a long list of appointments to make after he took over as House speaker in 2015, and the episodes committee \"slipped through the cracks\" after the 2015 Legislative session.\n\nThe members are Medicaid Director Dawn Stehle; Bradley Bibb, a family physician in Jonesboro; Elizabeth Blankenship of Heber Springs, who represents the Arkansas Assisted Living Association; David Deaton, administrator of Ozark Health Medical Center in Clinton; John Henderson, chief medical officer at White County Medical Center in Searcy; Brant Joyner, who owns two assisted living facilities in Searcy; David Norsworthy represents the Arkansas Health Care Association; Vicki Pennington, who represents the HomeCare Association of Arkansas; Joel Pritchett, who represents the Arkansas Association of Area Agencies on Aging; Jason Richey, family practice doctor in Paris; and Joanna Thomas, a medical director for Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield.\n\nThe committee also has one vacancy, Gorton said.\n\nMetro on 05/07/2016", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "2016-05-07 2:52", "description": "Health care providers involved in removing appendixes or uteruses, treating children for pneumonia or treating children or adults for urinary tract infections would be eligible for potential financial bonuses and penalties from Arkansas' Medicaid program under rules reviewed by an advisory panel on Friday.", "og": {"site_name": "NWADG.com", "description": "Health care providers involved in removing appendixes or uteruses, treating children for pneumonia or treating children or adults for urinary tract infections would be eligible for potential financial bonuses and penalties from Arkansas' Medicaid program under rules reviewed by an advisory panel on Friday.", "title": "State expands 'episode of care' list", "url": "http://www.nwaonline.com//news/2016/may/07/state-expands-episode-of-care-list-2016-1/", "image": "http://media.arkansasonline.com/static/nwaonline/redesign/images/nwadg_logo_square.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nwademgaz", "card": "summary"}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 808815}}, "msvalidate.01": "EA63F4AB342DF722672B7C42FC274A37", "verify-v1": "ntz4zhlNc8dc+KpcOZSIkQ3h1m920ZCTxFSLtaJeEkQ=", "y_key": "535776bc9e71aec0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c8d\"", "article_summary": "The episodes of care program is part of the state's Health Care Payment Improvement Initiative, which is aimed at curbing the growth of spending in the state's Medicaid program.\nShe said the department hopes to give health care providers information in October on their costs associated with the episodes over the previous year.\nJeremy Gillam said he had a long list of appointments to make after he took over as House speaker in 2015, and the episodes committee \"slipped through the cracks\" after the 2015 Legislative session.\nThe committee recommended that the Medicaid program track antibiotic use but not tie it to the bonuses.\nAs currently written, the rules call for the Medicaid program to track X-ray use, but they don't make X-ray use a requirement of eligibility for bonuses."}
