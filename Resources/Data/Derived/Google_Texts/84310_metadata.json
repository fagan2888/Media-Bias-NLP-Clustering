The network included former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal who was prevented from taking a job at State in 2009 by the Obama White House. Mr. Blumenthal had circulated some \u201cunflattering\u201d stories about the president during the 2008 campaign.\n\nWe also know that Mrs. Clinton used two separate email addresses (hdr22@clintonemail.com and hrod17@clintonemail.com) while she was at the State Department. Clinton\u2019s legal team asserted that the latter address did not exist during her tenure as our top diplomat. When the initial reports of the secret intelligence network came to light, we did not know if Hillary read or even corresponded with Blumenthal\u2019s emails. Now, it looks as if she did read them, and even forwarded a few to a State Department staffer.\n\nLast week, in Iowa, Mrs. Clinton said the Blumenthal emails were \u201cunsolicited\u201d (via Politico):\n\nClinton downplayed Blumenthal\u2019s influence in answers to reporters\u2019 questions this week in Iowa, describing the emails as useful to ensure that she wasn\u2019t \u201ccaught in a bubble\u201d with information coming only \u201cfrom a certain small group of people.\u201d \u201cHe sent me unsolicited emails which I passed on in some instances, and I say that that\u2019s just part of the give and take,\u201d Clinton said Tuesday. \u201cI have many, many old friends and I always think that it\u2019s important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what\u2019s on their minds,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time.\u201d\n\nNow, the Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius wrote that someone told him that Blumenthal approached a former CIA officer, Tyler Drumheller, and said to him that \"his friend Clinton\" was \"looking for information\" on Libya [emphasis mine]:\n\nBlumenthal\u2019s missives on Libya appear to be mostly repackaged information from a former CIA officer named Tyler Drumheller , who is now part of Alphom Group, one of the many consulting firms in Washington that employ former spooks to harvest their old contacts for salable information. A principal of Alphom told me that Blumenthal had approached Drumheller and said his friend Clinton was \u201clooking for information\u201d about Libya.\n\nDrumheller was named as someone who collected the intelligence and prepared the reports when the initial ProPublica/Gawker story broke. Yet, this nugget comes from one person at this consulting firm. If this is corroborated, it just added another notch regarding Clinton\u2019s lack of transparency and secretiveness that confirms old biases people have against the Clintons. She\u2019s turning into the most flawed of flawed candidates. Moreover, it could undercut any attempt to highlight her tenure at State. Such back-door communications have happened before, and often led to bad policy:\n\nMichael Morell, a former deputy director of the CIA and author of \u201cThe Great War of Our Time,\u201d says that Blumenthal\u2019s missives never came to the attention of senior agency personnel and never got into the paper flow of the National Security Council. That\u2019s good, given that it was the CIA\u2019s job to report on Libya, for real. But the Blumenthal papers were taken seriously at State. Clinton sent them on to her overworked aide, Jake Sullivan, with such notations as \u201cUseful insight, pls circulate,\u201d or \u201cvery interesting,\u201d or, in one instance, \u201cWe should get this around asap.\u201d \u2026 These memos recall other dubious back channels involving oil-rich Middle East nations. Libya snared President Jimmy Carter\u2019s brother, Billy, as an emissary in the late-1970s. The Iran-contra scandal began in 1985 with an Iranian information peddler named Manucher Ghorbanifar, whom the CIA dubbed a \u201cfabricator\u201d but the White House embraced, anyway. The danger of Washington\u2019s courtier ethos is that it can lead to bad policy, or no policy. You can\u2019t escape the feeling that Clinton and her aides were passing around Blumenthal\u2019s e-mails when they should have been framing a better plan to deal with Libya\u2019s disintegration.\n\nWe shall see what happens regarding Ignatius' Alphom source. In the meantime, it should come to no one's surprise that Mr. Blumenthal has been subpoenaed by the House Select Committee on Benghazi regarding these communications.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hmmmm..05/27/2016 8:52:17AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hmmmm.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Wait\u2013Did Hillary Tell Blumenthal To Look For Information In Libya?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/27/wait-did-hillary-tell-blumenthal-to-look-for-information-in-libya-n2004647", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/139/2015-05-19T164845Z_1_LYNXMPEB4I0UZ_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hmmmm.", "title": "Matt Vespa - Wait\u2013Did Hillary Tell Blumenthal To Look For Information In Libya?", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/05/27/wait-did-hillary-tell-blumenthal-to-look-for-information-in-libya-n2004647", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/139/2015-05-19T164845Z_1_LYNXMPEB4I0UZ_RTROPTP_3_USA-ELECTION-CLINTON.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Wait\u2013Did Hillary Tell Blumenthal To Look For Information In Libya?, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "A principal of Alphom told me that Blumenthal had approached Drumheller and said his friend Clinton was \u201clooking for information\u201d about Libya.\nWhen the initial reports of the secret intelligence network came to light, we did not know if Hillary read or even corresponded with Blumenthal\u2019s emails.\nThe network included former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal who was prevented from taking a job at State in 2009 by the Obama White House.\nYou can\u2019t escape the feeling that Clinton and her aides were passing around Blumenthal\u2019s e-mails when they should have been framing a better plan to deal with Libya\u2019s disintegration.\nWe also know that Mrs. Clinton used two separate email addresses (hdr22@clintonemail.com and hrod17@clintonemail.com) while she was at the State Department."}
