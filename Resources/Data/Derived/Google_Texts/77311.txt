BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) â€” Hungary's government says its computer network came under attack from outside the country, temporarily blocking access to several websites.

Officials said Saturday that over 62,000 cyberattacks had been registered in a single day, affecting the main government website and that of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, among others.

The interior ministry said it had been able to restore access to the overloaded networks despite the constant attacks but had not been able so far to identify the perpetrators.
