Hirono. \u201cThese grants will be paid back many time over as families who participate in home-visiting programs enter school better prepared. I was proud the vote to create the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting grants as part of the Affordable Care Act, and am pleased that Hawai\u2019i families continue to benefit from this valuable program.\u201d\n\nPregnant women and families with children up to five years old will be supported by the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program.\n\nBrian Schatz, who is a member of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, said in a statement that \u201ca child\u2019s development is more critical in the first few years of life than at any other time. These funds will provide more Hawai\u2019i families with access to in-home visits from nurses and social workers, ensuring parents have the support they need for their child\u2019s healthy development.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the MIECHV grant was first award to the Hawai\u2019i DOH. Officials used the funds to establish the Hawai\u2019i Home Visiting Network, which is a group of ten community based organizations that offer home visiting programs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis grant from the Department of Health and Human Services will help working families in Hawai\u2019i by providing the resources necessary to improve child health in a cost-effective way,\u201d said Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. \u201cBy funding local home-visit programs, we are helping families prevent child injuries, reduce emergency department visits, and improve economic self-sufficiency. The programs sustained by his DHHS grant promote the well-being of our keiki.\u201d\n\nFunds received under the grant will be used to provide voluntary home visits to low-income parents who will learn about health, child development, school readiness, and referrals to other services.\n\n\u201cI am happy to join the other members of Hawai\u2019i\u2019s Federal Delegation in announcing over $9 million in new grants to the State of Hawai\u2019i Department of Health,\u201d said Congressman Mark Takai. \u201cThese grants will be directed towards programs that provide for maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting and education services. These programs have improved the outcomes for many children and families and I look forward to a greater expansion of these services to serve our community here in Hawai\u2019i.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Hawai'i Department of Health will receive over $9.4 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "og": {"url": "http://bigislandnow.com/2015/02/20/hawaii-doh-receives-funding-for-miechv-program/", "site_name": "Big Island Now  |  Hawai\u2019i DOH Receives Funding for MIECHV Program", "image": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/department-of-health-logo-e1373576970260.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Big Island Now: Hawai\u2019i DOH Receives Funding for MIECHV Program"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://bigislandnow.com/wp-content/themes/BigIslandNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "hawaii department of health,united states department of health,maternal,infant,and early childhood home visiting program,east hawaii news,news,north hawaii news,west hawaii news", "theme-color": "#57ace2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf442\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBy funding local home-visit programs, we are helping families prevent child injuries, reduce emergency department visits, and improve economic self-sufficiency.\nOfficials used the funds to establish the Hawai\u2019i Home Visiting Network, which is a group of ten community based organizations that offer home visiting programs.\nThese funds will provide more Hawai\u2019i families with access to in-home visits from nurses and social workers, ensuring parents have the support they need for their child\u2019s healthy development.\u201dIn 2010, the MIECHV grant was first award to the Hawai\u2019i DOH.\nAccording to the Hawai\u2019i Congressional Delegation Friday, the Hawai\u2019i Department of Health is set to receive $9.43 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to support pregnant mothers and families with young children.\n\u201cThese grants will be directed towards programs that provide for maternal, infant, and early childhood home visiting and education services."}
