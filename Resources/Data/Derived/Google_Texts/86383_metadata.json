Wade, but a Tuesday ruling from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals declaring an admitting privileges requirement unconstitutional means that the clinic will remain open.\n\n\u201cPre-viability, a woman has the constitutional right to end her pregnancy by abortion,\u201d wrote Judge E. Grady Jolly in the decision. Mississippi\u2019s admitting privileges law \u2014 a law the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization had been unable to comply with despite multiple efforts to do so \u2014 \u201ceffectively extinguishes that right within Mississippi\u2019s borders.\u201d As Irin Carmon at MSNBC points out, Jolly is a Reagan appointee and the Fifth Circuit is a conservative court.\n\nA different panel on the same court had previously upheld an identical requirement in Texas even though it shuttered around half of the clinics in the state. But the law in Mississippi would have closed the state\u2019s last remaining clinic, meaning that people would have no other choice but to leave the state to exercise their constitutional rights and access abortion care. This was, according to the court\u2019s logic, an undue burden distinct to citizens of Mississippi. \u201cMississippi may not shift its obligation to respect the established constitutional rights of its citizens to another state,\u201d according to the ruling. It\u2019s the outcome that Dr. Willie Parker \u2014 a provider at the Jackson clinic and one of the plaintiffs named in the case \u2014 predicted in conversation with Salon earlier this year:\n\nI think everything hinges on that \u2014 the undue burden. [\u2026] I guess the undue burden standard can be looked at cynically \u2014 as it was in the Texas case \u2014 when the presiding judge said Texas is flat and that people can drive 75 miles an hour. So rather than being an undue burden [to have the nearest clinic be hundreds of miles away], it\u2019s more of an \u201cinconvenience.\u201d I think what makes this difference is that Texas is a big state. And you can drive 200 miles and be in the same state. But Mississippi is not that large of a state. If you drive 170 miles you\u2019ll be in another state, which is around where the closest clinic from Jackson would be. I think that would be in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. So in this case, I think it really comes down to: Can you impose your duty to take care of your own citizens on another state just because there are services that were formerly available in yours that are no longer available because you changed the rules? Can you do that to your citizens? Can you abdicate your responsibility?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The victory was the work of reproductive justice advocates in Mississippi, but the Reagan appointee helped", "title": "Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic to remain open \u2014 thanks in part to a Reagan appointee", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The victory was the work of reproductive justice advocates in Mississippi, but the Reagan appointee helped", "title": "Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic to remain open \u2014 thanks in part to a Reagan appointee", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/29/mississippis_last_abortion_clinic_to_remain_open_thanks_in_part_to_a_reagan_appointee/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/01/AP120627165653-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The victory was the work of reproductive justice advocates in Mississippi, but the Reagan appointee helped", "title": "Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic to remain open \u2014 thanks in part to a Reagan appointee", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/01/AP120627165653-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion rights, Mississippi, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Abortion, abortion rights, Mississippi, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights, Life News, News, Politics NewsMississippi was on the verge of becoming the first state in the nation without a single abortion clinic since Roe v.
