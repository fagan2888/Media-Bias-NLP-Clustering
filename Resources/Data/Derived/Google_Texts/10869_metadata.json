So what should I do with them? He asked. Burn them, he said.\u201d These were Netanyahu\u2019s words before the World Zionist Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nIf such a sentence were uttered by anyone but the leader of the Jewish state, one might be tempted to call it Holocaust denying, or at least a radically revisionist narrative of what happened.\n\nBut, Holocaust experts say, the interaction the prime minister described is a fiction.\n\n\u201cThis conversation never took place,\u201d said Dr. David Motadel, a historian and author of \u201cIslam and Nazi Germany\u2019s War.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mufti was not involved in the planning of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Nazis had started to murder Jews on the eastern front in the late summer of 1941, long before the mufti arrived in Germany. The Holocaust had already started.\u201d\n\nThe only time Mufti Husseini was received by Hitler was on Nov. 28, 1941, Motadel points out, when the Holocaust was already underway. The dynamics were also different from those Netanyahu alluded to. \u201cThere was of course a power imbalance. Hitler did not accept the mufti as an equal. The Germans had in fact a very patronizing attitude toward Amin al-Husayni. They used him as a propaganda tool in the hope to win over the Muslim world. But his influence in Berlin was limited.\u201d\n\nThe German government was equally adamant that Netanyahu was mistaken.\n\n\u201cWe know that responsibility for this crime against humanity is German and very much our own,\u201d said Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert when asked about the remarks. \u201cThis is taught in German schools for good reason, it must never be forgotten. And I see no reason to change our view of history in any way.\u201d\n\nThis is not Netanyahu\u2019s first such claim. During a 2012 Knesset speech he referred to Husseini as \u201cone of the leading architects\u201d of the Final Solution.
