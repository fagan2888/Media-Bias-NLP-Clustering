With open enrollment season upon us, employers and employees need to get ready for some changes precipitated by the Affordable Care Act and other legal developments.

Open enrollment refers to the period of time in which employees are allowed to choose among various options for health-care coverage and other benefits. Employers typically schedule open enrollment for two to four weeks in the fall, providing an annual window for employees to enroll in new coverage, change existing coverage or opt out of benefits they no longer want.

As part of the process, employers should be aware of compliance obligations under the Affordable Care Act, including some ACA requirements that took effect in prior years. For example, the federal health-care law has already eliminated pre-existing condition exclusions, extended the cutoff for dependent coverage until children reach age 26 and ended lifetime and annual limits on the dollar value of essential health benefits.

Additional compliance issues to watch out for heading into 2016 include the following:

•Benefits summary and glossary. During open enrollment, employers must supply health plan information in a standardized format, giving plan participants and beneficiaries a Summary of Benefits and Coverage and a Uniform Glossary. A separate SBC must be provided for each benefits package during open enrollment. The glossary, on the other hand, is a one-size-fits-all document that offers definitions of common health insurance and medical terms.

•Grandfathered status. If employers have maintained the grandfathered status of health plans that predated the ACA’s effective date, they must provide plan participants with disclosure statements in any materials describing plan benefits. Employers can draft their own statements or use model language from the Department of Labor. In the event that a health plan undergoes significant changes, it loses grandfathered status and becomes subject to the same ACA requirements as other plans.

•Out-of-pocket limits. Nongrandfathered group health plans must apply the 2016 self-only maximum annual limit on cost sharing to each individual regardless of whether individuals are enrolled in self-only or other than self-only health-care coverage. For plan years beginning in 2016, group health plan annual out-of-pocket maximums are $6,850 for self-only coverage and $13,700 for other than self-only coverage.

•Employer mandate. Effective Jan. 1, 2016, applicable large employers with 50 or more full-time employees must offer health-care coverage that is affordable and provides minimum value to at least 95 percent of full-time employees or be subject to penalties if employees purchase subsidized coverage through an ACA marketplace or exchange. (The upcoming open enrollment period for ACA marketplaces runs from Nov. 1, 2015, until Jan. 31, 2016.)

•Same-sex spouses. In light of a recent ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court (Obergefell v. Hodges), employers must treat plan participants who are legally married to same-sex spouses in the same manner they treat plan participants who are legally married to opposite-sex spouses.

Getting up to speed on issues such as these can help employers avoid compliance problems that have the potential to trigger enforcement action, lawsuits and costly penalties.
