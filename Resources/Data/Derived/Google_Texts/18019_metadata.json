So what could Planned Parenthood be using all that money for?\n\nSurprisingly Planned Parenthood is all too willing to share, but unsurprisingly the mainstream media won\u2019t report on any of this. Most American\u2019s would be shocked by what I\u2019m about to show you, using Planned Parenthood\u2019s own words.\n\nFirst, Planned Parenthood is proud of its nearly 100-year history, rooted in eugenics, and its founder Margaret Sanger who established the organization to \"assist the race toward the elimination of the unfit.\" Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t shy away from Sanger, instead opening its message from President Cecile Richards by praising her.\n\nPlanned Parenthood then talks to you, the American taxpayer, thanking you for your support and letting you know what you\u2019ve helped accomplish:\n\nUntil 1973, young healthy Americans women were dying because of illegal and unsafe abortions. Today, abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the country.\n\nThanks to your support, our movement has come so far in nearly one hundred years and we are building momentum.\n\nWith that in mind, here is some of what you helped pay for this year with your tax dollars:\n\n\u201c[A]ctively lobbying in state legislatures\u201d to \u201cprotect access to \u2026 abortion\u201d;\n\nIndoctrinating \u201c1.5 million young people\u201d and \u201c18,000 teachers, school staff, and other youth-serving professionals\u201d with \u201cwhat Planned Parenthood does better than anyone else \u2013 provide sex education\u201d;\n\nTexting \u201c125,000 young people in moments of crisis\u201d about \u201csex\u201d and \u201cemergency contraception,\u201d i.e. abortion pills; and\n\nRunning \u201cthe largest Affordable Care Act [ObamaCare] canvass\u201d in the U.S., ensuring that \u201c1.7 million\u201d people have insurance that covers abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also could have used your tax dollars to pay its legal bills, using the courts to implement its radical abortion agenda. Planned Parenthood spends an entire page of its report touting that it \u201cwon court victories protecting abortion\u201d in numerous states, from Arizona to Iowa. And claims to have stopped pro-life laws that could have \u201cforced three of the five abortion providers\u201d in Alabama to shut down and is \u201cpushing back against similar laws that closed health centers [i.e., abortion clinics] across Texas and threatened access to abortion in Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nWhat are these laws that your tax dollars could have helped to defeat or at least temporarily halt as the cases are appealed? These pro-life laws would have forced Planned Parenthood to follow federally proscribed safety standards and other basic health and safety regulations \u2013 the types of regulations that were ignored in abortionist Kermit Gosnell\u2019s house of horrors where women died and babies born alive after botched abortions were subsequently murdered. There is nothing \u201csafe\u201d about the abortions Planned Parenthood advocates for, not for the women nor the babies. The fact is your tax dollars are feeding Planned Parenthood\u2019s voracious appetite for more abortions, without any restrictions whatsoever.\n\nYou also helped pay for Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion machine reaching \u201c1 million people outside the U.S.\u201d Why is this important? Because President Obama repealed all restriction on U.S. tax dollars being used to fund abortion outside the U.S., something known as the Mexico City Policy. So while your tax dollars can\u2019t technically pay for an abortion within our borders, Planned Parenthood is free to use that money to pay for abortions outside America.\n\nYou also helped pay for Planned Parenthood\u2019s massive media propaganda blitz \u201c[i]n every medium and across every platform\u201d to \u201cshift[] public opinion\u201d by demonizing and distorting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case and every pro-life American who didn\u2019t want to be forced, against their firmly held religious beliefs, to pay for abortion pills.\n\nWhile you might have known about much of that, this next one should be absolutely shocking \u2013 so shocking in fact I am posting the actual page from Planned Parenthood\u2019s annual report so you can see it with your own eyes.\n\nYou paid for an admitted abortion propaganda movie.\n\nI can\u2019t state it in any more plain terms than what Planned Parenthood said itself: \u201cWhen the film Obvious Child was released this year, it marked a breakthrough for abortion in popular culture \u2013 as an edgy, hip, funny, remarkably honest story revolving around one woman\u2019s abortion.\u201d Your tax dollars helped write it, film it, and promote it.\n\nBut that\u2019s the point, Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion distortion is so convincing that it could name a movie about aborting an unborn baby, \u201cObvious Child.\u201d\n\nIt is obvious. It\u2019s obviously a life. But as obvious as it is, we\u2019re still sending half a billion of our tax dollars to the largest abortionist in America.\n\nIt\u2019s time for this obvious travesty to end. New legislation has just been introduced in Congress to cut off Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer funding. Stand with the ACLJ as we urge Congress to pass this legislation and stop forcing Americans to fund the abortion industry. Sign our Petition to Defund Planned Parenthood today.\n\nThis article is crossposted on Redstate.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ)", "language": "en-us", "og": {"site_name": "American Center for Law and Justice", "description": "Earlier this week I unpacked Planned Parenthood\u2019s fallacious reporting mechanisms which attempt to hide the fact that they are the nation\u2019s leader in...", "title": "How $500 Million Tax Dollars Helped Planned Parenthood | American Center for Law and Justice", "url": "http://aclj.org/pro-life/how-500-million-tax-dollars-helped-planned-parenthood", "image": "http://media.aclj.org/940/RTR3D0KM.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@aclj", "image": {"src": "https://7676076fde29cb34e26d-759f611b127203e9f2a0021aa1b7da05.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/940/RTR3D0KM.jpg"}, "description": "Earlier this week I unpacked Planned Parenthood\u2019s fallacious reporting mechanisms which attempt to hide the fact that they are the nation\u2019s leader in...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How $500 Million Tax Dollars Helped Planned Parenthood | American Center for Law and Justice"}, "google-translate-customization": "b9e3cfed32f5d748-542d1652bc3059d9-gd4d1c5bb4fc58f82-8", "revisit-after": "1 day", "article": {"section": "Pro Life", "published_time": "2015-01-08T23:28:53.830Z"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1", "description": "Earlier this week I unpacked Planned Parenthood\u2019s fallacious reporting mechanisms which attempt to hide the fact that they are the nation\u2019s leader in..."}, "article_summary": "You also helped pay for Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion machine reaching \u201c1 million people outside the U.S.\u201d Why is this important?\nPlanned Parenthood admittedly aborted at least 327,653 unborn babies last year and took in $528.4 million in our tax dollars, 41% of its total revenue, last year.\nSurprisingly Planned Parenthood is all too willing to share, but unsurprisingly the mainstream media won\u2019t report on any of this.\nThere is nothing \u201csafe\u201d about the abortions Planned Parenthood advocates for, not for the women nor the babies.\nPlanned Parenthood doesn\u2019t shy away from Sanger, instead opening its message from President Cecile Richards by praising her."}
