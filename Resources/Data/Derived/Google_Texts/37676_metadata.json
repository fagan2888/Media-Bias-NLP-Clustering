Policy and the issue of readiness to be president and experience. And questions about you being a first term senator. Governor Christie warning voters here in New Hampshire against voting for another first term senator as America did with Barack Obama in 2008. Arguing that you were quote not ready to be president of United States. And senator Santorum who we all know dropped of the race just this week and endorsed you had a hard time when asked on national television listing your accomplishments as senator. Tonight what are your accomplishments in the senate that demonstrate you're ready to be president of the United States law. Let me say from protecting the people of Florida from eminent domain abuse took bringing accountability to the VA to the girls count act. To sanctioning terrorists groups I'm proud of my service in the United States senate before that the Florida legislature. I will say it politics becomes in the presidency becomes about electing the people who have been in congress are in the senate the longest. We should all rally around Joseph Biden he's been around a thousand years he's passed hundreds of bills and I don't think any of us believe Joseph Biden should be president of the United States. And let's dispel once and for all of this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country. To make America more like the rest of the world that's why passed obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and a deal with a wrong it's a systematic effort to change America. When I'm president the United States we are going to re embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world. And we are gonna leave our children what they deserve the single greatest nation in the history of the world. Senator rubio thank you. Governor Chris if you sit fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me when it comes to electing a first term senator. You heard senator review make the case that he does have the experience your response. Sure pump first let's remember something every morning when he United States senator wakes up they think about what kind of speech tonight give or what kind of build and I dropped. Every morning when I wake up I think about what kind of problem do I need to solve for the people who actually elected me. It's a different experience it's a much stiffer experience and the fact is Marco you shouldn't compare yourself to Joseph Biden. And you shouldn't say that that's what we're doing here is exactly what we're doing you have not been involved in the consequential decision were you had to be held accountable. He just simply happen. And the factor. Fact that we talked about has lots action fact that you with that one of your competence and just did you weren't even there to vote for it that's not leadership that's truancy. Perhaps this country's not to make the same stick we may be years ago. Practice it does matter we have to make decision to be held accountable for them. It doesn't matter when the count so come on a list of a piece of paper what the vote yes or no every day when the problems come in from the people that should serve. I'd like Marco Rubio. And he's a Smart person and a good god. But he simply does not happy experience to be pres the United States and make these decisions. We've watched it happen everybody for the last seven years the people New Hampshire are Smart to not make the same mistake again. I think the experience is not just what you did how it worked out. Under Chris Christie's governorship of New Jersey they've been downgraded nine times in their credit rating. This kind charity have the debt problem. We don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up and and destroying the credit rating a mistake it. But I would add this let's dispel what this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world we don't want to be like the rest of the world we want to be the United States of America and when I'm elected president. This will become once again the single greatest nation in the history of the world not the disaster Barack Obama has imposed upon. Us senator review thank you do want to bring in governor bush and ultimately you lead agencies if you let the responding economic directly mentioned to me and my record and there. So I think I get a chance for a spot you see everybody I want the people at home to think about this. That's what Washington DC does. The drive by shot at the beginning with incorrect and incomplete information and then the memorize 2.5 second speech that is exactly what. Okay. Yeah. When your press the United States when your governor of a state. The city the memorize thirty seconds Petri talk about how great Americans at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person. They expected a cloudless though they expected to get the schools open and when the worst natural disaster in your State's history hits you. They expect you to rebuild your state which is what I've gone none of that stuff happens on the floor the United States senate it's a fine job I'm glad to ramp fort but it does not prepare you for president of the United States. Chris your state got hit by massive snowstorm two weeks ago you didn't want to go back they had to Shane human development. And then you stay there for 36 hour. Any they came back. See over the fact. The bottom line this notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not there is he knows that there is looking to memorize point five seconds speech that's good. And everybody campaign itself Horton. Because I think this notion I think this is an important point we have to understand what we're going through here we are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing he knows what he's doing. That's why he's done the things he's done. You that's why we have a president that passed obamacare and the stimulus all this damage is done to America is deliberate. This is a president that's trying to redefine this country that's why this election is truly a referendum. On our identity as a nation as a people our future is at stake this election is not about the past it is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21 century. And if we elect someone like Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders or anyone like that our children are going to be the first Americans inherited diminished country that will not governor Bob Miller. Christiane will we respond to Manila seem hesitant to this you don't perceive as mark up. The shame is that you would actually criticize somebody for showing up to work. Plowing the streets getting the trains run back on time when you've never been responsible for that in Iraq are. And the practice I went back it got that in you don't want to go back I went back also up way to think it is that whether the skills you get at the United States senator ESP also. Chris everybody. Today we're gonna go back back to his bar told everyone he would mark go back thought he had to shame them in the dark black market because I had already decided to go back to criticize the young lady saying Marco but you know what back with a ma by the way clean up the -- gets pretty gets ornery track it gets very governor was when he gets office talked. AQ governor I will makes it. Solicitor did not talking points to. Governor bush I'll mention your name so that you can come in on the tonight's premiere analysts. I want to bring you an on this because you've made this central to your campaign right here in New Hampshire in the last couple of days but four years ago you said senator rubio. He was ready to be vice president you spoke of his experience as well. He said he has the fortitude to be a good president. But just this week you said senator reveal accomplice quote nothing in the senate. How do you square the two. Well first of all he said the sex same thing about me that I would make a great vice presidential nominee when Mitt Romney was considering I said the same thing about Marco. I think we're both right at the time and Mitt pick pick somebody else. So let's move on to the Tony sixteen race who has leadership skills. The late. And I'm proud of the fact that I have twelve metal bottom recipients over thirty admirals and generals that believe that I would be a steady hand as commander in chief. That I served as president governor of the state of Florida were we cut taxes and reduced. Government I took on very powerful interest forge consensus fought for my beliefs implemented them the state was better off. We had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms in sixteen months. Though the hole cut the whole state was turned upside down it required. A steady hand leadership you'd learn this you learn by doing it it's not something. I have to say look let's be clear marker reviews a gifted gifted politician. And he may have the skills to be a president of the United States but we've tried at the old way with Barack Obama with soaring eloquence and we got. Leading get a leader we got someone who wants to divide the country up the next breath have to forge consensus to bring about a set a common purposes so that we can move forward again we're gonna Wednesday toward a continuous leadership now.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Video: Marco Rubio on What Qualifies Him to Be Commander in Chief", "description": "Rubio and Christie debate their qualifications at the ABC News GOP Presidential Debate.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Rubio and Christie debate their qualifications at the ABC News GOP Presidential Debate.", "title": "Video: Marco Rubio on What Qualifies Him to Be Commander in Chief", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/marco-rubio-qualifies-commander-chief-36763086", "image": {"identifier": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/160206_abc_gop_debate_rubio_experience_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "video": {"width": 470, "secure_url": "https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/AkamaiPremierPlayer.swf?settings_url=https://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/amp.premier.flashonly.xml?sec=1&params=%7B%22playerId%22%3A%22facebookHTTPS%22%7D&data_feed_url=http://abcnews.go.com/video/itemfeed?id=36763086&auto_play=true&ad_control_enabled=false", "type": "application/x-shockwave-flash", "identifier": "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/AkamaiPremierPlayer.swf?settings_url=http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.19.0.0004/amp.premier/amp.premier.flashonly.xml?sec=1&params=%7B%22playerId%22%3A%22facebookHTTP%22%7D&data_feed_url=http://abcnews.go.com/video/itemfeed?id=36763086&auto_play=true&ad_control_enabled=false", "height": 265}, "type": "video"}, "twitter": {"player": {"identifier": "https://abcnews.go.com/video/twittercard?id=36763086", "stream": {"identifier": "http://once.unicornmedia.com/now/od/auto/98330877-5095-4ac9-9a8c-7cdcd3944274/15a750c8-e7be-4371-b5c3-dd911c0d8bb0/politics-36763086/content.once", "content_type": "video/mp4"}}, "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/160206_abc_gop_debate_rubio_experience_16x9_992.jpg", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/video,36763086", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/video,36763086"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638}}, "card": "player", "site": "@ABC"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/video,36763086", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/video,36763086", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "video": {"duration": 519}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "republican debate, president, presidential debate, ABC debate, 2016, election, republican candidates, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, New Hampshire, politics, Manchester, politics news, election news, political news, political news articles"}, "article_summary": "And let's dispel once and for all of this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing.\nTo sanctioning terrorists groups I'm proud of my service in the United States senate before that the Florida legislature.\nBut I would add this let's dispel what this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing.\nThis is a president that's trying to redefine this country that's why this election is truly a referendum.\nThat I served as president governor of the state of Florida were we cut taxes and reduced."}
