At the same time many of our clients also reside in this area, so it makes perfect sense for us to have a permanent presence here,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new Munich Re office will have a staff of eight and ample room for expansion. Currently, the staff primarily services Munich Re\u2019s managed care unit, but plans call for additional resources in support of both the reinsurance and stop loss business.\n\nThe new office is located at Crescent Ridge II, 10900 Wayzata Blvd., Suite 620, Minnetonka, MN 55305.\n\nMunich Health is one of three business segments of Munich Re. All international health care business in insurance and reinsurance operations, as well as related services are pooled under the Munich Health brand.\n\nSource: Munich Re", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Global reinsurer, Munich Re, announced it is expanding its presence in the U.S. health reinsurance business with the opening of a new regional office in Mi", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "Global reinsurer, Munich Re, announced it is expanding its presence in the U.S. health reinsurance business with the opening of a new regional office in Mi", "title": "Munich Re Opening New Office in Minnesota", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2014/02/06/319743.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Global reinsurer, Munich Re, announced it is expanding its presence in the U.S. health reinsurance business with the opening of a new regional office in Mi", "title": "Munich Re Opening New Office in Minnesota", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "creator": "@ijournal", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2014-02-06", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "Midwest News", "tag": "Munich Re", "published_time": "2014-02-06T12:24:17-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd836d\"", "article_summary": "Global reinsurer, Munich Re, announced it is expanding its presence in the U.S. health reinsurance business with the opening of a new regional office in Minnetonka, Minn.\nThe Minnetonka office will be led by David Sipprell, president of Munich Re\u2019s managed care unit.\nAll international health care business in insurance and reinsurance operations, as well as related services are pooled under the Munich Health brand.\nMunich Health is one of three business segments of Munich Re.\nThe new Munich Re office will have a staff of eight and ample room for expansion."}
