Rodriguez\u2019s beef with the homeowner was so strong, he pulled up in his car a short time after to taunt the homeowner into a fight by waving a knife in the air, but, was unaware that a police officer, called by the homeowner, was watching Rodriguez\u2019s theatrics from behind.\n\nRodriguez\u2019s attack on the screen door was reported to police about 12:30 a.m. Monday and Patrolman Michael Macdonald responded immediately. The officer spoke with the victim then went to search nearby homes, said Ralph Stocco, spokesman for the Toms River Police.\n\nUltimately, Rodriguez, 19, of First Bayway Avenue was charged Monday with criminal mischief, unlawful possession of a weapon and making terroristic threats. He was placed in the Ocean County Jail in lieu of $30,000 bail, and bailed out Monday.\n\nMacdonald was one house away in his investigation and he saw Rodriguez pull up at 1:10 a.m., Stocco said. Unaware of the officer\u2019s presence behind him, Rodriguez got out of his car and started waiving his arms over his head toward the house. As Macdonald approached him, the officer could see Rodriguez had a knife in one hand and a sheath in the other, he said. Macdonald told him to drop his weapon.\n\n\u201cMr. Rodriguez turned and faced the officer and tried to conceal the knife,\u201d Stocco said. \u201cHe refused to obey the officer\u2019s commands to drop it.\u201d\n\nInstead, Rodriguez threw the sheath on the ground, Stocco said. He was told again to drop the knife. Then Rodriguez approached Macdonald \u201cbrandishing the knife\u201d and when he was told for the third time, to drop the knife as well as to halt his approach, he complied and was taken into custody, Stocco said.\n\nDuring his investigation, Macdonald determined that Rodriguez \u201cwas returning with the knife to engage in a fight with the homeowner, who he knew, and was having an ongoing dispute with,\u201d Stocco said.\n\nMargaret F.
