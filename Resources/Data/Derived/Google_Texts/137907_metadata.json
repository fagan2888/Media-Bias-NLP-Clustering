Since that is no longer the case, most counties have decided to cut ties with their nursing homes.\n\n\u201cI have been doing this for about 30 years,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWhen I started, there were probably 46 or 50 counties that still had nursing homes. Now, it is down to 22.\u201d\n\nSchuylkill County\u2019s Rest Haven nursing home, Schuylkill Haven, had a net operating deficit of about $3 million at the end of 2013.\n\nSo far this year, the county commissioners had loaned the facility $1,307,927.73 and allocated $758,891.59 to help pay the bills.\n\nThe commissioners allocated $255,415.62 in 2012 and $300,000 in 2011. Before that, the commissioners did not have to allocate funds since giving Rest Haven $975,000 in 2004.\n\n\u201cThe easy answer is the cost,\u201d Hill said about county homes not turning profits. \u201cThe reimbursement rate per bed is not adequate to cover the cost and counties generally have to make up the difference.\u201d\n\nHill said about 90 to 95 percent of payments at county-run nursing homes come from Medicaid and Medicare, while it only makes up about 40 to 60 percent at private facilities. The rest comes from private payments.\n\nThe reason for the discrepancy is that county homes are required to take in patients that are first-day eligible, Hill said.\n\nSince the cost of care usually exceeds medical reimbursement, private facilities tend to lose less money on their patients.\n\n\u201cThe cost balance is easier for a private home to maintain,\u201d Hill said.\n\nBuilt in 1912, Rest Haven is a 142-bed facility. The daily cost per bed at the facility is $221.47 while Medicaid only reimburses $172.09.\n\nAbout 84 percent of the patients at Rest Haven pay with Medicaid while 5.5 percent use Medicare. The remaining 10.5 percent use private payments. That is a difference of $29.38 in daily medical reimbursements per bed and adds up to a loss of $2,144,820.30 over the year.\n\nHill also said reimbursements from medical assistance have not increased accordingly.\n\n\u201cThe reimbursement rate is in no way keeping up with rising costs,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Carbon County, similar problems led the commissioners to sell Weatherwood Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Weatherly, in 2010.\n\n\u201cAt the time we made the decision to sell the home, we were projected to have a $3 million deficit each year,\u201d Carbon County Commissioner William O\u2019Gurek said Thursday.\n\nO\u2019Gurek, now is in his 11th year on the board, said the facility started losing money in 2008 and through 2009. He also cited low medical assistance reimbursements along with union contracts for nursing home employees making things difficult for county-operated homes.\n\n\u201cWith what the costs have increased to, it makes it very hard to keep your head above water,\u201d he said.\n\nA 200-bed facility, Weatherwood only had about 150 beds filled prior to being sold.\n\nRest Haven, on the other had, was operating at full occupancy at the end of July. The population at Rest Haven has steadily increased since Service Access and Management, Pottsville, took over management responsibilities at the facility in 2012. It is the first time Rest Haven operated at full occupancy in at least six years.\n\n\u201cWe found ourselves in a competitive market in Carbon County in that we are surrounded by nursing homes all over the place,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said.\n\nAccording to the government Medicare website, there are at least 14 nursing homes in Schuylkill County.\n\n\u201cIt also dropped because as a Medicare provider, we had faced some violations,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said.\n\nO\u2019Gurek said the facility was not permitted to accept Medicare patients until plans to resolve those issues were submitted to the state Department of Health. The hospitals in the area were also recommending patients to wings at their facilities.\n\n\u201cWe were also competing against ourselves in that our Area Agency on Aging administers a waiver program encouraging seniors to stay in their homes longer by providing them with programs and funding for things like nursing and housekeeping,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said. \u201cIn one department, we are encouraging people to stay in their homes and in another, we are trying to run a nursing home.\u201d\n\nCarbon County then acquired the services of Marcus & Millichap, Real Estate Investment Services of Philadelphia, to review all the finances at the nursing home, including union contracts, operational expenses and medical assistance reimbursements.\n\nO\u2019Gurek said the company provided them with three options.\n\nOne option was to continue operating the facility by cutting costs, which included the possibility of having fewer beds, reducing staff and developing a marketing strategy to attract more patients. Another option was to outsource the management responsibilities at the facility, like Schuylkill County did with SAM.\n\nThe commissioners ultimately decided to go with the recommended third option of selling the facility.\n\n\u201cUnanimously, we decided that since we were losing $8,200 a day, let\u2019s get out of the business,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said.\n\nMarcus & Millichap was then hired to help prepare the home for sale and secure bids.\n\n\u201cThe firm looked into the stability of those companies and their financial status so that if we were to sell it, we were going to sell it to someone who is capable of keeping it,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said.\n\nO\u2019Gurek said about 10 to 15 proposals were received and about four or five were considered before they agreed to sell it to Guardian Health Care, Nanticoke, for about $11 million. Guardian now owns 30 healthcare communities, with 25 in Pennsylvania, four in Ohio and one in West Virginia, according to its website at www.guardianeldercare.com.\n\n\u201cOur goal had been to keep the facility as a place for the elderly and infirmed that needed that nursing facility and to keep it as a place of employment in that area of the county,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said. \u201cWhen we sold it to Guardian, we believe we met that target we put out there.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Gurek said all but about five of the 200 employees at Weatherwood were offered jobs with Guardian, although probably at a lesser salary with a less lucrative benefits package than with the county.\n\n\u201cWhile they were offered jobs, it was difficult for us as commissioners because the conditions of people\u2019s livelihoods were changing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor some people, it had more of an impact.\u201d\n\nGuardian also negotiated new agreements with the two unions representing employees at Weatherwood.\n\n\u201cThe county put some of the proceeds of the sale to Guardian to help pay the benefits,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said. \u201cThey earned it on our watch, so they were owed what we gave to them.\u201d\n\nUnder state law, current residents at nursing homes can not be displaced even if it is being sold.\n\nWhile a difficult decision, O\u2019Gurek said he believes the board made the right call.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, it was one of the best and most sound fiscal decisions the three of us has made,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we had bleeding, we stopped the bleeding and did what anyone in business losing millions a year would do.\u201d\n\nThe county also collected about $132,000 in real estate taxes on the property the following year.\n\n\u201cThey became the sixth largest real estate taxpayer in the county,\u201d O\u2019Gurek said.\n\nLuzerne County is attempting to sell its 353-bed Valley Crest Nursing Home in Plains Township and received bids earlier this week. Lebanon County just sold its 324-bed nursing home, Cedar Haven, Lebanon, for $25.5 million in July.\n\n\u201cThere is a robust market place out there,\u201d Hill said.\n\nAdams, Blair, Cambria, Dauphin, Lancaster, Lackawanna, Mercer and Northumberland counties also sold their nursing homes within the last 10 years. The sale of Northampton County\u2019s Gracedale nursing home was blocked by a voter referendum in 2011.\n\nThe Schuylkill County commissioners have yet announced their plans for Rest Haven, but issued the following statement Thursday:\n\n\u201cAs it is clear from the number of counties selling their nursing homes, changes in state policy and reimbursement methods have created significant challenges for county-owned nursing home. Rest Haven is not immune from those challenges and we have openly shared with the public the growing financial support required by the facility. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and strive to balance the best interest of Rest Haven residents, our employees and the county taxpayers.\u201d\n\nNursing homes sold within the last 10 years:\n\n\n\nAdams County\n\n\n\nLocation: Green Acres, Gettysburg\n\n\n\nBeds: 135\n\n\n\nBuyer: Transitions Healthcare, Sykesville, Maryland\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2011\n\n\n\nPrice: $6.1 million\n\n\n\nBeaver County\n\n\n\nLocation: Friendship Ridge, Beaver Falls\n\n\n\nBeds: 600\n\n\n\nBuyer: Comprehensive HealthCare Management Services LLC, New Jersey\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2013\n\n\n\nPrice: $37.5 million\n\n\n\nBlair County\n\n\n\nLocation: Valley View Health and Rehabilitation Center, Altoona\n\n\n\nBeds: 240\n\n\n\nBuyer: Reliant Senior Care Management, Philadelphia\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2013\n\n\n\nPrice: $16.5 million\n\n\n\nButler County\n\n\n\nLocation: Sunnyview Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Butler\n\n\n\nBeds: 220\n\n\n\nBuyer: Investment 360, Lakewood, New Jersey\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2014\n\n\n\nPrice: $20.4 million\n\n\n\nCambria County\n\n\n\nLocation: Laurel Crest Rehabilitation and Special Care Center, Ebensburg\n\n\n\nBeds: 370\n\n\n\nBuyer: Grane Healthcare, Pittsburgh\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2010\n\n\n\nPrice: $14.3 million\n\n\n\nCarbon County\n\nLocation: Weatherwood Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Weatherly\n\n\n\nBeds: 200\n\n\n\nBuyer: Guardian Elder Care, Nanticoke\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2010\n\n\n\nPrice: $11 million\n\n\n\nDauphin County\n\n\n\nLocation: Spring Creek Rehabilitation and Health Care Center, Harrisburg\n\n\n\nBeds: 404\n\n\n\nBuyer: Continuum Care Holdings, Wesport, Connecticut\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2006\n\n\n\nPrice: $22 million\n\n\n\nFranklin County\n\n\n\nLocation: Falling Spring Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, Chambersburg\n\n\n\nBeds: 186\n\n\n\nBuyer: Mid-Atlantic Health Care, Sparks, Maryland\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2013\n\n\n\nPrice: $11 million\n\n\n\nLackawanna County\n\n\n\nLocation: Lackawanna County Health Care Center, Olyphant\n\n\n\nBeds: 272\n\n\n\nBuyer: Millennium Management LLC, Miami\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2010\n\n\n\nPrice: $13.4 million\n\n\n\nLancaster County\n\n\n\nLocation: Conestoga View Nursing Home, Lancaster\n\n\n\nBeds: 446\n\n\n\nBuyer: Complete Healthcare Resources, Dresher\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2005\n\n\n\nPrice: $8.5 million\n\n\n\nLebanon County\n\n\n\nLocation: Lebanaon Cedar Crest, Lebanon\n\n\n\nBeds: 324\n\nBuyer: Complete Healthcare Resources, Dresher\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2014\n\n\n\nPrice: $25.5\n\n\n\nMercer County\n\n\n\nLocation: Woodland Place, Mercer\n\n\n\nBeds: 100\n\n\n\nBuyer: Southwestern Alphia, New Castle\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2009\n\n\n\nPrice: $5 million\n\n\n\nMontgomery County\n\n\n\nLocation: Parkhouse Providence Pointe, Royersford\n\n\n\nBeds: 467\n\n\n\nBuyer: Mid-Atlantic Health Care, Sparks, Maryland\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2014\n\n\n\nPrice: $41 million\n\n\n\nNorthumberland County\n\n\n\nLocation: Mountain View Manor, Coal Township\n\n\n\nBeds: 271\n\n\n\nBuyer: Complete Healthcare Resources, Dresher\n\n\n\nYear sold: 2009\n\n\n\nPrice: $16.5 million\n\n\n\nWarren County\n\n\n\nWarren County supervisors voted Wednesday to go ahead with a sale of the county nursing home, reversing a defeat of the proposed sale that occurred less than three weeks earlier.
