In a statement, Sabrina Schaeffer, the executive director of the Independent Women’s Forum, said that “for too long progressive women’s groups have claimed to speak for women and set the agenda.”

“They’ve told women they’re a victim class in need of constant government protection,” Schaeffer said. “But that message is insidious and wrong, and the IWF is excited to lead a more productive conversation with conservative women leaders about a better path forward for women and their families.”

The Independent Women’s Forum is a non-partisan organization working to increase “the number of women who value free markets and personal liberty.”

The summit will be followed by a networking reception. Tickets to the event and more details are available here.
