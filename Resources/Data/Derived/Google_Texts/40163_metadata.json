Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) has taken up crusade once attempted by his fellow Republicans and announced the need for a constitutional amendment that would expand states\u2019 rights and allow them to veto any legislation passed by Congress and signed into law the President of the United States.\n\nGohmert was well received Saturday at the New Hampshire Freedom Summit in Manchester, N.H., as he spoke of the need for a constitutional amendment that would give power back to state legislatures.\n\n\u201cWe got to return that power to the states, and we can do that with a constitutional amendment,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nThe proposed amendment would allow states to work in unison to protect the freedoms of American citizens. In outlining the provisions of his proposal, Gohmert said a two-thirds vote by all the states would effectively overturn any act of Congress which the people of the nation do not favor \u2014 such as the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough Obamacare passed Congress \u2014 with a split party-line vote \u2014 many Americans disagree with the law and are feeling its negative affects. If Gohmert\u2019s amendment was passed, states could then decide to veto the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cMan, that would make such a difference,\u201d the Texas conservative said. \u201cThat would return the power back to where the Founders wanted it.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Torrey, an 18-year-old student at Saint Anselm College who attended the Freedom Summit, said Gohmert\u2019s proposed amendment is something she agrees with.\n\n\u201cCongress is trying to do too much all at once, and that just won\u2019t work,\u201d she told Red Alert Politics.\n\nTorrey continued, saying Gohmert is a speaker she can identify most with, as the policies he discussed \u2014 specifically the state veto amendment \u2014 are issues that affect her life.\n\nRep. Gohmert is not the first person to propose a state veto amendment. In 2011, Sens. Mike Enzi (R-Wy.), John Barasso (R\u2013Wy.), and Orrin Hatch (R\u2013Utah) and Reps. Rob Bishop (R\u2013Utah), Morgan Griffith (R\u2013Va.) and Paul Broun (R\u2013Ga.) led the charge for a similar provision.\n\nThough their amendment garnered support from the Tea Party, discussion surrounding the bill quickly died down within a year.\n\nGohemrt, instead, has taken up the charge.\n\nIn addition to announcing his constitutional amendment \u2014 which elicited cheers and praise from the audience \u2014 Gohmert also called for the implementation of a flat tax and abolishment of the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nBoth calls to action were met with abundant applause from Freedom Summit attendees.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rep.
