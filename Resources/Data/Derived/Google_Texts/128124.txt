SACRAMENTO (KCBS) — State auditors are concerned about the long-term financing of Covered California once federal money goes away later this year, but the state agency that administers Obamacare believes it is on solid footing.

Covered Califonria must be self-supporting by September of 2016, when it runs out of federal funds.

Roy Kennedy with Covered California says the agency has several months of reserves.

“We’re confident that with enrollment growing the way we’ve seen it, that we’ll continue to be sustainable. The most recent open enrollment report showed that we had 425,000 individuals for open enrollment three,” Kennedy said.

Auditors expressed concern over dozens of no-bid contracts the agency handed out.
