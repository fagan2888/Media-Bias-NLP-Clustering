But he\u2019s come in here and worked hard.\u201d\n\nJackson was working out at home in Las Vegas when the Patriots called earlier this week and gave him his early \u201cChristmas gift,\u201d as he called it. He recorded eight straight 1,000-yard seasons with the St. Louis Rams. His production tailed off with the Atlanta Falcons the past two years, but still showed he\u2019s a bulky and dependable option \u2014 and didn\u2019t fumble in his last three seasons.\n\nHe arrived this week and his locker is near Brady as he tries to learn the Patriots\u2019 system. He wouldn\u2019t be the first veteran \u2014 see Chad Johnson and Joey Galloway \u2014 to come in and fail to learn the New England playbook.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fun to see,\u201d Brady said. \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ve always watched him from afar and had admiration for him because to rush for that many yards in this league is a really hard thing to do, but he\u2019s had a remarkable career.\u201d\n\nWith Dion Lewis and LeGarrette Blount out for the season and rookie Joey Iosefa coming off the practice squad to lead the team with 14 carries and 51 yards in last week\u2019s 33-16 win over the Tennessee Titans, the Patriots \u2014 who also added Montee Ball to the practice squad last week \u2014 are rolling the dice with Jackson.\n\nBrady seemed optimistic. Upon meeting his newest teammate \u2014 the 75th player to be on or off the team\u2019s 53-man roster this season \u2014 Brady said: \u201cIt\u2019s just what you\u2019d expect. I think he\u2019s a real professional, takes good care of himself.\u201d\n\nWith just two games left in the regular season, the Pats\u2019 revolving door continues to spin with their roster.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot this year, on the practice squad, on the roster, off the roster, on the practice squad \u2014 every day Coach (Bill Belichick) announces new players on the team,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that we\u2019ve gotten used to and whoever comes and goes, maybe you\u2019ll see those guys again, but you always try to welcome in guys, try to get them up to speed \u2014 you never know, because these guys can help you win. We have guys out there playing now that weren\u2019t here a month ago that are helping us win.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is. Every team is looking for good players and to try to add a certain player. I think at this time of year, you kind of know what your team is all about and if there\u2019s players like that that are available and can help your team, then you try to add them.\u201d\n\nBrady declined to say anything negative about ex-teammate Darrelle Revis. The Jets cornerback who helped the Patriots win a Super Bowl last season said, among other things in the midst of \u201cDeflategate,\u201d that Brady and the Patriots have \u201ca history of doing stuff.\u201d Brady insisted that his feelings about Revis haven\u2019t changed because of the comments.\n\n\u201cIt was great having him as a teammate,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player.\u201d\n\nNOTES: TE Rob Gronkowski was back after missing a day to attend his friend\u2019s funeral. \u201cIt\u2019s always tough going through a time like this,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely paid my respects, my family and everything, but now it\u2019s a new day. I\u2019ve just got to concentrate and be ready for my teammates, get ready for practice today, and just catch up on what I missed yesterday and just make sure I stay a little bit extra today and make sure I\u2019m just ready for the game on Sunday.\u201d \u2026 Second-year RB James White on Jackson: \u201cHe\u2019s a great player. He\u2019s a veteran, been through a lot, been to a few Pro Bowls. He\u2019s a guy that we can learn from, so we\u2019re trying to coach him (up) a little bit, trying to make it easier for him. But he\u2019s a good player and he\u2019s a good person.\u201d \u2026 WR Danny Amendola, who last Sunday aggravated the left knee injury that forced him out of one game, was listed on Thursday\u2019s injury report as a limited participant.\n\nOther NFL news from The Associated Press:\n\n\n\nDrew Brees plans to play vs. Jaguars\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Saints quarterback Drew Brees said he has every intention of playing Sunday against Jacksonville despite having an injured right foot.\n\nAll he has to do is convince coach Sean Payton, who hasn\u2019t named a starting quarterback for the Saints\u2019 home finale.\n\nBrees said he has a torn plantar fascia ligament, which he said is painful but not necessarily too debilitating to prevent him from being effective.\n\nThe injury occurred during the second quarter of Monday night\u2019s loss against Detroit, but Brees never missed a snap, finishing with 341 yards passing and three touchdowns.\n\nBrees, who did not practice Thursday, said he has been told the injury won\u2019t require surgery.\n\nPayton said the team is judging Brees\u2019 status \u201cday by day.\u201d\n\nThe Saints\u2019 other quarterbacks are Matt Flynn and former Colorado State star Garrett Grayson, a rookie.\n\nDoug Baldwin may be back for Seahawks\n\n\n\nRENTON, Wash. \u2014 The Seahawks hope wide receiver Doug Baldwin will be ready to play Sunday against St. Louis.\n\nBaldwin has a hamstring injury and coach Pete Carroll said Thursday the Seahawks believe Baldwin will be able to play against the Rams. Baldwin did not practice Wednesday or Thursday, but he is expected to have a big workload in practice Friday.\n\nAdrian Peterson still hobbled\n\nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. \u2014 A bothersome ankle leaves Vikings running back Adrian Peterson\u2019s availability for Sunday\u2019s home game against the Giants in question. Peterson was held out of practice Thursday for the second consecutive day as he deals with a sprained left ankle.\n\nBills\u2019 LeSean McCoy doubtful\n\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. \u2014 Bills coach Rex Ryan said he is taking the approach that star running back LeSean McCoy will not play against Dallas on Sunday because of an injured right knee.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tom Brady happy to welcome Steven Jackson into Patriots\u2019 backfield", "title": "Tom Brady happy to welcome Steven Jackson into Patriots\u2019 backfield", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/24/tom-brady-happy-to-welcome-steven-jackson-into-patriots-backfield/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151124_122802_tom-brady-2.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151124_122802_tom-brady-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T15:18:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T20:43:36+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2014 Tom Brady is looking forward to having Steven Jackson in the backfield for the New England Patriots.\nHe arrived this week and his locker is near Brady as he tries to learn the Patriots\u2019 system.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot this year, on the practice squad, on the roster, off the roster, on the practice squad \u2014 every day Coach (Bill Belichick) announces new players on the team,\u201d Brady said.\nPeterson was held out of practice Thursday for the second consecutive day as he deals with a sprained left ankle.\nBaldwin did not practice Wednesday or Thursday, but he is expected to have a big workload in practice Friday."}
