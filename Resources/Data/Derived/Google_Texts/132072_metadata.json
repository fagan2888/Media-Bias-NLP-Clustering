In this election recap, we'll look at their respective races, including the Attorney General\u2019s race.\n\nBy a one percent edge, Governor Rick Scott claimed victory over Democrat challenger Charlie Crist. But, for the rest of the Florida Cabinet, they coasted to victory by double-digit percentages.\n\nTake the Florida Attorney General\u2019s race, for example. Republican incumbent Pam Bondi defeated both her challengers, after receiving 55 percent of the vote.\n\nAnd, during her speech, she talked about her fight in the gay marriage ban issue. She also reminded her supporters of her involvement in going against the Affordable Care Act\u2014also called \u201cObamaCare.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026the mandate of ObamaCare\u2014where more than half of the nation\u2019s Attorneys general spoke up and asked the Supreme Court to weigh in,\u201d said Bondi. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t about politics or ideology. This was about the law.\u201d\n\nAnd, she also vowed to continue her fight for a number of issues, including her anti-human trafficking efforts.\n\n\u201cWe just formed a council on human trafficking that I\u2019ll be chairing for the next three years. We\u2019re fighting a war on drugs still, and we\u2019re not going to give up,\u201d said Bondi, talking to reporters.\n\nBondi also thanked her two opponents for a race well fought.\n\nOn a three-to-one margin, Bondi outraised George Sheldon, her Democrat challenger and the former head of the Florida Department of Children and Families. Throughout the campaign, Bondi also rotated some ads, highlighting her prescription drug abuse and anti-human trafficking efforts.\n\nSheldon and Libertarian Bill Wohsifer, not only had little cash in the race, they also did not run any TV ads. And, there was one debate that aired in only two areas: Tampa\u2014Bondi\u2019s hometown\u2014and Orlando.\n\nStill, Sheldon says he\u2019s proud of the campaign he ran and hopes to work with Bondi in the future, adding he\u2019s glad he stuck to his principles in this race.\n\n\u201cPrinciples of integrity, of aggressiveness, speaking up for children, saying that everyone in this country ought to be equal and they ought to have the right to love the person that they do love and to marry that individual and to say that every person in this country has a right to Affordable Health Care,\u201d said Sheldon.\n\nAs for Tallahassee Attorney Bill Wohlsifer, more than 168,000 people voted for the Libertarian candidate. He says even getting close to three-percent is huge for a third-party candidate and they can only build from here.\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid to vote against the candidate,\u201d said Wohlsifer. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid if they vote for the Libertarian candidate, then the candidate they don\u2019t want to win will win. We\u2019ve got to overcome that and we\u2019re on the right track. The campaign was more of a movement and we\u2019re going in the right direction.\u201d\n\nAnd, Bondi wasn\u2019t the only win of the night.\n\n\u201cI have been informed that the Associated Press has called our race and that we won,\u201d said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, on Election Night to a cheering crowd.\n\nPutnam took more than 58 percent of the vote. During his victory speech, he even thanked his opponent Thaddeus Hamilton, who had more than 30 years of experience working for the federal agriculture agency.\n\n\u201cWe ran a positive campaign and so did my opponent,\u201d said Putnam. \u201cWe focused on what we\u2019ve done, but not just what we\u2019ve done, but what we can do, what we can be, what we can achieve together as a state, and where we\u2019re going and how we\u2019re going to get there.\u201d\n\nFlorida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater was also elected to a second term with more than 58 percent of the vote, and he thanked voters on behalf of the Florida Cabinet during his Election Night speech.\n\n\u201cAnd, it looked like overwhelmingly the people in Florida are giving us that second. So, to everyone in Florida, we want to say thank you, we won\u2019t let you down, and we\u2019ll hustle again for you for four more years. Thank you very, very much on that front,\u201d said Atwater to cheers.\n\nAtwater\u2019s Democrat challenger in the CFO race was William Rankin, a private business consultant and army vet. While they lost by double digits, both Rankin and Putnam\u2019s challenger Hamilton\u2014also a U.S. Army veteran\u2014took more than two million votes each, even though they were little known and didn\u2019t really have any financial backing.\n\nAnd, Florida Democratic Party Chair Allison Tant says despite the overall losses in this year\u2019s election, it speaks to the strong loyalty and support Democrats still have.\n\n\u201cBoth William Rankin and Thaddeus Hamilton ran races against established, entrenched, well-funded Republicans, and they did it on their sweat equity, very few resources, and they still gained a good number of votes and I\u2019m very thankful for people who put themselves up to run because when you do take a leadership role, you do become a pi\u00f1ata in this state\u2026and they did a good job, connected with voters, and yes, they, did get some support and I\u2019m thankful for the votes they got,\u201d said Tant.\n\nMeanwhile, coming off some big wins, Republican Party of Florida Chair Leslie Dougher says she believes voters have spoken\u2014and they like the GOP leadership that\u2019s in place.\n\n\u201cYou know, we ran an aggressive campaign from the Governor, from the entire Cabinet, that we put families first and we put jobs first and education,\u201d said Dougher. \u201cAnd, someone, like CFO Atwater [said], it\u2019s your money we\u2019re spending, we\u2019re watching your money, and I think the voters really took that to heart when they went they looked at the different candidates.\u201d\n\nBoth Dougher and Tant say they\u2019re now looking forward, putting more of the focus on 2016 presidential election.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.", "article_metadata": {"category": "State News", "description": "Florida\u2019s Cabinet will look exactly the same as it did when they were elected in 2010.
