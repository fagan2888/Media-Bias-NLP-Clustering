Bernie Sanders of Vermont is suddenly surging as he challenges Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, with a plethora of events in early battleground states that are drawing lively and enthusiastic crowds.\n\nWhile Clinton remains the odds-on favorite to win the nomination next year, the 73-year-old Sanders is making a respectable showing in early polling in Iowa and doing even better in New Hampshire, where he currently trails Clinton by just 10 points overall and is tied with her among self-described liberals, according to a new Suffolk University poll.\n\nRelated: Sanders Suddenly Is Moving Up on Clinton in New Hampshire\n\nIn a campaign speech to hundreds of supporters in Keene, N.H., last month, Sanders declared: \u201cLet me tell you a secret: We\u2019re going to win New Hampshire!\u201d\n\nBut some technicalities in state election law may complicate Sanders\u2019 quest for victory in the Granite State. And according to at least one political expert -- former Rep. Charles F. Bass (R-NH) -- Sanders might not even qualify to appear on the ballot.\n\nThe problem, Bass says in an op-ed in The Washington Post on Friday, goes to Sanders\u2019 political pedigree. The outspoken liberal and former House member was elected to the Senate in 2006 as an independent and for years has described himself as a socialist. Although he has caucused with the senate Democrats and currently holds the position of the ranking minority member of the Senate Budget Committee, he technically isn\u2019t a registered Democrat.\n\nBecause independent or third party candidates for president historically have been unable to qualify to appear on enough state ballots to mount a serious election bid, Sanders said at the time he announced for president that he would run as a Democrat in the 2016 primaries and caucuses.\n\nRelated: Sanders Lumps Clinton with Koch Brothers and Adelson\n\nAccording to Bass, however, Sanders may not qualify for the New Hampshire ballot as a Democrat.\n\n\u201cState law makes clear that candidates must be registered members of the party on whose ballot line they wish to appear,\u201d wrote Bass, a former New Hampshire state senator who chaired the committee with jurisdiction over state election law. \u201cThis is a problem for Sanders, who is not a registered Democrat.\u201d\n\nTo a layman, this might appear to be a minor bump in the road that could be easily fixed by having Sanders, a former mayor of Burlington, simply change his registration in his home state from independent to Democrat. However, Vermont doesn\u2019t have a party registration system, so he can\u2019t do that, according to Bass. Registered voters express their party preference on election day, when they show up at the polls and ask for either a Democratic or Republican ballot.\n\nMichael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, dismissed Bass\u2019s dire warning on Friday, saying there have been plenty of previous situations in which candidates appeared on the New Hampshire primary ballot even though they weren\u2019t technically registered in their homes states as either Democrats or Republicans.\n\nRelated: Where Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley Stand on the Issues\n\n\u201cVermont is like about 20 states that have no voter registration,\u201d Briggs explained in a phone interview from Las Vegas, where Sanders is campaigning. \u201cAnd both George Bushes had no trouble getting on the ballot in New Hampshire even though they were not registered Republicans in their home state of Texas. And Howard Dean got on the ballot in New Hampshire, and he wasn\u2019t a registered Democrat, although he was Democratic governor from Vermont.\u201d\n\n\u201cBernie has caucused with Democrats ever since he came to Congress,\u201d Brigss added. \u201cAnd also, when he filed his paperwork with the FEC [Federal Election Commission] creating the campaign committee, Bernie did say on there that he was running in the Democratic Party primaries.\u201d\n\nNot so fast, Bass says. While both George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush were indeed from a state that that doesn\u2019t register voters by party, the Bushes qualified for New Hampshire\u2019s primary ballots because they could show that they had previously appeared on ballots as Republicans. Ditto former Democratic Vice President Al Gore, whose home state of Tennessee did not register voters by party.\n\nRelated: U.S. presidential hopeful Sanders: Break up the big banks\n\nWhen he ran for the Senate, Sanders won the Democratic primary in Vermont, but then declined the nomination and asked that his name not appear on the general election ballot as a Democrat, Bass wrote.\n\n\u201cIn short, Sanders is not a Democrat, has not been elected as a Democrat, has never served as a Democrat and cannot plausibly claim, at least in New Hampshire, to be a Democrat,\u201d Bass declared.\n\nStay tuned. It looks as if this controversy might generate plenty of election lawyer billing hours.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.", "title": "Surging Sanders May Face Surprise Hurdle in New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/19/Surging-Sanders-May-Face-Surprise-Hurdle-New-Hampshire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09142014_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/19/Surging-Sanders-May-Face-Surprise-Hurdle-New-Hampshire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09142014_Sanders.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd348c\"", "article_summary": "Related: Sanders Lumps Clinton with Koch Brothers and AdelsonAccording to Bass, however, Sanders may not qualify for the New Hampshire ballot as a Democrat.\nAlthough he has caucused with the senate Democrats and currently holds the position of the ranking minority member of the Senate Budget Committee, he technically isn\u2019t a registered Democrat.\nAnd according to at least one political expert -- former Rep.
