He allowed governors to opt out of the expansion of Medicaid that also was part of the law. And because many states are governed by rightwing hardbars who don't give a damn about anyone who can't cut them a check, we had the remarkable\u2014and, well nigh unprecedented\u2014spectacle of watching politicians turn down FREE MONEY! This occurred in many places. Georgia was one of them.\n\nHospital industry officials say Georgia's decision not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has hurt rural health care.

It's happening all over the place, mainly in states where the governor has declined to accept FREE MONEY! Governor Nathan Deal could have kept this hospital open. He chose not to do so for reasons that had nothing whatsoever with the health of his constituents. Five will get you 10 that Obamacare gets blamed.
