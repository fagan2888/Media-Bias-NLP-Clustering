Part of this includes obsessing over whether their brains and intelligence are maturing at the right pace. Although there are plenty of ways to determine how intelligent a child will be, researchers from King's College London have found that a simple drawing test can predict future intelligence.\n\n\u201cDrawing is an ancient behavior, dating back beyond 15,000 years ago,\u201d said Dr. Rosalind Arden, from the university\u2019s Medical Research Council Social, Genetic, and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, in a press release. \u201cThrough drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what\u2019s in our mind. This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species\u2019 ability to store information, and build a civilization.\u201d\n\nTheir \u201cDraw-a-Child\u201d test literally asked kids to draw a child. They graded the tests on a scale of 0 to 12 depending on how detailed the children\u2019s drawings were. If they included facial components like eyes and noses, or other body parts like hair, arms, and legs, they were given additional points. In addition to the drawing test, the children, who were 4 years old, were also given verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests.\n\nTen years later, when the kids were 14, the researchers conducted a new set of verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests. They found that the scores children earned on their drawing tests could predict intelligence at age 14, although the correlation was moderate. \u201cThe Draw-a-Child test was devised in the 1920s to assess children\u2019s intelligence, so the fact that the test correlated with intelligence at age 4 was expected,\u201d Arden said. \u201cWhat surprised us was that it correlated with intelligence a decade later.\u201d\n\nShe added that parents shouldn\u2019t be worried if their child is bad at drawing because other factors can contribute to a child\u2019s intelligence, both genetic and environmental. The study involved over 7,700 twin pairs, and the researchers found that twins tended to have similar drawings to each other when compared to other twins \u2014 suggesting that there was a possible genetic link. \u201cThis does not mean that there is a drawing gene,\u201d Arden said. \u201cA child\u2019s ability to draw stems from many other abilities, such as observing, holding a pencil, etc. We are a long way off understanding how genes influence all these different types of behavior.\u201d\n\nAlthough exposing a child to many things when they\u2019re young can help boost their intelligence, it only works to an extent. The key to helping a child learn more may actually be in doing the opposite, by letting their curiosity and willingness to explore take them on a journey. Two studies from 2011 showed that giving kids instructions on how to use certain objects caused them to only use the objects as told, eliminating any toying around they might have done. But it\u2019s that toying around that spurs creativity, making them smarter.\n\nSource: Arden R.
