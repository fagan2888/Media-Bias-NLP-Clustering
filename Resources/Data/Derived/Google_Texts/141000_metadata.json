It was \u201clittle more than a fund for corporate welfare,\u201d candidate Barack Obama said in 2008. Left-wingers routinely deplored the way the bank did big favors for big businesses such as Boeing and Enron, at the expense of the little guy both at home and abroad. Although the bank was created by FDR, its biggest friends long have been Chamber-of-Commerce Republicans who think government\u2019s principal business should be helping the business community.\n\nLately, the bank\u2014it\u2019s actually a government agency\u2014has come under fire from tea party populists, too. They oppose it for many of the reasons liberals did, plus one more: its distortion of the free market. Government, they say, should not be picking winners and losers.\n\nLo and behold, suddenly Ex-Im is becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the left. While principled liberals such as Vermont socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders still oppose it, many so-called progressives have come to its defense (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for example). Apparently, some folks would rather think the other side is wrong than be right themselves\u2014even if that means passing up what everybody in Washington claims to want: bipartisan cooperation on an issue of substance.\n\nOf course, Ex-Im\u2019s supporters might have another motive as well: campaign contributions. Some of America\u2019s biggest companies reap the benefits of Ex-Im, and they can be mighty generous around campaign time.\n\nThe support can\u2019t have much to do with genuine substance. Not every argument made by the bank\u2019s critics is equally strong. But every argument made by the bank\u2019s supporters is astoundingly weak.\n\nFor instance: They routinely concede that the critics have the moral high ground. As former Sen. Judd Gregg put it not long ago, the critics object to Ex-Im \u201cpicking winners and losers, and supporting the big boys with influence. To be fair, this is basically true.\u201d In an ideal world, the bank\u2019s defenders agree, Ex-Im would not exist. They say the only reason we provide export subsidies to our guys is that other countries provide export subsidies to theirs. \u201cWe live in the real world, not the theoretical world,\u201d Mark Warner said late last month.\n\nBoy, that\u2019s some defense: \u201cWe know what\u2019s right\u2014but what\u2019s right is not expedient.\u201d\n\nWarner also insists failure to reauthorize the bank \u201cwould cost us thousands of American jobs.\u201d But the studies a spokesman provided as proof said something very different: e.g., that Ex-Im \u201chelp[s] to sustain\u201d jobs or that last year the bank \u201csupported over 200,000 jobs.\u201d Well. When you buy your daily cup of coffee at a convenience store, you, too, are helping to sustain jobs. That doesn\u2019t mean any jobs would disappear if you stopped.\n\nAs Veronique de Rugy, a scholar at George Mason University\u2019s Mercatus Center, pointed out not long ago: According to the Government Accountability Office, \u201cthe bank doesn\u2019t actually count jobs related to its projects; it simply extrapolates\u201d from statistics used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In plainer language: It guesses.\n\nHere\u2019s another reason to suspect the jobs claim is overblown: Supposedly, the bank creates U.S. jobs by lending foreign companies the money to buy American products. This means it is creating (or at least steering) demand. Yet, one-fifth of the bank\u2019s funding goes to export credit insurance, which buffers exporters against the possibility that an overseas customer might not pay. That doesn\u2019t generate any demand at all.\n\nMoreover, the bank\u2019s defenders ignore another big Ex-Im effect. If, say, a foreign company uses Ex-Im financing to place a big order for American-made construction machines, that\u2019s a great deal for Acme Construction Equipment. But it\u2019s not such a great deal for other companies\u2014including American ones\u2014that also buy from Acme. All of a sudden, U.S. companies are bidding against foreign ones that are, through Ex-Im, using the American government as leverage against them. (Something just like that happened in 2013, de Rugy notes, causing a Cleveland mining company to protest an Ex-Im subsidy that helped an Australian mining company buy heavy gear from Caterpillar.)\n\nWhen Ex-Im supporters talk about \u201cleveling the playing field,\u201d they never bring that up. There\u2019s something else they don\u2019t do, either: They don\u2019t answer, specifically, \u201clevel for whom?\u201d\n\nThe U.S. aerospace industry is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Ex-Im financing. In that sector, at least, it\u2019s pretty clear who the competitors are: Boeing is going up against Airbus, which gets hefty European subsidies. Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. is going up against the subsidized French satellite maker Thales\u2014as well as Russian and Chinese satellite enterprises. So you can argue that any Ex-Im support on behalf of Orbital simply levels the playing field.\n\nIn many other cases, however, the ostensible leveling of the playing field might not occur at all. That\u2019s because, for a great many of the Ex-Im Bank\u2019s deals, the U.S. company is not competing against a subsidized foreign competitor. A U.S. supplier could be competing against a company that receives no subsidies at all. In that case, the Ex-Im subsidy would actually create an unlevel playing field, not a level one.\n\nBut wait, it gets worse.\n\nSuppose Procter & Gamble reaches out to Ex-Im so a foreign company can buy a few million rolls of paper towels. In that case, Procter & Gamble isn\u2019t competing just against Chinese paper-towel companies. It\u2019s also competing against Kimberly-Clark and other U.S. companies that didn\u2019t get a subsidy. How level is that?\n\nEx-Im supporters admit they have no principled argument. Their practical argument is full of gaping holes. It will be interesting to see what they come up with next to avoid admitting the opposing team might actually be right about something.
