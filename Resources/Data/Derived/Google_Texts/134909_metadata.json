Roughly eight million people signed up through the health care exchanges. But it\u2019s been clear this summer that there are cases of discrepancies with information of some of the newly enrolled, calling their eligibility into question in some cases.\n\nImmigration status is now a part of this. Yesterday, the Obama administration warned that more than 300,000 people could lose coverage if they can\u2019t show proof they are U.S. citizens or legal residents.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nReporter Louise Radnofsky is covering all this for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd we welcome you back to the program.\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY, The Wall Street Journal: Thank you for having me.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, Louise, who are these people who are being questioned or getting these letters?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: Well, originally, there were about a million people for whom the healthcare.gov system couldn\u2019t verify that they were in the United States legally, and therefore entitled to access coverage under the law.\n\nThe administration has whittled that down to about 310,000 people now that they say they haven\u2019t heard from after they have asked them multiple times to send in more information.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So \u2014 and how did this come to light? What caused this to bubble to the surface for the administration?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: There appeared to be a long standing glitch in the healthcare.gov system in which it was particularly difficult to ascertain data supplied by people who were illegally resident in the United States or naturalized citizens, but were not born here.\n\nEssentially, the data that was being drawn on from the Department of Health and Human \u2014 the Department of Homeland Security, the other DHS, wasn\u2019t \u2014 wasn\u2019t working to get their information available in time.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So they literally couldn\u2019t verify what people were saying; is that it?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: They couldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd at one point, people couldn\u2019t enter document numbers that actually existed at all in order to get through the system. So they just sort of tried to progress as best as they could and then were planning to send information later.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, remind us about the eligibility requirements. For people to sign up for health care coverage under the program, they had to be what?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: They had to be legally in the United States.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: This was a very highly charged issue at the time that the law was being debated.\n\nAs a result, unauthorized immigrants are not only not eligible for tax credits towards the cost of coverage. They\u2019re not allowed to shop on healthcare.gov at all.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, they\u2019re being told \u2014 as you said, over a million notices went out. They have heard back from many of these people. They have cleared it up; 300,000 people, though, they haven\u2019t heard back from.\n\nWhat are they \u2014 what happens to them? What do they have to do?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: Those people have until September 5 to start sending information, either uploading it or mailing it in to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIf they don\u2019t, they would lose their coverage entirely. It\u2019s not just a question of their tax credits being cut off and this being settled next year in taxes in time. Their plans will be terminated by their insurance company.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So the administration is literally prepared to shut them off, even after a year or less than a year of coverage?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: They are.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly something that immigrant activists are very concerned about. They never really liked the provision in the first place and felt it was somewhat spiteful to deny people the access to the exchange at all. But they say that here the government may be moving quite hastily.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: What do people in the administration say to you about this? Do they honestly believe that most of these people are illegal, that they\u2019re not citizens or are not here legally, or do they think that there are just honest mistakes that were made?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: They say that they\u2019re in a position to process through and find out whether people who submitted information in good faith do have data on file in the federal government that can verify what they\u2019re saying.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why they\u2019re going to these extra measures. But they say they do need to hear from the people.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So they don\u2019t really know? They honestly don\u2019t know? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: It\u2019s a data-matching error, they describe it as, yes.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: OK.\n\nSo, at this point, two million people \u2014 we started out saying some two million people are being investigated for some sort of discrepancy. This is a big number of the eight million.\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: Right.\n\nAnd it gets to the idea that there were a number of flaws in healthcare.gov that went beyond the widely publicizes ones that being understood at the outset, where they couldn\u2019t just get through a system that kept seizing up on them. The underlying data in some cases has been very problematic to verify, particularly because you have a number of people with complicated circumstances, like not being born in the United States, which here is proving to be very complicated, or their income has changed.\n\nThat\u2019s the other million people among that two million that we were talking about here. What they earned in 2012 does not appear to match up very closely with what they are saying they expect to earn in 2014. That, incidentally, is often the sort of thing that happens when people are suddenly looking to buy insurance on their own.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, how does that get reconciled?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: Well, for that, again, the administration is asking for more information for people.\n\nBut for those people, because it\u2019s about their tax credits and not about their coverage entirely, there is also an expectation that it will sort of get sorted out around tax filing season. The Republicans aren\u2019t very happy about that, but certainly that\u2019s the way it\u2019s being planned out.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, there is a renewal process that has to take place. What is the administration saying about that? Do they expect that to go smoothly? What are they looking at?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: The administration decided to automatically renew policies for people, unless they asked to change them in some way, precisely because it was worried about a bunch of people falling out of the system.\n\nThe people whose policies are going to be renewed are generally people who were able to get through the system relatively smoothly the first time, and don\u2019t have these additional circumstances complicating their applications that appear to have disproportionately affected immigrants.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So, they don\u2019t look to \u2014 they don\u2019t expect to have a significant problem?\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: They don\u2019t.\n\nBut immigrant groups are also concerned that there are ongoing problems that will persist into the next enrollment season, particularly for these people that the administration is very keen to make sure, in cases where they\u2019re in the United States illegally, are signed up for coverage.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the watching goes on of the health care law.\n\nLouise Radnofsky, we thank you.\n\nLOUISE RADNOFSKY: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration warned that more than 300,000 people could lose health care coverage if they can\u2019t show proof that they are U.S. citizens or legal residents.
