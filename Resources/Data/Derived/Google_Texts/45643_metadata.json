It\u2019s not the same people; the OECD has a new chief economist, Catherine L. Mann, whose excellent research has always been pragmatic in orientation (and who wrote her dissertation, way back when, under Rudi Dornbusch and yours truly.) But by selecting Ms. Mann the OECD was making a statement, and my sense is that the ground is shifting all around the world.\n\nIt has taken a while. In early 2013, with the infamous growth cliff at 90 percent debt and the case for expansionary austerity collapsing, many of us thought we had the austerians on the run. But we underestimated the extent to which officials and, to some extent, the news media had a professional stake in the positions they had staked out over the previous three years, and their willingness to seize on anything \u2014 slight recovery in southern Europe, a pickup in the UK when the government stopped tightening for a while, Latvia \u2014 as supposed vindication of views that were, in reality, overwhelmingly at odds with the evidence.\n\nThis still goes on. Simon Wren-Lewis complains, and rightly, about \u201cmediamacro\u201d \u2014 and his government has learned nothing. The Bundesbank is still what it always was.\n\nBut the hawks seem in retreat at the Fed; Mario Draghi (another MIT Ph.D.) sounds an awful lot like Janet Yellen; the whole way we\u2019re discussing Japan is very much on Keynesian turf. Three and a half years ago Businessweek was declaring that expansionary austerian Alberto Alesina was the new Keynes; now it tells us that Keynes is the new Keynes. And we have people like Paul Singer complaining about the \u201cKrugmanization\u201d of the debate.\n\nWhy does the tide finally seem to be turning? Partly, I think, it\u2019s just a matter of time; after six years it\u2019s becoming hard not to notice that the anti-Keynesians have been wrong about everything. Europe\u2019s slide toward deflation makes it even harder to deny the realities of liquidity-trap economics. And the refusal of almost everyone on the anti-Keynesian side to admit any kind of error has gradually made them look ridiculous.\n\nAll of this may be coming too little and too late to avoid policy disaster, especially in Europe. But it\u2019s something to cheer, faintly.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141126094037, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 26, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Keynes Is Slowly Winning ( 20141126 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "In the long run, wrong ideas are sort of dead.", "title": "Keynes Is Slowly Winning", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/keynes-is-slowly-winning/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "In the long run, wrong ideas are sort of dead.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 26, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1417012837, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T14:40:37-05:00"}, "utime": 20141126144037, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141126, "pdate": 20141126, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "In the long run, wrong ideas are sort of dead.", "title": "Keynes Is Slowly Winning", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/keynes-is-slowly-winning/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/keynes-is-slowly-winning/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Keynes Is Slowly Winning", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf1d\"", "article_summary": "Three and a half years ago Businessweek was declaring that expansionary austerian Alberto Alesina was the new Keynes; now it tells us that Keynes is the new Keynes.\nBut by selecting Ms. Mann the OECD was making a statement, and my sense is that the ground is shifting all around the world.\nAll of this may be coming too little and too late to avoid policy disaster, especially in Europe.\nNow, the OECD is calling for fiscal and monetary stimulus in Europe.\nAnd the refusal of almost everyone on the anti-Keynesian side to admit any kind of error has gradually made them look ridiculous."}
