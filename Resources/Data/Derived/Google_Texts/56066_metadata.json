On Tuesday, she said \u201cMs. Gunderson has recently accepted another position. She is currently still employed with HHS thru March 2015.\u201d\n\nTheBlaze followed up on Wednesday and Thursday with the original question, as to whether the HHS Inspector General report was related to her departure. Daniels responded Thursday she was still working on the information. On Friday, Daniels responded that Gunderson \u201chas accepted a position with the Department of the Navy.\u201d And she answered \u201cNo,\u201d as to whether her departure was related to the IG report.\n\nThe IG report released last month, was titled, \u201cFederal Marketplace: Inadequacies in Contract Planning and Procurement.\u201d\n\nThe report said the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management failed to develop an acquisition strategy for the Obamacare marketplace; did not mitigate risks; and did not perform adequate background checks of past performances on Healthcare.gov contractors. CMS was originally estimated to the cost of six key contracts to be $464 million. But, as of by early 2014, CMS had updated the estimated by almost double to $824 million.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The departure of a high-level official with the Department of Health and Human Services who oversees contracting is unrelated to a scathing audit of the department\u2019s mismanagement of Healthcare.gov contracts, a department spokeswoman told TheBlaze Friday after a week of back and forth questioning.
