I don\u2019t even feel like it\u2019s a black-and-white thing, honestly, in my opinion,\u201d Ms. Garner said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just something that he continued to do. And the police knew.\u201d\n\nNew York has the highest state taxes on cigarettes in the nation at $4.35 per pack, while New York City tacks on an additional $1.50 in taxes, bringing the total tax rate to $5.85 per pack. The taxes bring in an estimated $1.8 billion per year.\n\nConservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Sunday that police targeted the 43-year-old Garner \u201cbecause they\u2019re so eager for tax collection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was Eric Garner doing? He was selling cigarettes, loose cigarettes,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cAnd the police in New York, because they\u2019re so eager for tax collection \u2014 what is being done here [pertains] to taxes and the state\u2019s desire to collect them no matter what.\u201d\n\nCritics say New York\u2019s high cigarette taxes have created an underground market and incentives for people to sell loose cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI think the real outrage here is that an American died while the state is enforcing tax collection on cigarettes. This is just absurd,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd \u2026 you know, people talk about the left [wanting] a big state. They want a powerful state. Well, here it is. You\u2019ve got to take all of it.\u201d\n\nA grand jury\u2019s decision Wednesday not to indict the officer who choked to death Mr. Garner during the arrest touched off three straight nights of protests nationwide, including rioting Saturday in Berkeley, California, in which protesters hurled rocks at police and smashed storefront windows.\n\nThe Garner decision inflamed tensions already high over the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, who was unarmed but shot during a scuffle with an officer. In both instances, the officers were white and the shooting victims were black.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was accused of fanning unrest after the grand jury\u2019s decision in the Garner case by saying that he has had to train his mixed-race son about the \u201cdangers\u201d he faces when encountering police.\n\nMs. Garner said Sunday that police \u201cknew him by name and harassed us\u201d for his illegal cigarette selling.\n\n\u201cWe would go shopping. They [would say] \u2018Hi, cigarette man. Hey, cigarette man wife.\u2019 You know, stuff like that,\u201d Ms. Garner said. \u201cAnd I would just say, \u2018Eric, just keep walking. Don\u2019t say anything; don\u2019t respond. Don\u2019t give them a reason to do anything to you.\u2019 And he just felt like, \u2018But babe, they keep harassing me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Garner was 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 350 pounds, his wife said he had asthma and often was sick, which made it difficult for him to hold a job. He had previously worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\n\u201cHe had issues. Heavy guy. And he was very lazy,\u201d Ms. Garner said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like to do anything. He wasn\u2019t used to it.\u201d\n\nMr. Limbaugh asked, \u201cHow many people smoking marijuana did the cops pass by and ignore on the way to Eric Garner?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got $13 a carton, $13 a pack in New York City. Over $6 of that is taxes,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said. \u201cAnd the authorities are telling the cops, \u2018You go out and you stop that\u2019 because they\u2019re so intent on collecting tax revenue.\u201d\n\nEven though Ms. Garner downplayed the racial issue, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who also appeared on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said questions need to be asked as to whether Mr. Garner\u2019s race contributed to his death.\n\n\u201cWhen you bring up race \u2014 and she has tried to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to deal with race as the issue,\u2019 but could he have been treated differently?\u201d Mr. Sharpton said. \u201cIf he was of a different race with the same background, and no one\u2019s trying to sugarcoat anyone\u2019s background here, would he have been treated the same way? And that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The role of New York's high cigarette taxes in the death of Eric Garner drew more scrutiny Sunday as his widow said that he was targeted not because of his race, but because he continued to defy local ordinances by selling loose cigarettes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The role of New York\u2019s high cigarette taxes in the death of Eric Garner drew more scrutiny Sunday as his widow said that he was targeted not because of his race, but because he continued to defy local ordinances by selling loose cigarettes.", "title": "Eric Garner\u2019s widow says husband targeted for illegally selling cigarettes, not race", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/7/garners-widow-says-husband-was-targeted-illegally-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/esaw.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/07/esaw.jpg", "description": "The role of New York's high cigarette taxes in the death of Eric Garner drew more scrutiny Sunday as his widow said that he was targeted not because of his race, but because he continued to defy local", "card": "summary", "title": "Eric Garner\u2019s widow says husband targeted for illegally selling"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Ms Garner, New York City, Eric Garner, Meet The Press, Rush Limbaugh"}, "article_summary": "Don\u2019t say anything; don\u2019t respond.\nOver $6 of that is taxes,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said.\nThis is just absurd,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said.\nConservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh said Sunday that police targeted the 43-year-old Garner \u201cbecause they\u2019re so eager for tax collection.\u201d\u201cWhat was Eric Garner doing?\nAl Sharpton, who also appeared on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said questions need to be asked as to whether Mr. Garner\u2019s race contributed to his death."}
