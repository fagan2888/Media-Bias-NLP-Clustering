If you don’t like the idea of robot waiters and robot cooks replacing entry-level workers, you might think twice about the recent $15 minimum-wage craze. Because that’s what doubling the current federal minimum — which several cities are doing — is likely to produce.

A Washington Post story this week says that restaurant chains are “already looking for ingenious ways to take humans out of the picture, threatening workers in an industry that employs 2.4 million wait staffers, nearly 3 million cooks and food preparers and many of the nation’s 3.3 million cashiers.”

And with 30% of a restaurant’s costs coming from paying humans, “burger-flipping robots … become that much more cost-competitive if the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is doubled,” notes Post reporter Lydia DePillis.

That’s economics 101, folks.

It’s true that some of these technological changes are probably inevitable, as restaurants, like everyone else, look for ways to cut costs and improve efficiency. But it is beyond doubt that artificially raising costs for human workers makes their robotic counterparts more economical far sooner than they otherwise would be.

It’s not just minimum-wage costs, either. Obama’s Labor Dept. seems determined to do whatever it takes to make hiring flesh and blood workers more expensive. And ObamaCare is piling on new labor costs as well in the form of employer mandates and piles of paperwork.

In fact, Darden Restaurants, one of the most vociferous critics of ObamaCare a few years ago, recently announced plans to roll out ordering tablets make by Ziosk in its Olive Garden chain. The tablets would sit on restaurant tables, letting patrons place their orders without ever talking to a waiter or waitress. All a server has to do is bring the food out.

That is, unless minimum-wage zealots win more battles and make robot servers a cheaper alternative, too.
