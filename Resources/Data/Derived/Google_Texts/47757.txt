Traffic rerouting starts Monday on westbound Interstate 70 as the Colorado Department of Transportation begins widening the westbound bore of the Twin Tunnels in Idaho Springs.

The work is part of a $55 million package of improvements planned to help ease congestion on the I-70 mountain corridor.

Last year, crews expanded the eastbound approach to the Twin Tunnels to three lanes. There is no third lane planned for the westbound approach.

But before crews can start the blasting that will widen the existing westbound bore, traffic must be rerouted from the west into the eastbound bore. Crews will put down temporary pavement in the center median on both sides of the tunnel to transition westbound traffic into and out of the eastbound lanes, CDOT says.

This center median work will take about a month to complete and requires closing the far left lane of eastbound I-70 during off-peak travel hours.

“With this year’s record snowfall in the mountains, we realize how important it is to keep traffic moving during the spring-break ski season, so we will only close lanes during off-peak travel times and we will monitor traffic flow so we can make adjustments as needed,” said CDOT project manager Benjamin Acimovic.

Other prep work in the westbound tunnel bore requires putting I-70 traffic in head-to-head configuration through the eastbound tunnel for overnight work. This will be done several nights through March and will involve maintaining two eastbound lanes and one westbound lane.
