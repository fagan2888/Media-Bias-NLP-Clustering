Using anything from .38 Specials, to AR-15s, and everything in between.\n\nSo far, Florida Fish and Wildlife officials say the range has shot up in popularity, drawing an average of anywhere from 800 to 1,000 shooters a month, for some blue skies and blued steel.\n\n\"There's a variety of different opportunities for people to go out and use their rifles, use their pistols, things like that to get sighted in to make sure the guns are on target and enjoy the beautiful day,\" said FWC spokesperson Bekah Nelson.\n\nAccording to Nelson, one of the newest additions to the shooting range is the 300 yard steel challenge, which allows people to bring rifles out to test their shot on steel animal targets that are about three football fields lengths away.\n\nIt's something O'Brien says that helps make the shooting range a top shot in the community.\n\nFor Dawn Pfeiffer, the range also offers a chance for those hoping to pull the trigger for the first time.\n\n\"The fact that the range officers were not only here to help control the area, but they offered fantastic shooting insights and abilities to us,\" said Pfeiffer. \"So when you come here, not only is it a great facility, but you also get some hands-on teaching and learning, which is a great opportunity offered here in Bay County.\"\n\nAccording to Nelson, the cost to shoot at the range is anywhere from just less than $11 to $15. She says the range is working on adding sporting clays sometime around the end of the year.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the range, you can follow the link attached to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ever since opening last year, residents and Florida Fish and Wildlife officials say the Bay County shooting range is continuing to grow and shoot up in popularity.", "language": "english", "author": "Zak Dahlheimer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Bay-County-Shooting-Range-Shooting-Up-in-Popularity-314455821.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_01354.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Ever since opening last year, residents and Florida Fish and Wildlife officials say the Bay County shooting range is continuing to grow and shoot up in popularity.", "title": "Bay County Shooting Range Shooting Up in Popularity"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ever since opening last year, residents and Florida Fish and Wildlife officials say the Bay County shooting range is continuing to grow and shoot up in popularity.", "title": "Bay County Shooting Range Shooting Up in Popularity", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Bay-County-Shooting-Range-Shooting-Up-in-Popularity-314455821.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_01354.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Bay County Shooting Range Shooting Up in Popularity", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bay County Shooting Range Shooting"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1252\"", "article_summary": "Ever since it opened last October, the Bay County shooting range has given anyone a shot to test their skills pulling the trigger.\nIt's something O'Brien says that helps make the shooting range a top shot in the community.\nFor Dawn Pfeiffer, the range also offers a chance for those hoping to pull the trigger for the first time.\n\"The fact that the range officers were not only here to help control the area, but they offered fantastic shooting insights and abilities to us,\" said Pfeiffer.\nSteve O'Brien may live in Lynn Haven, but some days his home is on the range."}
