The Health Resources and Services Administration’s HIV/AIDS Bureau is calling for abstracts for the 2016 National Ryan White Conference on HIV Care and Treatment, which will take place August 23-26, 2016 in Washington, DC. This year’s theme is Forward Momentum: Accelerating Access. Optimizing Care. Transforming Public Health.

The 2016 National Conference brings together HIV clinical decision makers and key HIV service delivery providers working in Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program-supported settings from across the country, as well as HIV health care providers, stakeholders, and people living with HIV. In keeping with the conference theme, six session tracks will serve as the basis for this year’s workshop and poster sessions: data to care, emerging issues, health care landscape, quality management, innovative practices, and clinical pathway.

To submit an abstract for a workshop or poster and register for the conference, visit ryanwhite2016.org . The deadline for submission is April 29, 2016. On the website, you can also register for the conference and view the continuously expanding conference agenda.
