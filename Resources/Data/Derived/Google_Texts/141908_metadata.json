Because that\u2019s what doubling the current federal minimum \u2014 which several cities are doing \u2014 is likely to produce.\n\nA Washington Post story this week says that restaurant chains are \u201calready looking for ingenious ways to take humans out of the picture, threatening workers in an industry that employs 2.4 million wait staffers, nearly 3 million cooks and food preparers and many of the nation\u2019s 3.3 million cashiers.\u201d\n\nAnd with 30% of a restaurant\u2019s costs coming from paying humans, \u201cburger-flipping robots \u2026 become that much more cost-competitive if the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is doubled,\u201d notes Post reporter Lydia DePillis.\n\nThat\u2019s economics 101, folks.\n\nIt\u2019s true that some of these technological changes are probably inevitable, as restaurants, like everyone else, look for ways to cut costs and improve efficiency. But it is beyond doubt that artificially raising costs for human workers makes their robotic counterparts more economical far sooner than they otherwise would be.\n\nIt\u2019s not just minimum-wage costs, either. Obama\u2019s Labor Dept. seems determined to do whatever it takes to make hiring flesh and blood workers more expensive. And ObamaCare is piling on new labor costs as well in the form of employer mandates and piles of paperwork.\n\nIn fact, Darden Restaurants, one of the most vociferous critics of ObamaCare a few years ago, recently announced plans to roll out ordering tablets make by Ziosk in its Olive Garden chain. The tablets would sit on restaurant tables, letting patrons place their orders without ever talking to a waiter or waitress. All a server has to do is bring the food out.\n\nThat is, unless minimum-wage zealots win more battles and make robot servers a cheaper alternative, too.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you don't like the idea of robot waiters and robot cooks replacing entry-level workers, you might think twice about the recent $15 minimum-wage craze.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "If you don\u2019t like the idea of robot waiters and robot cooks replacing entry-level workers, you might think twice about the recent $15 minimum-wage craze.
