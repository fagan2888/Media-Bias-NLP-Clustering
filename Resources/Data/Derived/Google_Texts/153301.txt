One person is dead following a crash on Interstate 10 between a semi and a passenger vehicle near Casa Grande, according to the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

The collision happened shortly after 11 a.m. on westbound I-10 at milepost 185, according to an email from a DPS spokesperson.

The crash has closed the westbound lanes of I-10 at State Route 387, causing traffic to be routed off the freeway at the offramp for SR 387 and back on using the SR 387 on-ramp, according to a media alert from the Arizona Department of Transportation.

I-10 is backed up for at least five miles on the westbound side near Casa Grande, according to ADOT. Motorists should use alternate routes such as SR 287 (Florence Boulevard) west to SR 387 and then north to I-10, or take Interstate 8 west to SR 85 north to hit I-10 west of Phoenix.

The roadway just reopened, according ADOT.
