States will be required to evaluate how proposed rate reductions and payment restructuring would impact the program, and establish ways for beneficiaries and providers to give input, including surveys and hotlines.\n\nUnder the final rule, new structures will assist the federal government in making \u201cbetter informed, data-driven decisions\u201d that support care delivery services, structures and payment methods, the agency said in a late October press release. The rule will also help CMS \u201censure Medicaid payment rates are consistent with efficiency, economy and quality and care,\u201d the agency said. The original rule was first proposed in 2011.\n\nAmerican Health Care Association President and CEO Mark Parkinson applauded the release of the \u201clong-awaited\u201d final rule, which AHCA provided input on.\n\n\u201cThis is a framework for more transparency and accountability in the state plan amendment process for both beneficiaries and providers,\u201d Parkinson wrote in a statement released Wednesday. \u201cStates themselves have much work to do to make this into reality that ensures access for the beneficiaries receiving these needed services.\u201d\n\nIn the five years since the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid provisions, states have varied in how much they have expanded their program. Most recently, Kentucky's newly elected governor has pledged to dismantle the expansion program titled Kynect, which has led to 500,000 out of the state's 4.4 million gaining healthcare coverage, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe final rule will go into effect on January 4, 2016. Until then, CMS is accepting comments on the rule's access review requirements.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages05.net,forms.mcknights.com,mcknights.com,media.mcknights.com", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has released its final rule on Medicaid, which will include state requirements to review access plans for beneficiaries.", "content-language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "McKnight's", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has released its final rule on Medicaid, which will include state requirements to review access plans for beneficiaries.", "title": "Medicaid final rule aims to improve access, transparency", "url": "http://www.mcknights.com/news/medicaid-final-rule-aims-to-improve-access-transparency/article/453361/", "image": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/02/24/page01center0315_730785_730786.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has released its final rule on Medicaid, which will include state requirements to review access plans for beneficiaries.", "creator": "@Emmongan", "image": {"src": "http://media.mcknights.com/images/2015/02/24/page01center0315_730785_730786.jpg"}, "title": "Medicaid final rule aims to improve access, transparency", "site": "@mcknightsltcn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183363395035820}, "google-site-verification": "mx4rGVRiNxzj0lwxNljynJz1gArTEK6bZ0rK6AzvXic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-11-11T23:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T17:31:08"}, "Content-Type": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd416\"", "article_summary": "Medicaid final rule aims to improve access, transparencyShare this content:linkedingoogleEmailPrintThe final rule is a \"framework\" for transparency in Medicaid, Parkinson saysThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has released its final rule on Medicaid, which will include state requirements to review access plans for beneficiaries.\nThe final rule will go into effect on January 4, 2016.\nThe rule reflects the White House's goal to ensure those under Medicaid will have access to services.\nAmerican Health Care Association President and CEO Mark Parkinson applauded the release of the \u201clong-awaited\u201d final rule, which AHCA provided input on.\nThe rule will also help CMS \u201censure Medicaid payment rates are consistent with efficiency, economy and quality and care,\u201d the agency said."}
