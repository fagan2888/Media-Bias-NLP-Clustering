Jeffrey A. Currey, D-East Hartford, left, and U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-East Hartford, congratulate each other on their victories Tuesday. Currey was elected state representative of the 11th House District, and Larson was elected to his ninth term as representative of the 1st US House District.\n\nDemocratic Congressional incumbent John B. Larson was elected to his ninth term as Representative of the 1st Congressional District, beating challengers from both the Republican and Green parties.\n\nThe Larson campaign declared victory about 11 p.m., with a number of news agencies calling the race in his favor.\n\nBy 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, 70.4 percent of the votes had been tallied. Larson, 66, had 95,392 votes, or 59.6 percent of the total. Republican Matthew Corey had 62,258 votes, or 38.9 percent of the total, and Green Party candidate Jeffrey Russell had 2,369, or 1.5 percent of the total.\n\nThe Working Families party cross-endorsed Larson, and he appeared on the ballot under their party\u2019s ballot line as well.\n\nThe 1st Congressional District includes the towns of Barkhamsted, Berlin, Bloomfield, Bristol, Colebrook, Cromwell, East Granby, East Hartford, East Windsor, Granby, Hartford, Hartland, Manchester, New Hartford, Newington, Portland, Rocky Hill, Southington, South Windsor, West Hartford, Wethersfield, Winchester, Windsor, and Windsor Locks, and parts of Glastonbury, Middletown, and Torrington.\n\nRepublicans took control of both the U.S. House and Senate in this election. But Larson said of the nine times he has been elected, the Democrats have been in the minority seven of those times, so he understands the importance of reaching across the aisle to find common ground on a number of issues, even before the new term officially starts.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure, roads, deep harbors, those are not Democratic or Republican issues, they\u2019re American issues,\u201d Larson said from his East Hartford campaign headquarters Tuesday.\n\nLarson also brought up the importance of proper infrastructure funding several times Tuesday. When he served on the House Ways & Means Committee last term, he worked toward getting long-term, six-year infrastructure funding passed. But the measure was voted down along party lines.\n\nThere also is a bipartisan bill on immigration reform on the house floor Congress should vote on, Larson said, adding that there also is room to work on continuing to improve the Affordable Care Act, of which he is a supporter.\n\nIn his last term, Larson cosponsored over 100 bills with Republicans, according to his campaign information.\n\nLarson also said he will work closely with the state government and manufacturing base to help stimulate economic growth in Connecticut. The state has a bright future in the bioscience and aerospace engineering fields, he said, not just with big companies but with smaller entrepreneurs, too, and Connecticut can be a big draw for them all.\n\nThe world continues to be a dangerous place, he said, and the defense industry will help form the background of the state\u2019s manufacturing industry. Larson in May helped bring the contract for the Presidential Helicopter back, in part, to United Technologies Sikorsky Aircraft, according to his campaign information.\n\nRelatively new to the political scene, Corey, 50, of Manchester, owns McKinnon\u2019s Irish Pub in Hartford and Advanced Services International, a high-rise window-cleaning company. He ran against Larson in 2012 as a write-in candidate but received less than 2,300 votes.\n\nCorey said he agreed to run again because he\u2019s tired of the partisanship in Congress, and disagrees that Larson did enough to reach out to Republicans.\n\n\u201cHe put politics in front of people,\u201d Corey said Tuesday night at McKinnon\u2019s, where he and his supporters waited for the results. \u201cHe never found common ground.\u201d\n\nCorey ran on a campaign of economic growth, saying corporate taxes should be lowered to encourage reinvestment in America. He also said on his campaign website that high taxes, high energy costs, and over-regulation are stifling job growth.\n\n\u201cPeople are sick of politics,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about jobs.\u201d\n\nCorey also said during his campaign that the Affordable Care Act was harming economic growth, and would have voted to abolish portions of it.\n\nFurther, Corey said Larson had a double standard when calling out the president on military action in the Middle East, saying Larson should have been just as willing to question President Obama as he did President Bush.\n\nHowever, Larson voted against arming Syrian rebels and said no military action should be taken in the Middle East without an exit strategy.\n\nCorey acknowledged that Larson had an advantage as an incumbent, especially in a heavily Democratic district. But the important thing, he said, was getting the word out about himself and the campaign.\n\nHe did say, however, that it would have been great to have had a Republican Representative from Connecticut in office when the Republicans held a majority in the House.\n\nCorey was not sure if he would run again in 2016, but he would consider throwing his hat back in the ring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep an eye on him.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"publisher": "CT News Junkie", "og": {"url": "http://www.ctnewsjunkie.com/archives/entry/larson_wins_another_term_in_1st_congressional_district/", "site_name": "CT News Junkie", "type": "article", "description": "Democratic Congressional incumbent John B.
