Utah dropped from the ranks of the unbeaten and so did Florida State.

The two losses led to a shake-up in The Associated Press' Top 25 college football poll.

Ohio State (8-0) strengthened its season-long hold on the top spot, adding 11 first-place votes in Sunday's balloting after rolling over Rutgers.

Baylor (7-0) remained at No. 2, but lost five first-place votes and now total seven. Clemson (7-0) climbed three spots to No. 3 and has six first-place votes.

LSU (7-0) moved up a spot and received five first-place votes following its win over Western Kentucky. TCU (7-0) dropped a spot to No. 5 despite not playing over the weekend.

No. 7 Alabama (7-1), a spot behind Michigan State (8-0) in the poll, was the only one-loss team to receive a first-place vote after holding off Tennessee.

Utah (6-1) had been gaining on Ohio State, receiving 16 first-place votes last week while moving up to No. 3, their highest regular-season ranking.

Considered a contender for the College Football Playoff, Utah was no match for unranked Southern California, losing 42-24 as Cameron Smith returned one of his three interceptions 54 yards for a touchdown.

The loss dropped the Utes 10 spots to No. 13 and made them a long shot for a CFB spot.

Florida State (6-1) didn't last long in the top 10, falling eight spots to No. 17.

The Seminoles were on the short end of the season's second bizarre special teams ending, losing to Georgia Tech 22-16 after Lance Austin scooped up a blocked field goal and returned it 78 yards for a touchdown on the game's final play.
