Quitting cigarettes will be one of the hardest things a smoker will ever do. Ask anyone who has quit. And it can be a lonely battle as the quitter deals with inevitable cravings and ever-present temptations. But there is help. Smoking-cessation programs are numerous, but three of the most current are Quitter in You (quitterinyou.org), Freedom From Smoking (ffsonline.org) and the EX program (becomeanex.org). Quitter in You, sponsored by the American Lung Association and funded by the insurance company WellPoint, recognizes that past attempts at quitting smoking are not failures and encourages more attempts. Participants can join online or attend in-person programs. Freedom From Smoking, also an American Lung Association initiative for adults, guides smokers through an eight-session, step-by-step plan designed to help them control behavior. A Legacy initiative, the EX program helps young smokers learn to cope with smoking triggers and addiction. The FDA public service campaign The Real Cost (therealcost.betobaccofree.hhs.gov targets youth in ads on TV, radio, print and online. Tips From Former Smokers (cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips), the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s first ever media campaign, launched in 2012, profiles ex-smokers living with serious long-term health effects from smoking.
