Well, maybe the creaky Peyton Manning more than the ageless Tom Brady, who must be using his supermodel wife\u2019s face cream, because he\u2019s forever 24. These guys are football old, sure, but someday they will be old old. And an elderly Manning will be at a restaurant valet stand, picking up his hover-Buick, and someone will shout from afar: \u201cHey, Manning. You could never beat Brady!\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re eternally linked, these two Canton-bound quarterbacks, yet they divide a generation of fans debating which is better. Heading into the AFC championship game Sunday, the Broncos\u2019 Manning has won but four of 14 matchups against Brady\u2019s New England Patriots.\n\nTheir rivalry makes for the quintessential barroom debate. Manning, 37, probably will win his fifth league MVP award this year. He set NFL season records for touchdown passes and yards passing. But he\u2019s 1-for-2 in the Super Bowl. Brady? The 36-year-old QB has three title rings in five tries, as well as a significantly better playoff record than Manning, but lesser regular-season statistics.\n\nWho\u2019s better? The debate will continue long after Sunday\u2019s game, but of this there is no uncertainty: Manning vs. Brady ranks among the all-time best sports rivalries.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been as frequent a matchup with this much marquee that I can think of. I think it transcends the NFL,\u201d said CBS broadcaster Jim Nantz, who will work Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not trying to get into hyperbole here. We\u2019re not going to get one more person to watch this game. It\u2019s something everyone wants to see. But this is tantamount to Ali-Frazier one more time. This is Palmer-Nicklaus. This is Bird-Magic. I\u2019m not trying to create some sort of synthetic drama here. This is as big as it gets.\u201d\n\nJust as Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier was as big as it ever got in boxing, a rivalry that enraptured a nation at the height of the sport\u2019s popularity. The great heavyweights fought three times, with Frazier winning the first, \u201cThe Fight of the Century,\u201d which was Ali\u2019s first big bout since he had been stripped of his title after being convicted of draft evasion during the Vietnam War. Ali won the next two, including 1975\u2019s \u201cThrilla in Manila,\u201d which is possibly the greatest fight of all time, save for Rocky Balboa-Ivan Drago.\n\n\u201cThe difference is that boxers compete against each other \u2014 Peyton Manning competes against the New England Patriots\u2019 defense on Sunday, and he and Brady are never on the field at the same time,\u201d said Bob Arum, Ali\u2019s famed promoter. \u201cThat really makes it a different kind of rivalry. \u2026 And there was a lot of animosity that grew (between Ali and Frazier). If you take the situation like we have here, with Manning and Brady, I\u2019d venture to say that you couldn\u2019t find one bad word that one said about the other. Not one. But that might be because they\u2019re not really competing against one another.\n\n\u201cWhoever wins the AFC championship game, it doesn\u2019t answer the question, because it may very well be that the Patriots throw up a defense that befuddles Manning, or vice versa. So you can\u2019t really settle it. But after the 14th round in Manila, when Frazier couldn\u2019t come out because he was blind by taking punches to the face, that settled it. At least that night, Ali was the better man.\u201d\n\nRivalries have different seeds\n\nWhile the Ali-Frazier rivalry grew out of a mutual boiling hatred, the Larry Bird-Magic Johnson rivalry grew out of respect. Famously, the Boston Celtics star wasn\u2019t friends with the Los Angeles Lakers magician until the two spent time together on a commercial shoot. They became fast friends from that point forward, which only fueled the rivalry more. First, they faced off in the NCAA title game, won by Johnson and Michigan State. Then, representing the two coasts, the Hall of Famers faced off three times in the NBA Finals, with Bird winning the first one, in 1984, in a Game 7. Johnson\u2019s \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers won the next two, in 1985 and 1987. Together they helped rejuvenate the NBA and pushed each other to further greatness. A generation of basketball fans reaped the benefits.\n\nTennis, naturally, lends itself to rivalries \u2014 John McEnroe-Bjorn Borg, Steffi Graf-Monica Seles, Andre Agassi-Pete Sampras and Roger Federer-Rafael Nadal, who played in every French Open final and Wimbledon final from 2006-08.\n\n\u201cRoger and Rafa had the same sort of underlines that they\u2019re different enough personalities to make it interesting, and stylistically they matched up in an entertaining way,\u201d said Andy Roddick, who reached five Grand Slam finals and won the 2003 U.S. Open. \u201cAnd they both went about it the right way, and they both had a certain level of respect, which is probably different than the ones you saw in the \u201980s with McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, where they flat-out didn\u2019t like each other. So there are different ways to have a great rivalry.\u201d\n\nBut in terms of longevity and clashing styles, one tennis rivalry ascends and transcends.\n\n\u201cChris Evert was No. 1 for years before Martina came along,\u201d said Craig Kardon, a former coach of Martina Navratilova\u2019s. \u201cMartina was sort of this pudgy kid who grew into her body. They couldn\u2019t be more different with their personalities, but they became the best in the world. It developed into a rivalry because Chris was No. 1; Martina got in better shape and pushed Chris. Their lifetime match record was very close.\u201d\n\nIn fact, it was 43-37, Navratilova, a record spanning from 15 years. The cute and cunning Evert won three of four French Open finals against the bespectacled warrior Navratilova, but the Czech star went 9-1 against Evert in all other Grand Slam finals.\n\n\u201cIt was about changing her game and being cognizant of how to beat the other player \u2014 it\u2019s always tweaking,\u201d Kardon said. \u201cMartina always had a great support group around her \u2014 trainers, nutritionist, psychologists, and it forced Chris to hire different coaches and hitting partners and to get into better shape.\u201d\n\nAn army against the new king\n\nIn golf, Palmer ushered the sport into the modern era, captivating fans with his go-for-broke style, but along came Nicklaus to take the throne in the sport\u2019s passing-of-the-torch rivalry. Five times the two finished 1-2 in a major, and in a five-year span, 1962-66, they were the only two winners of the Masters.\n\nThe easy pick for a top NHL rivalry would be the blissful blitzkrieger Wayne Gretzky against his flipped-number counterpart Mario Lemieux, but the two seldom faced off (literally and figuratively).\n\nBut on Sunday in Denver, America\u2019s most popular sport will showcase its two most popular players, the two best players of their generation. It\u2019s Manning-Brady XV for a trip to Super Bowl XLVIII.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to savor it, because you don\u2019t know how many more times you\u2019re ever going to get it again,\u201d Nantz said. \u201cI know they\u2019re scheduled to play in the regular season again next year. But who knows? Maybe somebody\u2019s not going to be playing next year. When you say Brady-Manning, I defy anyone to say there\u2019s anything bigger in this league.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman\n\nOff-the-field talents from show business who spawned competing fans\n\nDenver Post columnist Benjamin Hochman offers five great American rivalries away from the sports arena:\n\nRobert De Niro-Al Pacino\n\nThe two Italian-American actors starred \u201ctogether\u201d in The Godfather Part II\u201d but were never on the screen at the same time. The actors defined a generation (really, perhaps two) with their intense performances.\n\nTupac Shakur-Notorious B.I.G.\n\nFriends-turned-foes, the legendary 1990s rappers were emblazoned voices of the West Coast-East Coast rap rivalry. Each man was shot to death, and each man\u2019s music lives on today.\n\nGinger-Mary Ann\n\nFor a certain generation, these two characters from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d led to heated debates. Ginger Grant, played by Tina Louise, was the elegant actress, while Mary Ann Summers was the girl next door played by Dawn Wells.\n\n\u2018N Sync-Backstreet Boys\n\nAt the height of the boy band era, these two groups reigned supreme. With frosted tips and cheesy dance routines, these guys churned out hit after hit.\n\nDavid Letterman-Jay Leno\n\nLeno got \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d job over Letterman, so Letterman took his talents to CBS. The two became late-night rivals for decades.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Peyton Manning-Tom Brady ranks among greatest sports rivalries of all time", "title": "Peyton Manning-Tom Brady ranks among greatest sports rivalries of all time", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/18/peyton-manning-tom-brady-ranks-among-greatest-sports-rivalries-of-all-time/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__20140119_C2_SP19FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140118__20140119_C2_SP19FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-18T19:02:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T07:32:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2139\"", "article_summary": "The debate will continue long after Sunday\u2019s game, but of this there is no uncertainty: Manning vs. Brady ranks among the all-time best sports rivalries.\nFirst, they faced off in the NCAA title game, won by Johnson and Michigan State.\nWell, maybe the creaky Peyton Manning more than the ageless Tom Brady, who must be using his supermodel wife\u2019s face cream, because he\u2019s forever 24.\nHeading into the AFC championship game Sunday, the Broncos\u2019 Manning has won but four of 14 matchups against Brady\u2019s New England Patriots.\nYou could never beat Brady!\u201dThey\u2019re eternally linked, these two Canton-bound quarterbacks, yet they divide a generation of fans debating which is better."}
