The Little Sisters of the Poor is an international Catholic institute that cares for the elderly. The Sisters consider it a sin to provide their employees health coverage for contraceptives \u2013 including drugs classified by the FDA as abortion-inducing \u2014 as required under Obamacare, and they want the same kind of exemption that already has been given to churches.\n\nThe Sisters, as neither a corporation nor a church, are in the same legal limbo as thousands of religious schools and colleges, charities and hospitals. Those groups have filed dozens of lawsuits.\n\nThe Eight Circuit was the only lower court of seven that ruled against the federal government.\n\nIt is the fourth time the Supreme Court has taken a case involving Obamacare, and it\u2019s the second related to its contraceptive mandate. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the justices decided by a 5-4 vote 16 months ago to protect for-profit companies with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate.\n\nIt was second time the Sisters have gone to the high court. A year ago, the justices gave them preliminary protection pending a full hearing of the arguments.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters spend their lives taking care of the neediest members of our society \u2013 that is work our government should applaud, not punish,\u201d said Rienzi. \u201cThe Little Sisters should not have to fight their own government to get an exemption it has already given to thousands of other employers, including big companies like Exxon and Pepsi Cola Bottling Company.\u201d\n\nThe brief criticized the Obama administration for its \u201cdeceptive labels and diversionary tactics\u201d designed to falsely suggest that the Little Sisters can \u201copt out\u201d of the mandate.\n\nThe document also pointed out if the government really wants pills distributed, it doesn\u2019t need the nuns.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the government has invested billions of dollars in creating exchanges for the express purpose of making it easy to obtain qualifying insurance when it is not available through an employer. The government cannot explain why those exchanges suffice to advance its goal of getting contraceptive coverage to the tens of millions of [other] people \u2026 yet are not good enough,\u201d the brief said.\n\nSister Loraine Marie Maguire, a spokeswoman for the order, said: \u201cWe offer the neediest elderly of every race and religion a home where they are welcomed as Christ. We perform this loving ministry because of our faith and cannot possibly choose between our care for the elderly poor and our faith, and we shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\n\u201cAll we ask is that our rights not be taken away. The government exempts large corporations, small businesses, and other religious ministries from what they are imposing on us \u2013 we just want to keep serving the elderly poor as we have always done for 175 years. We look forward to the Supreme Court hearing our case, and pray for God\u2019s protection of our ministry.\u201d\n\nThe filing explained that the text of the Affordable Care Act \u201csays nothing about contraceptive coverage, but it does require employers to \u2018provide coverage\u2019 for certain \u2018preventive services,\u2019 including \u2018preventive care\u2019 for women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services (\u2018HHS\u2019) has interpreted that statutory mandate to require employers through their healthcare plans to provide at no cost the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, including some that cause abortions. Despite the obvious implications for many employers of deep religious conviction, HHS decided to exempt only some nonprofit religious employers from compliance,\u201d the brief said.\n\n\u201cAs to all other religious employers, HHS demanded compliance, either by instructing their insurers to include coverage in their plans, or via a regulatory mechanism through which the employers must execute documents that authorize, obligate and/or incentivize their insurers or plan administrators to use their plans to provide cost-free contraceptive coverage to their employees. In the government\u2019s view, either of those actions suffices to put these religious employers and their plans in compliance with the statutory \u2018provide coverage\u2019 obligation.\n\n\u201cThis court has already concluded that the threatened imposition of massive fines for failing to comply with this contraceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise, and that the original method of compliance violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\u2018RFRA\u2019). And it is undisputed that this case involves the same mandate and the same fines, and that nonexempt religious employers such as petitioners hold sincere religious objections to the regulatory method of compliance as well.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the help you\u2019ll need to prepare your household for the realities of living under a centralized health-care system \u2014 order Dr. Lee Hieb\u2019s \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "U.S. Supreme Court justices, who have issued mixed rulings on Obamacare \u2013 once changing the law\u2019s fees into taxes to make them legal and another time saying exchanges set up by the states are the same as those set up by the federal government \u2013 now have been handed another problem.
