The paper says it is time for Gov. McCrory to stand up to his budget director and conservative political moneybags, Art Pope (who has launched a new and public effort to forestall needed growth in university spending).\n\nThis is from the editorial:\n\n\u201cPope, who has his own conservative political constituency, has long been a UNC critic. The UNC operations request alone is for 4.6 percent. And while Pope had instructed state agencies to keep increase requests to 2 percent or less, the university\u2019s response must be considered in historical context. Over the last five years, the UNC operational budget has been cut by hundreds of millions of dollars. UNC officials have found efficiencies to cover some of those lost funds, but they\u2019ve also weakened the education they deliver. Additionally, students have been hit with big tuition and fee increases while state funding has dropped. All of this in a state where the constitution guarantees a university education that is as close to free as is \u2018practicable\u2019\u2026. McCrory is caught in the middle here. On one side, Pope is his budget director. On the other, most members of the Republican-controlled UNC Board of Governors are his allies, too. And the Republican-controlled General Assembly put them in. Pope is also contradicting McCrory, poor-mouthing state finances while the governor boasts of a \u2018Carolina Comeback,\u2019 an economy recovering quickly under his leadership. As for the repairs and renovations UNC requested and which Pope dismissed in a memo, remember: McCrory made infrastructure improvements an administration cornerstone. With the economy improving, it\u2019s time to begin rebuilding the UNC system. The UNC board realizes that. McCrory must as well.\u201d\n\nLets hope McCrory heeds the advice and that he rejects the idea of installing Pope as the head of the UNC system \u2014 a possibility that\u2019s been percolating in the Raleigh rumor mill for sometime.\n\nRead the entire editorial by clicking here.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29de\"", "article_summary": "On the other, most members of the Republican-controlled UNC Board of Governors are his allies, too.\nAdditionally, students have been hit with big tuition and fee increases while state funding has dropped.\nWith the economy improving, it\u2019s time to begin rebuilding the UNC system.\nMcCrory to stand up to his budget director and conservative political moneybags, Art Pope (who has launched a new and public effort to forestall needed growth in university spending).\nPope is also contradicting McCrory, poor-mouthing state finances while the governor boasts of a \u2018Carolina Comeback,\u2019 an economy recovering quickly under his leadership."}
