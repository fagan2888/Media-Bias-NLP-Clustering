Nine justices on the Supreme Court. Anything else just doesn\u2019t make sense, right?\n\n\u201cThe answer is no. There have been many circumstances in our nation's history when the court has functioned with fewer than nine justices. The number nine isn't anywhere in the Constitution,\u201d said Michael Paulsen, a law professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, and the author of \u201cThe Constitution: An Introduction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's nothing magical about nine,\u201d Paulsen told Fox 9. \u201cOver time, the Court has gone from six to seven to nine. For a while, it was at ten. And back to nine.\u201d\n\nWith eight justices, the Court is more likely to tie, 4-4, on the hot button issues.\n\n\u201cOn a 4-4 vote, they will simply leave the lower court decision affirmed without an opinion by the Supreme Court,\u201d Paulsen said. In other words, a tie means the lower court\u2019s decision stands, with the Supreme Court not applying the decision to the rest of the country.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how a tie would affect four key cases:\n\nImmigration: U.S. v. Texas\n\nLower courts blocked the president\u2019s executive order allowing millions of undocumented workers to remain in the U.S. if they met certain guidelines. Because lower courts blocked the president\u2019s actions, their decision would stand: the executive order would not be valid.\n\nContraception: Zubik v.Burwell\n\nLower courts are in conflict, meaning some have ruled one way, another ruling the other way, on non-profits challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that they provide contraception coverage, or sign a form opting out. Because different courts have ruled in different ways, a Supreme Court tie would mean the law would be different depending on where you live. Paulsen says this difficult outcome might lead the justices to try another option.\n\n\u201cIn that case, I hesitate to make a firm prediction, but I would think the justices might think this would be an appropriate case to put to the next term,\u201d Paulsen said.\n\nAffirmative Action: Fisher v. Texas\n\nA tie at the Supreme Court would likely lead to limitations on affirmative action. That\u2019s because Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from a lawsuit against the University of Texas, likely leading to a 4-3 vote with conservatives winning.\n\nAbortion: Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt\n\nA Supreme Court tie would likely leave a Texas law in place that requires doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. The law led some clinics to close. Because the lower court, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, upheld the law, a tie would let it stand \u2013 but only in Texas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nine innings in a baseball game.
