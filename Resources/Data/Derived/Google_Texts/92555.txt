Solano County officials have selected Gerald Huber as the new director of Health and Social Services.

Starting Nov. 10, he will assume leadership over Solano County's largest and most comprehensive public service agency.

Huber, who has been involved with health and human service programs at county, state and federal levels of government for more than 30 years in Minnesota, Wisconsin and New York, will oversee a $289 million budget and more than 1,200 employees working in five program services areas in 22 offices throughout Solano County.

In addition to providing strategic direction and support across the department, Huber will also be responsible for overseeing the ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). His experience in social service agencies will help the department continue to navigate the financial complexities related to medical billing, privacy and security practices.

"We're excited to welcome Mr. Huber as he brings a wealth of knowledge and experience that will serve us well as we continue to implement new state and federal requirements for the delivery of health and social service programs in Solano County," said County Administrator Birgitta Corsello.

Before joining Solano County, Huber worked to help transform the Medicaid program in New York as Deputy Commissioner for the Office of the People with Developmental Disabilities. He has been honored by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services for outstanding contributions in the prevention of child abuse and neglect, received lifetime achievement awards for accomplishments in the non-profit sector and crafted welfare reform programs that have shaped national policy.

Huber holds master's degrees in public administration, social work and human services administration, and public health administration; and a bachelor's degree in behavioral science. He has been married to his wife Debbie for 34 years and has two children, Dianna and Dan.
