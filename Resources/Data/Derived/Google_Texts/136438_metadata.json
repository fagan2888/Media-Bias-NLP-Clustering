The project, now entering its fifth year, received another grant worth $658,485 this summer. The total funding for the research is now $3,531,925. Funding has more than doubled since the study was first revealed in 2013. Since, the study that is examining why three-quarters of lesbians are obese, but gay men are not, has survived sequester cuts, and continues to produce results such as the discovery that gay men have a \u201cgreater desire for toned muscles\u201d than straight men.\n\nApparently the administration is obsessed with obesity, especially given the rule last month to ban trans fats. But are Americans really that concerned with lesbians supposedly being fat that it requires government funding? Shouldn't somebody's weight be their choice but not the government's?\n\nFor what it's worth, on Reddit somebody posed the question as to why lesbians tend to be more obese, and here was the answer:\n\n\u201cI was at women\u2019s weekend in ptown this weekend,\u201d one user said. \u201cWe are fat, there\u2019s no question. My unpopular opinion? We just let ourselves go easier when we get into relationships. My [significant other] SO and I struggle with our weight but we HATE being fat so we force ourselves to eat healthy and get out and be athletic.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s tough though and many lesbians I know just don\u2019t care, don\u2019t want to put the work into it,\u201d they said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t care, who cares? If you\u2019re happy that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nExactly. It's not the government's business to get involved with this stuff.\n\nOf course, the reason why the government is getting involved is because the left has always wanted universal healthcare. Obama himself has even stated as such. Obamacare will eventually lead to a single-payer system. When the government runs healthcare, suddenly what you eat becomes everyone's business we are all paying for it. That's why the NIH is concerned.\n\nThe numerous amounts of GOP candidates running for president would be wise to use this as an example of low-hanging fruit that can be cut from the federal government's budget and ask Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders et al. if they are in favor of letting this kind of government waste go on unabated.", "article_metadata": {"description": "And no this is not from the Onion..05/26/2016 18:17:38PM EST.", "author": "Aaron Bandler", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "And no this is not from the Onion.", "title": "- Federal Government Spent $3.5 Million to Determine Why Lesbians Are Obese", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/aaronbandler/2015/07/13/federal-government-spent-35-million-to-determine-why-lesbians-are-obese-n2024790", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/160/2015-06-09T202723Z_1_LYNXMPEB580ZD_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "And no this is not from the Onion.", "title": "- Federal Government Spent $3.5 Million to Determine Why Lesbians Are Obese", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/aaronbandler/2015/07/13/federal-government-spent-35-million-to-determine-why-lesbians-are-obese-n2024790", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/160/2015-06-09T202723Z_1_LYNXMPEB580ZD_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Federal Government Spent $3.5 Million to Determine Why Lesbians Are Obese, Aaron Bandler, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "From the Washington Free Beacon:The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has now spent over $3.5 million to determine why the majority of lesbians are obese.\nBut are Americans really that concerned with lesbians supposedly being fat that it requires government funding?\nThe project, now entering its fifth year, received another grant worth $658,485 this summer.\nApparently the administration is obsessed with obesity, especially given the rule last month to ban trans fats.\nOf course, the reason why the government is getting involved is because the left has always wanted universal healthcare."}
