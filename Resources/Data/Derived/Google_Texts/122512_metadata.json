About 250 parishioners, friends, neighbors and guests attended the half-day celebration. Guests from ages 2 weeks old to 96 years old came from as far as California, Texas and Nebraska.\n\nBoard Chairman Rob Canterbury said about 60 people attend Sunday School each week and an average of about 140 people attend Sunday morning services. He said seven Bible studies are offered throughout the week.\n\nJerry Estis served on the board of directors for more than 50 years, before retiring just a couple of years ago. He first began serving when he was in high school, when the church met in the science room of the Cotopaxi schoolhouse.\n\n\"It wasn't my idea to get on the board, it was my mother's idea, and I didn't argue with my mother,\" he said.\n\nWhat he has enjoyed most about his time with Cotopaxi Community Church, he said, simply is Jesus.\n\nAssociate Pastor Bill Cosson said the church will continue to move forward, reaching out to \"anybody\" that God leads into their paths and will continue to abound in the work of the Lord.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We are going to emphasize the sanctity and the value of life, just as God does,\" he said. \"Whether a person is 90 years old, 50 years old, 20 years old, a teenager, a 2-and-a-half week old baby or a minus 8-month-old baby, we want to come along side what scripture says and recognize the value of human life.\"\n\nThe church also will continue to emphasize the sanctity of marriage, work to bring up the next generation, and future generations, in the nurture and admonition of the Lord and continue to support missions.\n\nThe church supports about 19 missionaries and designates about 40 percent of the church budget to the mission field, Cosson said.\n\nHe said in 90 years, he hopes people will recognize Cotopaxi Community Church continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayer.\n\nCotopaxi Community Church formally was organized by 53 residents in April 1924. The church officially was incorporated in 1936 and in the same year, received a donation of land, where the church is located today, by Mrs. B.S. McCroy. A permanent building was constructed and opened to the community in 1956.\n\nFor more information, visit https://facebook.com/cotopaxicommunitychurch\" title=\"facebook.com\">facebook.com/cotopaxicommunitychurch.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26487604/cotopaxi-community-church-celebrates-90th-anniversary", "modificationDate": "2014-09-07T18:33:39-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0907/20140907__08DRCHURCHw~4_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Carie Canterbury \n \n  canterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Cotopaxi \u2014 Cotopaxi Community Church may appear a small body of believers   nestled in a tiny community, but it's actually quite substantial when it comes to family, friends and faith.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:26487604:view"}, "startDate": "2014-09-07T18:31:13-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26487604/cotopaxi-community-church-celebrates-90th-anniversary", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0907/20140907__08DRCHURCHw~4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Cotopaxi \u2014 Cotopaxi Community Church may appear a small body of believers   nestled in a tiny community, but it's actually quite substantial when it comes to family, friends and faith.", "title": "Cotopaxi Community Church celebrates 90th anniversary"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Cotopaxi \u2014 Cotopaxi Community Church may appear a small body of believers   nestled in a tiny community, but it's actually quite substantial when it comes to family, friends and faith.", "title": "Cotopaxi Community Church celebrates 90th anniversary", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_26487604/cotopaxi-community-church-celebrates-90th-anniversary", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0907/20140907__08DRCHURCHw~4.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-07T18:31:13-0600", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "endDate": "2024-09-07T18:30:13-0600", "sailthru.title": "Cotopaxi Community Church celebrates 90th anniversary", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "byline": "By Carie Canterburycanterburyc@canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/0907/20140907__08DRCHURCHw~4.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-09-07T18:34:32-0600", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbad6\"", "article_summary": "The Cotopaxi Community Church board of directors is introduced during the church's 90th anniversary celebration Sunday at Stagecoach Ranch in Cotopaxi.\nWhat he has enjoyed most about his time with Cotopaxi Community Church, he said, simply is Jesus.\nCotopaxi Community Church formally was organized by 53 residents in April 1924.\nHe said in 90 years, he hopes people will recognize Cotopaxi Community Church continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine, in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayer.\n( Carie Canterbury / Daily Record )Click photo to enlarge \u00ab1234\u00bbCotopaxi \u2014 Cotopaxi Community Church may appear a small body of believers nestled in a tiny community, but it's actually quite substantial when it comes to family, friends and faith."}
