S. economy are increasingly putting in more hours at work than those in the bottom income levels.\n\nA Czar of Equity put in charge of fixing the \u201cdefining challenge of our time\u201d might therefore note, correctly, that household incomes would be more equal if the government permitted only one earner per household, and if the rich were restricted via government decree to fewer work hours per week, and more equal if women hadn\u2019t moved into higher-income jobs during the decades when upper-income professionals were increasingly choosing to marry other upper-income professionals, and more equal if family structures were more alike across all income quintiles. In 2012, reported the Census Bureau, 83 percent of households in the bottom income quintile were singles or single-parent families, versus 22 percent in the top income quintile.\n\nRalph R.
