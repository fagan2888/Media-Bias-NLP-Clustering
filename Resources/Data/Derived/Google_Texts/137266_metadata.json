The system also will continue to gain access to industry-leading pricing on supplies with the company's national group purchasing organization.\n\nThe renewal builds upon savings of more than $42 million since 2010 by leveraging MedAssets supply chain solutions as well as its recently completed enterprise consulting engagement, which focused on utilizing data-driven insights, evidence-based technologies and consulting expertise for sustainable margin improvement.\n\n\"The enacted Affordable Care Act legislation and continued pressure on reimbursement are driving hospitals and health systems like Jackson Health System to lower their cost structure and better manage the total cost of care delivery while maintain quality metrics,\" said Rosa Costanzo, vice president and chief procurement officer, Strategic Sourcing and Supply Chain Management Division, Jackson Health System. \"Our work with MedAssets on cost reduction has delivered significant financial value and enhanced our operational and clinical excellence as we strive to provide the highest standard of care.
