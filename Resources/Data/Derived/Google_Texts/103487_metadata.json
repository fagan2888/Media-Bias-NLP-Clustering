But he offered no specific effort to address those challenges, as he did a year-and-ahalf ago when he launched My Brother\u2019s Keeper for at-risk boys and men of color.\n\nInstead, the president pointed to policies, programs and legislation that his administration already is pursuing, including job training and encouraging girls to study STEM fields, urging Congress to pass bills for equal pay and paid leave, and promising to work with black lawmakers to pass criminal justice reforms.\n\n[Obama launches My Brother's Keeper Alliance to help young men of color]\n\nKimberle Crenshaw, a feminist scholar who along with other activists has called on the White House to expand My Brother\u2019s Keeper to include women and girls of color, praised the president for acknowledging that race affects the economic and social chances for women and girls.\n\n\u201cFirst, we have to say how significant it is that he has finally acknowledged that black women and girls are not doing just fine,\u201d Crenshaw said in a telephone interview Sunday. \u201cThat has been one of the inferences that many people have drawn after nearly two years of exclusive focus on men and boys of color and to the extent this speech actually helps to correct this incorrect assumption, [it] is enormously important.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech, Obama, who as an Illinois senator was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, was interrupted several times by applause as he talked about how \u201call of us are beneficiaries of a long line of strong black women who helped carry this country forward.\u201d\n\nAnd he drew delighted laughter when, referring to his wife, daughters and mother-in-law, he noted: \u201cOf course, they\u2019re also a majority of my household. So I care deeply about how they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe president said that in recent years the number of black women-owned businesses \u201chas skyrocketed\u201d and that high school and college graduation rates for girls and women of color are up, indicating progress despite continued racial and gender discrimination.\n\nStill, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that black women and girls still face real and persistent challenges.\u201d He cited high unemployment for black women, who are often relegated to low-paying jobs. \u201cIt makes a mockery of our economy when black women make 30 fewer cents for every dollar a white man earns,\u201d he said.\n\nObama referenced his initiative aimed at improving the life changes of boys and young men of color when talking about how criminal justice issues disproportionately affect black girls and women.\n\n[1,000 women of color want women and girls included in My Brother's Keeper]\n\n\u201cAlthough in these discussions a lot of my focus has been on African American men and the work we\u2019re doing with My Brother\u2019s Keeper, we can\u2019t forget the impact that the system has on women, as well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president noted that the incarceration rate for black women is twice as high as for white women and that girls of color are suspended from school at higher rates than other girls and white boys.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re focusing on boys, but we\u2019re also investing in ways to change the odds for at-risk girls -- to make sure that they are loved and valued, to give them a chance,\u201d Obama said.\n\nCrenshaw, who did not attend the dinner, said that the administration needed to focus on women and girls of color in the same targeted way it has done with boys.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have a one-size-fits all approach to black women and girls, no more than you can have a one-size-fits-all approach for men and boys,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to have an intersectional awareness that race makes some women more vulnerable.\u201d\n\nShe said Obama's acknowledgment was \"a good first step. Step two is action -- specific targeted action to the needs of women and girls of color.\"\n\nCrenshaw is a founder of the African American Policy Forum, a think tank that urges taking into account race, gender and class in addressing injustice issues.\n\nIn addition to lobbying the White House to include women and girls in the My Brother\u2019s Keeper Initiative, she also is a leader of the #SayHerName movement, which urges Black Lives Matter activists and public officials to acknowledge that women and girls that have been killed during encounters with law enforcement.\n\nAs part of the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative, the White House directed Cabinet agencies to document the problems faced by boys and young men of color and propose solutions; the chairman of the initiative is a member of the president\u2019s Cabinet. My Brother\u2019s Keeper, which focuses on mentoring, tutoring, job-training and other efforts to help at-risk youth, also has garnered hundreds of millions in support from private businesses and corporations.\n\nValerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser and chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls, tweeted quotes and statistics from the president\u2019s speech Saturday night. Her council is often cited in response to concerns about the exclusion of women and girls from the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative.\n\nWe\u2019re investing in ways to change the odds for at-risk girls \u2013 to make sure they know they are loved and valued and deserve a chance in life \u2014 Valerie Jarrett (@vj44) September 20, 2015\n\nMelanie L. Campbell, convenor of the Black Women's Roundtable, did attend Saturday night\u2019s dinner. She said via text message that she was \u201cpleased to hear President Obama lift up the leadership role Black women have always played in the Civil Rights, women's rights and social justice movements.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the Roundtable issued a report citing many of the disparities that Obama noted in his speech. And on Wednesday the group, along with Essence, a popular black women\u2019s magazine, released a survey that found affordable healthcare and college and higher wages were the three top issues among African-American women going into the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with President Obama in the 4th quarter of his administration to address the unique challenges black women face from economic justice, criminal justice, equal pay, violence and more,\u201d Campbell wrote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attendees at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner were moved by the president's tribute to black women.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678837008", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Attendees at the Congressional Black Caucus dinner were moved by the president's tribute to black women.", "title": "Obama\u2019s call to lift up black women gets applause, but some want specific plan", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/20/obamas-call-to-lift-up-black-women-gets-applause-but-some-want-specific-plan/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-09-19/Getty/Was8962458.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@wapovanessa"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/20/obamas-call-to-lift-up-black-women-gets-applause-but-some-want-specific-plan/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama, black women, my brother's keeper", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678837008"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama, black women, my brother's keeper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d0d\"", "article_summary": "Still, he added, \u201cthere\u2019s no denying that black women and girls still face real and persistent challenges.\u201d He cited high unemployment for black women, who are often relegated to low-paying jobs.\n\u201cIt makes a mockery of our economy when black women make 30 fewer cents for every dollar a white man earns,\u201d he said.\nHer council is often cited in response to concerns about the exclusion of women and girls from the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative.\n\u201cFirst, we have to say how significant it is that he has finally acknowledged that black women and girls are not doing just fine,\u201d Crenshaw said in a telephone interview Sunday.\nStep two is action -- specific targeted action to the needs of women and girls of color.\""}
