Julia Mancuso, the bronze medalist in super combined, was the top American in eighth place.\n\nAustrians Anna Fenninger and Nicole Hosp took gold and bronze, respectively. Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany took the silver.\n\nMidway through the alpine program, the U.S. racers are having to answer questions about what\u2019s wrong with a team that won eight medals at the Vancouver Games four years ago.\n\n\u201cWe probably expected a little more, to be honest,\u201d said U.S. Ski Team alpine director Patrick Riml. \u201cThe Games aren\u2019t over yet. We\u2019re halfway through, and we have some strong performers and good events coming up for us.\u201d\n\nLeanne Smith was 18th Saturday and the other U.S. racers, Laurenne Ross and Stacey Cook, failed to finish. Last year they all made podium appearances on the World Cup, but none of them have this year.\n\n\u201cEvery athlete is out here to do their best,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThere\u2019s definitely no lack of that on this team. Alpine skiing is a very difficult sport. It\u2019s so competitive, and there\u2019s so many variables and factors that go into it.\u201d\n\nIn the men\u2019s downhill, Bode Miller made one costly mistake that cost him a gold medal. In other races, U.S. skiers have appeared tentative, especially Mancuso in the women\u2019s downhill. She finished eighth, on the same course where she was first in the downhill leg of the combined two days earlier.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely some disappointments, for sure in the downhill,\u201d Mancuso said. \u201cI wanted to have a better race, and Bode for sure wanted to do better. But it\u2019s hard. There\u2019s really only three spots that you can get a medal \u2014 first, second and third. There\u2019s tons of skiers out here that can really step it up and have their best races.\u201d\n\nMiller and Ted Ligety still have medal prospects in the men\u2019s super-G Sunday, Ligety will be the favorite in giant slalom Wednesday, and young star Mikaela Shiffrin arrived Friday for giant slalom Tuesday and slalom on Friday. She is the reigning world champion in the slalom and has been on the podium twice this season in GS.\n\n\u201cYou can believe so much, and then you actually have to do it on the day,\u201d Mancuso said. \u201cEvery time I cross the finish line, it makes me appreciate so much that I\u2019ve been able to win medals. It\u2019s tough because you want to be motivated to get more. It feels so good to stand on the podium, but everything really has to come together. It really has to be a magical day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "American skiers miss podium at women\u2019s Olympic super-G", "title": "American skiers miss podium at women\u2019s Olympic super-G", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/14/american-skiers-miss-podium-at-womens-olympic-super-g/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215_013137_USA-skier-Julia-Mancuso-womens-Olympic-Super-G.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140215_013137_USA-skier-Julia-Mancuso-womens-Olympic-Super-G.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-15T01:18:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T22:47:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Alpine skiing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd697\"", "article_summary": "Ski Team alpine director Patrick Riml.\nThere\u2019s really only three spots that you can get a medal \u2014 first, second and third.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s definitely some disappointments, for sure in the downhill,\u201d Mancuso said.\nKRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia \u2013 A bizarre women\u2019s super-G resulted in another deflating performance Saturday for the U.S.\nIn other races, U.S. skiers have appeared tentative, especially Mancuso in the women\u2019s downhill."}
