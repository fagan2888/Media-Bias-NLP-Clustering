University of Oklahoma President David Boren will encourage his son, former U.S. Rep. Dan Boren, not to run for governor in 2018, saying in a statement "it is not a good idea."

A former Democratic governor and U.S. Senator, David Boren issued a statement Sunday after The Associated Press reported the younger Boren was considering running for governor in 2018.

In the statement, David Boren said he will advise his son against running. He added that he has always had a policy of not endorsing or campaigning for any candidate for governor. Neither David Boren nor Dan Boren immediately returned messages seeking further comment.

Dan Boren said last week he would make a decision by the end of the year on whether to run.
