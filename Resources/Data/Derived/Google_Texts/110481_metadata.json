The parkway itself remained open, but the administration said all concessions in national parks must shut.\n\nSEE ALSO: Debt fight to escalate shutdown showdown; Boehner attaches Obamacare strings\n\n\u201cI\u2019m questioning their authority to shut me,\u201d Pisgah Inn owner Bruce O'Connell told The Washington Times on Friday as he fought to stay open.\n\nSeveral congressional committees have said they would look into the Park Service\u2019s decisions, accusing the Obama administration of trying to make the shutdown as painful as possible for Americans.\n\nIn the meantime, Americans across the country have embraced the chance to flout the closures as a defiant act of civil disobedience.\n\nSEE ALSO: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew: Obama can\u2019t stop default if debt ceiling is hit\n\nThe Internet has been flooded with photos of people going around traffic cones and vehicle barricades to get to parking lots, bicycle paths and hiking trails.\n\nStill, campgrounds, ski areas and basic services have been closed at all parks, the monuments the Park Service runs in Washington have been barricaded, and rangers are doing their best to keep folks away.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the park closures have shuttered the City Tavern.\n\nOn Cape Cod, the Nauset Knoll Motor Lodge is closed.\n\nBut not all private companies on park land have been shut down. Two high-profile places in San Francisco, the Argonaut Hotel in San Francisco Maritime National Park and Cavallo Point, a luxury hotel in Golden Gate National Park, are open.\n\nThe Park Service says those are operating under lease agreements rather than as concessions, which means they are allowed to stay open.\n\n\u201cConcessions operations are required to close; leases are permitted to remain open,\u201d Mike Litterst, a spokesman for the parks, said in an email to The Washington Times.\n\nThe discrepancies are difficult for some to understand.\n\nOne man wondered why Skyline Drive, the road running through Shenandoah National Park, was closed but the Blue Ridge Parkway remained open.\n\nIn the Washington region, the George Washington Parkway is open for traffic, and the bike trail that runs alongside the Potomac for much of the road is also getting heavy use \u2014 but the Park Service has barricaded the parking lots, leaving visitors to park on nearby streets and cross through traffic to get to the path.\n\nOther federal land agencies have taken different routes. The Army Corps of Engineers, for example, has said some of its concessionaires can remain open.\n\nAlthough some Army Corps marinas are open, the Park Service has shut down all of its marinas.\n\n\u201cWe consider the National Park system to be a single entity, and without an appropriation, the entire system is closed and cannot reopen until funding is restored,\u201d said Mr. Litterst, the parks spokesman. \u201cWe do not believe it is appropriate or feasible to have some parts of the system open while others are closed to the public.\u201d\n\nMr. Litterst also said that the 3,000 employees still on the job are needed to protect safety and property, and can\u2019t staff \u201cvisitor services\u201d such as campgrounds.\n\nMr. O\u2019Connell, who runs the Pisgah Inn, said he never received a certified letter or even a call from the park superintendent telling him to close, but rather got an email from someone in the park business office.\n\nOther concessions had similar stories.\n\nMr. O'Connell said his workers are not federal employees, and his fire, police and rescue services all come from the county, so he isn\u2019t drawing any federal funds. Indeed, the rangers posted at his driveway to turn away patrons Friday likely used more resources \u2014 and made it tougher for them to respond to an actual emergency had one occurred elsewhere on the parkway, he said.\n\nDerrick A. Crandall, a counselor at the National Park Hospitality Association, an organization for park concessionaires, said the Park Service is showing less leniency this time than it did during the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns.\n\n\u201cLast time around, we saw some superintendents that tended to recognize hardship and perhaps be a little more forgiving of hard deadlines, just attempting to make sure any special needs were accommodated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, from what I\u2019m being told, there were some superintendents who acted to shut down ops before the Thursday 6 p.m. deadline.\u201d\n\nHe said his organization plans to sit down with the Park Service and ask about trying to find \u201ccreative ways\u201d to let the concessionaires get back up and running.\n\nHouse Republicans have passed a bill that would open the national parks, but President Obama has vowed to veto it. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat, said either all of the government must be funded or none of it will be funded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The National Park Service has closed privately run marinas, restaurants and inns throughout the country and in some cases even posted guards to keep people from using them during the government shutdown, arguing that it doesn't have the money, manpower or authority to let them operate.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The National Park Service has closed privately run marinas, restaurants and inns throughout the country and in some cases even posted guards to keep people from using them during the government shutdown, arguing that it doesn\u2019t have the money, manpower or authority to let them operate.", "title": "National Park rangers ordered to keep visitors out of privately run businesses", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/6/national-park-rangers-ordered-to-keep-visitors-out/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/03/budget-battle-shutdown-parks-tourismjpeg-01569.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/03/budget-battle-shutdown-parks-tourismjpeg-01569.jpg", "description": "The National Park Service has closed privately run marinas, restaurants and inns throughout the country and in some cases even posted guards to keep people from using them during the government shutdo", "card": "summary", "title": "National Park rangers ordered to keep visitors out of privately run bu"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "US National Park Service, Bruce O Connell, Pisgah Inn"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe297d\"", "article_summary": "Two high-profile places in San Francisco, the Argonaut Hotel in San Francisco Maritime National Park and Cavallo Point, a luxury hotel in Golden Gate National Park, are open.\nDerrick A.
