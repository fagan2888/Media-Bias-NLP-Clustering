However, with colder weather approaching, food and medicine are not the only items these homeless pets will need.\n\nHomeless shelters do not allow pets inside unless they are registered as service dogs, forcing pet owners and their pets to have to stay outside and endure all kinds of weather.\n\nHowever, Machen said the clinic is collecting blankets, jackets and similar clothing to keep the homeless and their pets warm.\n\nDale Kaplan-Stein, a veterinarian and co-founder of the St. Francis House Pet Care Clinic, said she has never heard of any other place that provides this type of care for needy pets.\n\n\u201cThis is the only program that I know of in the country,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to be disproven because I would like to know there are more places where care like this is given to pets who otherwise wouldn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\n\n\nKaplan-Stein said over the past nine years, she has noticed a trend in the lack of health care education in pet owners.\n\n\u201cWhen I asked them what is the average life of their pets, dogs in this case, most of them would say three years,\u201d Kaplan-Stein said. \u201cThey were surprised to learn that dogs can live to 15 years.\u201d\n\nKaplan-Stein said this is mainly because they do not have access to professionals who can educate them on how to take care of their animals.\n\nOne of the clinic\u2019s primary goals is to educate people through counseling on the importance of nutrition, daily care, and the monthly necessities pets require.\n\nWilliams said she started coming to the St. Francis House Pet Care Clinic seven years ago. Before Mr. King, she had a dog named Laila, who she would bring into the clinic after she became unemployed. She said she is thankful for the St. Francis House Pet Care Clinic staff, who are lending a hand during a her financial difficulties.\n\n\u201cAs long as I was able to work and take care of her, I did,\u201d Williams said. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really expensive. So when you find someone that can do the same thing when you don\u2019t have your job anymore and you are disabled\u2026I am grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gets his shots, paws clipped, love and care every time he comes here. If he needs medication, they make sure he has it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis whole team here loves Mr. King, and Mr. King loves them too.\u201d\n\nSt. Francis House Pet Care Clinic provides medical care to animals every Tuesday from 10 a.m. to noon.
