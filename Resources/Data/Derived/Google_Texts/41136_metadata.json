Add more sharknados.\n\nThe third installment of Syfy\u2019s popular \u201cSharknado\u201d franchise is set to air on July 22 and director Anthony C. Ferrante tells Speakeasy that the new film will feature multiple sharknados terrorizing the east coast. Dubbed \u201cSharknado 3: Oh Hell No!,\u201d it primarily takes place in Washington D.C. and Orlando, Fla., but will incorporate a road-trip element too.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I started pitching was this whole Washington idea, which is basically \u2018White House Down\u2019 with sharks,\u201d Ferrante said, referring to the 2013 action film that starred Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx. \u201cI thought that would be fun to make sharks [the] terrorists.\u201d\n\n\u201cSharknado 3\u201d was shot in 18 days earlier this year and stars Ian Ziering as Fin and Tara Reid as April, who are once again, tasked to stave off shark-infused storms. More celebrity cameos are lined up, with Mark Cuban, Ann Coulter, Bo Derek, David Hasselhoff, and Michele Bachman slated to appear.\n\nGene Page/SyFy\n\n\u201cSharknado 2: The Second One\u201d was Syfy\u2019s biggest original movie, with 3.9 million tuning in live and dominating social media for the night \u2014 at one point, all 10 United States top trending topics on Twitter were \u201cSharknado\u201d-related.\n\nFerrante says they\u2019re trying to up the ante this time. \u201cThere\u2019s a weird child-like joy with what you can do with a \u2018Sharknado\u2019 movie,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are no rules. We don\u2019t over explain it, we don\u2019t say it\u2019s because of global warming or a scientist created it.\u201d\n\nAlong with another devastating weather pattern that causes hungry sharks to rain down from the sky, Ferrante notes that it\u2019s a \u201cdifferent\u201d type of \u201cSharknado\u201d movie, where Fin\u2019s notion of fatherhood will come to light.\n\n\u201cThe first movie was Fin\u2019s reconciling with his family,\u201d he says. \u201cThe second one is [Fin saying] \u2018I\u2019m committing to my wife again, we\u2019re going to make this work.\u2019 You\u2019re doing \u2018Sleepless in Seattle\u2019 with \u2018Sharknado.\u2019 This one is about fatherhood and parenthood \u2013 and how he deals with his son.\u201d\n\nAlong with the new film, Syfy is planning new \u201cSharknado\u201d merchandise, including a David Hasselhoff bobblehead and an \u201cArchie\u201d tie-in comic released on the same day. There\u2019s also an official \u201cSharknado\u201d soundtrack, which will feature songs from Camper Van Beethoven, YouTube star Dave Days, and Ferrante\u2019s own band Quint, who contribute two tracks: \u201c(The Ballad of) Sharknado\u201d and \u201cCrash.\u201d\n\n\u201cSharknado\u201d fans should still expect a heavy dose of campy, nonstop action. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of energy in these movies because it\u2019s an energy of desperation,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make magic happen. Some of the best stuff that\u2019s happened in these movies comes from the sense of unpredictability.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Director Anthony C.
