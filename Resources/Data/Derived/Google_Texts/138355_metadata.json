(Photo: Omar Ornelas/The Desert Sun )Buy Photo\n\nAt the foot of dusty, scrub-covered hills in Desert Hot Springs, dormitories of recovering addicts tell their stories: trinkets bearing marks for sober days, an odd photo or letter to family or friends, a serenity prayer pinned to a corkboard.\n\nA counseling office sits in the middle of the modest Ranch Recovery Center, once a saloon, that has been offering treatment to valley patients since 1972.\n\nPatients of all ages mill about the fire pit.\n\n\u201cIt provides access to a lot of men, women and families who don\u2019t have the ability to access treatment in more expensive facilities,\u201d said the facility\u2019s president and CEO Rick Mesa.\n\nBut Mesa and his staff worry that could all change with new Affordable Care Act requirements that may jeopardize funding for treatment centers with more than 16 beds. The Ranch Recovery Center currently has 46 beds; fewer would not make fiscal sense for the low-income group they serve, they said.\n\nA nonprofit, the center treats 400 to 500 patients annually and relies on donors. About 47 percent of the clients\u2019 stays are paid for through funds from Riverside County for indigent, low-income patients. And the money doesn\u2019t usually cover all of their stay, so the center ends up typically giving away about 4,000 bed days a year with no reimbursement \u2013 worth roughly $300,000.\n\n\u201cThose monies are slowly but surely going to be taken away,\u201d Mesa said. \u201cIt has a ripple effect throughout the system.\u201d\n\nThe changes date back in part to a 1965 federal statute limiting Medicaid coverage to treatment centers with more than 16 beds, part of a movement to de-institutionalize long-term psychiatric hospitals where patients were overwarehoused and drugged, experts say.\n\nThis was meant to usher in a shift toward recovery, integration and community-based services.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act, aimed at improving health access across the board, has made insurance mandatory and expanded Medi-Cal to those living below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, making about 30,000 new valley residents insurance-eligible.\n\nAlthough this theoretically could improve substance-abuse treatment, since it\u2019s an essential health benefit, some treatment facilities are also stuck with a rule that might prevent them from doing so, said David Peters, director of external affairs for the California Association of Addiction Recovery Resources.\n\nThe glitch has left treatment centers statewide in a bind, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now with substance abuse disorder treatment programs is we\u2019re in the wrong definition,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a long-term care place.\u201d\n\nMost sober-living facilities offer a maximum of 90 days of residential treatment.\n\n\u201cThis is a big problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early requirement was every treatment in program in California \u2013 if you want any money, you\u2019ve got to go get Medi-Cal certified. But then all of a sudden you can\u2019t get Medi-Cal certification if you\u2019re a residential treatment. It\u2019s a mess.\u201d\n\nThe state of California is filing a waiver to the federal government to ask for an exemption or workaround, but it is unknown yet if it will be successful.\n\nMesa said the funding shift toward Medi-Cal puts their 30-year county contracts at risk.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where this is going to go, but this is troubling,\u201d Mesa said.\n\nPatrick Kelley, 43, laughs when he\u2019s asked if he would have been able to seek treatment for a serious methamphetamine problem if it hadn\u2019t been free to him.\n\nLarry Tortes, 32, highly doubts it; he just didn\u2019t have the money.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve rolled with the punches and taken a couple bruises and seen where I came out and ended up,\u201d he said.\n\nAt Ranch Recovery, the two share a room \u2014 and stories of the cards their addictions have dealt them.\n\nKelley is in for a 90-day program, after he relapsed while on parole following decades-long stints in prison.\n\nTortes is in the last week of a 60-day program. He voluntarily checked himself in after going on another week-long alcohol binge and more than a decade of battling a drinking problem.\n\nThe son of a working-class man who worked in shipyards and boiler rooms in Long Beach, Kelley was one of 13 children and said he endured abuse \u201cat all angles.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce drugs and alcohol entered the picture it was game on for me, because it just was something I could completely feel sociable with; I could get away from the pain that was hurting me,\u201d Kelley said.\n\nBut it led to 23 years in prison and frayed relationships with two daughters he fathered along the way. They are both teenagers now.\n\n\u201cMy thing is sticking to this program, working the steps, having a sponsor and trying to be responsible and show (my daughter) that drugs and alcohol are not important to me\u2026 (not as much) as trying to be in the capacity of her life as a loving figure and hopefully one day father figure,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully some day she\u2019ll see me as that.\u201d\n\nKelley has been taking anger management classes, turning to faith, experimenting with cognitive behavior therapy and trying to face his demons head-on. He still has urges to use \u2013 but that\u2019s why he\u2019s staying put in treatment and is learning to \u201cbabysit\u201d his feelings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been working,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s kept me clean, out of jail, away from crime \u2014 bringing about change, positive change.\u201d\n\nTortes, a member of the Torres-Martinez tribe based in Thermal, wonders if his drinking habit is genetic. He said his mother died at age 47 from alcohol-related illnesses. Other relatives also used alcohol, heroin, meth.\n\nHe started drinking around age 15 and was arrested for alcohol at 17. By his early 20s he was using continuously.\n\n\u201cIt was just something that grasped ahold of me,\u201d Tortes said. \u201cI cant really pinpoint why \u2013 if it\u2019s guilt, shame or trying to take away certain things of growing up poor, resentments as we learn in the program towards people.\u201d\n\nHe went in and out of jail. This is his first time in residential rehab.\n\n\u201cMy life was just a big problem, but I\u2019ve heard once every problem is an opportunity in disguise,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve got to use all that to build myself to a better tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHe finds hope remembering his children and family members who are still there for him and believe in him despite his problems.\n\nMesa said that it could be anywhere from six months to a year and a half until the funding changes take place, depending on the waiver.\n\nBut he worries that if they lose money to care for everyone, patients like Torres or Kelley could lose their chance at sobriety, hope and direction in life.\n\n\u201cBottom line is we\u2019re going to be cutting a lot of services when those effects come into play,\u201d he said.\n\nDesert Sun Healthcare Reporter Victoria Pelham can be reached at (760) 778-4649, Victoria.Pelham@desertsun.com and on Twitter @vpelham.\n\nServices at Ranch Recovery Center\n\n\u2022 Detoxification\n\n\u2022 Primary treatment: 12-step programs, individualized treatment planning, group and individual counseling, alcohol and drug education services, recreational services, social activities and tasks such as gardening, peer involvement, referrals\n\n\u2022 Transitional/sober living\n\n\u2022 Aftercare and extended care\n\nIf you need help for substance abuse\n\n\u2022 Ranch Recovery Center: 800-955-2924, ranchrecovery.org\n\n\u2022 Toll-free Drug Abuse Helpline from the Coalition against Drug Abuse, open at all times: (888) 858-6629\n\n\u2022 Alcoholics Anonymous in the Coachella Valley: www.aainthedesert.org, (760) 324-4880\n\n\u2022 Alcoholics Anonymous for LGBT Coachella Valley residents: www.gayaainthedesert.org\n\n\u2022 ABC Recovery Center, Indio: 760-342-6616\n\n\u2022 Betty Ford Center, Rancho Mirage: 888-739-0781\n\n\u2022 Michael's House, Palm Springs: 877-345-8494\n\n\u2022 Narcotics Anonymous in the Coachella Valley local helpline: (760)346-5800, (800) 834-9303\n\n\u2022 Soroptomist House of Hope, Desert Hot Springs: 760-329-4673\n\nRead or Share this story: http://desert.sn/1jQWxkv", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A nonprofit, the center treats 400 to 500 patients annually and relies on donors.
