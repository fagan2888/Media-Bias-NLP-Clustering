Jenice May\u2019s Aurora seat was so safe they put her in charge of a program to elect caucus members, but she\u2019s losing by 110 votes.\n\n\u201cI got caught in the wave,\u201d she said, referring to a strong Republican ground game that took Democrats by surprise.\n\nMay has not conceded yet to Republican JoAnn Windholz because the Adams County clerk and recorder is still \u201ccuring\u201d ballots in House District 30. That includes calling voters who forgot to sign their ballots, or whose signature on the ballot didn\u2019t match the signature on file. Still, 110 ballots is a tough hurdle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the representative in limbo,\u201d May said, Sunday.\n\nShe\u2019s not alone.\n\nRep. Mike McLachlan of Durango is trailing sheep rancher J. Paul Brown, the Republican he unseated two years by 917 votes in a Democratic wave year. McLachlan has a much more difficult gap to close than May \u2014 he\u2019s behind by 206 votes \u2014 but he said he\u2019s taking a wait-and-see attitude. He also hasn\u2019t conceded.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to ride out the storm,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m prepared for whatever happens.\u201d\n\nDemocrats always knew that defending McLachlan would be tough. After he voted for tougher gun laws in 2013, his constituents tried to recall him but couldn\u2019t collect enough signatures to force a special election. They vowed to get him at the election.\n\nA third Democrat, Rep. Tony Exum of Colorado Springs, has already conceded the race. Two years ago Exum unseated Republican Mark Barker by 3,455 votes. Democrats initially thought he might be OK this year until El Paso County Republicans started returning their ballots in record numbers. Exum lost to Republican Kit Roupe by 294 votes.\n\nWhen results started pouring in Tuesday night, Democrats were shocked to see several representatives in Adams and Arapahoe counties in trouble. A low turnout from Democrats, combined with a strong ground game from Republican Congressman Mike Coffman and Senate hopeful Cory Gardner, was producing results few expected \u2014 except former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb. He said when he examined precinct results the week before the election he made calls. He told some lawmakers who had assumed they were safe to quit campaigning for others and start campaigning for themselves.\n\nDemocrats never dreamt May would be in trouble. Two years ago, she won her first House race by 3,870 votes. She was appointed to the powerful Joint Budget Committee and her experience as a former human services employee gives her an insider\u2019s knowledge of state government. She was assigned to chair the House Majority Project, which helps elects Democrats to the chamber.\n\n\u201cIf I happen to lose because I focused on that, then I\u2019m OK with that,\u201d May said, adding she\u2019s proud Democrats were strong against \u201cthe wave.\u201d\n\nNo matter what happens, she\u2019s still the representative for House District 30 and will be doing her duties until next January, when the new session convenes and lawmakers are sworn in. She has a budget meeting Wednesday.\n\nIt\u2019s all pretty heady for Windholz, a Commerce City businesswoman who was told by some movers-and-shakers \u201cwe\u2019d like to support you more but\u201d as in but May is going to win. She said she and her supporters didn\u2019t see May much on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just so glad the county is 99.9 percent done with its counting,\u201d Windholz said.\n\nDemocrats currently have a 37-28 majority. Even if May and McLachlan lose, Democrats will maintain the majority for the next two years.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cory Gardner,gun recalls,Jenise May,Mark Ferrandino,Mike Coffman,Mike McLachlan,Tony Exum,Wellington Webb", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Two Colorado House Democrats who are trailing in close races are waiting for final ballot counts to see whether they prevailed.", "title": "Two Colorado House Democrats in limbo", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/09/guns-gop-turnout-doom-three-colorado-house-democrats/115082/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/11/MarkFerrandino.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Two Colorado House Democrats who are trailing in close races are waiting for final ballot counts to see whether they prevailed.", "title": "Two Colorado House Democrats in limbo as they wait for final vote counts", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/11/09/guns-gop-turnout-doom-three-colorado-house-democrats/115082/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/11/MarkFerrandino.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Two Colorado House Democrats who are trailing in close races are waiting for final ballot counts to see whether they prevailed."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a70\"", "article_summary": "Colorado House Democrats thought Rep.
