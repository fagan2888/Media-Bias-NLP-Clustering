We are going to do something so good and so fast and so strong and the world has got to respect us again believe me. Okay. We're going to do. Do we love our country. Do we love America. I think one of the things that really caught on it's very important self funding my campaign every. Body on both sides. And yet I was saying two weeks ago I said. Don't think people really appreciated. As I see all of that money being poured into commercials and it's not their money it's special interest money and kisses on both sides on the Republican side the Democrats at. Money just pouring into commercials. Special engines it's obvious he's of people that don't necessarily love our country they don't have the best interest of our country at heart. We're not gonna let it happened we can't we have to do something about it when you see when you see the kinds of deals made in our country. A lot of those deals of Nate because. The politicians aren't supposed to. Yeah and making them the air benefit. We have to stop it. We have to stop it we are now going to make it to your benefit with going to make the deals with the American people that's the way. I I. Now. Very. I love this look at you. Look do.

For the people of New Hampshire where you have a tremendous problem with heroin and drugs you wouldn't even believe that you see this place is it's so beautiful have a tremendous problem. The first thing always that they mentioned to me mr. trump pleased and something. The drugs the heroin it's pouring in and it's so cheap. Because there's so much of it.
