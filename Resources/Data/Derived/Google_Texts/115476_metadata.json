By mid-century, the lack of space made it harder to outrun the bulls, so they began to die much earlier in the route, beyond Hotel La Perla, and most just before the bulls made their 90-degree turn onto Calle Estafeta.\n\nI was there in Pamplona, standing on the balcony of the piso near this precarious juncture. It was 8 a.m.; the stone streets were shiny with rain. There was a wood barricade, like an outfield wall, that unnaturally ended Calle Mercaderes and forced the route right onto Estafeta. This is where I saw the first bulls slip, losing their footing at the turn, their bulk hitting the stones, their tonnage pounding into the barricade, the runners fleeing to the sidewalks, some, in fetal curls, waiting for death.\n\nThis was how the last American was killed in Pamplona, along this narrow corridor that offers no escape from the charging bulls. That morning, his killer, \u201cCastellano,\u201d had begun to run the 826 meters from the Cuesta de Santo Domingo to the Plaza de Toros at an unusually torrid pace, which frightened the runners and sent them scurrying. One of them fell. Castellano plunged his horns into the limp American on the ground, goring his stomach and piercing through to his aortic vein. He began to crawl. But there were still more bulls in the stampede, and by the time the Red Cross unit got to Matthew Tassio, most of the blood had already drained from his body. He was dead just eight minutes after he finally reached the hospital. Tassio\u2019s was the 14th death in the recorded history of San Ferm\u00edn \u2014 the festival most famous for hosting the annual \u201cRunning of the Bulls\u201d \u2014 and the last American to die there. One other has perished since, in 2003, and many others have been badly damaged by the bulls, but perhaps none have died as gruesomely as the American did in 1995. I wasn\u2019t in attendance for that run, thankfully. In a year in which there would be no deaths, I came to Pamplona for the second time by bus from Madrid, passing through the sunflowers of Basque country. I had been invited by the correspondents of the Associated Press, with whom Dow Jones Newswire, my former employer, shared its local outpost to witness the Running of the Bulls from their prized perch. That morning\u2019s encierra would be the first of the new millennium. It was very wet and, even from the balcony, you could see the unevenness in the cobblestones. The only place to witness the run was from the balconies of the apartments along the route. When the bulls began to stampede, the runners, many still drunk and wearing all white save for a red pa\u00f1uelico around their necks, filled all of the space in the corridors. It was a jogging gait until they saw the bulls. Most of them ran well ahead of the danger, but some were eventually chased down by the bulls.\n\nI remember an American student who slipped nearly died on the curb by the cigarette shop on Estafeta, trampled, blood maroon in the grooves of the cobblestones, a small crowd coagulating around him to watch for death.\n\nI remember the dense crowds, the public drunkenness, the street drink that kept you drunk and alert made from equal parts Coca-Cola and red wine. And, of course, I remember the monumental visage of Ernest Hemingway that hung down the side of the Hotel La Perla, where he set the novel that first recorded this mad dash from mortality.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is not an overstatement to claim that Ernest Hemingway introduced Pamplona to the world. Until he first wrote about it in 1923 in an article for The Toronto Star Weekly, the San Ferm\u00edn festival had been a regional affair: \u201cAs far as I know we were the only English speaking people in Pamplona during the Feria of last year,\u201d writes Hemingway. \u201cWe landed at Pamplona at night. The streets were solid with people dancing. Music was pounding and throbbing. Fireworks were being set off from the big public square. All the carnivals I had ever seen paled down in comparison.\u201d\n\nThis Toronto Star sketch of Pamplona comes from the appendix of new edition of \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d released last week by Scribner\u2019s to commemorate the 90th anniversary of its publication. The \u201cupdated\u201d version will titillate Hemingway aficionados: unpublished early drafts, excised scenes and two deleted opening chapters. This \u201cnew\u201d material provides a rare glimpse into the evolution and creative process of one of the great masters of American literature.\n\nDrafted over six weeks across Spain (mostly in Valencia and Madrid) in the summer of 1925, set in Jazz Age Paris amid the psychic ruins of the Great War, \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d endures as one of the finest first novels ever written. Its itinerant narrative of Spain and France (they were largely unknowns to the American traveling public in 1925, but more on that later), depictions of caf\u00e9 life and drinking, bullfighting and affairs with matadors, were all new to novels of the time. \u201cNo amount of analysis can convey the quality of \u2018The Sun Also Rises,\u2019\u201d went the original review of the book in The New York Times in 1926. \u201cIt is a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.\u201d\n\nHemingway chose to evoke disillusionment through Jack Barnes, an expatriated American foreign correspondent living in Paris, and his married paramour, Lady Brett Ashley. Their romance is complicated, to say the least: Jake\u2019s manhood was marred in the war and he cannot procreate (in his famous interview with The Paris Review in the 1950s, Hemingway was adamant that Jake was not a eunuch). The war injury was a crucial detail in the text, and an emblematic signature of the Hemingway code that ran through his subsequent work. His male characters bore physical or psychic wounds (sometimes both). Jake\u2019s injury was an outward symptom of an interior crisis suffered in the wake of WWI.\n\nHemingway\u2019s genius was present in Jake and Lady Brett as protagonists and antagonists. We inflict our own wounds, Hemingway seems to say, an insight that bears out even today: Contemporary disillusionment is concerned with the surprising, man-made ironies of modernity \u2014 a dwindling sense of freedom, both existential and civil; the West\u2019s waning hegemony even amid unparalleled wealth and technology; a diminished middle class and shrinking American dream; and an ever present sense of looming doom (an attack of some kind, perhaps) by forces beyond our control. The Lost Generation time of \u201cThe Sun\u201d was infected with its own disillusionment, owing to man-made origins from the tragic period of 1914\u20131918. This disillusion plays out in \u201cThe Sun\u201d almost nihilistically; by the novel\u2019s end, both characters are badly damaged by the preceding events, degraded, alienated.\n\n* * *\n\nThe two opening chapters, cut by Hemingway but offered to readers in the new edition, were fortunate omissions. The original opening lines of \u201cThe Sun\u201d sound an awkward, conversational, and Victorian tone, inconsistent with the remainder of the novel:", "article_metadata": {"description": "As a young man in Europe, I immersed myself in the work of a master.
