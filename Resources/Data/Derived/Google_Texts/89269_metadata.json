But you have those years. It happens,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to this offseason conditioning and getting ready for next year, to be as healthy as I can and stay that way.\u201d\n\nThe defensive end was listed as doubtful for Sunday\u2019s season finale against his former team, the Dallas Cowboys, with an unspecified right knee injury. But in the way he spoke about his injury, it was immediately evident that his season would be over.\n\nThe Redskins made it official Saturday, placing Hatcher on injured reserve and signing defensive tackle Travian Robertson from Seattle\u2019s practice squad. The move marks the end of the 32-year-old\u2019s disappointing first season in Washington.\n\nHatcher, who had missed the Redskins\u2018 past two games, said he is disappointed that his knee hasn\u2019t improved as quickly as expected. Coach Jay Gruden echoed that disappointment while explaining why the team didn\u2019t put Hatcher on injured reserve earlier in the season.\n\n\u201cWe thought there was a chance [he\u2019d return],\u201d Gruden said this week, before Hatcher\u2019s move to IR had been announced. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t progressed like we thought it would. It was the type of injury that didn\u2019t really need surgery, we didn\u2019t think. So we thought maybe the swelling or the soreness would be something he could play with, but obviously it hasn\u2019t as of yet.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins signed Hatcher to a four-year, $27.5 million contract in the offseason with hopes that he would be a dominant interior pass-rusher to complement outside linebackers Brian Orakpo and Ryan Kerrigan. But the longtime Cowboy was limited in training camp after having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, and he continued to struggle with injuries all season.\n\nHatcher recorded only 5 1/2 sacks this year, with nearly half of that total coming in a Week 2 blowout of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n\u201cEarly on, I think when we had everybody healthy, I think he was doing a good job obviously,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cBut I think overall for anybody to say that we were completely pleased with coaching performances or player performances would be a little over-exaggerated. But I think Hatcher came in here, he\u2019s a great guy who works hard and I really appreciate what he brought to this team not only from the football player standpoint but from a person standpoint. So moving forward, I\u2019m glad he\u2019s on our team.\u201d\n\nThough Hatcher was unable to play late in the year, he continued to watch practice from the sidelines and help out the team in any way possible. \u201cI\u2019ve just been more of a coach these last couple weeks,\u201d he explained.\n\nWhile Hatcher\u2019s first season in Washington didn\u2019t go as planned, he is already looking forward to next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things, you get a little ding early in the season, you ain\u2019t able to rest it and then stuff started piling up from then on,\u201d Hatcher said. \u201cBut it\u2019s just one of those things I grind through. It\u2019s just a learning process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Redskins finally placed Hatcher on injured reserve Saturday, marking the end of a frustrating and injury-plagued first year in Washington.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Redskins finally placed Hatcher on injured reserve Saturday, marking the end of a frustrating and injury-plagued first year in Washington.", "title": "Jason Hatcher\u2019s first season with the Redskins reaches disappointing end", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/27/jason-hatchers-first-season-redskins-nears-disappo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/11/redskins_20140611_004.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/11/redskins_20140611_004.jpg", "description": "The Redskins finally placed Hatcher on injured reserve Saturday, marking the end of a frustrating and injury-plagued first year in Washington.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jason Hatcher\u2019s first season with the Redskins reaches disappoin"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jason Hatcher, Washington Redskins"}, "article_summary": "Sitting in front of his locker Friday afternoon, Jason Hatcher was asked to summarize his injury-plagued first season with the Washington Redskins.\nCoach Jay Gruden echoed that disappointment while explaining why the team didn\u2019t put Hatcher on injured reserve earlier in the season.\nIt was the type of injury that didn\u2019t really need surgery, we didn\u2019t think.\nWhile Hatcher\u2019s first season in Washington didn\u2019t go as planned, he is already looking forward to next year.\nThe move marks the end of the 32-year-old\u2019s disappointing first season in Washington."}
