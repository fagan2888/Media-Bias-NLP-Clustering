REUTERS/Joe Skipper\n\n3981103\n\nWomen and Democrats are now turning on Obamacare, which is more unpopular than ever according to a new Kaiser Health Tracking Poll.\n\nThe poll, which was released Friday, found that just 33 percent had a favorable opinion of the president\u2019s signature health-care law. Forty nine percent have an unfavorable view of Obamacare, which has been plagued with serious problems since it went into effect last month.\n\nThe poll notes that the 16-point gap between favorable and unfavorable has only been seen once before. That was in October 2011, when the law received a lot of \u201cnegative attention in the Republican presidential primaries and the country was focused on the upcoming election and the Occupy Wall Street movement.\u201d\n\nIn Oct. 2011, 34 percent had a favorable view of the law and 51 percent had an unfavorable view.\n\nAnd while views of Obamacare trended negative in November among most demographic groups, Kaiser notes that the greatest drop in favorability occurred among Democrats \u2014 with 55 percent viewing the law favorably, compared to 70 percent a month earlier.\n\nWomen also polled more negatively on the law, with 48 percent of women saying they viewed the law unfavorably, compared to 32 percent seeing it favorably. According to Kaiser, for the first time in its poll, \u201cthe share of women with an unfavorable view outnumbered those with a favorable view by a large margin.\u201d\n\nThe downward polling trend comes as millions of Americans have received cancellation notices from their insurance provider due to Obamacare and the central Obamacare website continues to grapple with problems.\n\n\u201cThis negative shift in opinion comes amid heavy news coverage of the website problems plaguing the law\u2019s online health insurance exchanges and stories about individuals being dropped from their insurance coverage because their plans don\u2019t meet minimum requirements set by the ACA, stories that were followed closely by more than half the American public this month,\u201d the Kaiser poll notes.\n\nThe poll was conducted from Nov. 13-18 among 1,204 adults nationwide and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "Obamacare is at its lowest favorability since it became law --- with favorability among women and Democrats trending more negatively, according to a new Kaiser", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Women and Democrats are now turning on Obamacare, which is more unpopular than ever according to a new Kaiser Health Tracking Poll.
