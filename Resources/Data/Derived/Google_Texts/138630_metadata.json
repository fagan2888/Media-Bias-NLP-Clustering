Longstanding payment structures in healthcare organizations were hinged to incentives for physicians, hospitals and other care providers to deliver more services to patients. Research now suggests that more services and higher expenses do not guarantee better patient outcomes.\n\nThis factor along with others is propelling hospitals to a value-driven healthcare model. Piloting the change is the CFO, determining the optimum resource allocation, depending on current income flows and future needs.\n\n[See also: Reforecast: Organizational culture key to successful hospital mergers.]\n\nMany CFOs are pulling back on construction plans for more patient beds, instead investing dollars in data analytics, promoting more outpatient services and, as Warren Forgey, CFO and executive vice president of fiscal services and business development at the Schneck Medical Center puts it, \u201credoubling our efforts on the basics.\u201d\n\nThese changes are still in their infancy, but they paint a picture of tomorrow\u2019s reconfigured hospital environment, one that is focused not just on getting patients healthy but also getting them out the door. \u201cPhysicians are key in this transformation, but so are patients and their employers,\u201d Forgey says. \u201cToday\u2019s clinically integrated network of healthcare is a coordinated effort involving the hospital, local physicians, long-term care facilities, and so on. This system must be efficient and navigable for both patients and their employers.\u201d\n\nCompanies footing much of the bill for their employees\u2019 healthcare \u201care absolutely concerned about the cost and how this expense affects their own profitability and the price of the products and services they sell,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re the healthcare experts and have to help them find solutions.\u201d\n\nReallocating capital\n\nAs the shift to a system that rewards quality of care progresses, it compels many CFOs already running a tight fiscal ship to pinch each penny. \u201cWe\u2019re already a pretty disciplined operation,\u201d says Brian Walton, CFO and vice president at BSA Health System in Amarillo, Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we buy another MRI just to have one more. We\u2019re always checking to see we\u2019re getting as many time slots out of it as we can.\u201d\n\nSuch frugality will be needed as shorter patient stays become the norm. \u201cWhen we end up in that position of paying for outcomes and value versus volume, we\u2019ll probably have some assets that will ultimately become idle,\u201d he says. \u201cConsequently, we are backing off, from a capital perspective, at the main hospital. We have no plans to add a fourth or fifth MRI or more space for other diagnostic procedures.\u201d\n\nRather, capital is being allocated towards acquisitions of physician practices and outpatient locations in the regional market. \u201cThe key to success in the future is to have a solid footprint to ensure a reasonable amount of access points, without having to invest heavily on the inpatient side,\u201d Walton explains.\n\n[See also: Reforecast: New business models for hospitals buying medical practices.]\n\nIn building this geography, BSA seeks to have relationships with the \u201cright number\u201d of high quality physicians in each high demand specialty, he says. This objective compelled the hospital last year, for example, to acquire an ENT (ears, nose and throat) specialty practice.\n\nSchneck Medical Center faces different pressures, in that the Seymour, Indiana-based hospital not long ago completed a mass facility expansion project that increased its overall physical space by 30 percent. The organization originally occupied only 20 percent of this additional space, with the remaining 80 percent designated as flexible space to accommodate new and changing services. This space now is largely being occupied by outpatient facilities. \u201cIt turned out to have been a very strategically sound move for us,\u201d Forgey says.\n\nApproximately 70 percent of the additional space is set for outpatient needs. Walton says the hospital has no near-term brick and mortar plans. \u201cWith the exception of IT, our capital spending is less now than it has been in many years,\u201d the CFO notes.\n\nTechnology Triumphs\n\nBoth hospitals have increased the dollars invested in IT initiatives, which has become a larger percentage of overall capital allocations. Schneck Medical Center, for instance, is partnering with its physicians to make population health management\u2014the outcomes of a group of patients\u2014a reality. \u201cThe physicians are key to any transactions we make towards developing clinically integrated networks of providers to manage patient health across this spectrum,\u201d he explains. \u201cHaving that IT infrastructure in place to accommodate this new type of system is where we\u2019re putting a lot of our IT dollars now.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cBy managing chronic conditions and focusing on preventive care, we can build a cohesive system that is less costly and more efficient.\u201d\n\nAs part of this initiative, the hospital is investing in the design and development of a clinical registry system for patient data. The system would compile data from the hospital and individual physician practices and then integrate the results to track health outcome patterns down to the specific patient level. The overarching goal is to move the hospital closer to the day when more personalized patient care is the norm. \u201cYou do that and you can successfully reduce the possibility of patient readmissions,\u201d Forgey says.\n\nWalton agrees there are significant financial returns from investments in technology. \u201cWe\u2019ve been spending upwards of $5 million a year on upgrading our IT infrastructure and systems to implement electronic health records come this October,\u201d he says. \u201cWould we be investing this money if we didn\u2019t have to? Probably not in the short-term, but eventually I would think. The race to `meaningful use\u2019 deadlines has meant more upfront capital expenditures when we would have rather drawn them out over a longer timetable.\u201d\n\nWhile these financial demands take a toll on other capital spending objectives, Walton says it has not stopped needed investments like a substantial upgrade of the hospital\u2019s emergency room. Just in time, too. \u201cChances are a lot of newly-covered people with insurance still won\u2019t have access to primary care and will come to the ER instead,\u201d Forgey says. \u201cWe\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/reevaluating-capital-spending-strategies", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare-reevaluating-spending.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "As healthcare reimbursement shifts from a system that rewards quantity of care to quality of care, the onus is on the CFO to determine where best to allocate financial resources and how best to pare them.", "title": "Reevaluating capital spending strategies"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/healthcare-reevaluating-spending.jpg"}, "description": "As healthcare reimbursement shifts from a system that rewards quantity of care to quality of care, the onus is on the CFO to determine where best to allocate financial resources and how best to pare them.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Reevaluating capital spending strategies"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As healthcare reimbursement shifts from a system that rewards quantity of care to quality of care, the onus is on the CFO to determine where best to allocate financial resources and how best to pare them.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWith the exception of IT, our capital spending is less now than it has been in many years,\u201d the CFO notes.\nThe overarching goal is to move the hospital closer to the day when more personalized patient care is the norm.\nLongstanding payment structures in healthcare organizations were hinged to incentives for physicians, hospitals and other care providers to deliver more services to patients.\nTechnology TriumphsBoth hospitals have increased the dollars invested in IT initiatives, which has become a larger percentage of overall capital allocations.\n\u201cToday\u2019s clinically integrated network of healthcare is a coordinated effort involving the hospital, local physicians, long-term care facilities, and so on."}
