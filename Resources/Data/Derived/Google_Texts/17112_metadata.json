But ever since Mitt Romney lost last November, most of the genuine policy innovation on the right has come from the party\u2019s populist, Tea Party-affiliated wing. The key figure has been Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, whose antiwar conservatism has kicked off a post-Iraq foreign policy debate that the party desperately needed, and whose forays into issues like sentencing reform and drug policy have raised the possibility of a national Republican Party that\u2019s smart as well as tough on crime.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t just been Paul turning populism into policy. This spring, Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, nobody\u2019s idea of a moderate, became the Republican face of a financial reform effort aimed at addressing the problem of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks. And then just last week, Paul\u2019s frequent ally Mike Lee, the junior senator from Utah, took the floor at the American Enterprise Institute to offer a tax-reform proposal that would actually help middle-class families rather than mostly cut taxes on the investor class.\n\nThe Lee proposal is a particularly noteworthy breakthrough. Its centerpiece, a large expansion of the child tax credit, is an example of how social conservatism could seek to assist families instead of just lecturing them \u2014 by addressing the rising cost of child rearing, the stress wage stagnation puts on parents, and the link between family instability and socioeconomic disarray. This makes it the first major Republican tax proposal in years that actually seems tailored to contemporary challenges rather than to the economic climate of 1979.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut despite the best efforts of the Lee tax plan\u2019s admirers, the party\u2019s populists didn\u2019t make headlines last week on that issue. Instead, Lee and Paul were in the news \u2014 with the ubiquitous, less innovative junior senator from Texas, Ted Cruz \u2014 because they\u2019re part of the so-called \u201cdefund Obamacare\u201d effort, an elaborate game of make-believe in which Republicans are supposed to pretend, for the sake of political leverage, that they\u2019ll actually shut down the government if the president refuses to go along with the repeal of his own signature legislative achievement. (How Republicans gain leverage by threatening a shutdown they\u2019d be blamed for has never been adequately explained.)\n\nExcept that the game isn\u2019t make-believe to the many conservative voters who have been suckered into actually believing that the health care law could be rolled back tomorrow if only Republicans would just stop \u201csurrendering\u201d and use the power of True Conservatism to bend the White House to their will. This is what makes the defund movement\u2019s style of populism so depressing: In addition to throwing sand into the gears of government for no clear purpose, it\u2019s effectively deceiving precisely the voters that it claims to represent.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHence the widespread view \u2014 shared by concerned liberals, chin-stroking moderates, and many Congressional Republicans, I\u2019m sure \u2014 that Cruz and Paul and Lee and their compatriots need to be crushed for the Republican Party to become effective and responsible again.\n\nBut the trouble is that if John Boehner and Mitch McConnell could somehow crush the populists (and they can\u2019t), they would also be crushing the best hope for conservative policy reform. That\u2019s because, for now at least, the same incentives that shape the \u201cbad populism\u201d of the defund movement are also shaping the \u201cgood populism\u201d that wants to end farm subsidies or reform drug sentencing or break up banks or cut taxes on families.\n\nTheir willingness to engage in theatrical confrontations with President Obama, for instance, is part of what lends figures like Paul and Lee and Vitter the credibility to experiment with ideas from outside the Reagan-era box. And their arm\u2019s-length relationship to Wall Street and K Street makes them both more irresponsible on issues like a government shutdown and more open to new ideas on taxes, financial reform, corporate welfare, etc.\n\nObviously Republicans should be seeking a way to have the good without the bad: the innovation without the risky brinkmanship, the fresh ideas without the staged confrontations.\n\nBut for now, they\u2019re stuck dealing with a populism that resembles Homer Simpson\u2019s description of his beloved beer: It\u2019s both the cause of, and the solution to, all of their problems.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20130921143009, "twitter": {"description": "The most innovative ideas in the Republican Party are coming from the same contingent
