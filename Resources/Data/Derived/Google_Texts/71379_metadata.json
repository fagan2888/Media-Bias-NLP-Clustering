The video that appears on YouTube mimics Neves' video that went viral by starting off with her wrapped in a gray blanket while in bed, but instead of revealing the Brazilian girl in the room Cyrus, 20, decides to flash the camera her infamous tongue wagging expression.\n\nCyrus, the singer who has been the face of controversy in light of her suggestive performances, previously spoke about the image of her 19-year-old fellow entertainer Bieber. The 20-year-old singer, covered Rolling Stone magazine earlier this year where she spoke serving as a mentor to Bieber.\n\n\"I'm not much older than him, so I never want it to feel like I'm mentoring him. But I do mentor him in a way,\" Cyrus told the publication. \"Because I've been doing this (expletive) for a long time, and I already transitioned, and I don't think he's quite done it yet. He's trying really hard.\"\n\nHowever, Cyrus also spoke about warning the 19-year-old Canadian crooner about certain pitfalls that could be caused by his behavior.\n\n\"People don't take him seriously, but he really can play the drums, he really can play guitar, he really can sing. I just don't want to see him (expletive) that up, to where people think he's Vanilla Ice,\" Cyrus told Rolling Stone. \"I tell him that. Like, 'You don't want to become a joke. When you go out, don't start (expletive). Don't come in shirtless.'\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Miley Cyrus may be making fun of her good friend Justin Bieber in a video mimicking his now popularly leaked video sleeping in a bed with a Brazilian girl in his room during the South American stop of his \"Believe\" tour.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Miley Cyrus Parodies Justin Bieber's Alleged Brazilian Tryst?", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "Miley Cyrus may be making fun of her good friend Justin Bieber in a video mimicking his now popularly leaked video sleeping in a bed with a Brazilian girl in his room during the South American stop of his \"Believe\" tour.", "author": "Christine Thomasos", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/miley-cyrus-parodies-justin-biebers-alleged-brazilian-tryst-108904/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/66560/miley-cyrus.jpg", "title": "Miley Cyrus Parodies Justin Bieber's Alleged Brazilian Tryst?", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/66560/miley-cyrus.jpg", "title": "Miley Cyrus Parodies Justin Bieber's Alleged Brazilian Tryst?", "description": "Miley Cyrus may be making fun of her good friend Justin Bieber in a video mimicking his now popularly leaked video sleeping in a bed with a Brazilian girl in his room during the South American stop of his \"Believe\" tour.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/miley-cyrus-parodies-justin-biebers-alleged-brazilian-tryst-108904/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Miley&20Cyrus,Cyrus,Miley,Justin&20Bieber,Bieber,Justin,,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2013-11-16T16:50:24-05:00", "modDate": "2013-11-16T16:50:24-05:00"}, "Keywords": "Miley Cyrus, Cyrus, Miley, Justin Bieber, Bieber, Justin,,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddadb\"", "article_summary": "However, Cyrus also spoke about warning the 19-year-old Canadian crooner about certain pitfalls that could be caused by his behavior.\nI just don't want to see him (expletive) that up, to where people think he's Vanilla Ice,\" Cyrus told Rolling Stone.\nCyrus recently appeared in a spoof of the video filmed by Tati Neves, the Brazilian girl who attempted to expose Bieber as her companion by filming him sleeping in an intimate setting.\n\"People don't take him seriously, but he really can play the drums, he really can play guitar, he really can sing.\n\"Because I've been doing this (expletive) for a long time, and I already transitioned, and I don't think he's quite done it yet."}
