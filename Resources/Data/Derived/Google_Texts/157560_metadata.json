I see our guys playing hard. I see our guys fighting.\n\n\u201cI see our guys fighting through adversity. And I see it in an environment going on the road, where I don\u2019t think we ever would have been in that game.\n\n\u201cThose are the things you can see, and when you watch it on video, you can see the effort. You can see it and you can feel the energy.\n\n\u201cYeah, you can be disappointed (in the 0-2 record); You should be,\u201d he added. \u201cDiscouraged, no. Disappointed, yes. Disappointment deals with the expectations. The discouraged part, when you get discouraged that sinks into your confidence, and there\u2019s no reason for our confidence to take a hit.\n\n\u201cIt should take a bruise, but \u2026 and the disappointment is we\u2019re sitting here 0-2 and have a possibility of being 2-0. I take responsibility for that. I\u2019m OK with that, because I\u2019m at peace knowing where we are and what we\u2019ve built. Disappointed, absolutely. Discouraged?
