Photo: Associated Press\n\nAetna Inc. expects to continue selling Affordable Care Act exchange plans in 15 states, and the insurer said it may expand into new areas.\n\nThe announcement adds to the mixed picture that the industry has been providing about companies\u2019 willingness to stick it out on the exchanges, which have generated red ink for many insurers.\n\nInsurers\u2019 moves on the exchanges are being closely watched after UnitedHealth Group Inc. said last month that it would withdraw from all but a handful of the 34 states where it is offering the marketplace plans, amid continued losses. Humana Inc., which is also expecting losses this year on its exchange business, has said it would likely withdraw from some exchanges.\n\nBut other big insurers have struck a guardedly optimistic tone. Anthem Inc. expects to make a narrow profit on ACA marketplace plans this year, though short of its target margins, and Aetna itself earlier said it continues to expect to break even on the exchanges in 2016.\n\nAetna Chief Executive Mark T. Bertolini told analysts during the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call that Aetna still saw its position in the ACA marketplaces as a \u201cgood investment.\u201d But he also made pointed comments about the need for changes to the law to ensure a sustainable business. Aetna is currently seeking to acquire Humana, a deal that is under review by Justice Department antitrust regulators.\n\nSome Medicaid-focused insurers, such as Centene Corp., have been profitable on the exchanges, and analysts think they could expand their presence. Cigna Corp. has said it plans to expand to a few more states from the seven where it currently sells exchange plans.\n\nHowever, many insurers that are sticking with the exchanges are expected to seek significant rate increases for next year as they try to boost lagging results.\n\nAetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said the company has submitted proposed rates to regulators in all of its existing exchange states for plans to be offered next year. The insurer has \u201cno plans at this point to withdraw from any of those states,\u201d he said. In making its regulatory filings, he said, the insurer has also \u201cpreserved our options to enter certain new geographies pending careful evaluation of marketplace conditions.\u201d\n\nAt least one state regulator, in Oklahoma, said it already had been informed that Aetna planned to begin selling exchange plans there in 2017.\n\nHowever, Aetna emphasized that its exchange footprint wouldn\u2019t be finalized until September, when insurers sign binding agreements to offer plans. Mr. Crawford said the company has \u201cnot made any final decisions on where we might enter new Affordable Care Act states.\u201d\n\nAetna said on its first-quarter earnings call that enrollment in its individual plans grew more than it expected, to about 1.2 million, an increase of about 200,000 from the end of last year. The company said 911,000 of those people signed up through the ACA marketplaces.\n\nAetna had previously said it aimed to break even on ACA plans this year, while targeting profits in future years. The company said during the first-quarter call that it thought it was on a path to achieve its 2016 goal, but warned that it had \u201clow visibility\u201d at this point in the year.\n\nWrite to Anna
