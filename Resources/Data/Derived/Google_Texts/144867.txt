“Parkland’s certified application counselors are trained to assist people interested in applying for Marketplace coverage,” said Bob Reed, Vice President, Patient Access, in a statement. “We extended our hours at the hospital in order to help those who may have delayed enrolling or who may have questions about the Marketplace.”
