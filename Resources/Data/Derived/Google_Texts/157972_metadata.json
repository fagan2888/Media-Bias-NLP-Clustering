The debate was hosted by Americans for Prosperity \u2013 Iowa, National Review and The Des Moines Register. The debate was moderated by Americans for Prosperity Vice President Derrick Sontag, Kathie Obradovich of The Des Moines Register and Robert Costa of National Review questioned the candidates. The debate was solely focused on the economy with a total of five questions asked. The candidates: Sam Clovis, Paul Lunde, Joni Ernst, David Young, Matt Whitaker and Scott Schaben were given two minutes for opening statements and for closing statements. Answers were also supposed to be limited to two minutes as well.\n\nThere were no exchanges between the candidates, and there were not many mentions of the presumed Democratic candidate \u2013 Congressman Bruce Braley. While there is little daylight between the candidates on issues discussed last night (minus Lunde) it seems that the debate did separate Clovis, Ernst and Whitaker from the rest of the field based on the feedback given to Caffeinated Thoughts by some in attendance.\n\nIn my opinion all three gave solid debate performances. Clovis had substantive answers (as expected). Ernst made a strong case with her legislative record in the Iowa Senate being the only candidate to vote against Obamacare via the healthcare exchanges. Ernst had the best one-liner: \u201cI am a farmer\u2019s daughter who grew up in southwest Iowa, castrating hogs with her dad. I can go to Washington and cut pork.\u201d\n\nWhitaker had a relaxed presence, made answers personable by relating stories from potential voters he talked to, and he had the strongest closing statement.\n\nFrom the feedback received and my own opinion: Whitaker and Clovis had the strongest debate performance with Ernst close behind.\n\nI was disappointed by Paul Lunde\u2019s inclusion in the debate. It seemed like his only purpose for being in the debate was to plug books he wrote, as well as, a balanced budget amendment he crafted. Schaben overall was much, much improved from a recent candidate forum performance. I didn\u2019t hear any feedback regarding Young good or bad. From my perspective there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with the answers he gave, but he just doesn\u2019t seem to be connecting.\n\nHere is video of the debate if you haven\u2019t watched it yet so you can judge for yourself.\n\nHere is a playlist of all of the opening statements:\n\nQuestion on Obamacare: What\u2019s wrong with it, and what if anything would you keep? (accidently cut one answer off so I made this a playlist)\n\nQuestion: How would you deal with Obamacare facing a divided government?\n\nQuestion related to government shutdown and debt ceiling:\n\nSpending & entitlement reform:\n\nFinancial meltdown:\n\nClosing statements:\n\nBonus: Post-debate comments (in the order they were done):\n\nStraw poll: Who do you think won the first Iowa U.S. Senate GOP Primary Debate? I have my opinion, but I want to hear yours.\n\nSeveral candidates issued statements after the debate.\n\nFrom Joni Ernst\u2019s campaign:\n\nJoni Ernst set herself apart, and above, the rest of the Republican field tonight, proving she is the candidate Republicans can trust to cut wasteful Washington spending, repeal Obamacare, and defeat Bruce Braley. \u201cAs a farm girl who grew up castrating hogs in southwest Iowa, I know I can go to Washington and cut pork.\u201d Throughout the 90-minute debate, Joni clearly articulated her platform while reminding voters that she is the only candidate in this race with a strong conservative record to back up her principles. Joni continues to gain momentum and solidify her position as the candidate in this race who can beat Democrat Bruce Braley, and her standout, winning performance in tonight\u2019s debate proved it.\n\nHeather Swift, David Young\u2019s communications director, issued a statement:\n\nTonight, David Young laid out a clear plan for tackling Washington\u2019s biggest problems with fresh conservative ideas and limited government values that will dismantle DC bureaucracy and make government work for Iowans again. David\u2019s plan to get our nation back on track begins with Iowa common sense solutions, like: zero-based budgeting and generational accounting to balance our budget, dismantling onerous and duplicative agencies to free our job creators of costly red tape, and conducting a full federal audit to shine light on and dismantle wasteful and nefarious programs to restore accountability to government. Iowa voters know they can count on David Young to solve problems and fight for them because that\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing all along, fighting for Iowa alongside Senator Grassley.\n\nSam Clovis\u2019 campaign manager, Chuck Laudner, declared victory today.\n\nClearly Sam was the winner last evening. He\u2019s the only candidate revealing breadth and depth on the issues. Plus, Sam didn\u2019t check the boxes with boilerplate answers \u2014 he showed he will be a real leader. Sam proved last night why he is the frontrunner.\n\nClovis also made a statement:\n\nVoters of Iowa last night got to hear solutions to many of the problems that plague our nation. Iowans now have a clear choice as to who will provide the leadership and strength of character in the U.S. Senate. I will always have the best interest of Iowans and our nation in mind when I am in Washington, D.C. I will not only vote right, but fight right for you. I am that \u2018someone\u2019 you can trust to have your back.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2013/10/first-iowa-u-s-senate-gop-primary-debate-wrap/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/afp-nro-iowa-us-senate-debate.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2013-10-24T20:53:26+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "david young, iowa u.s. senate race, joni ernst, matt whitaker, paul lunde, sam clovis, scott schaben, election central, iowa news & politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "Recap and full video of the AFP/NRO Iowa U.S. Senate GOP Primary debate.
