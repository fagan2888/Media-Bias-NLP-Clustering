Although fellow guest investor Chris Sacca spars with Cuban on Twitter, he also thinks Cuban will \u201chave a path to run for President.\u201d This pretty much makes up public Mark Cuban: Businessman, provocateur, politico.\n\nCuban\u2014whose savvy deals include one with a 16 year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 who wants to \u201creshape the shampoo market,\u201d Bottle Breachers, and a voting app\u2014considers himself an entrepreneur first. This drives everything from business decisions to opinions on politics. This also means he sometimes appears quite politically conservative, and sometimes he doesn\u2019t. The dissonance doesn\u2019t bother him.\n\nFor example, while many conservatives have publicly declared Obamacare a disaster, Cuban\u2019s not so quick to jump on that bandwagon. \u201cThe most important phrase for conservatives\u201d he told me via text on his app CyberDust, \u201cis the risk never leaves the system. It\u2019s why Obamacare, while far from perfect, is better than what we had from insurance companies. Someone will pay for the uninsured and services they need. The question is how? Either it can be organized and thought-through or haphazard.\u201d\n\nGovernment Complexity Isn\u2019t That Big a Deal Cuban says he \u201chates big government\u201d and thinks there are \u201ctoo many welfare programs,\u201d but feels genuine responsibility to help those less fortunate. \u201cWe as a country have committed to a level of support for everyone. Reagan started the program that said anyone can walk into a hospital and get care. When people can\u2019t get an education or be healthy and get sick all the time who do you think pays for all that? Don\u2019t you think it costs the country money when kids aren\u2019t healthy and can\u2019t learn? Who pays for it?\u201d\n\n\u2018I would have started a company even if I paid 90% in taxes.\u2019 One of the reasons conservatives often advocate for lower taxes is to aid small-business owners. Cuban says this mindset glosses over how many entrepreneurs are wired. He said most entrepreneurs possess pure drive coupled with innovation: \u201cWhen I was broke and starting businesses I never knew what a tax code was. I had no idea what tax rates were. I did know I had no interest in working for others. I would have started a company even if I paid 90% in taxes.\u201d\n\nWhile regulation does affect businesses somewhat it doesn\u2019t as much as many think, Cuban argued (although his opinion could be due to his billionaire status).\n\n\u201cCEO\u2019s want to get **** you rich\u2013that drives their decision making more than anything,\u201d he texted. \u201cEntrepreneurs approach the world differently\u2013they want to get rich and do so building businesses. When regulation is a huge problem is when administration of licensing and paperwork and complexity of taxes.\u201d\n\nStop Screaming and Present Solutions One of the reasons Cuban thinks conservatism as an ideology has become less popular is because politicians aren\u2019t concerned with providing solutions, especially when it comes to helping businesses (he pointed out neither side has hosted \u201ca townhall focused on business\u201d).\n\n\u2018I hate socialism. It has no chance of working. But Millennials and Generation Z think doing good is part of making money.\u2019 \u201cThe problem is conservatism is no longer about smart business decisions. It\u2019s about screaming the dogma. The Republicans are a mess because there is no leadership. Everything they all say is about stopping someone. No one is saying \u2018here is exactly what I will do about that. Others can\u2019t do it and here\u2019s why my plan will work and how the country will benefit.\u2019 Saying you will undo everything isn\u2019t leadership. There\u2019s plenty to do beyond the things Obama has implemented that could have a huge impact.\u201d\n\nAnother thing conservatives need to recognize, and quickly, Cuban says is the social aspect of capitalism, or socio-capitalism. \u201cLook at most product startups these days: They follow the Tom\u2019s [the shoe company] model of being socially responsible and millennial consumers expect that. One key reason Bernie is popular with younger generation is they see socialism as responsible capitalism. I look for a social side for all my product companies now. Consumers expect it.\u201d\n\nCuban differentiates between socialism and doing good: \u201cI hate socialism. It has no chance of working. But Millennials and Generation \u2018Z\u2019 think doing good is part of making money. So a smart consumer recognizes what the market wants.\u201d\n\nHow can conservatives fix this? Cuban cites Reagan again. \u201cGiven our commitments, we need to figure out what is the most efficient way to deliver the services we promised as a country to our citizens. Conservatism didn\u2019t evolve with the times. It\u2019s trying to conserve a time that is unlike today.\u201d\n\nMark Cuban on 2016 During another conversation via CyberDust, I asked Cuban about his preferred candidate, now that it\u2019s essentially down to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. He said the candidates were \u201cflawed,\u201d but he was \u201cexcited to see how it plays out.\u201d\n\nHe said Hillary was \u2018far smarter\u2019 than Trump, although he acknowledged the \u2018e-mail thing is a joke.\u2019 When I asked him, incredulously, acknowledging his generally conservative background, \u201cAre you actually considering Clinton? You can\u2019t possibly!\u201d He shot back, \u201cI can.\u201d I voiced my opinion about Clinton\u2019s less-than-stellar reputation as secretary of State, and he replied, \u201cWe aren\u2019t voting for Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s been no secret Cuban and Trump have a love-hate relationship, Cuban acknowledged one thing Trump might help with: \u201cThe GOP needed to get off all the social shit. The Donald might be the one to take them off.\u201d On the other hand, he said there was nothing President Hillary Clinton could do \u201cthat would hurt anything I would do.\u201d\n\nCuban challenged the conservative consensus several times. \u201cObama did a good job, other than with the FCC and some foreign policy. That doesn\u2019t make him a bad President. No POTUs gets it all right. Which candidate do you think is smarter\u2013[Hillary or Trump]?\u201d\n\nWhen I turned the question around, he said Hillary was \u201cfar smarter\u201d than Trump, although he acknowledged the \u201ce-mail thing is a joke\u201d and that \u201cHillary and trump are technologically illiterate.\u201d\n\nMark Cuban for President? While on Fox Sports Radio \u201cThe Herd\u201d with Colin Cowherd, Sacca told Cowherd the presidency is a real possibility for Cuban.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been approached for third party. I won\u2019t do it.\u2019 \u201cCuban has everything that Trump has in terms of the adherence and hanging on his every word. The minute you\u2019re coined as a billionaire in this country everyone just takes everything you say as gospel\u2026.Cuban has all of that, but he\u2019s not an idiot.\u201d\n\nSo has Cuban been approached to run for president? \u201cI\u2019ve been approached for third party,\u201d he told me Sunday via his app. \u201cI won\u2019t do it.\u201d While Cuban confirmed he has not been asked to run for vice president, he would consider it if he were, \u201cbut it\u2019s a long shot.\u201d\n\nAt times throughout our conversation, Cuban seemed to voice some conservative viewpoints, and at others he leaned further Left. In an attempt to identify him, I offered him an explanation: \u201cThat makes sense for someone in your position, given your billionaire status.\u201d\n\nHe corrected me. \u201cI care about what happens to this country. I\u2019m set. It\u2019s not about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re more of a moderate Democrat at heart, but someone who supports a token conservative issue here and there,\u201d I also suggested.\n\n\u201cMaybe I think for myself,\u201d he responded. \u201cNo labels for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 17 May 2016 14:25:58 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "\u2018Shark Tank\u2019 investor Mark Cuban dishes on business, politics, and whether he\u2019ll run for president.", "title": "Mark Cuban Won't Run For President, Would Consider Veep", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_166785026-1.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2016/05/17/mark-cuban-wont-run-for-president-would-consider-veep/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "\u2018Shark Tank\u2019 investor Mark Cuban dishes on business, politics, and whether he\u2019ll run for president.", "title": "Mark Cuban Won't Run For President, Would Consider Veep", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/shutterstock_166785026-1.jpg"}, "creator": "@nmrussell2", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "tag": "2016,ABC,Donald Trump,Hillary Clinton,Mark Cuban,Shark Tank,vice president", "published_time": "2016-05-17T14:25:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\u2018Shark Tank\u2019 investor Mark Cuban dishes on business, politics, and whether he\u2019ll run for president."}, "article_summary": "Although fellow guest investor Chris Sacca spars with Cuban on Twitter, he also thinks Cuban will \u201chave a path to run for President.\u201d This pretty much makes up public Mark Cuban: Businessman, provocateur, politico.\nI won\u2019t do it.\u2019 \u201cCuban has everything that Trump has in terms of the adherence and hanging on his every word.\nI would have started a company even if I paid 90% in taxes.\u201dWhile regulation does affect businesses somewhat it doesn\u2019t as much as many think, Cuban argued (although his opinion could be due to his billionaire status).\nFor example, while many conservatives have publicly declared Obamacare a disaster, Cuban\u2019s not so quick to jump on that bandwagon.\nWhile on Fox Sports Radio \u201cThe Herd\u201d with Colin Cowherd, Sacca told Cowherd the presidency is a real possibility for Cuban."}
