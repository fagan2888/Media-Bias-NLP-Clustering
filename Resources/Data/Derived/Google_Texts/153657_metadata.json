Programs will exceed their budgets without any real assurance that they are working.\n\nBack in 2010, for example, the United States provided about $50 billion for reconstruction without any strategy in place. A SIGAR audit found that anti-corruption efforts provided relatively little assistance to some key Afghan institutions. Still, an additional $46 billion in aid was doled out.\n\nIn the 2010 audit, SIGAR recommended that then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton approve and implement a draft comprehensive strategy created by the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan to combat corruption and protect tax dollars from waste. But the State Department never approved a strategy, and it, along with several other agencies continue doling out money without a plan.\n\nIn order to better manage resources going forward, SIGAR recommends that all agencies handling aid to Afghanistan develop a comprehensive and coordinated strategy for U.S. anti-corruption efforts.\n\nThis is just one of a handful of recent SIGAR audits that shows the lack of coordination and planning between agencies to manage billions in aid to Afghanistan.\n\nAnother report, released today, warns that other agencies charged with reducing waste among construction projects worth up to $4.7 trillion,don\u2019t have procedures in place to determine which structures meet the Afghan Security Forces\u2019 needs.\n\nSIGAR said that these agencies, including the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \u201cmay be missing opportunities to identify additional planned facilities that are candidates for consolidation or termination.\u201d If identified, these projects could save U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United States has spent $100 billion to rebuild and strengthen Afghanistan\u2014without", "title": "Billions Spent in Afghanistan with No Game Plan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/13/Billions-Spent-Afghanistan-No-Game-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/13/Billions-Spent-Afghanistan-No-Game-Plan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092012_Defense_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The United States has spent $100 billion to rebuild and strengthen Afghanistan\u2014without", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The lack of an anti-corruption strategy in Afghanistan is the latest outrage contained in an audit from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopka.\nBut the State Department never approved a strategy, and it, along with several other agencies continue doling out money without a plan.\nWithout a strategy in place, the U.S. will continue being an ATM machine for corrupt officials and other bad actors.\nThis is just one of a handful of recent SIGAR audits that shows the lack of coordination and planning between agencies to manage billions in aid to Afghanistan.\nBack in 2010, for example, the United States provided about $50 billion for reconstruction without any strategy in place."}
