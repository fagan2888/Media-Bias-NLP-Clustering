Poulter lost command of the Honda Classic, but he didn\u2019t lose his place atop the leaderboard.\n\nHe was at 7-under par through seven holes, tied with Paul Casey, who went out in 31 and was in the left rough on the 10th hole when the final round was halted at sunset.\n\nPatrick Reed, in the final group with Poulter, was one shot behind.\n\nPhil Mickelson was among four players who were three shots behind at 4-under par. That group included Daniel Berger, the PGA Tour rookie from West Palm Beach whose final shot Sunday was a 35-foot chip-in for birdie on the 11th hole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty pleased with the golf I\u2019ve played throughout the whole of today,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cI haven\u2019t really made many mistakes at all. I\u2019ve put it in position an awful lot, which is encouraging right now. And If I do that tomorrow, then I\u2019m going to be in a good position.\u201d\n\nHis two mistakes were big ones.\n\nLeading by three shots, he tried to take a little off an 8-iron on the par-3 fifth hole, where the green is guarded by water on the left. Poulter hit a shank that went so far to the right it bounced into water on the sixth hole. He made double bogey and lost the lead.\n\nOn his next tee shot, he pulled his drive into the water down the left side of the sixth fairway and had to two-putt from 65 feet to escape with bogey.\n\n\u201cYou take your foot off the accelerator for one second, all of a sudden you find yourself completely out of position,\u201d Poulter said.\n\nFor a day of plodding across the rain-softened fairways, the Honda Classic suddenly was full of energy, not to mention possibilities. There was a three-shot swing at No. 5 when Reed holed a 35-foot birdie putt from a swale right of the fifth green and Poulter made his double bogey. Reed took the lead on No. 6 when Poulter made bogey.\n\nAnd then Poulter was on the right end of a two-shot swing at their final hole of the long day, the par-3 seventh. His eyes a little wider, his blood boiling, Poulter drilled a 6-iron into 3 feet for birdie, while Reed missed the green to the left and failed to get up-and-down.\n\nNo longer forgotten was Casey, who made four birdies on the front nine, all from no more than 12 feet. His birdie on No. 9 moved him into a share of the lead.\n\nThe Monday finish was caused by nearly 5 inches of rain and 50 mph gusts that washed out the third round on Saturday and took a 78-member grounds crew until 10 a.m. Sunday just to get the course ready. It had so much water that the crew had to chase off an alligator from the bunkers. Players finished the third round and went right back out to squeeze in as many holes as possible. The final round was to resume at 8 a.m.\n\n\u201cThis sort of situation is going to be difficult for everybody, and it just breaks up momentum,\u201d said Casey, who had more than anyone. \u201cSome guys will carry it through tomorrow. Others won\u2019t, and that\u2019s very difficult to predict. \u2026You just hope you wake up tomorrow and you feel like you\u2019ve got the same kind of golf swing and putts are going in the hole. You just don\u2019t know. Hope the golfing gods are nice to us tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Mickelson was thinking.\n\nHe opened with two quick birdies and was getting closer to the lead until pushing a 4-foot par putt on the sixth hole. Mickelson had 10-foot par putt on the ninth hole when he returned Monday morning.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to just having a minute to regroup and take a look at what\u2019s going on,\u201d Mickelson said.\n\nJeff Overton, Brendan Steele and Russell Knox, who lost in a four-man playoff last year at PGA National, also were at 4 under.\n\nPoulter was right about one thing. He did play some good golf, except for those two holes. He was bogey-free for a 66 in the third round, taking him from a two-shot deficit to a three-shot lead over Reed and Padraig Harrington going into the final round. It was his first 54-hole lead on the PGA Tour.\n\nHarrington twice missed short putts - making bogey on No. 4 and double bogey on No. 6 - and was at 3 under.\n\nPoulter at least was pleased with how he left the course with that 6-iron for birdie. He will try to end more than two years without a victory.\n\n\u201cSilly things happen,\u201d he said. \u201cTiring, and made a couple of really bad swings on 5 and 6. But that kind of angered me inside enough to spark a little bit of energy there to hit a good shot on 7.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poulter didn't realize he had a three-shot lead in the Honda Classic, only that he was playing well enough to feel like he was in control of his game and the tournament.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Poulter didn\u2019t realize he had a three-shot lead in the Honda Classic, only that he was playing well enough to feel like he was in control of his game and the tournament.", "title": "Ian Poulter, Paul Casey share lead at rain-delayed Honda Classic", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/1/poulter-builds-3-shot-lead-at-honda-classic/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/01/09783112abf48a096f0f6a706700dda8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/01/09783112abf48a096f0f6a706700dda8.jpg", "description": "Poulter didn't realize he had a three-shot lead in the Honda Classic, only that he was playing well enough to feel like he was in control of his game and the tournament.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ian Poulter, Paul Casey share lead at rain-delayed Honda Classic"}, "Author": "Doug Ferguson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Ian Poulter, Patrick Reed, The Honda Classic, Honda Motor Company  Ltd"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbfd\"", "article_summary": "What had been a marathon day at soggy PGA National suddenly turned into a sprint-to-the-finish on Monday morning when the final round was to resume.\nHis next tee shot that splashed down in the water left of the fairway made it even worse.\nAnd then Poulter was on the right end of a two-shot swing at their final hole of the long day, the par-3 seventh.\nPoulter lost command of the Honda Classic, but he didn\u2019t lose his place atop the leaderboard.\nThe final round was to resume at 8 a.m.\u201cThis sort of situation is going to be difficult for everybody, and it just breaks up momentum,\u201d said Casey, who had more than anyone."}
