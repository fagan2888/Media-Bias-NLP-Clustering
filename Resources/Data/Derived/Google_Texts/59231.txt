Seven House Republicans have unveiled their own version of a federal health care law.

The bill drafted by members of the Republican Study Committee, including Fourth District Representative Todd Rokita, repeals President Obama‘s health care law, and replaces it with a $7,500 income tax deduction if you buy your own insurance. It proposes health savings accounts similar to those in Indiana‘s health insurance plan, and would make state insurance data and Medicare claims data public, to allow patients to comparison-shop on pricing.

Rokita argues the GOP version would force medical prices down through competition, while preserving existing doctor-patient relationships. Rokita says Republicans tried to offer many of these ideas in the original health care debate three years ago.

“We were told that we would have to pass Obamacare to find out what was in it,” Rokita said. “And now as more and more people see what is in it vis-à-vis how it is affecting their daily lives, this was an opportune time not just to say no but to say what could be.”

Rokita acknowledges the bill will go nowhere in the Senate without Democratic support. He says that would probably first require the existing law to prove unworkable as more provisions take effect — something he maintains as inevitable.

“We reject the idea that government knows best, that government should be between you and your doctor,” Rokita said. “That we should have special boards deciding what you need, that we know better than you what you need from your doctor and how best to get it.”
