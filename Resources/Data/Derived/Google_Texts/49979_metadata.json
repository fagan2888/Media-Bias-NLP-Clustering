Ever wonder why progressives talk endlessly about diversity yet can\u2019t tolerate the slightest dissent from their orthodoxy?\n\nEver wonder why Barack Obama seems more suited for a European coffee shop than the Oval Office?\n\nWonder no more. Fred Siegel\u2019s new book explains all you need to know about liberalism, a political philosophy that, despite good intentions, careened off track after World War I and hasn\u2019t found its way back yet.\n\n\u201cThe Revolt Against the Masses\u201d is a brilliantly argued, well-timed case against reactionary snobs who were and remain disgusted with American society. Under the subtitle \u201cHow Liberalism has Undermined the Middle Class,\u201d Siegel documents with scholarly detail the arrogance of elites who launched a movement that romanticizes the poor while trying, with distressing success, to dismantle the democratic, capitalist traditions that helped establish the middle class.\n\n\u201cThe aim of liberalism\u2019s founding writers and thinkers \u2014 such as Herbert Croly, Randolph Bourne, H.G. Wells, Sinclair Lewis and H.L. Mencken \u2014 was to create an American aristocracy of sorts, to provide the same sense of hierarchy and \u00adorder long associated with European statism,\u201d he writes.\n\nI have enjoyed many lively conversations with Siegel, and his voice jumps off the page. He approvingly quotes an early critic\u2019s observation that a \u201cpsychological mechanism\u201d allows progressive reformers to turn their own failings \u201cinto moral judgments against society.\u201d\n\nSiegel traces the movement from the era of Woodrow Wilson to our own, stopping along the way for details the way a travel writer samples local food. Wells, for example, is best remembered for science-fiction books like \u201cThe Time Machine,\u201d but Siegel blames him for laying out \u201ctwo central tropes of liberalism: a sense of superiority and a claim on the future.\u201d\n\nCroly, a founder of the New Republic magazine, held the average American in contempt and wanted a government led by enlightened \u00adexperts. Mission accomplished.\n\nSiegel, of St. Francis College and the Manhattan Institute, has a keen eye for hypocrisy. He twins liberalism\u2019s hunger for \u201cmoral deregulation\u201d with its appetite for overregulating everything else. He captures the religious fervor by labeling its leaders a \u201cclerisy.\u201d\n\nThe ultimate payoff is his depiction of Obama as the incarnation of the philosophy\u2019s disdain for conventional life, including the president\u2019s penchant for \u201cauthoritarian liberalism.\u201d In that America, rights are given and taken by government experts.\n\nIn a remarkable book that has only one shortcoming \u2014 it\u2019s too short \u2014 Siegel connects the dots between the founding motivations of liberalism and the failed social experiments of today.\n\nFrom the dumbing down of education to extreme environmentalism, from anti-family poverty programs to free-speech curbs on campuses, the excesses of our times are laid out like the pieces of a puzzle. It is a clear-eyed vision of how we got to this troubled place.\n\nSadly, the damage continues. The president\u2019s scandalous attempts to circumvent Congress and the Constitution by, among other things, re-writing ObamaCare to suit his political needs, demonstrate that the overreach will not stop voluntarily.\n\nThat is the challenge Siegel presents. Thanks to his brilliant work, none of us can claim ignorance.\n\nThe \u2018Blas\u2019 pass: That\u2019s the ticket!\n\nMayor de Blasio defended his call to the police about a supporter who was arrested as \u201cabsolutely appropriate\u201d and says \u201cthat\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d\n\nMaybe, maybe not. Some stories have legs from the start, and others grow them later. We can\u2019t know yet whether this story is finished or just the first example of corrupt cronyism.\n\nMuch depends on whether the mayor intervenes again in police procedures. With 35,000 cops working around the clock, the odds are high that other mayoral pals will get busted. And after this case, anybody facing charges who ever met de Blasio would be crazy not to beg for special help.\n\nThus, I offer a modest proposal. It would be far simpler if de Blasio drew up a list of people who, by virtue of their support for him, earned a get-out-of-jail free card.\n\nThis \u201cFriends of Mayor Bill\u201d list should be posted in every station house and squad car for handy reference. Detectives should carry a copy at all times and commanders would be required to memorize it.\n\nEach name should include an identifying fact to prevent fraud, such as campaign contributions made or number of voters registered. Those arrested who demand mayoral help could be given a quiz on progressive values, to make sure no infidels slip through.\n\nThe idea involves some effort, but consider the alternative. The mayor said it was near midnight when he got the first call on Bishop Orlando Findlayter\u2019s arrest and it was after that when the precinct commander drove from his Queens home to Brooklyn to let the pastor walk.\n\nIf that becomes a habit, nobody in City Hall will get any sleep and cops will be wasting time enforcing the law on those above it. Better to make a list and stop pretending justice is blind.\n\nBam hands putin the keys\n\nVladimir Putin isn\u2019t letting the Olympics interfere with Russia\u2019s expansionist aims. The Syria peace talks collapsed when Putin refused to discuss pushing Bashar al-Assad from power. Even more brazen, Egypt\u2019s top military commander visited Putin last week and came away with his endorsement for the presidential election. They also discussed expanding economic and military ties.\n\nWhen future historians ask who lost Egypt and let Russia back into the Middle East, the answer will be easy: Barack Obama.\n\nActually, we don\u2019t have to wait for historians. We can see Russia\u2019s expansion and America\u2019s retreat with our own eyes.\n\nTrying time$ for Boyland\n\nFor sheer sleaze, it\u2019s hard to top the Brooklyn corruption trial of Assemblyman William Boyland Jr. Federal prosecutors are trying to show he solicited more than $250,000 in bribes tied to real-estate deals. Unfortunately for the Democrat, the \u201cbusinessmen\u201d seeking his help were undercover FBI agents.\n\nHis former girlfriend and assistant testified about her role, and it was a doozy. \u201cUnder my official capacity, I accepted bribes and I helped my former boss receive bribes,\u201d Ry-Ann Hermon said.\n\nShe told of her own checkered past, saying \u201cI committed mortgage fraud\u201d and owed over $100,000 in back taxes. She said Boyland used a nonprofit funded by taxpayers for campaign events. Boyland\u2019s father, a former assemblyman, allegedly was a bag man for one bribe.\n\nBoyland Jr. beat the rap on an earlier case, but was caught on tape saying he needed $250,000 to pay legal fees. Unless he\u2019s got a good defense, this case is shaping up as an even more expensive proposition. And a classic example of why Gov. Cuomo must keep exposing Albany\u2019s dirty dealers.\n\nChancell or storming on\n\nThe storm that wreaked havoc on New York last week deserves a name. Absent a better idea, I say we name it \u201cCarmen,\u201d as in Carmen \u201cit\u2019s a beautiful day\u201d Fari\u00f1a.
