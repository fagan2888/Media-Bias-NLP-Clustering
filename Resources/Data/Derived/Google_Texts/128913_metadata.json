About sixty people signed up to participate in public comment, the majority of whom said they were in favor of delaying the vote to impose the regulations, according to the San Antonio Express-News. However, after nearly three hours of discussion and debate, the Council voted 7-2 in favor of the new regulations.\n\nAs Breitbart Texas reported, the new regulations include additional requirements for insurance, driver testing, and vehicle inspections, for transportation network companies, or TNCs. Uber strongly objected to the regulations and sent a letter from Leandre Johns, a Dallas-based Uber general manager, to the Council explaining how these regulations were duplicative of safety requirements that are already mandatory to have a Texas driver\u2019s license, required insurance coverage far in excess of what taxi companies are required to carry, and created an unfair burden for Uber drivers. Johns concluded that, if the new regulations were enacted, it would \u201cwould force TNCs to abandon service in San Antonio.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSan Antonio already had the most restrictive regulations for TNCs, according to a study by the free market think tank R Street Institute, as Breitbart Texas reported last month. \u201cMake no mistake. This is not an ordinance to allow ride-sharing. It\u2019s an ordinance to prevent ride-sharing,\u201d said Josiah Neeley, R Street\u2019s Texas Director. \u201cThe regulation throws up so many anti-ride-sharing roadblocks, from millions in insurance to written exams, that it will effectively prohibit ride-sharing companies from operating in San Antonio.\u201d\n\nJess Fields, senior policy analyst for the Center for Local Governance at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, had a similar opinion. In an op-ed earlier this week for the Express-News, Fields wrote how the taxi companies were employing \u201caggressive lobbying efforts\u201d to stifle competition rather than improve their services. \u201cThe truth is when government protects an industry and shuts out competition, there\u2019s no reason to do better,\u201d wrote Fields. \u201cAs a protected industry, the taxicab companies are basically guaranteed customers and market share. They have very little incentive to provide the highest quality service or the lowest cost. Incidentally, this same factor is why, in most markets, ridesharing services price out much more inexpensively than traditional taxicabs.\u201d\n\nFields also noted that groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving \u201cstrongly opposed burdensome regulations on the ridesharing industry,\u201d because TNCs expand the options that people have to secure a safe ride home if they have been drinking alcohol.\n\n\u201cTaxicab companies, ever protective of their government-enforced cartel, are no fans of the new \u2018app-based\u2019 services because they are a threat to their established model of business,\u201d concluded Fields. \u201cBut San Antonio\u2019s council members would do well to remember that the threat of new competition threatens taxicab companies, not consumers while the threat of drunk drivers is very real indeed.\u201d\n\nIt is not yet known if Uber will carry out its threat to cease doing business in San Antonio. Breitbart Texas will continue to follow this story.\n\n[Disclosure: Sarah Rumpf was previously employed by the Texas Public Policy Foundation.]\n\nPhoto credit: Uber via Facebook.\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "San Antonio Votes to Crush Ride-Sharing Companies Like Uber", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "San Antonio Votes to Crush Ride-Sharing Companies Like Uber", "title": "San Antonio Votes to Crush Ride-Sharing Companies Like Uber - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/12/12/uber-facebookpng.png", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/12/14/san-antonio-votes-to-crush-ride-sharing-companies-like-uber/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "San Antonio Votes to Crush Ride-Sharing Companies Like Uber", "creator": "@rumpfshaker", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/12/12/uber-facebookpng.png", "title": "San Antonio Votes to Crush Ride-Sharing Companies Like Uber - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "published_time": "2014-12-14T05:17:13-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 The San Antonio City Council voted on Thursday to impose new regulations on ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft.\nAs Breitbart Texas reported, the new regulations include additional requirements for insurance, driver testing, and vehicle inspections, for transportation network companies, or TNCs.\nHowever, after nearly three hours of discussion and debate, the Council voted 7-2 in favor of the new regulations.\nIt\u2019s an ordinance to prevent ride-sharing,\u201d said Josiah Neeley, R Street\u2019s Texas Director.\n\u201cThe truth is when government protects an industry and shuts out competition, there\u2019s no reason to do better,\u201d wrote Fields."}
