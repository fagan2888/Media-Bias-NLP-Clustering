Besides his shoe line at Adidas, and proclaiming how awesome he is, there\u2019s been news about a new follow up album to the widely acclaimed album Yeezy.\n\nWord on the street is that West was making an album called New Testament with art work of an alleged album cover even floating on the web. The artwork for Kanye\u2019s supposed album features Michaelangelo\u2019s David in all of his glory.The fact that this album is named The New Testament wouldn\u2019t be that far fetched.\n\nWest has many biblical themes throughout his work, and one of those works includes boldly proclaiming that he\u2019s a God. However, this New Testament is nothing but talk and wishful thinking by West fans. Someone from West\u2019s camp told Gawker that the news of an album is completely fabricated.\n\nAccording to a source close to West, \u201cWe have no idea what this is. It\u2019s not coming from us.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the art work that touts the album\u2019s release date as June 10, 2014, a Twitter handle was created in honor of the fake Kanye West album. The Twitter handle KWsNewTestament currently follows 878 people, which include news sites, and other various celebrities. As it is Kanye is only following one person on Twitter.\n\nAnother example that points to this being a ruse is that during the blackout promotion of his album Yeezus Kanye\u2019s team didn\u2019t set up a separate Twitter handle for the album. In fact, it wasn\u2019t even promoted until weeks after the album came out.\n\nAs far as social media goes, it seems like West is starting to show the world that he has a sense of humor. Earlier West embraced a meme that someone made of him. The graphic shows the rapper superimposed in the infamous Kim Kardashian bikini photo. His image is photoshopped to look like he\u2019s running into her behind.\n\nThe 36-year-old wrote \u201cHaha\u201d right above the image of Kardashian in the swimsuit. As for Twitter, West has been frequently posting photos of himself with his new bride as well as baby Nori \u201cNorth\u201d West, who he has shielded from the private eye for some time.\n\nDreams come true http://t.co/JlNzCKwZ0h pic.twitter.com/sC3KNTl7fH \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 24, 2014\n\nI love my family pic.twitter.com/SDZohbsoaA \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) March 26, 2014\n\npic.twitter.com/4fUQMtMhe9 \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) May 27, 2014\n\n[Image via Bing]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now that the wedding is over and done with it was only a matter of time before rumors started circulating about what Kanye West will be up to next.
