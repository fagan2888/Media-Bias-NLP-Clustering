This anti-Christian discrimination is the flip-side of the judges\u2019 endorsement of anti-Christian progressive ideologies, such as sexual liberty, secularism, diversity and environmentalism.\n\nIf the anti-religion group wins the lawsuit, the school must pay the group\u2019s lawyers and also block students\u2019 free speech.\n\nSince the 1960s, the expanding federal government has created many new walls against religious groups\u2019 freedom of religion, despite the constitution\u2019s first amendment, which says \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.\u201d\n\nIn Concord, the annual \u201cChristmas Spectacular\u201d show includes mostly secular acts related to the year-end festivities. However, during the last 15 minutes of the production, religious characters arrive on the stage and a \u201cNativity Orchestra\u201d performs Christmas carols with a religious theme, such as \u201cHark, the Herald Angels Sing\u201d and \u201cJoy to the World.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this case, the violation is pretty clear,\u201d Grover said, according to the news report. School officials can\u2019t contribute to \u201ccelebrating the religious aspects\u2026 The school district cannot promote Christianity above other religions. It\u2019s a pretty clear-cut violation in that sense, and we hope the district acknowledges that.\u201d\n\nInstead of its current \u201cChristmas Spectacular,\u201d Grover said the school district will can pay for to secular winter-themed concert around the themes of \u201csecular values like family, giving and community.\u201d\n\nThe letter from FFRF cites case law that reportedly states schools are not permitted to sponsor any religious messages because these create \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, school official Trout released this response:\n\nRecently, Concord Community Schools received a letter from the Madison, Wisconsin based Freedom From Religion Foundation questioning an aspect of one of the high school music department\u2019s performances. As in past dealings with Concord Schools, that foundation provided copies of its letter to the local media before school administrators were able to review the letter. It is a long standing practice of Concord Schools to not publicly comment on concerns, valid or invalid, initially raised by students, parents, or patrons to the media instead of first addressing them with school administrators. Rest assured that Concord Schools routinely reviews all of its programs, curricular, co-curricular, and extra-curricular, to ensure not only compliance with legal and financial standards, but also the educational goals of the school corporation. Consistent with its past practice, Concord Schools will have no further public comment concerning the letter received from the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, FFRF\u2019s Wisconsin affiliate sued the government in July, demanding that the World War II memorial known as \u201cBig Mountain Jesus\u201d be removed from a Montana ski slope on the grounds that it is an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.\n\nIn August, FFRF threatened a lawsuit against the Chanute, Kansas, school district for its copy of a famous painting of Jesus that has hung on a middle school wall since 1965. FFRF called the painting an \u201cegregious violation of the First Amendment,\u201d and warned the district superintendent that a similar situation in Ohio left the school district with $95,000 in legal fees after settling the case.\n\nIn March of 2012, the FFRF also placed an anti-Catholic ad that was then published by the New York Times. The ad, which criticized the Catholic Church\u2019s position against Obamacare\u2019s HHS mandate, stated, \u201cIt\u2019s time to quit the Roman Catholic Church. Will it be reproductive freedom, or back to the Dark Ages?\u201d\n\nThe ad accused the Catholic Church of promoting \u201cacute misery, poverty, needless suffering, unwanted pregnancies, overpopulation, social evils and deaths.\u201d\n\nIn an appeal to Catholic women, the ad asked, \u201cApparently, you\u2019re like the battered woman who, after being beaten down every Sunday, feels she has no place else to go.\u201d\n\nAnother lawsuit by FFRF includes one against the Clemson football program because of prayers and Bible studies instituted by the team.\n\nDespite FFRF\u2019s relatively small annual budget of about $3 million and little more than 22,000 members, it manages to work its will around school districts that have fixed budgets and would rather just agree to the foundation\u2019s terms than spend thousands of dollars on defending religious freedom.\n\nFFRF\u2019s website states its mission is \u201cprotecting the constitutional principle of the separation of state and church.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An atheist organization threatened a lawsuit against an Indiana public school if it allows the nativity scene in 2015\u2019s Christmas concert.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "An atheist organization threatened a lawsuit against an Indiana public school if it allows the nativity scene in 2015\u2019s Christmas concert.", "title": "Anti-Religion Group Uses Judges To Threaten Students' Christmas Concert - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/nativityfileap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/01/anti-religion-group-uses-judges-to-threaten-students-christmas-concert/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An atheist organization threatened a lawsuit against an Indiana public school if it allows the nativity scene in 2015\u2019s Christmas concert.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/nativityfileap.jpg", "title": "Anti-Religion Group Uses Judges To Threaten Students' Christmas Concert - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Christian persecution, Concord Community Schools, FFRF, Freedom From Religion Foundation, freedom of religion, Indiana, living nativity, militant atheism, religion in public schools, Religious persecution,Big Government, Education, Faith,nativity", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Religious persecution", "published_time": "2015-09-01T19:21:03-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Education,Faith"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAn atheist organization is threatening an expensive lawsuit unless an Indiana school district blocks students from holding a Christmas concert during the Christmas season.\nSchool officials can\u2019t contribute to \u201ccelebrating the religious aspects\u2026 The school district cannot promote Christianity above other religions.\nIf the anti-religion group wins the lawsuit, the school must pay the group\u2019s lawyers and also block students\u2019 free speech.\nConsistent with its past practice, Concord Schools will have no further public comment concerning the letter received from the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\nAs in past dealings with Concord Schools, that foundation provided copies of its letter to the local media before school administrators were able to review the letter."}
