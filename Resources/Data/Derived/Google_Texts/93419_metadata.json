He deployed with a cavalry scout unit from 2004 to 2005 and was stationed near FOB Warhorse. I asked him if he thought this movie really mattered. \u201cEvery portrayal of a historical event should be historically accurate,\u201d he explained. \u201dA movie like this is a cultural symbol that influences the way people remember history and feel about war.\u201d\n\nGarett and I met through our antiwar and veteran support work, which he\u2019s been involved with for almost a decade. He served in Iraq. I served in Afghanistan. But both of us know how powerful mass media and mass culture are. They shaped how we thought of the wars when we joined, so we felt it was important to tell our stories when we came home and spoke out.\n\nI commend Chris Kyle for telling his story in his book \u201cAmerican Sniper.\u201d The scariest thing I did while in the military was come home and tell my story to the public \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly. I feel that veterans owe it to society to tell their stories, and civilians owe it to veterans to actively listen. Dr. Ed Tick, a psychotherapist who has specialized in veteran care for four decades, explains, \u201cIn all traditional and classical societies, returned warriors served many important psychosocial functions. They were keepers of dark wisdom for their cultures, witnesses to war\u2019s horrors from personal experience who protected and discouraged, rather than encouraged, its outbreak again.\u201d\n\nChris Kyle didn\u2019t view Iraq like me and Garett, but neither of us have attacked him for it. He\u2019s not the problem. We don\u2019t care about the lies that Chris Kyle may or may not have told. They don\u2019t matter. We care about the lies that Chris Kyle believed. The lie that Iraq was culpable for September 11. The lie that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The lie that people do evil things because they are evil.\n\nThe film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is also rife with lies. This was not Chris Kyle\u2019s story. And Bradley Cooper was not Chris Kyle. It was Jason Hall\u2019s story, a one-time actor in \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and screenwriter for \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d who called his film a \u201ccharacter study.\u201d Don\u2019t believe him. His movie is as fictional as Buffy Summers.\n\nIn the movie\u2019s first scene, Cooper faces a moral dilemma that never happened in real life. Cooper suspects a boy is preparing to send an improvised explosive device, or IED, toward a convoy of approaching Marines on the streets of Fallujah. Either he kills a child or the child kills Marines. A soldier next to Cooper warns, \u201cThey\u2019ll send your ass to Leavenworth if you\u2019re wrong.\u201d In writing this line, Hall implies that killing civilians is a war crime and U.S. military members are sent to prison for it. If U.S. soldiers, including Kyle, don\u2019t seem to be getting punished for killing civilians, then they must not be killing civilians.\n\nGarett and I agreed that even if that boy was a civilian, nothing would have happened to Cooper for shooting him. Both of us were trained to take detailed notes with the understanding that if something went wrong, it would be corrected in the report. Americans were responsible for thousands of Iraqi deaths and almost none were held accountable.\n\nDuring one incident in Iraq, Garett was involved in a firefight that left six to seven civilians dead. He received his orders from an intelligence officer who got his intelligence wrong. He led Garett and a small convoy to an Iraqi deputy governor\u2019s compound, which was supposedly under attack. As the convoy approached, the soldiers spotted a cluster of trucks with armed Iraqis. The armed Iraqis saw the American convoy inching closer, but they didn\u2019t fire. It seemed obvious to Garett that these Iraqis were not who the intelligence officer was looking for. Then the officer screamed, \u201cFire!\u201d Confused, no one in the convoy pulled their triggers. \u201cI said fire goddamn it!\u201d Someone fired, and all hell broke loose. In the ensuing chaos, one of the Iraqi trucks struck a civilian seeking cover on the sidewalk. As it turned out, those armed Iraqis were the deputy governor\u2019s own security detail. The officer didn\u2019t go to Leavenworth.\n\nIn Hall and Cooper\u2019s Fallujah, it\u2019s as if the Americans just found a city that was already laid to waste. The movie leaves out America\u2019s bombardment of Fallujah. An officer explains that the city has been evacuated, so any military-aged male remaining must be an insurgent. Conveniently, every Iraqi that Cooper kills happens to be carrying a rifle or burying an IED, even though the real Chris Kyle wrote that he was told to shoot anymilitary-aged male. Obviously, every non-insurgent did not evacuate Fallujah.\n\n\u201cMany Iraqis didn\u2019t have cars or other transportation,\u201d Garett explained. \u201cTo get to the nearest town, you\u2019d have to walk across very hot desert, and you wouldn\u2019t be able to carry much. So a lot of residents just decided to stay indoors and wait it out. It\u2019d be like telling people in San Antonio that they have to walk to El Paso; then they come back home and their city is bombed and contaminated with depleted uranium.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clint Eastwood's film is propagandistic fiction masquerading as a \u201ctrue story.\" Here's why it's so dangerous", "author": "Brock McIntosh", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Clint Eastwood's film is propagandistic fiction masquerading as a \u201ctrue story.\" Here's why it's so dangerous", "title": "I\u2019m a U.S. veteran, and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is rife with lies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/07/im_a_u_s_veteran_and_american_sniper_is_filled_with_lies_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/american_sniper31.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clint Eastwood's film is propagandistic fiction masquerading as a \u201ctrue story.\" Here's why it's so dangerous", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/american_sniper31.jpg", "title": "I\u2019m a U.S. veteran, and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is rife with lies", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "I\u2019m a U.S. veteran, and \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is rife with lies", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, american sniper, true stories, Waging Nonviolence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0cd7\"", "article_summary": "Topics: american sniper, true stories, Waging Nonviolence, Life News, Entertainment News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on Waging NonviolenceAfter watching the movie \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d I called a friend named Garett Reppenhagen who was an American sniper in Iraq.\nThe film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is also rife with lies.\nWe don\u2019t care about the lies that Chris Kyle may or may not have told.\nIt was Jason Hall\u2019s story, a one-time actor in \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d and screenwriter for \u201cAmerican Sniper,\u201d who called his film a \u201ccharacter study.\u201d Don\u2019t believe him.\nDuring one incident in Iraq, Garett was involved in a firefight that left six to seven civilians dead."}
