According to data obtained by Quintly, a social media analytics firm, Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign page began the day of Saturday, August 22 with 1,197,290 likes to Clinton\u2019s 1,199,797. By the end of the day, he had 1,218,879 to her 1,205,437. His lead has only increased since then.\n\nSanders\u2019 success comes despite some suggestions that the Clinton campaign has been padding its totals on Facebook with purchased likes. Back in April, Vocative, a data mining media site, reported that Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign page was more popular among Facebook users in Baghdad than any American city. And a further side-by-side comparison of both candidates\u2019 page data shows that, over the last month, 95% of Sanders\u2019 growth came from within the United States, while for Clinton that number is only 74%.\n\nOftentimes, so-called \u201cclick farms\u201d are based out of developing countries and employ legions of low-paid workers to create fake Facebook profiles and then like the pages of clients. Clinton has seen strong growth over the last several weeks in followers in developing countries. To cite a single example, her followers in Myanmar tripled, to 18,150. (By contrast, Sanders\u2019 share of foreign followers is much smaller and comes mostly from Western Europe.) This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Clinton\u2019s campaign was paying click-farms directly \u2014 sometimes customers buy ads from Facebook, which promises to generate a certain number of likes, and those end up coming from click farms \u2014 but that didn\u2019t stop some Reddit users from accusing her of buying likes to stave off Sanders.\n\nTodd Hauptman is the public relations director for Wishpond, an online marketing platform, and previously worked as the social media director for two members of Canada\u2019s parliament. According to Hauptman, when politicians purchase likes on Facebook, it comes from a general ignorance and lack of understanding of social media.\n\n\u201cPeople are looking for authenticity from politicians,\u201d Hauptman says. \u201cOne of the reasons people shouldn\u2019t buy likes is that it creates an alienation from the real fans; the genuine followers that like a page.\u201d\n\nWhether or not her campaign bought followers directly, there is a precedent for an organization led by Hillary Clinton purchasing Facebook likes: the State Department spent $630,000 on them between 2011 and 2013, when she was secretary of state, according to an inspector general\u2019s report.\n\nFacebook itself urges users not to buy fake likes, with its business page stating: \u201cWhile many legitimate Page admins think that packages of fraudulent likes are a useful tool to increase the perception of how popular their Page is, the likes end up being detrimental to the Pages and admins that purchase them. Fraudulent likers are extremely unlikely to engage with a Page after liking it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The progressive insurgent not only enjoys more Facebook fans than Hillary \u2014 his are more engaged.
