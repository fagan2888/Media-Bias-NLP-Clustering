Here's how it opens:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take you across the mighty Mississippi through eight states\u2014past wheat fields and ranches, missions and pueblos, mountains and deserts,\u201d reads the promotional copy for Amtrak\u2019s Southwest Chief, a sleeper train that weaves 2,256 miles from Los Angeles to Chicago along portions of the old Sante Fe trail. \u201cYou\u2019ll see spectacular landscapes and pristine vistas not visible from interstate highways.\u201d While gazing out at scenery worthy of the best John Ford flicks, riders can chow down on offerings from Amtrak\u2019s full-service kitchen, such as the angus steak burger for $9.75, a $16 Vegetarian Gemelli Pasta, or the wild caught Mahi-Mahi for $23.25.\n\nThis \u201cjourney of elevations,\u201d as Amtrak describes it, may be a bliss-out for passengers, but should taxpayers be forced to underwrite the ride? In 2011, the Southwest Chief ran a $66.5 million deficit, meaning the federal government had to kick in $185 for every passenger on board. And to keep the Southwest Chief running, Amtrak is now seeking additional state aid of $120 million over the next decade.\n\nAs any popcorn-stand profiteer posing as a movie house operator can attest, captive eaters create golden opportunities to supersize profits. But on the Southwest Chief\u2014and Amtrak trains in general\u2014food and beverages are a financial drain. Last week, the inspector general revealed at a congressional hearing that Amtrak lost $609 million on its meal services over the past six years, citing all kinds of eye-popping details about giveaways to staff, spoiled food, and service workers earning about four times the standard industry wage. Defenders of Amtrak argue that the report was just a headline-grabbing jab that distracts from the larger story of the organization\u2019s resurgence.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "I have a new story up at The Daily Beast on Amtrak and it's alleged resurgence.
