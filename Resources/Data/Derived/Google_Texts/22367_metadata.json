Collyer enthused conservatives and shocked Democrats last month by granting House Republicans legal standing to sue President Obama, after lawmakers said his administration continued to dole out cost-sharing payments under the Affordable Care Act even though lawmakers had not approved them.\n\nOn Monday, the same judge prevented the Justice Department from appealing that decision before she can move on to the merits of the case.\n\nPHOTOS: New concealed carry guns entering the market for 2016\n\nJudge Collyer, appointed by President George W. Bush, said allowing the administration to plead its case to the appellate courts now would not terminate the case any faster \u2014 one of three key factors she had to weigh \u2014 because she is set to deliver summary judgment after a few months of briefing and oral argument.\n\n\u201cThe relevant question is whether immediate appeal would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. In this case, it would not,\u201d she said in a written order.\n\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who plans to step down once Republicans choose someone to replace him, swiftly cheered the ruling.\n\nPHOTOS: These celebrities are devoutly Christian \u2014 and you probably didn't realize it\n\n\u201cThe court has previously ruled that the House does, in fact, have standing to challenge one of the president\u2019s unilateral actions with regard to Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling further underscores that point, and ensures that the District Court will hear the merits of the case this fall.\u201d\n\nJudge Collyer set out a briefing schedule that brings the parties into January, at which point she will schedule oral argument.\n\nThe case stems from a lawsuit filed last November that challenged Mr. Obama\u2019s moves to twice delay the health law\u2019s insurance mandate on employers, and to reimburse insurers who have reduced co-pays and deductibles for qualified Obamacare enrollees as a condition of participating in the state-based health care exchanges.\n\nRepublicans said Congress never authorized the reimbursement money, and indeed specifically rejected an administration request for that spending, so by moving ahead anyway Mr. Obama violated Congress\u2019s constitutional power of the purse.\n\nIf the House succeeds on the substance of their suit and inevitable appeals, it would spell trouble for Mr. Obama\u2019s namesake law.
