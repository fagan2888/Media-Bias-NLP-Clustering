One man was taken to the hospital after a serious wreck on Saturday morning.

It happened on Highway 19 South, just south of Vimville-Causeyville Road. The Mississippi Highway Patrol tells Newscenter 11 that a man was trapped in his vehicle after the single car crash. Investigators are not sure what led to the wreck.

"At this time, it's under investigation," according to Anthony Chancelor with MHP. "Troopers have yet to speak with the subject. But like I said, we don't know the extent of his injuries. All we know is a one vehicle accident. Subject left the road, traveling southbound here, just south of Causeyville-Vimville Road."

Firefighters from the Causeyville and Vimville fire departments also responded to the crash.
