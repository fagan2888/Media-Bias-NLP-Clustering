An alternate costume for Mario in the upcoming Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U has been revealed this morning.

Going for a decidedly more nationalistic style choice, we can expect to find Tea Party Mario here marching, protesting Obamacare, and picketing in the parking lot of your Planned Parenthood. We're assuming subtlety wasn't the first order of business on Nintendo's part considering Mario's costume looks exactly like Apollo Creed's in Rocky IV.

The new costume comes courtesy of the official Smash Twitter account and the only way this whole thing could get any more patriotic would be if Mario was playing a slide guitar while mounting a Bald Eagle.
