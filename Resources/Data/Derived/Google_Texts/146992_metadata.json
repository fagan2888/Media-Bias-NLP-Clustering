Reuters\n\nA heavily oversubscribed IPO by one of Tunisia\u2019s key companies and smooth parliamentary elections held last weekend are helping the country attract more attention from foreign investors.\n\nShares in Delice Holding, a consortium of companies that make dairy products, started trading on October 16 following an IPO that was almost 16-times oversubscribed. The company, which has a market capitalization of $475 million, sold 15% of its shares in the IPO.\n\nBoubaker Mehri, the firm\u2019s chief executive, says Delice Holding, which was founded by Hamdi Meddeb, was looking to come to market in an effort to attract foreign investment. \u201cWe wanted to have funds in our business from independent sources outside the family,\u201d Mr. Mehri said in an interview.\n\nObservers of the Tunisian market believe Delice Holding\u2019s IPO signals the strengthening of a stock market that, according to research provider Capital Cube, includes 72 listed companies with a total market capitalization of around $8.7 billion. They also expect more companies in the consumer sectors, such as diaper maker SAH Lila and baker Moulin D\u2019Or, to launch their own IPOs soon as they seek to grow their presence in a market where at least two thirds of the population is classified as middle class.\n\nMatthew Spivack, practice leader for the Middle East and North Africa at consultant Frontier Strategy Group in London, says that despite Tunisia having a small population relative to other countries in the region, investors are interested in consumer goods companies because of the country\u2019s relatively stable market and a return of growth in consumer-oriented sectors.\n\nHamdi El Meddeb, founder of Delice Holding. Reuters\n\n\u201cIt is interesting to see some activity in Oman and Tunisia, because these are among the markets that are gaining a lot of new attention from clients who are looking for markets to help fulfill ambitious growth plans for the next few years,\u201d he says.\n\nOthers agree. Slim Feriani, executive chairman of Advance Emerging Capital, a London-based investment manager, says: \u201cFirms like Delice Holding are putting the Tunisian stock market in the spotlight.\u201d\n\nFeriani\u2019s own funds didn\u2019t invest in Delice Holding but he believes there are considerable opportunities in Tunisia. \u201cIt\u2019s important to take into consideration the specific dynamics of the Tunisian market, which is an inefficient frontier market, where stock prices are driven by local [primarily retail] investors rather than sophisticated foreign institutional investors,\u201d he explains. \u201cDelice Holding\u2019s IPO represented an attractive entry point for long-term investors.\u201d\n\nInvestors have been wary of putting significant resources into North Africa in part because of recent events. Tunisia was the cradle of the Arab Spring that led to the ouster of a number of dictatorships. Delice Holding\u2019s Mr. Mehri admits the country still has a somewhat shaky political situation. \u201cWe are still in transition and we have some instability,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are determined to build a strong democracy.\u201d\n\nThe peaceful parliamentary elections last weekend have been hailed as a return to political stability by some observers. London-based analyst Capital Economics noted: \u201cThe fact that the election passed smoothly and that there is a growing consensus among politicians in all of the major parties to push through difficult policies to reduce the economy\u2019s vulnerabilities and raise investment mean that the country\u2019s longer-term growth prospects are brightening.\u201d\n\nFollow Javier Espinoza on Twitter @WSJEjespinoza.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A heavily oversubscribed IPO by one of Tunisia\u2019s key companies and smooth parliamentary elections held last weekend are helping the country attract more attention from foreign investors.", "title": "Tunisian IPO Highlights Growing Foreign Investor Appetite", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/29/tunisian-ipo-highlights-growing-foreign-investor-appetite-%e2%80%a8/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FG828_tunisi_P_20141029124428.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Tunisian IPO Highlights Growing Foreign Investor Appetite", "description": "A heavily oversubscribed IPO by one of Tunisia\u2019s key companies and smooth parliamentary elections held last weekend are helping the country attract more attention from foreign investors.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Javier Espinoza", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "A heavily oversubscribed IPO by one of Tunisia\u2019s key companies and smooth parliamentary elections held last weekend are helping the country attract more attention from foreign investors.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-10-29T17:45:31-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/29/tunisian-ipo-highlights-growing-foreign-investor-appetite-%e2%80%a8/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1308", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A heavily oversubscribed IPO by one of Tunisia\u2019s key companies and smooth parliamentary elections held last weekend are helping the country attract more attention from foreign investors.", "title": "Tunisian IPO Highlights Growing Foreign Investor Appetite", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/29/tunisian-ipo-highlights-growing-foreign-investor-appetite-%e2%80%a8/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FG828_tunisi_P_20141029124428.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1308", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-11-03T18:50:21-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c48\"", "article_summary": "Shares in Delice Holding, a consortium of companies that make dairy products, started trading on October 16 following an IPO that was almost 16-times oversubscribed.\nHamdi El Meddeb, founder of Delice Holding.\nThe company, which has a market capitalization of $475 million, sold 15% of its shares in the IPO.\nBoubaker Mehri, the firm\u2019s chief executive, says Delice Holding, which was founded by Hamdi Meddeb, was looking to come to market in an effort to attract foreign investment.\nObservers of the Tunisian market believe Delice Holding\u2019s IPO signals the strengthening of a stock market that, according to research provider Capital Cube, includes 72 listed companies with a total market capitalization of around $8.7 billion."}
