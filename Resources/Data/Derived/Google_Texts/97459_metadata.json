Roby, senior research scientist at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\n\n\u201cIn the L.A. area, UCLA is trying to broaden its reach into a larger part of L.A. County via purchases of medical groups and offices and partnerships with other providers as well,\u201d Roby said.\n\nSimilar collaborative efforts are being seen in the San Francisco Bay area as UC San Francisco Medical Center is reaching out to medical organizations in the East Bay, said Jan Emerson-Shea, vice president of external affairs for the California Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cWhile the ACA itself did not create the incentive, it seems to have accelerated changes in the market,\u201d said Roby.\n\n\u201cEvery provider needs a plan to take advantage of the new investments made by the ACA, via insurance coverage, grants, innovation models\u201d and other measures, Roby said.\n\nThese must be done while the providers adjust to the reimbursement changes in the law, through Medicare growth reductions and other measures, Roby said.\n\nEmerson-Shea said that as part of the ACA, California hospitals will lose some $22 billion in Medicare funding between now and 2023.\n\n\u201cI think Loma Linda University Medical Center could certainly develop a hub for specialty care for the Inland Empire and create strategic alliances to broaden its reach into the more rural areas ...,\u201d Roby said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the agreement becomes final, the LLU Health team will invest $50 million to help San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital complete a major expansion.\n\nThe Loma Linda medical center is seeking the alliance because it believes only those who create integrated health systems will thrive under the ACA, said Heinrich.\n\n\u201cYes, we need a partner\u201d for survival, said Kaibel. \u201cThey (LLU Health) bring a lot to the table. They seem to be the perfect fit as partners.\u201d\n\nThe hospital expansion is desperately needed to keep up with the explosive population growth in the San Gorgonio Pass, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Loma Linda University Medical Center is forging an alliance with a hospital in the San Gorgonio Pass.And the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, is cited as one of the major factors driving such hospital alliances up and down the stat", "title": "Loma Linda University, San Gorgonio Pass hospitals seek alliance", "og": {"url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20150703/loma-linda-university-san-gorgonio-pass-hospitals-seek-alliance", "image": {"width": "512px", "identifier": "http://local.sbsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sbsun_new.png", "height": "512px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Loma Linda University, San Gorgonio Pass hospitals seek alliance"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sbsun.com", "description": "Loma Linda University Medical Center is forging an alliance with a hospital in the San Gorgonio Pass.And the Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, is cited as one of the major factors driving such hospital alliances up and down the stat", "title": "Loma Linda University, San Gorgonio Pass hospitals seek alliance", "url": "http://www.sbsun.com/health/20150703/loma-linda-university-san-gorgonio-pass-hospitals-seek-alliance", "image": {"src": "http://local.sbsun.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/sbsun.png?052016"}, "site": "@sbsun", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563372734", "iphone": "id503662617", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sanbernardinosun"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Banning,Loma Linda,Loma Linda University Health, Access to health care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Banning,Loma Linda,Loma Linda University Health, Access to health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b8d\"", "article_summary": "Loma Linda University Medical Center is forging an alliance with a hospital in the San Gorgonio Pass.\nLoma Linda University Health and Adventist Health are negotiating a long-term contract with San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital to manage and operate the Banning hospital while its real-estate assets continue under the ownership of the San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital District, said Kerry Heinrich, chief executive officer at Loma Linda University Medical Center.\nThe Loma Linda medical center is seeking the alliance because it believes only those who create integrated health systems will thrive under the ACA, said Heinrich.\n\u201cCombining our current strengths with the long-standing history of Loma Linda University Health and Adventist Health was the best option for the community we serve,\u201d said Dr. Jerilynn Kaibel, San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital board chairwoman.\nAdvertisementIf the agreement becomes final, the LLU Health team will invest $50 million to help San Gorgonio Memorial Hospital complete a major expansion."}
