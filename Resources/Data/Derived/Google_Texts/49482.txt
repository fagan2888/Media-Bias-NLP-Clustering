Fulton, SD

It's been a difficult month for the Haag Family. We introduced you to them earlier this month after their home in Alexandria was destroyed by a fire. Now the generous community has given them hope, just in time for the holidays.

It was a fire that the Haag family will never forget. No one was home when the flames started, so no one was hurt. The fire destroyed their home of 12 years, and a left a hole in their hearts that will never be filled.

Now as they try and move on, the family of seven has a new roof over their heads. This home in Fulton was given to the Haags by another family after they moved into a new home. It might not replace what they lost, but it helps with getting their lives back to normal.

"The house has been good. It's roomy enough for all the kids and everything like that. So thankful to have the house," Chad Haag said.

The Haag family says they're overwhelmed with the support they've received from the community, especially this time of the year.

This spot in the living room would be empty, but a family member donated a Christmas tree. Chad's sister decided to give the family a little holiday cheer.

"She had it at her house unopened and she gave it to us so we'd have something," Sherry Haag said.

The presents sitting under the tree are also donated. Whether it's gifts, donations, or just an encouraging word, the Haags say their darkest moment has turned into the greatest moment in their community.

"I'm very thankful that there's so many generous people in South Dakota and I couldn't be happier to be from a state where everybody is so generous and caring for other people," Sherry said.

The family plans on spending their Christmas in Fulton. It's a new home for the family, and after everything they've been through, they have a new outlook this holiday season.

"I think we're more thankful for the things that we do have than what we can get," Sherry said.
