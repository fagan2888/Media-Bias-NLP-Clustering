Always has, always will.\n\nFrom the day he described his new position at OSU football as his \u201cNew York Yankees\u201d job, to the day he lambasted an OKC writer during his famous (or infamous, depending on your persuasion) \u2018I\u2019M FORTY\u2019 rant.\n\nFrom his clearly uncomfortable relationship with AD Mike Holder and the man with his name on the stadium to when Gundy and the mega booster publicly re-booted their relationship.\n\nFrom the time he called Dez Bryant a knucklehead, to the times soon after he referred to Dez as the greatest receiver in football.\n\nFrom the annual preseason Big 12 Coaches Media Days when he looks like he just stepped off the cover of GQ to Saturday night when he and his pal/son Gavin entered Chesapeake Arena for a prearranged pregame interview with ESPN unshaven, dressed in jeans, tennis shoes and an untucked orange knit shirt.\n\nWhether a fan of the winningest coach in OSU history or not, one thing is clear: Mike Gundy is true to Frank Sinatra\u2019s classic, I Did It My Way. Sometime between Gundy\u2019s interview with ESPN and tipoff of the Thunder vs. Golden State, we caught up with the always-cooperative Cowboy coach.\n\nAttached, you\u2019ll see our interview with Mike didn\u2019t disappoint. Where most coaches would do their best to avoid answering a question about an incoming transfer whose daddy just happened to be the greatest running back in college football history, Gundy not only answered questions, he was the one to initially bring up Barry J. Sanders. And when he did, he actually put a number of carries he anticipates next season for the Stanford transfer.\n\nThanks for checking in.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Dean caught up with Mike Gundy and discussed Barry J.
