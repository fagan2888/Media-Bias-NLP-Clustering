Eduardo Munoz/Reuters\n\nOne of Hillary Clinton\u2019s rivals for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination received an informal boost Wednesday from a curious source: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nMr. de Blasio, who managed Mrs. Clinton\u2019s winning 2000 campaign for Senate and supported her 2008 presidential bid, said at an unrelated news conference that \u201cI\u2019ve always liked what I heard from Bernie Sanders,\u201d the independent Vermont senator who is running for the Democratic 2016 nomination.\n\n\u201cI think Bernie Sanders is a great senator, is a great voice for a fair society and a fair economy,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. de Blasio, a Democrat, also said that he wouldn\u2019t attend Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign rally on Saturday in New York City, on Roosevelt Island.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting to hear, as I\u2019ve said, her larger vision for addressing income inequality,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said when asked if he would attend her June 13 event. \u201cI look forward to that.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio has sought lately to cast himself as a national voice for liberalism.\n\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t immediately respond a question about whether Mr. de Blasio was invited to the rally, nor to a request for comment on the mayor\u2019s remarks about Mr. Sanders.\n\nThe mayor also praised Mrs. Clinton more extensively on Wednesday than he has since the start of her campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very impressed by the comment she\u2019s given so far on a host of issues,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI saw her speech on voting rights \u2014 it was very powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought her vision for that was exactly right. I\u2019m very impressed by her criminal justice reform speech. What I am waiting to hear about is the fight against income inequality, how we raise wages and benefits.\u201d\n\nMrs. Clinton last week proposed that Americans be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they opt out, and called for an expansion of early-voting opportunities across the country.\n\nMr. de Blasio has had a lengthy relationship with both Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, in whose administration he worked as an official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Mr. de Blasio has distanced himself from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign or expressed reservations about her platform. In recent months he has said repeatedly that he hasn\u2019t decided whether to endorse her 2016 presidential bid.\n\nIn April, Mr. de Blasio said in an interview on NBC that he wouldn\u2019t endorse her \u201cuntil I see an actual vision of where they want to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a tremendous public servant,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cI think she is one of the most qualified people to ever run for this office. And by the way, thoroughly vetted, we can say that. But we need to see the substance.\u201d\n\nMara Gay contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s rivals for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination received an informal boost Wednesday from a curious source: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.", "title": "De Blasio to Skip Clinton Rally, Praises Rival Sanders", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/10/de-blasio-to-skip-clinton-rally-praises-rival-sanders/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IU873_NYMAYO_P_20150608162347.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "De Blasio to Skip Clinton Rally, Praises Rival Sanders", "description": "One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s rivals for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination received an informal boost Wednesday from a curious source: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Erica Orden", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s rivals for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination received an informal boost Wednesday from a curious source: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-10T21:56:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/10/de-blasio-to-skip-clinton-rally-praises-rival-sanders/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-55819", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s rivals for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination received an informal boost Wednesday from a curious source: Mrs. Clinton\u2019s former campaign manager, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.", "title": "De Blasio to Skip Clinton Rally, Praises Rival Sanders", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/06/10/de-blasio-to-skip-clinton-rally-praises-rival-sanders/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IU873_NYMAYO_P_20150608162347.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-55819", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-10T22:10:12-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2655\"", "article_summary": "Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, also said that he wouldn\u2019t attend Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign rally on Saturday in New York City, on Roosevelt Island.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Mr. de Blasio has distanced himself from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign or expressed reservations about her platform.\nA spokesman for Mrs. Clinton didn\u2019t immediately respond a question about whether Mr. de Blasio was invited to the rally, nor to a request for comment on the mayor\u2019s remarks about Mr. Sanders.\nThe mayor also praised Mrs. Clinton more extensively on Wednesday than he has since the start of her campaign.\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio last month."}
