One is the pop of backhands and forehands kicking up puffs of red clay. The other, getting ever louder, is the scratchy tick of life\u2019s clock.\n\nAt age 33, with 34 bearing down in August, time is increasingly the enemy to Federer\u2019s quest to add to his already record haul of Grand Slam titles.\n\nThe count climbed to 17 with his seventh win at Wimbledon in 2012, when he was still a young 30-year-old. Then, abruptly, it stopped. In Federer\u2019s golden spell from 2004-2009, there were 24 Grand Slam finals. Federer played in 20 of them, winning 14. But since his 2012 Wimbledon win against Andy Murray, just one of the 10 subsequent Grand Slam finals featured the Swiss: an epic five-setter lost to Novak Djokovic last year.\n\nOf all places for Federer to prove that he still has another major title in him, Roland Garros would seem the least favorable. The slow red dust blunts nuances of his game so effective on other, faster surfaces. Having one of the sharpest tactical minds and best right hands tennis has ever seen were never quite enough for Federer at the only major he\u2019s not won multiple times. He needed a sprinkling of luck, too. Federer\u2019s only victory at the French Open, in five finals, came in 2009 against Robin Soderling, who did him the favor of taking \u201cKing of Clay\u201d Rafael Nadal out of the picture in the fourth round.\n\nGood fortune, in the shape of Maria Sharapova\u2019s fingers, is smiling on Federer again this year. The defending women\u2019s champion, called upon to pluck out the seeded men\u2019s names in Friday\u2019s draw, delivered a road map that could hardly be more favorable for Federer.\n\nSixth-seeded Nadal and third-seeded Murray were both drawn in the half of top-seeded Djokovic. That means second-seeded Federer would only have to play, at most, one of those infernal three who beat him at the semifinal or final stage of majors in 2013 and 2014. And such a blockbuster match could only happen in the June 7 final, if Federer gets that far.\n\n\u201cThere is a chance to go very deep,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cHow deep remains to be seen depending on the level of play.\u201d\n\nFederer opens his 62nd consecutive Grand Slam campaign, extending his record, on Sunday against a qualifier. In the women\u2019s championship, last year\u2019s losing finalist Simona Halep, seeded three, opens against Evgeniya Rodina, ranked 91. The 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic plays Yaroslava Shvedova, quarterfinalist in 2010 and 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clock ticks but fortune smiles for Federer at French Open", "title": "Clock ticks but fortune smiles for Federer at French Open", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Clock ticks but fortune smiles for Federer at French Open", "title": "Clock ticks but fortune smiles for Federer at French Open", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/clock_ticks_but_fortune_smiles_for_federer_at_french_open/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/french-open-mens-capsules-tennis.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Clock ticks but fortune smiles for Federer at French Open", "title": "Clock ticks but fortune smiles for Federer at French Open", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/french-open-mens-capsules-tennis.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "John Leicester", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In Federer\u2019s golden spell from 2004-2009, there were 24 Grand Slam finals.\nBut since his 2012 Wimbledon win against Andy Murray, just one of the 10 subsequent Grand Slam finals featured the Swiss: an epic five-setter lost to Novak Djokovic last year.\nAt age 33, with 34 bearing down in August, time is increasingly the enemy to Federer\u2019s quest to add to his already record haul of Grand Slam titles.\nThe count climbed to 17 with his seventh win at Wimbledon in 2012, when he was still a young 30-year-old.\n\u201cHow deep remains to be seen depending on the level of play.\u201dFederer opens his 62nd consecutive Grand Slam campaign, extending his record, on Sunday against a qualifier."}
