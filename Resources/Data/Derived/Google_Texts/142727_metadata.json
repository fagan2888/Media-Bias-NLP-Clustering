Whedbee, a 50-year-old derrickhand, was helping another worker remove a pipe fitting on top of the well when it suddenly blew.\n\nShare Your Workers\u2019 Comp Story As part of our ongoing investigation, we invite you to tell us about your experience navigating the workers\u2019 comp system. Have something we should look into? Share Your Story How Much Is Your Arm Worth? Depends On Where You Work Each state determines its own workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which means workers in neighboring states can end up with dramatically different compensation for identical injuries. Read the Story The Fallout of Workers\u2019 Comp \u2018Reforms\u2019: 5 Tales of Harm Injured workers share their stories, revealing the real-life impact of rollbacks that have been spreading across the country. Read the Story\n\nOil and sludge pressurized at more than 700 pounds per square inch tore into Whedbee\u2019s body, ripping his left arm off just below the elbow. Coworkers jerry-rigged a tourniquet from a sweatshirt and a ratchet strap to stanch his bleeding and got his wife on the phone.\n\n\u201cBabe,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201ctell everyone I love them.\u201d\n\nIt was exactly the sort of accident that workers\u2019 compensation was designed for. Until recently, America\u2019s workers could rely on a compact struck at the dawn of the Industrial Age: They would give up their right to sue. In exchange, if they were injured on the job, their employers would pay their medical bills and enough of their wages to help them get by while they recovered.\n\nNo longer.\n\nOver the past decade, state after state has been dismantling America\u2019s workers\u2019 comp system with disastrous consequences for many of the hundreds of thousands of people who suffer serious injuries at work each year, a ProPublica and NPR investigation has found.\n\nThe cutbacks have been so drastic in some places that they virtually guarantee injured workers will plummet into poverty. Workers often battle insurance companies for years to get the surgeries, prescriptions and basic help their doctors recommend.\n\nTwo-and-a-half years after he lost his arm, Whedbee is still fighting with North Dakota\u2019s insurance agency for the prosthesis that his doctor says would give him a semblance of his former life.\n\nThe changes, often passed under the banner of \u201creform,\u201d have been pushed by big businesses and insurance companies on the false premise that costs are out of control.\n\nIn fact, employers are paying the lowest rates for workers\u2019 comp insurance since the 1970s. And in 2013, insurers had their most profitable year in over a decade, bringing in a hefty 18 percent return.\n\nDespite the setbacks he\u2019s faced with his injury and workers\u2019 comp, Dennis Whedbee has tried to maintain an active life, waking early for yard sales, cooking homemade spaghetti sauce and throwing a football with his grandsons. Here, he walks his grandson Haven, 2, back inside their home in Homer City, Pennsylvania. (Jeff Swensen for ProPublica)\n\nAll the while, employers have found someone else to foot the bill for workplace accidents: American taxpayers, who shell out tens of billions of dollars a year through Social Security Disability Insurance, Medicare and Medicaid for lost wages and medical costs not covered by workers\u2019 comp.\n\nProPublica analyzed reams of insurance industry data, studied arcane state laws and obtained often confidential medical and court records to provide an unprecedented look at the unwinding of workers\u2019 comp laws across the country.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nSince 2003, legislators in 33 states have passed workers\u2019 comp laws that reduce benefits or make it more difficult for those with certain injuries and diseases to qualify for them. Florida has cut benefits to its most severely disabled workers by 65 percent since 1994.\n\nWhere a worker gets hurt matters. Because each state has developed its own system, an amputated arm can literally be worth two or three times as much on one side of a state line than the other. The maximum compensation for the loss of an eye is $27,280 in Alabama, but $261,525 in Pennsylvania.\n\nMany states have not only shrunk the payments to injured workers, they\u2019ve also cut them off after an arbitrary time limit \u2014 even if workers haven\u2019t recovered. After John Coffell hurt his back at an Oklahoma tire plant last year, his wages dropped so dramatically that he and his family were evicted from their home.\n\nEmployers and insurers increasingly control medical decisions, such as whether an injured worker needs surgery. In 37 states, workers can\u2019t pick their own doctor or are restricted to a list provided by their employers.\n\nIn California, insurers can now reopen old cases and deny medical care based on the opinions of doctors who never see the patient and don\u2019t even have to be licensed in the state. Joel Ramirez, who was paralyzed in a warehouse accident, had his home health aide taken away, leaving him to sit in his own feces for up to eight hours.\n\nThe scope of the changes, and the extent to which taxpayers are paying the costs of workplace accidents, has attracted almost no national attention, in part because the federal government stopped monitoring state workers\u2019 comp laws more than a decade ago.\n\nThe cuts have gone so deep in some states that judges who hear workers\u2019 comp cases, top defense attorneys for companies and even the father of the modern workers\u2019 comp system say they are inhumane.\n\nPresented with ProPublica and NPR\u2019s findings, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., one of the leading worker advocates in Congress, said the changes undermine the basic protections for injured workers.\n\nThe rollback \u201cwould be bad if it were happening in one state,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact that a number of states have moved in this direction is disturbing and it should be unacceptable to people in both political parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey call them reforms,\u201d Casey added. \u201cThat\u2019s a real insult to workers.\u201d\n\n33 States Have Cut Benefits or Made it Harder to Qualify.

Brian Bingman, the Republican president pro tem of the Oklahoma Senate. \u201cYour workers\u2019 comp rates are way too high.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s 2013 reform law provided tremendous cost savings, he said, and its supporters proudly acknowledge it was written primarily by a young lawyer at a drilling company and a lobbyist for the state chamber of commerce.\n\nThey call them reforms. That\u2019s a real insult to workers. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa.\n\nWhile the vast majority of injured workers need only minor medical care and experience little friction in getting it, the changes often affect those who need the system the most.\n\nAfter Whedbee lost his arm, his doctor said he\u2019d be an ideal candidate for a modern prosthesis with a movable hand.\n\nBut North Dakota\u2019s workers\u2019 comp insurer sent him to another doctor \u2014 not in North Dakota or his home state of Pennsylvania \u2014 but in Minnesota. After seeing him once, that doctor recommended a cheaper prosthesis with a metal hook.\n\n\u201cI lost a hand,\u201d Whedbee pleaded with the insurer to no avail. \u201cI didn\u2019t lose a hook.\u201d\n\nThe Industrial Revolution and the Nixon Commission\n\nWorkers\u2019 comp was born in the early 1900s as a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d forged by business and labor as awareness grew about the grisly workplace accidents that came with industrialization.\n\n\u201cAs the work is done for the employer, and therefore ultimately for the public,\u201d President Theodore Roosevelt said in 1907, \u201cit is a bitter injustice that it should be the wage-worker himself and his wife and children who bear the whole penalty.\u201d\n\nIn return for a measure of a security, workers gave up their right to sue their employers \u2014 even in cases of gross negligence \u2014 protecting businesses from lawsuit judgments that could bankrupt them. By 1920, nearly every state had enacted workers\u2019 comp laws.\n\nThe systems differed in their particulars but aimed to answer the same questions: Is an injury work-related? What\u2019s the appropriate medical care? How much compensation should injured workers receive and for how long? Each decision affected employers\u2019 costs as well as workers\u2019 solvency and well-being.\n\nThe first national assessment of workers\u2019 comp protections came in the early 1970s when Congress established a commission to study state laws as part of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\n\nConvened by President Richard Nixon and led by John Burton, a Republican economist and law professor, the commission unanimously concluded that state laws were \u201cinadequate and inequitable.\u201d\n\nEmployers Complain of Rising Premiums, But Workers\u2019 Comp Is at 25-Year Low Despite the drumbeat of complaints about costs, employers are paying the lowest rates for workers\u2019 compensation insurance than at any time in the past 25 years, even as the costs of health care have increased dramatically. In 2014, employers in North Dakota paid the least, averaging $0.88 for every $100 they paid workers in wages. In 1988, North Dakota averaged $2.39. California employers pay the most: $3.48, which is still far cheaper than the rates they paid in 1988.

Note: There are two additional data sources available for understanding employer costs in regards to workers\u2019 compensation \u2014 the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Academy of Social Insurance. ProPublica selected Oregon's data because it was the most suited for comparisons between states. While all three studies vary in exact cost from year to year, the downward trend is reflected in all three. A specific company's premium will be determined by its industry, injury experience, and any discounts offered by its insurance company.\n\nThe commission made dozens of recommendations that laid the foundation for modern workers\u2019 comp systems: Nearly every employee should be covered. Workers should be able to pick their own doctors. If employees couldn\u2019t work, they should get two-thirds of their wages up to at least the state\u2019s average wage. Compensation should last as long as the person is disabled, with no arbitrary caps. Spouses should receive death benefits until they remarry, children until they graduate college.\n\nIn 1972, the commission advised Congress to mandate 19 of these recommendations as minimum federal standards if states didn\u2019t enact the provisions on their own. States quickly did. But over time the political winds shifted. A wave of cutbacks began in the 1990s, swelled in the mid-2000s and, after slowing during the recession, picked up again.\n\nThe U.S. Labor Department used to keep track of how states complied with the presidential commission\u2019s recommendations, but stopped after budget cuts in 2004.\n\nA ProPublica analysis of state laws done in consultation with Burton found that only seven states now follow at least 15 of the recommendations made during the Nixon administration. Four states comply with less than half of them.\n\nThe recent changes are \u201cunprecedented in the history of workers\u2019 comp,\u201d Burton said in an interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re in a pretty vicious period right now of racing to the bottom.\u201d\n\nSaving Companies Money, Forcing Workers Into Poverty\n\nSitting at a table on the 10th floor of a Tulsa office building, Mark Schell, senior vice president and general counsel of the Unit Corporation drilling company, argued that Oklahoma\u2019s old workers\u2019 comp system was bad for employers and workers alike.\n\nLawyers had clogged the workers\u2019 comp courts while doctors approved costly, unnecessary medical care. Oklahoma cut benefits three times between 2005 and 2011, resulting in a 10 percent drop in employers\u2019 insurance rates. But other states experienced even steeper drops in costs, leaving Oklahoma comparatively expensive, he said, especially against neighbors like Texas and Arkansas.\n\nWorkers\u2019 Comp Costs Have Been Going Down, While Other Employer Costs Go Up Employers complain about the burden of workers\u2019 comp, but the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance has fallen since 1991. Meanwhile, employer costs for health insurance and retirement benefits have increased significantly.

Nodding to his firm\u2019s associate general counsel, Drew Harding, across the table, he noted, \u201cDrew was one of the main authors of the bill.\u201d\n\nBuried among a number of changes, from altering how disputes are heard to letting employers opt out of workers\u2019 comp entirely, the reform cut the maximum wage-replacement benefits for injured workers from $801 a week to $561 a week. The new rate was the third lowest in the country.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s lobbyist, Jonathan Buxton, rationalized the cuts as tough love for Oklahoma workers. \u201cGetting them healed and back to work is the goal of our system, and it\u2019s better incentivized now,\u201d he said.\n\nProPublica\u2019s review of workers\u2019 comp changes nationwide found that many were steered by big business, aided by the recent Republican takeovers of state legislatures.\n\nWhile rising medical expenses have long concerned insurers, the reforms were mostly driven by the recessions of 2001 and 2007-2009, which pitted states in a seemingly endless competition to lure business with lower costs. Even in states dominated by Democrats, worker advocates have been forced to make major concessions to achieve slight increases in benefits \u2014 sometimes just to keep up with inflation.\n\nFlorida, New York and Tennessee have chopped compensation for workers with permanent partial disabilities \u2014 such as debilitating back injuries \u2014 by at least 20 percent.\n\nIn California, West Virginia, North Dakota and Oklahoma, lawmakers have placed time limits on wages for temporarily disabled workers, limiting such benefits to two years even for those who can\u2019t go back to work or need more medical care.\n\nFew of the cuts were driven by concerns about fraud, which is estimated to account for only a small percentage of the $60 billion spent on workers\u2019 comp each year. And studies show most of the money lost to fraud results not from workers making false claims but from employers misclassifying workers and underreporting payroll to get cheaper insurance rates.\n\nRecently, some judges have questioned whether states have cut too deeply in the name of saving employers money.\n\nIn August, a Florida circuit court judge ruled that the state\u2019s workers\u2019 comp law was unconstitutional, saying benefits had been \u201cdecimated\u201d and the law \u201cfails miserably\u201d as to safety, health, welfare and morals. If the ruling is upheld, workers in Florida would be able to sue their employers, and the legislature would have to rewrite the law.\n\nBut in many states, few people \u2014 even the lawmakers who sponsored bills paring back benefits \u2014 seem to fully understand the bills\u2019 impact on workers.\n\nBefore his injury, John Coffell, 30, was solidly part of the nation\u2019s blue-collar rank and file.\n\nHe made $17.42 an hour as a tread booker at a Goodyear Tire & Rubber plant in Lawton, Oklahoma. With overtime and bonuses, he was earning close to $1,000 a week. It still wasn\u2019t easy for a family with three kids, but he and his wife were managing.\n\nThen, on a graveyard shift last July, Coffell was winding long strips of rubber compound onto heavy metal spools and loading them onto a truck when he felt a pinch and burning sensation in his lower back.\n\n\u201cAs time went on throughout the night, it got worse and worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurt when I walked. It hurt when I stood up. It hurt when I sat down.\u201d\n\nWhen the pain didn\u2019t go away, he was prescribed physical therapy and placed on temporary disability.\n\nIf Coffell had been hurt a few months earlier, workers\u2019 comp would have provided close to his take-home pay. But under the new law that took effect in early 2014, his disability check was capped at $561 a week \u2014 just above the poverty line for a family of five.\n\nA high summer electricity bill and some unexpected fees from the credit union had already put the family behind. With less money coming in, things slid downhill quickly. The utilities went first, followed by Coffell\u2019s truck, which was repossessed. Then the family received a letter from their landlord evicting them from their rental home.\n\nBecause none of their relatives had room for them all, the family had to split up.\n\nCoffell\u2019s wife, Justine, helped look after him. They alternated between his grandmother\u2019s small home and her father\u2019s camper. The kids, ages 5, 7 and 9, moved in with John\u2019s mother 40 miles away.\n\nJohn and Justine had only enough gas money to see them on weekends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of those families, we lived paycheck to paycheck,\u201d John said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have all the bills caught up, but I had plans to get them caught up with being able to work and get overtime. My dominoes were stacked and they got knocked over \u2014 all for getting hurt.\u201d\n\nSince John went on workers\u2019 comp, the Coffells have had to fill the gap by filing for food stamps. Such cost-shifting has become common. Dozens of injured workers said in interviews they\u2019ve been forced to seek help from government programs because workers\u2019 comp fell short.\n\nA study by J. Paul Leigh, a health economist at the University of California, Davis, estimated that workers\u2019 comp covered less than a third of injured workers\u2019 medical costs and lost earnings in 2007 and that government programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid had shelled out about $30 billion to fill part of the gap.\n\nThe rest came from regular health and disability insurance or out of workers\u2019 pockets, Leigh said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about taxpayers picking up the bill of something that should have been paid for by workers\u2019 compensation insurers,\u201d Leigh said.\n\nBingman, the Oklahoma state senator who sponsored the 2013 workers\u2019 comp cutbacks, said he couldn\u2019t speak to the particulars of Coffell\u2019s plight and wasn\u2019t aware of similar complaints from other injured workers.\n\nBut if such hardships were \u201ca pattern,\u201d Bingman said, it would be \u201csomething we need to look at.\u201d\n\nCoffell, like most workers, had no idea his benefits were shrinking until he got hurt.\n\nJohn Coffell lies on a bed in his grandmother\u2019s living room outside Hulen, Oklahoma as his sons watched cartoons, and his daughter, in pigtails and an orange tutu, bounced on a ball nearby. (Brett Deering/AP for ProPublica)\n\nTwo days after Labor Day, Goodyear sent Coffell to see an occupational medicine specialist in Oklahoma City for an exam that would determine his future.\n\nWhether Coffell had pulled a muscle or herniated a disc in his spine was critical. Under a 2005 reform, Oklahoma workers with soft-tissue injuries, like muscle strains, were limited to eight weeks of benefits. And Coffell\u2019s eight weeks were about to run out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand how they expect someone to live in this much pain,\u201d Justine Coffell said after her husband limped into the doctor\u2019s office. \u201cHe falls when he stands up sometimes. His leg just gives out.\u201d\n\nAn hour later, John gingerly walked back to where Justine was sitting. \u201cYou want to tie my shoes for me?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe next week, Coffell got the medical report. The results were mixed: The doctor agreed that he had injured his spine at work and would need further treatment, which would be covered by workers\u2019 comp. But he was not \u201ctemporarily totally disabled,\u201d the doctor said, meaning his disability checks would stop and \u2014 pain or no pain \u2014 he would have to go back to work.\n\nA few weeks later, Coffell fell returning home after 12 hours on his light duty job at Goodyear and ended up in the emergency room. Soon after, he was finally approved for surgery to shave down a bulging disc.\n\nHe now waits to see if that will allow him to return to work and to begin putting his family\u2019s life back together. But neither he nor his family can forget the way the workers\u2019 safety net allowed them to plunge to the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like someone is sitting here shaking a snow globe,\u201d Justine Coffell said. \u201cAs soon as the dust settles, we get hit twice as hard.\u201d\n\n\u2018Is a Hook Going to Help Me Tie My Own Shoes Again?\u2019\n\nOn top of reducing benefits or capping the time injured workers can receive them, states have found another way to cut workers\u2019 comp costs: shifting control over medical decisions from workers and their doctors to employers and their insurers.\n\nThanks to a 2011 reform in Montana, for example, once insurers accept claims, they can choose workers\u2019 doctors and change them at any time. In 2013, Georgia ended the promise of lifetime medical care for workers\u2019 injuries, capping it at eight years for all but the worst cases. As a result, workers who have had hips or knees replaced because of workplace accidents may be out of luck when the devices wear out.\n\nOther states, like Illinois and Delaware, have enacted more subtle changes, such as placing strict caps on payments to doctors and hospitals through medical fee schedules. The measures help control costs, but, critics say, they also cause some doctors to stop taking workers\u2019 comp patients.\n\nI lost a hand, I didn\u2019t lose a hook. Dennis Whedbee\n\nAs Dennis Whedbee found out, North Dakota \u2014 like California and Texas \u2014 has increased its use of outside medical reviewers who can deny recommended treatments or rule that injuries aren\u2019t work related after only brief exams or by merely reading medical records.\n\nAfter the oilfield explosion, Whedbee was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Bismarck and eventually sent home to Homer City, Pennsylvania. He and his wife, Dori, struggled to come to terms with what happened and waited anxiously to hear how North Dakota\u2019s workers\u2019 comp system would help them. They would drive down the road to cry because they didn\u2019t want their grandchildren, who were living with them, to see their tears.\n\nWhedbee\u2019s surgeon in North Dakota referred him to Dr. Marshall Balk, an orthopedic surgeon in the Pittsburgh area. Balk recommended that Whedbee be fitted with a myoelectric prosthesis, which has a realistic hand with movable fingers that are controlled by the muscles in the remaining part of the arm.\n\nBalk noted that such a prosthesis would be ideal for Whedbee because he still had the muscles in his upper forearm and led an active life, according to court documents.\n\nRather than accept the doctor\u2019s recommendation, North Dakota\u2019s Workforce Safety & Insurance agency (WSI) \u2014 the government entity that is the state\u2019s sole workers\u2019 comp insurer \u2014 flew Whedbee to Minneapolis to see Dr. Ronald Bateman, a medical examiner, for a second opinion.\n\nA myoelectric prosthesis is \u201cvery fragile and expensive to repair,\u201d Bateman said in his report, and could also strain Whedbee\u2019s still-healing shoulder. Instead, he recommended a prosthesis with a split hook. But Bateman failed to note that the split hook, which is only a few ounces lighter, opens and closes by moving the shoulder.\n\nAlso not mentioned in the report was this salient fact: The hook costs $50,000 less than the myoelectric prosthesis, which, according to the state runs about $70,000.\n\nIn appealing the agency\u2019s denial, Whedbee listed 12 reasons why the split-hook prosthesis wouldn\u2019t work for him. Among them: \u201cI can\u2019t pick up grand baby.\u201d \u201cTry cutting up meat or veggies with one hand.\u201d \u201cIs a hook going to help me tie my own shoes again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI deserve as normal [a] life as I had before the accident,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe agency denied his appeal, even though insurers in states like Georgia and Alabama, which have some of the lowest benefits in the country, routinely provide myoelectric prostheses, according to workers and attorneys there.\n\nDennis Whedbee fishes for trout in Two Lick Creek in Homer City, Pennsylvania. He has been fighting workers\u2019 comp for two-and-a-half years to get the prosthesis that will help restore some semblance of his former life. (Jeff Swensen for ProPublica)\n\nUnbeknownst to Whedbee, since the early 1990s, North Dakota has steadily made it harder for workers to get benefits for their injuries.\n\nA company recently hired by the state auditor to review the system found that when disputes occur, WSI relied entirely on out-of-state physicians mostly working for private companies that perform medical reviews for insurers. These doctors reversed the recommendations of workers\u2019 physicians 75 percent of the time, the September report by Sedgwick Claims Management Services found.\n\nWSI\u2019s own medical director, Dr. Luis Vilella, questioned the impartiality of medical decisions in a letter to WSI\u2019s top administrator last year, saying the agency\u2019s lawyers overrode valid medical opinions and diagnoses to beat back the appeals of injured workers.\n\nVilella, who resigned in August, observed that \u201cthe cost of fairness seems to be exceptionally high for North Dakota injured workers.\u201d (Vilella did not return calls for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nIn an interview, WSI director Bryan Klipfel said there was \u201creally no merit\u201d to Vilella\u2019s concerns. The agency uses outside medical exams in only a small number of cases, he said, and goes out of state because it has had trouble finding doctors in North Dakota willing to do them. The agency\u2019s surveys show injured workers are satisfied with the care they receive, Klipfel said.\n\nWorker advocates say such explanations fail to acknowledge that most claims involve simple strains or stitched wounds, which aren\u2019t controversial. The most severe \u2014 and expensive \u2014 injuries are often the ones that end up in dispute.\n\nThe system \u201cisn\u2019t only designed for the short-term, easily diagnosed diseases and injuries; it\u2019s supposed to be for all of them,\u201d said Emily Spieler, a Northeastern University law professor and former head of the West Virginia workers\u2019 comp system.\n\nKlipfel defended the agency\u2019s handling of Whedbee\u2019s case, saying, \u201cWe felt we made the right decision.\u201d\n\nWhedbee\u2019s employer, Black Hawk Energy Services, hired him back as a safety technician as his case worked its way through the courts. Workers can appeal WSI denials, but the legislature has greatly restricted the courts\u2019 ability to overrule them. And in 2013, lawmakers amended the law to specify that no deference should be given to the worker\u2019s treating doctor.\n\nIn March 2014, Whedbee\u2019s attorney, Stephen Little, told the North Dakota Supreme Court that WSI was looking for the cheapest solution. Whedbee was more than a \u201cwage slave,\u201d he wrote in his brief. He was also \u201ca Little League coach, hunter, fisherman, bicyclist, outdoorsman, taxidermist and cook.\u201d\n\nA WSI lawyer responded that the agency had considered Whedbee\u2019s life outside his job. But the agency also needed to consider cost, he said.\n\nWhedbee has applied for a number of jobs in the oil industry since being laid off just before Christmas 2013. But he says companies lose interest when they learn he\u2019s missing an arm.\n\nNow 53, with sun-weathered skin and a brownish-gray goatee, Whedbee has refused to get the split-hook prosthesis. Instead, he got a tattoo of a severed, bloody hand on the end of his arm with the words: \u201cLost 9-23-12.\u201d\n\nDennis Whedbee got a tattoo of his lost hand after workers\u2019 comp offered him a prosthesis with a hook instead of the one with a hand his doctor recommended. \u201cI got tired of people staring at it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I thought, you know what, I\u2019ll just put it on and let them know what happened.\u201d (Jeff Swensen for ProPublica)\n\nMeanwhile, WSI\u2019s hard line has helped make it, and the state\u2019s employers, very flush. The agency can invest the surplus when insurance premiums exceed the amount needed to cover injuries. After reserves are met and if investments do well, money is then returned to employers in the form of dividends.\n\nSince 2005, WSI has paid about $900 million back to employers.\n\nThe dividends given out in 2013 alone, a ProPublica analysis of federal injury data shows, could have paid for myoelectric prostheses for every U.S. worker who has lost an arm or hand on the job since 2001.\n\nAnonymous Doctors Never See Patients\n\nUnlike Whedbee, Joel Ramirez, a 48-year-old paraplegic in California, never even got to see the doctor who took away his medical care.\n\nLast June \u2014 without examining Ramirez or even sending someone to assess his daily struggles \u2014 his former employer\u2019s insurance company terminated the home health aide he relied on.\n\nSuch cases underscore the consequences as states seek to streamline disputes and take more control of medical costs. But along the way, such provisions have tilted systems in favor of employers and stripped away fundamental protections that guaranteed workers the right to be examined by doctors and heard by judges.\n\nA 2012 California law, supported by both business and labor, was intended to solve problems with an earlier reform that had left workers waiting months to see impartial doctors and months more for administrative hearings.\n\nUnder the new process, disputes are decided by independent medical reviewers chosen by a state contractor. These doctors, many of whom are licensed out of state, rely solely on medical records and remain anonymous. Their decisions can\u2019t be overturned except in limited cases.\n\n\u201cI Try to Forget\u201d Paralyzed in a warehouse accident, Joel Ramirez has battled California\u2019s workers\u2019 comp system. View Photos\n\nLawmakers also added a surprising twist: The medical dispute process wouldn\u2019t just apply to new cases, but retroactively. Suddenly every treatment request in the system \u2014 whether it be for surgery or a simple prescription refill \u2014 could now be subject to reviews by insurance company doctors and compared against more rigid medical treatment guidelines that might not have been in place when care was approved.\n\nWhen the law took effect for old cases in July 2013, it quickly proved as problematic as the one it replaced \u2014 and insurance premiums went up. A process that was supposed to take less than six weeks has often stretched to six months.\n\nAnd reviewers routinely rule against injured workers\u2019 doctors, denying treatment in 91 percent of disputes, according to preliminary data to be released this month by the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Institute, an insurance research group.\n\nThat\u2019s more than twice the denial rate for patients under regular group health plans, according to the California Applicants\u2019 Attorneys Association, which represents workers\u2019 lawyers.\n\nChristine Baker, the state official who oversees workers\u2019 comp in California, said the number of claims that reach medical review is very low and the reform has provided an important check on costs. Most of the denials, she added, represent \u201cinappropriate care,\u201d such as overprescribing addictive painkillers.\n\nThe reform is \u201cspeeding up the decision-making process,\u201d Baker said, noting that the initial backlog is now under control. \u201cWorkers are getting their treatment and a decision made about that treatment much quicker.\u201d\n\nBut in some instances, records and interviews show, injured workers have been denied treatment simply because the reviewer didn\u2019t have the right medical records.\n\nSome of the harshest criticism of the new system is coming from a surprising source: the judges who hear workers\u2019 appeals.\n\n\u201cThe only interest that\u2019s being protected here is industry,\u201d said Judge John C. Gutierrez, a workers\u2019 comp jurist for 22 years, in an interview a few hours after his retirement party in January. \u201cI feel that their financial influence has had an impact on how this legislation came out.\u201d\n\nWorkers, he said, \u201care losing their voice.\u201d\n\nIn Ramirez\u2019s case, Travelers Insurance relied on the opinion of a doctor with no background treating spinal cord injuries who later withdrew his opinion and said he didn\u2019t know he was denying 24-hour home health care.\n\nThe only interest that\u2019s being protected here is industry. Judge John C. Gutierrez\n\nRamirez had worked for 17 years at Kuehne + Nagel, the second largest freight forwarder in the world, climbing his way up from temp worker to warehouse supervisor. One day in July 2009, his boss asked him to move a crate. Ramirez pulled it out with a piece of equipment called a pallet jack. But as he turned his back to operate the jack, he heard a whooshing sound. A nearly 900-pound crate loaded with boxes full of satellite dish mounting poles came crashing down on him.\n\nThe crate, which OSHA said had been unsafely stacked, folded Ramirez\u2019s body in half, crushing his spinal column and pinning his head between his feet.\n\n\u201cI started howling and yelling in Spanish and English,\u201d he said. As blood poured from his mouth, he managed to tell his coworkers he couldn\u2019t feel his legs anymore.\n\nTravelers, the company\u2019s workers\u2019 comp carrier, began providing Ramirez with 24-hour home health care. In August 2012, a judge ruled him permanently and totally disabled and awarded him coverage for future medical care.\n\nThe system appeared to be working. But a month later, the governor signed the new law, making old cases like Ramirez\u2019s subject to the new review process.\n\nAccording to medical and court records, in early 2014, Ramirez\u2019s physician submitted an unrelated request for additional care. Travelers sought a second opinion and then used what appeared to be only a slight modification to reassess the entirety of Ramirez\u2019s home care plan.\n\nThe decision to take away his support and leave him without a way to care for himself, Ramirez said, made him \u201cfeel like less than nothing.\u201d\n\nWithout his aide, the indignities for Ramirez began almost immediately. Unable to sense his bodily functions, he has at times been left soaking in his own urine or feces, waiting for his wife or children to come home from work, school or a trip to the pharmacy.\n\nWithout his aide, the indignities for Ramirez began almost immediately. He has fallen several times and been left to sit in his own urine and feces for hours. His wife, Lupita, had to give up her job cleaning houses to care for him. (Patrick T. Fallon for ProPublica)\n\nHe fell several times trying to transfer from his wheelchair to the couch, lying helplessly as his wife and daughter struggled to pick him up.\n\nHis wife had to give up her job cleaning houses to care for him. His daughter quit college and works at a casino to help out financially.\n\nIn emailed responses, Travelers officials said they \u201csympathize\u201d with Ramirez and his family, and that the case was \u201cunfortunate and complicated.\u201d But they insist Travelers did not use the new law to withdraw the aide, and only did so after a routine review of his care. A judge, however, said otherwise and ordered the company to restore the aide.\n\nTold of Ramirez\u2019s situation, Baker said it was \u201cterrible\u201d and not how the system was intended to work.\n\nThe state workers\u2019 comp division is planning to update the home health care guideline after determining from a number of similar cases that it was too narrow and \u201cdoes not meet what we want to have in California,\u201d said Dr. Rupali Das, the division\u2019s medical director.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Ramirez lay on his couch in Rialto, California, after a long day traveling to doctors\u2019 appointments. Covering the wall were collage frames full of family photos \u2014 Ramirez holding an American flag the day he became a citizen, his daughter in a purple gown celebrating her quincea\u00f1era, and he and his wife dressed up when they used to spend the weekends dancing to Mexican and country music.\n\n\u201cWe were really good at dancing together,\u201d he said. \u201cSince my accident, I try to forget about music because I just get sad.\u201d\n\nHe breathed in and exhaled deeply.\n\nIn late October, Ramirez got some good news. Travelers reinstated his home health aide under orders from the state Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.\n\nBut Ramirez now feels doubly vulnerable, knowing how easily his critical support could be taken away.\n\nLying awake at night, Ramirez wonders what will happen when he gets older, when he and his wife have even less strength, when his kids have families of their own.\n\n\u201cThose moments, they make you think it\u2019s better to die before that happens,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live like that.\u201d\n\nThis story was co-published with NPR.\n\nMichael Grabell covers economic and labor issues for ProPublica and has previously reported on temp agencies, the stimulus, and the TSA.", "article_metadata": {"premium": "true", "description": "Over the past decade, states have slashed workers\u2019 compensation benefits, denying injured workers help when they need it most and shifting the costs of workplace accidents to taxpayers.", "author": "Michael Grabell", "og": {"site_name": "ProPublica", "description": "Over the past decade, states have slashed workers\u2019 compensation benefits, denying injured workers help when they need it most and shifting the costs of workplace accidents to taxpayers.", "title": "The Demolition of Workers\u2019 Compensation", "url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/the-demolition-of-workers-compensation", "image": "https://www.propublica.org/images/ngen/gypsy_og_image/20150304-workers-comp-1200x630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Over the past decade, states have slashed workers\u2019 compensation benefits, denying injured workers help when they need it most and shifting the costs of workplace accidents to taxpayers.", "title": "The Demolition of Workers\u2019 Compensation", "url": "https://www.propublica.org/article/the-demolition-of-workers-compensation", "image": {"src": "https://www.propublica.org/images/ngen/gypsy_og_image/20150304-workers-comp-1200x630.jpg"}, "creator": "@MichaelGrabell", "site": "@ProPublica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "project": "Insult to Injury", "fb": {"app_id": 229862657130557, "pages": 13320939444}, "google-site-verification": "R7yl3d-Z-qHW6xTItWhBYggGROoZNgEVh2z6dVneuIM", "article": {"section": "Insult to Injury", "published_time": "2015-03-04T06:00:38-0600", "modified_time": "2015-06-23T18:00:39-0500", "author": "http://www.propublica.org/site/author/michael_grabell/"}, "type": "article", "scope": "Medium", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dec\"", "article_summary": "Share Your Workers\u2019 Comp Story As part of our ongoing investigation, we invite you to tell us about your experience navigating the workers\u2019 comp system.\nRaised Benefits Cut Benefits Workers\u2019 Compensation Reforms by State Explore the full interactive for details of workers\u2019 comp reforms in each state, as well as sources.\nWorkers\u2019 Comp Costs Have Been Going Down, While Other Employer Costs Go Up Employers complain about the burden of workers\u2019 comp, but the cost of workers\u2019 compensation insurance has fallen since 1991.\nDozens of injured workers said in interviews they\u2019ve been forced to seek help from government programs because workers\u2019 comp fell short.\nDepends On Where You Work Each state determines its own workers\u2019 compensation benefits, which means workers in neighboring states can end up with dramatically different compensation for identical injuries."}
