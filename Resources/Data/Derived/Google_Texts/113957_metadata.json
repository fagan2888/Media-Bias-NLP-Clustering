They wrote, \u201dWhile the federal government has emphasized research on the potential harms associated with the use of marijuana, there is still very limited research on the potential health benefits of marijuana \u2014 despite the fact that millions of Americans are now eligible\n\nby state law to use the drug for medical purposes.\u201d\n\nThe Senators applauded a recent decision by the Department of Health and Human Services to eliminate the HHS Public Health Service review process. But they also acknowledged the drawbacks of NIDA\u2019s monopoly on supply of marijuana for research purposes and the need for alternative providers.\n\nSenators also questioned marijuana\u2019s current classification as a Schedule 1 drug under federal law and its classification under international treaties and if the FDA is prepared to call for the reclassification of cannabidiol.\n\nAddressed to the heads of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the letter signals to many that medical marijuana is becoming an even more important issue in the political sphere not only to voters but also to their elected officials.\n\nCo-signing the letter with Senator Warren were Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). The Senators are seeking a reply to their questions from the administration by August 31.\n\nSource: NORML - make a donation", "article_metadata": {"description": "Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with seven other Senators, has directed a letter to the Obama administration demanding regulators answer questions specific to the facilitation of research into the medical benefits of marijuana.", "generator": "TWB", "og": {"site_name": "The Weed Blog | Marijuana News And Information", "description": "By Danielle Keane, NORML Political Director Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with seven other Senators,\u00a0has directed\u00a0a\u00a0letter to\u00a0the Obama\u00a0administration demanding regulators answer\u00a0questions specific to\u00a0the facilitation\u00a0of research into the medical benefits of marijuana.
