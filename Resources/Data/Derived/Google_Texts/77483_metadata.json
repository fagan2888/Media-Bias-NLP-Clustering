But while Trump\u0092s TV partner NBCUniversal stayed quiet in the days immediately following that speech, more recent troubles have forced its execs\u0092 hands, and the company is now severing all ties with the business mogul. It remains to be seen how far-reaching this decision will be.Here is how NBC explained their motivations through a press statement.The first signs of the fissure happened when NBC started thinking about how to handle Trump\u0092s position as the host of Celebrity Apprentice , a gig he wouldn\u0092t be able to continue if his run for the presidency actually lasts. But it looks like he won\u0092t have a home there anymore, no matter what happens with his political dreamscapes. I\u0092m sure most of you were just picturing Trump saying \u0093You\u0092re fiyahed,\u0094 into a mirror over and over, or was that just me?Another big blow came last week when Univision, the most popular Spanish language network in the U.S., pulled out of airing this year\u0092s Miss USA pageant. Now the event will have to find a brand new home altogether without NBC able to air it, assuming it's still going to happen. I\u0092m sure other networks will jump at the chance to bring the two contests to viewers.In his speech, Trump took shots at China and Mexico for their immigrants stealing jobs in America, and made some derogatory comments about the Mexicans that cross the border being criminals and rapists \u0096 comments he later attempted to reword \u0096 and promised that he would build a wall between the two countries if he became president. These thoughts were definitely not universally approved of, especially not by the media giant with Universal in its name.You can watch a chunk of his inflammatory speech below.Remember a few years ago when Trump chose not to run for president, and his career didn\u0092t change? I wonder if he\u0092ll be thinking of those days fondly, or if he\u0092ll be getting even more fired up in the weeks to come. Expect The Daily Show to have a few words about it.
