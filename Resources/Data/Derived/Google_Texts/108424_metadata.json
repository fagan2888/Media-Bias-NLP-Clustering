We are hopeful the Tenth Circuit will give them more lasting protection,\" said Rienzi.\n\n\"The federal government is a massive entity that has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people\u2013it doesn't need to force the Little Sisters to participate.\"\n\nLast September, the Little Sisters filed suit against the HHS over the controversial \"preventive services\" mandate.\n\nAlthough the mandate exempts churches automatically under the \"religious employers\" category, the Little Sisters did not receive an automatic exemption.\n\n\"We believe the government's attempt to coerce us in this manner is wrong, and that it violates our religious liberty,\" stated the Little Sisters last year.\n\n\"So, like many other Catholic and religious institutions around the country, we felt the need to seek legal recourse.\"\n\nLast month, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted the Little Sisters a temporary injunction protecting them from the demands of the mandate as their case continued.\n\n\"\u2026respondents are temporarily enjoined from enforcing against applicants the contraceptive coverage requirements imposed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 42 U. S. C. \u00a7 300gg-13(a)(4), and related regulations pending the receipt of a response and further order of the undersigned or of the Court,\" ordered Sotomayor.\n\nThe Little Sisters case has garnered its share of diverse opinions, with some believing that the nuns are going beyond the boundaries of religious freedom.\n\nJonathan Dobrer of the news opinion blog \"Friendly Fire\" argued that while the nuns had a right to be coerced into directly providing contraceptives, they do not have a right to demand that their employees do not get it elsewhere via health insurance.\n\n\"The only fair thing to do is to free all who object to any program on moral or religious grounds from paying anything,\" wrote Dobrer.\n\n\"Sounds great, but of course, it couldn't work. The nature of society is cooperation. The prudent support the improvident and the thrifty balance the profligate.\"\n\nHowever, Kirsten Powers, political analyst at Fox News and contributor to USA Today, wrote a column late last month calling for the government to give the Little Sisters \"a break.\"\n\n\"Personally, I support the mandate. The government has a compelling interest in providing free birth control. But there are ways to provide it that don't involve harassing nuns,\" wrote Powers.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "A Maryland-based order of nuns has sent a formal appeal before a federal court in order to be exempted from having to provide contraceptive services to its employees.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Little Sisters of the Poor Appeal to Federal Court Over Obamacare Contraception Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "A Maryland-based order of nuns has sent a formal appeal before a federal court in order to be exempted from having to provide contraceptive services to its employees.", "author": "Michael Gryboski", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/little-sisters-of-the-poor-appeal-to-federal-court-over-obamacare-contraception-mandate-115155/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/65927/nun-convent.png", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor Appeal to Federal Court Over Obamacare Contraception Mandate", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/65927/nun-convent.png", "title": "Little Sisters of the Poor Appeal to Federal Court Over Obamacare Contraception Mandate", "description": "A Maryland-based order of nuns has sent a formal appeal before a federal court in order to be exempted from having to provide contraceptive services to its employees.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ChristianPost"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/little-sisters-of-the-poor-appeal-to-federal-court-over-obamacare-contraception-mandate-115155/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Little&20Sisters,nuns,obamacare,healthcare,lawsuit,exemption,injunction,court,Supreme&20Court,Tenth&20Circuit,appeal,appellate,litigation,Becket&20Fund,HHS,Sebelius,Obama,Powers,Dobrer,religious&20liberty,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2014-02-25T08:39:50-05:00", "modDate": "2014-02-25T08:39:50-05:00"}, "Keywords": "Little Sisters, nuns, obamacare, healthcare, lawsuit, exemption, injunction, court, Supreme Court, Tenth Circuit, appeal, appellate, litigation, Becket Fund, HHS, Sebelius, Obama, Powers, Dobrer, religious liberty,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2599\"", "article_summary": "Last September, the Little Sisters filed suit against the HHS over the controversial \"preventive services\" mandate.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor filed their appeal Monday before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, requesting an exemption from the Department of Health and Human Services' \"preventive services mandate.\"\n\"The federal government is a massive entity that has lots of ways to deliver contraceptives to people\u2013it doesn't need to force the Little Sisters to participate.\"\n\"We are thrilled the Supreme Court temporarily protected the Little Sisters from having to violate their conscience or pay crippling IRS fines.\nAlthough the mandate exempts churches automatically under the \"religious employers\" category, the Little Sisters did not receive an automatic exemption."}
