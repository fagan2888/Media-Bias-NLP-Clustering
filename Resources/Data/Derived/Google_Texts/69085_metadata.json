In a recent speech, he recognized Sister Carol Keehan, the chief executive of the Catholic Health Association, as critical in helping the president pass the ACA in the first place when Catholic bishops rallied against the law\u2019s provision of providing free birth control.\n\nPresident Obama spoke in front of the Catholic Health Association and Keehan, whom he conceded he couldn\u2019t have passed the ACA without. He went on to say, \u201cAnd it\u2019s true, I just love nuns, generally.\u201d\n\nThe speech came as King v. Burwell is argued in front of the Supreme Court. If the federal government were to lose this case, over 6 million Americans could lose their government-provided health care subsidies. The case debates whether or not health care subsidies can be distributed by states that use federal exchange provided by Healthcare.gov over their own health care marketplaces.\n\nBut in speaking to the Catholic Health Association, President Obama took a different tact. He argued that maintaining the ACA is now a moral issue. He called the ACA \u201cthe fabric of how we care for one another.\u201d\n\nReligious groups have opposed the ACA since its inception. In addition to the Catholic Church\u2019s objection to the requirement that all employers provide contraception to employees who want it, Orthodox Jews also spoke out against the ACA. The contraception issue did not create any issues within the Jewish faith, but the general disregard for religious freedom did.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court considers the legality of the ACA and its provisions, President Obama will round up nuns and his other supporters within the religious realm to appeal to American\u2019s moral obligation to take care of their neighbors.\n\nResources\n\nFollow the Conversation on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Catholic health Association, obama, barack, president, aca, healthcare, health care, King v.
