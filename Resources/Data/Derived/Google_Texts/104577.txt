Police say a teen was hurt in an early morning shooting in west Wichita.

Officers were called around 1 a.m. Sunday to numerous reports of gunfire at the Spectrum Venue in the 3900 block of West Douglas, which is just east of West Street.

Sgt. Bart Brunscheen said a fight broke out at the venue and two people went outside to a car, got a gun and fired at least 20 rounds. The car then headed east on Douglas. A description wasn't provided.

"That resulted in gunfire from several other people as they fled," said Sgt. Jim Merrick at the scene.

He said people were leaving in different directions, and shots were fired in the parking lot, in the street, in the alley, and in the 100 block of North McComas.

A 17-year-old later showed up to Via Christi St. Joseph Hospital with a gunshot would to his left calf. He was admitted in serious but stable condition. He told police he had just arrived at Spectrum when the fight happened and didn't know what it was about.

Brunscheen said about 30 shell casings were recovered from the scene. Several buildings and at least one vehicle were hit by bullets.

Anyone with information is asked to call 911 or Crime Stoppers at (316) 267-2111.
