Baran works for the House Energy and Commerce Committee on issues including nuclear power and Burns was an NRC attorney for three decades.\n\nThe senators sought mostly to make their objections about the NRC known, though they at times asked Baran and Burns whether they agreed.\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), the panel\u2019s former chairman, said that under his watch, the NRC\u2019s budget has increased by about 30 percent, due to an expectation that its workload would increase. But it never approved the major applications that were filed.\n\n\u201cA legitimate review of the agency\u2019s staff levels and current workloads needs to be examined by the commission ... and cuts need to be made if current staff levels cannot be justified when compared to the mission and needs of the NRC then versus now,\u201d Inhofe said.\n\nHe added that the result of overstaffing at the agency has been overregulation of the nuclear power sector, because employees don\u2019t have enough work to do.\n\n\u201cMany of these new regulations have been in response to the Fukushima disaster in Japan, and while each rule by itself may not be considered costly, when added to the many other orders and regulations being considered, the cumulative costs skyrocket,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Barbara Boxer Barbara BoxerThe Hill's 12:30 Report Sen. Boxer fires back at Sanders aide: 'He wasn't there' Sanders aide questions Boxer's story about fearing for her safety MORE (D-Calif.), the committee\u2019s chairwoman, criticized the NRC for its handling of California\u2019s only remaining nuclear plant and another that was recently decommissioned.\n\nThe operating plant, Boxer said, does not conform with the NRC\u2019s decisions about its safety requirements.\n\nBaran and Burns both agreed in principle that plants should follow the NRC\u2019s rules, though they did not comment on the specifics of California\u2019s plants.\n\n\u201cI think it's important, because NRC makes the decision, and I think they should enforce it,\u201d Boxer said.\n\nSen. Ed Markey Ed MarkeyHonor Frank Lautenberg by protecting our kids Sanders pans chemical safety reform deal Feds fault pipeline company in California oil spill MORE (D-Mass.) said the NRC has refused to give him non-public documents he has requested, despite a 2011 law that requires such disclosures.\n\n\u201cBut the agency is still refusing to comply with this law, and it won\u2019t respond to many of my information requests about serious safety and security matters,\u201d he said.\n\nSen.
