Common Core is an educational concept that isn’t being fought over for its actual content; it’s its symbolic value that’s causing all the controversy.

For years, former Gov. Jeb Bush has been one of those pushing the idea of teaching kids critical thinking rather than rote memorization; it’s what they do in other industrialized countries, and it’s why they’re pulling ahead of us in test scores. Ironically, it’s the current “teaching to the test,” rather than inculcating a reasoning process, that is causing our students to fare so comparatively poorly. They can pass a standardized exam, but they can’t think on their feet.

The crowd that reliably rails about government overreach — the folks who view Obamacare as another example of Big Brother’s sweaty embrace — have been thrown this new bone to gnaw on without, as usual, really knowing what it is they’re protesting.

The reflexive opposition to Common Core has reached such an intensity that Gov. Bush, in an attempt to maintain his presidential viability, actually had to make a statement declaring that he would stack up his conservative credentials against anyone else in the field.

Even Bush, who is a true movement conservative, knows that there is a point where rebelling against anything that happens to come out of the central government — just because it does — becomes absurd. Common Core is respected and has supporters on all sides of the political spectrum. The problem is that those who hate it tend to base their objections on visceral reactions, and they happen to be those who vote in Republican primaries.

Jeb is a smart guy; he’ll figure out a way to thread this needle by 2016 if he wants to. In any case, the biggest problem he still faces at this point is his last name.
