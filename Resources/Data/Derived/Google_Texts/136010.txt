A woman stole a poodle puppy from a Wilkes-Barre pet store Thursday afternoon, according to police.

The suspected thief stole the puppy from Tropic Pet Center, in the South Main Plaza shopping center, sometime between 2 p.m. and 2:10 p.m., according to Wilkes-Barre police.

The dark brown female puppy is valued at about $1,000, police said.

The suspect is described as a mixed-race woman, between 30 and 40 years old, wearing a brown jacket. She has a birth mark or beauty mark on her right cheek.

After stealing the puppy, the woman fled on foot, police said.

Police provided a photo of a puppy that is very similar in appearance to the dog that was stolen. However, unlike the dog in the photo, the stolen puppy does not have light brown facial markings, according to police.

Anyone with information is asked to call Wilkes-Barre police at 570-826-8106.
