The Framers assumed that neither Congress nor the courts would tolerate such usurpation. In Federalist No. 48, James Madison said power was \u201cso divided and balanced among several bodies \u2026 that no one could transcend their legal limits, without being effectually checked and restrained by the others.\u201d Madison\u2019s confidence assumes a wayward president could be reversed by the courts, reigned in by Congress or \u2014 as a last resort \u2014 impeached. But what if none of these checks and balances works? Americans may soon find out.\n\nFirst, courts have limited ability to check a president\u2019s failure to execute. The primary obstacle is \u201cstanding,\u201d a doctrine that requires a plaintiff to have a concrete, personal injury in order to sue. Citizens can\u2019t file generic lawsuits to enforce the Constitution; they must prove that the government has harmed them in a personal, palpable way.\n\nWhen a president delays or exempts people from a law \u2014 so-called benevolent suspensions \u2014 who has standing to sue him? Generally, no one. Benevolent suspensions of law don\u2019t, by definition, create a sufficiently concrete injury for standing. That\u2019s why, when President Obama delayed various provisions of Obamacare \u2014 the employer mandate, the annual out-of-pocket caps, the prohibition on the sale of \u201csubstandard\u201d policies \u2014 his actions cannot be challenged in court.\n\nSimilarly, when the president decided not to deport certain young people, not to prosecute most marijuana users, and rewrote the work requirement of welfare reform, courts cannot rule on these acts\u2019 constitutionality because no individual has suffered the personal harm required for standing. Sure, the Constitution and its separation of powers are tremendously harmed. But the Supreme Court has made clear such generalized societal harms won\u2019t suffice.\n\nCongress probably can\u2019t sue the president, either. The Supreme Court has severely restricted so-called \u201ccongressional standing,\u201d creating a presumption against allowing members of Congress to sue the president merely because he fails to faithfully execute its laws.\n\nIf courts can\u2019t be counted on to check the president, couldn\u2019t Congress just enact another law reversing him, or even impeach him? In today\u2019s hyper-partisan climate, the answer appears to be no.\n\nEven if the House passed a bill undoing presidential action \u2014 for example, a bill that declared, \u201cWe don\u2019t want individuals brought into this country illegally to be exempt from deportation, and we really, really mean it this time\u201d \u2014 the Democrat-controlled Senate wouldn\u2019t likely allow a vote on the measure. House Republicans passed a spending measure this fall to keep the government operating. But because the bill included a one-year delay in Obamacare \u2014 something the president threatened to veto \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to even bring the bill to the floor.\n\nIndeed, why should Congress even bother to legislate in the current environment? If it somehow miraculously passed something the president opposed, it would be promptly vetoed, and getting two-thirds of both Houses of Congress to overrule his veto \u2014 particularly in the Senate \u2014 is as likely as a snowstorm in Miami.\n\nEven when a congressional majority agrees with the president and passes a law the president signs, there\u2019s little confidence he will faithfully execute the law as written. Why pass comprehensive immigration reform, for example, if it includes tight border security or deportation measures with which the president disagrees and may ignore? As Congressman Paul Ryan put it, \u201cHere\u2019s the issue that all Republicans agree on: We don\u2019t trust the president to enforce the law.\u201d The president\u2019s failure to faithfully execute has made Congress grind to a halt and with it, democracy itself.\n\nIf the president\u2019s actions are so bad, why not just impeach him? Presidential impeachment has occurred only three times. Reconstruction President Andrew Johnson narrowly escaped conviction after the House impeached him for firing the Secretary of War in contravention of the Tenure of Office Act. Richard Nixon resigned after being impeached for obstructing an investigation into the Watergate break-in, and using the IRS and other executive agencies to target political opponents. Bill Clinton was impeached for abusing the judicial process and executive power to cover up his extramarital relationships. The Democrat-controlled Senate acquitted him.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Elizabeth Price Foley", "description": "'While President Obama's pattern of failing to execute laws is serious, the ability of courts and Congress to stop him is shockingly limited.'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "What happens if a president refuses to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\" as required by Article II of the Constitution?
