One of 123 new ACOs in Medicare, River Health ACO, LLC is comprised of PinnacleHealth System, Susquehanna Health, Family Practice Centers, Annville Family Medicine, Laurel Health Centers and Susquehanna Community Health & Dental Center. This alliance was formed on April 15, 2013 to improve access, cost, quality and patient experience for residents of central Pennsylvania.\n\nAs of January 1, 2014, River Health ACO began working with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide Medicare beneficiaries with high-quality care while reducing growth in Medicare expenditures. This goal is accomplished by providing better coordination of care, offering additional services to patients with chronic disease conditions and focusing more attention on health and wellness.\n\n\u201cRiver Health ACO\u2019s approval is a very important next step in upholding our health system\u2019s tradition of providing high-quality, patient-centered care,\u201d said William McCauley, MD, President of Susquehanna Health Medical Group. \u201cAs healthcare providers, we recognize the need to share information in a way that improves the health and wellness of our patients and communities in the most cost-effective manner.\u201d\n\n\n\nMedicare beneficiaries, served by physicians in the participating organizations, under the River Health ACO were notified with letters from their physicians. Neither the physicians nor Medicare coverage will change. Patients may continue to see any physician who is in Medicare as well as those who are not members of the River Health ACO. Choosing a physician who participates in the River Health ACO ensures the patient receives additional care coordination. \u201cThe ACO model enables the patient and provider to further develop a partnership to make the best care decisions,\u201d McCauley said.\n\nPhysicians and staff of River Health ACO will work with Medicare beneficiaries who have complex chronic conditions, such as diabetes or congestive heart failure, to provide care management between medical visits. Patients who are well will receive activities and wellness information, such as immunizations and screenings, to help detect illness or prevent it before it becomes serious.\n\n\n\nSince the passage of the Affordable Care Act, more than 360 ACOs have been established and serve greater than 5.3 million Americans with Medicare. ACOs are established by physicians, hospitals and health care providers as a means for working more closely together to provide higher-quality coordinated care to their patients, while helping to slow growth in health care costs.\n\nBeneficiaries who visit health care providers in ACOs always have the freedom to choose providers inside or outside of the ACO. ACOs share with Medicare any savings generated from lowering health care costs when they meet standards for high quality care established through the Medicare Shared Savings Program. ACOs must meet quality standards to ensure that savings are achieved through improving care coordination and providing care that is appropriate, safe and timely. The CMS evaluates ACO quality performance using 33 quality measures on patient and caregiver experience of care, care coordination and patient safety, improved care for at-risk populations and appropriate use of preventive health services.\n\n\n\nThe new ACOs include a diverse cross-section of healthcare providers across the country including providers delivering care in underserved areas. More than half of all ACOs are physician-led organizations that serve fewer than 10,000 beneficiaries. About one in five ACOs include community health centers, rural health clinics and critical access hospitals that serve low-income and rural communities.\n\n\n\nAdditional information about River Health ACO, LLC and participating providers is available at http://www.riverhealthaco.org.
