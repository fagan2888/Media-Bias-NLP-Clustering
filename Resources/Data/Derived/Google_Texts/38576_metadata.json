Here\u2019s a list of four common misunderstandings that have appeared as mindfulness spread from the monastery to the middle-class home.\n\nMyth No. 1: All Buddhists practice mindfulness meditation.\n\nBuddhism is synonymous with mindfulness in the West. Many suggest that mindfulness is the core of Buddhism and that nothing else \u2013 like ceremonies or doctrine \u2013 is even necessary.\n\nIt may come as a surprise, therefore, to learn that the majority of Buddhists, past and present, have never performed regular meditation practice.\n\nMindfulness and similar forms of meditation were traditionally the domain of ordained monks and nuns, not the average people who make up the great bulk of Buddhist societies.\n\nEven for the monks and nuns, meditation was often a peripheral activity, with the greatest honors reserved for scholars and ritual specialists, not meditation masters.\n\nCan meditation really slow aging?\n\nMyth No. 2: Mindfulness is always good for you.\n\nMindfulness is sold to the American public primarily on the strength of its supposed mental and physical health benefits, including stress reduction. But meditation can have dangerous psychological and physical effects as well.\n\nTraditional Buddhist stories abound of meditators being taken over by evil spirits, and contemporary psychological studies of mindfulness practice going back to the 1970s include patients who experienced hallucinations, psychotic episodes, depression and other mental trauma, as well as nerve pain and similar physical impacts.\n\nThese effects are especially likely when the practitioner has a pre-existing mental or physical condition.\n\nPracticing under the guidance of a trained instructor can help reduce these risks, and careful screening by leaders before extended retreats is also necessary.\n\nMyth No. 3: Mindfulness has always been used for self-improvement.\n\nOne of the hottest trends in mindfulness is the application of meditation to specific everyday activities, not to prevent a break in one\u2019s meditation when away from the cushion but to enhance those various activities.\n\nFor instance, books, articles, TED talks and websites promote the idea that mindfulness can be used to overcome sexual dysfunction and to increase the pleasure of intercourse. Mindful parenting advocates preach that maintaining awareness while taking care of the kids results in kinder, smarter, more responsive parents.\n\nThere are similar movements for mindful work, mindful eating, mindful sports and many other activities. These are very new applications of mindfulness.\n\nIn Buddhist history, mindfulness was typically used to create detachment from desire and to help achieve nirvana. A Buddhist monk who couldn\u2019t keep his robes on would\u2019ve been kicked out of the monastery, no matter how mindful he was in bed.\n\nBut Americans have little tolerance for renunciation, and so mindfulness has been reoriented to provide us with the benefits we do seek.\n\nCan mindfulness help manage pain and mental illness?\n\nMyth No. 4: All mindfulness practitioners are Buddhist.\n\nBuddhism gave us mindfulness, but most Americans who\u2019ve had some experience with mindfulness would not claim a Buddhist identity for themselves.\n\nIn fact, there are large and growing numbers of self-professed Christians, Jews, Muslims, atheists and others involved in mindfulness practice. In part, this is because mindfulness has been promoted by scientists, doctors, psychologists and others with a secular role in society.\n\nSome who begin mindfulness practice as a secular activity eventually investigate Buddhism more deeply and end up as full-fledged Buddhists.\n\nBut in other cases, encounter with Buddhist-based meditation has led Christians and Jews to a newfound appreciation for the riches of their own traditions, including a revival of neglected meditation techniques from Western religious history.\n\nJeff Wilson is the author of \u201cMindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture.\" He teaches Religious Studies at Renison University College at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jeff Wilson, special to CNN (CNN) -- Mindfulness meditation is a huge phenomenon\u00a0\u2013 and a multibillion-dollar industry\u00a0\u2013 in the United States.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "4 myths about mindfulness meditation", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/14/4-myths-about-mindfulness-meditation/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140912121129-meditating-at-a-gym-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Jeff Wilson, special to CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Mindfulness meditation is a huge phenomenon\u00a0\u2013 and a multibillion-dollar industry\u00a0\u2013 in the United States.", "title": "4 myths about mindfulness meditation"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "asia, buddhism, health, meditation, trends, buddhism, meditation, mindfulness", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/09/14/4-myths-about-mindfulness-meditation/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc484\"", "article_summary": "There are similar movements for mindful work, mindful eating, mindful sports and many other activities.\nBy Jeff Wilson, special to CNN(CNN) - Mindfulness meditation is a huge phenomenon \u2013 and a multibillion-dollar industry \u2013 in the United States.\n1: All Buddhists practice mindfulness meditation.\nOnce upon a time, mindfulness meditation conjured up images of an orange-robed monk with a shaven head, sitting quietly somewhere in a jungle cave.\nSome who begin mindfulness practice as a secular activity eventually investigate Buddhism more deeply and end up as full-fledged Buddhists."}
