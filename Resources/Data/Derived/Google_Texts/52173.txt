While some people were up early Wednesday morning unwrapping gifts under the Christmas tree, a local couple was welcoming a new addition to their family this Christmas morning.

Amber Parker thought she was going to be woken up by her 5 and 7 year old children begging to open Santa's presents.

However, those plans were put on hold when her baby son decided to make a grand entrance instead.

"We having Christmas with with my other two kids. I was definitely not planning on having a baby today, but I guess he's making the rules," she said.

Maverick Daniel was the first Christmas day baby born at Gulf Coast Medical Center.

Parker said, "We got here at like three and he was born at 5:52. He came really fast; I guess he was in a hurry."

Baby Maverick was originally expected to make his debut to the world on New Years Eve.

The father says Maverick is the best present he could ask for.

"We were expecting to have dinner with the family and the other kids, but he decided to come on out I guess," said Trystan Summers, dad. "We were expecting a New Years Baby. We weren't expecting him to be on Christmas day. We got us a present for sure."

The healthy baby boy weighs 7 lbs 13 ounces and is 19 inches long.

"From the sonograms and everything I was expecting him to be chubby, but he's not as big as I thought. He's healthy for sure," Summers said.

Parker will be discharged from the medical center Thursday morning.

The hospital's second Christmas baby was born about 5 hours after Maverick.
