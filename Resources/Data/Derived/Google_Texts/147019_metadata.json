None of the board\u2019s 15 members has been put in place \u2014 no one has even been nominated. The omnibus budget signed into law last week slashed $10 million from its budget. And now, because of reported slowing health care spending levels, there are questions about when it will even be even necessary.\n\nThere\u2019s been nary a peep about the IPAB, too, either from the administration or from Congress.\n\nLike so many Obamacare provisions, repealing the IPAB was once a prime target for Republicans hammering the law. Supporters argue the IPAB is a key method of reducing health care spending; critics call the IPAB a rationing board, claiming it will ultimately limit care to seniors, though the law stipulates the IPAB can\u2019t make recommendations that will lead to rationing. Unlike other key provisions of the law, though, repealing the IPAB found support with a good number of Democrats.\n\nThat bipartisan scorn has politicized what the IPAB\u2019s supporters argue is an essential piece of the cost control puzzle: to actually take the politics out of the decision making process.\n\n\u201cThe idea of having a quasi-independent board, look at health care spending is one that has been on the table for a long time,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert and senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThere is some value in some having some people think independently and understand what\u2019s driving health care spending and think about ways to slow the growth\u2026 but the IPAB is certainly a lightening rod.\u201d\n\nRep. John Fleming, a GOP doctor, posited that the president would wait at least until after the 2014 midterm elections before moving on any nominations.\n\n\u201cThe president is sort of operating this law on the fly,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cI suspect there\u2019s a political downside to it and he\u2019s going to wait until after the 2014 elections. That\u2019s been his pattern in the past. It\u2019s a huge political issue and the last thing in the world they need is to start talking about IPAB.\u201d\n\nWith last year\u2019s rule changes, conceivably the administration could push nominees through the Senate \u2014 but that would likely be a difficult vote for Democrats facing tough reelections.\n\nThere\u2019s an even bigger question, however: Is the IPAB even needed right now? A report issued last year concluded both that health spending has slowed and that no recommendations from the IPAB would even be necessary.\n\nConceivably, had Medicare spending gone up, the IPAB would have had to make recommendations this year to slow spending growth \u2014 and considering the IPAB does not exist, the secretary of Health and Human services would have made them instead. The good news for the IPAB\u2019s supporters and opponents alike is that it will probably be a while before the panel\u2019s existence even becomes necessary.\n\n\u201cTwo things happened this year: There haven\u2019t been any appointments, but what did happen is the actuaries were required to issue a report to say whether was spending was projected to exceed the target and they did and they said it wasn\u2019t,\u201d Neuman said.\n\nAn administration official told BuzzFeed there were no updates on nominations of appointees, but stressed that health care costs were growing at a slow enough rate that IPAB action wouldn\u2019t be necessary for a long time.\n\n\u201cRecent slower growth in health care costs means action would not be needed until 2017 according to the Medicare Trustees and CBO does not predict recommendations would be needed at all between now and 2023 (current budget window),\u201d the official said in an email.\n\nAmong the most ardent critics of the IPAB, though, the fervor hasn\u2019t died.\n\nRep. Phil Gingrey, a Georgia Republican and doctor, was an original co-sponsor to the House bill to repeal the IPAB. He argued that that the rocky roll out of the health care law itself distracted from slashing things like the IPAB. Gingrey has previously said that the board will cause seniors to die.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the issue has gone away one iota. The absolutely fiasco of the roll out continues, so why take the spotlight away from that?\u201d Gingrey said. \u201cWhen and if that\u2019s ever fixed than the spotlight\u2019s certainly going to go back to IPAB.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2929837, "userid": 686094}, "description": "Obamacare's Independent Payment Advisory Board, derided by critics as a rationing board, still doesn't exist.
