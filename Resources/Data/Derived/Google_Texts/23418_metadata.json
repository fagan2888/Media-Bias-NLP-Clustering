JENNIFER CAPPUCCIO MAHER \u2014 STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER\n\nREDLANDS >> Local supporters of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday rallied for jobs, national security and making America great again.\n\nThe rally, hosted by the Redlands chapter of Stump for Trump at the Mill Creek Cattle Co. in Mentone, drew a full house of supporters, including members of the Redlands Tea Party Patriots as well as Republican congressional candidates Tim Donnelly and Paul Chabot.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is a very unique person and he is a problem solver and a deal maker,\u201d Don Nydam, event organizer, said by phone earlier Tuesday. \u201cHe knows how to make things happen and one of the things that really impresses me is he\u2019s going to be thinking 24/7 about jobs.\u201d\n\nThe event was held the same day Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders visited the Inland Empire hoping to drum up support by the June 7 primary.\n\nTrump did not make an appearance in Mentone Tuesday, but is expected to make two stops in California this week \u2014 2 p.m. today at the Anaheim Convention Center and 2 p.m. Friday at the San Diego Convention Center. Tickets to the appearances are available online at www.donaldjtrump.com.\n\n\u2022 Photos: Stump for Trump Redlands Chapter holds rally\n\nSpeakers Tuesday evening took turns discussing topics in Trump\u2019s platform: Nydam spoke on having a president who supports Christianity; Randy Trau, who helped found the group with Nydam, addressed jobs and fair trade; Jim Lotito, owner of the Mill Creek Cattle Co., spoke on hope for the future; and Joe Henehan discussed the Affordable Care Act and insurance.\n\n\u201cThe only way to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is if Donald Trump is president,\u201d Henehan said.\n\nChabot, who is running against Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-San Bernardino, for the 31st Congressional District, addressed national security and terrorism.\n\n\u201cThe world is on fire,\u201d he said. \u201cOur enemies do not fear us. Our allies do not trust us and we lay that at the feet of the progressives who have destroyed the moral fabric and strength of this nation. What we need is our president to defend and protect this great nation.\u201d\n\nDonnelly, who is running against Rep. Paul Cook, R-Yucca Valley, in the 8th District, spoke on the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cWhen a powerful government becomes the threat to your rights, the only stop back is the Second Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t put there for hunting or sports shooting or any of those wonderful, desirable activities. It was put there to defend freedom from tyranny and the Founders knew that tyranny was on its way even if it took over 200 years to arrive.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Berry, a Redlands Tea Party Patriots cabinet member who supported former GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz, urged Republicans to unify in support of the party\u2019s nominee.\n\n\u201cThis election is about saving our country,\u201d Berry said. \u201cThis election is not about me. This election is about saving our country for our children, fighting Islamic terrorism, building a wall, appointing conservative Supreme Court justices, reversing a $19 trillion debt, creating opportunities for my son \u2014 in other words it\u2019s everything Donald Trump says. It\u2019s making America great again.\u201d\n\nNydam and his wife, Ruth Ann Nydam, formed Stump for Trump with fellow Trump supporters Trau and Nancy Karr.\n\nNydam asked attendees to contact 10 people in the next few days to tell them why they are voting for Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reaction to Donald Trump,\u201d Nydam said earlier Tuesday. \u201cHe\u2019ll tell you like it is and a lot of people don\u2019t like that, but you\u2019ve got to say the man is a dynamic leader.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "REDLANDS >> Local supporters of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday rallied for jobs, national security and making America great again.The rally, hosted by the Redlands chapter of Stump for Trump at the Mil", "title": "Donald Trump supporters \u2018Stump for Trump\u2019 in Mentone Tuesday", "og": {"url": "http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/government-and-politics/20160524/donald-trump-supporters-stump-for-trump-in-mentone-tuesday", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20160524/NEWS/160529773/AR/0/AR-160529773.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1016px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump supporters \u2018Stump for Trump\u2019 in Mentone Tuesday"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "REDLANDS >> Local supporters of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday rallied for jobs, national security and making America great again.The rally, hosted by the Redlands chapter of Stump for Trump at the Mil", "title": "Donald Trump supporters \u2018Stump for Trump\u2019 in Mentone Tuesday", "url": "http://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/government-and-politics/20160524/donald-trump-supporters-stump-for-trump-in-mentone-tuesday", "image": {"src": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20160524/NEWS/160529773/AR/0/AR-160529773.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump,Election 2016,Mentone,Mill Creek Cattle Co., Primary elections", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump,Election 2016,Mentone,Mill Creek Cattle Co., Primary elections"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s making America great again.\u201dNydam and his wife, Ruth Ann Nydam, formed Stump for Trump with fellow Trump supporters Trau and Nancy Karr.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reaction to Donald Trump,\u201d Nydam said earlier Tuesday.\n\u201cThe only way to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act is if Donald Trump is president,\u201d Henehan said.\nJENNIFER CAPPUCCIO MAHER \u2014 STAFF PHOTOGRAPHERREDLANDS >> Local supporters of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday rallied for jobs, national security and making America great again.\n\u201cDonald Trump is a very unique person and he is a problem solver and a deal maker,\u201d Don Nydam, event organizer, said by phone earlier Tuesday."}
