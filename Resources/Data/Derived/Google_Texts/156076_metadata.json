He worked on the Affordable Care Act and married several same-sex couples when same-sex marriage was approved last spring.\n\nHe is a regular opinion piece contributor to The Huffington Post and the Forest Grove Leader.\n\nFinding 'common ground'\n\nWhile students of different faiths may not be able to come to the same conclusions about \"hot topics\" such as abortion or same-sex marriage, Currie \u2014 who is openly pro-choice and a supporter of same-sex marriage \u2014 believes spiritual and religious students can still be a strong force for significant, but less controversial, issues.\n\n\"I would like very much to get students who have faith backgrounds to be interested and involved in the world around them,\" Currie said. \"I want people to be concerned about the economic inequality that we have in the world. I want people to be concerned about climate change and the environment. These are going to impact them and their children.\"\n\nHe called these \"common ground issues\" that can bring students of all religious backgrounds together to be a positive force in the world.\n\nCurrie hopes to engage students of all religions in service projects in and around the Forest Grove community.\n\nHe said he hopes to eventually take students on overseas trips to experience the religious climates of other countries, and that these trips could also include a community service element.\n\nReligion at Pacific\n\nThough now a non-sectarian university, Pacific has its roots in the Congregationalist tradition \u2014 Congregationalist minister Harvey Clark cared for and educated orphans of the Oregon Trail in the school's earliest days.\n\nToday, says Lang, welcoming a diverse population of students is key to the school's mission.\n\nFor students who don't want religion or spirituality to be part of their college experience, Currie knows that having an official chaplain on campus might make them a bit wary.\n\nHe looks forward to winning these students over \u2014 not to his \"side\" per se, but to tolerance and discussion.\n\n\"I expect all of my encounters with students will be learning experiences for me as much as they're going to be learning experiences for the students,\" he said.\n\nWhile he won't hold weekly chapels, he hopes to host a few interfaith worship services and help students connect with religious groups on- and off-campus.\n\nCurrie will teach at least one religion-based class each semester and will hold office hours for all students to probe him with questions about religion and spirituality.\n\n\"My job is not in any way to convert people from one religion to another or to tell people they ought to be religious,\" Currie said. \"But I do think it's a good thing for students to realize that religion is there.\"\n\n-- Kelsey O'Halloran", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "forest grove lifestyles, forest grove news, Pacific University, religion, news", "title": "Chuck Currie seeks to bring religious conversation, not conversion, to Pacific University", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Chuck Currie seeks to bring religious conversation, not conversion, to Pacific University\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/forest-grove/index.ssf/2014/08/chuck_currie_seeks_to_bring_re.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/forest_grove_news/photo/15605901-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"13629402\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-19T20:35:14Z\", \"author\": \"Kelsey O\\u0027Halloran | The Oregonian/Oregonlive\", \"tags\": [\"@education\",\"@fg-leader\",\"@forest-grove\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@washington-county\",\"forest grove lifestyles\",\"forest grove news\",\"Pacific University\",\"religion\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/forest_grove_news/photo/15605901-standard.jpg", "description": "When students of faith step onto the Pacific University campus this fall, Chuck Currie hopes they won't be stepping away from their religion.
