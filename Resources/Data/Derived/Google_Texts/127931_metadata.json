However, it is the policy of Extensive Enterprises Media not to link to stories written by those authors currently out on bail for attempted murder.\n\nInstead of highlighting Manjarres\u2019 work, we spotlighted a scoop from Florida Politics\u2019 Jenna Buzzacco-Foerster about Ambassador Francis Rooney deciding not to run for Florida\u2019s U.S. Senate seat.\n\nThis important development was not included in our rival tout sheets because, clearly, it\u2019s more important to highlight the work of those accused of attempted murder instead of a veteran journalist.\n\nPlease accept our apologies.\n\nWHILE NAT\u2019L POLITICS WAS FOCUSED ON WISCONSIN, FLORIDICOS WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS VIDEO \u2013\u2013 During a visit to a Starbucks in downtown Gainesville, Gov. Rick Scott got an earful from an angry woman over his refusal to expand Medicaid to low-income Floridians. The 47-second video was captured by another patron and uploaded by YouTube user Stephen Bender.\n\n\u201cYou cut Medicaid so I couldn\u2019t get Obamacare,\u201d the woman yells at Scott. \u201cYou\u2019re an asshole. You don\u2019t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.\u201d\n\nWhen Scott responded that he created 1 million jobs, the woman was less than impressed. \u201cA million jobs?\u201d she answered incredulously while looking around. \u201cGreat, who here has a great job? I was looking forward to finishing school. You really feel you have a job coming up?\u201d The young woman then scolded the governor for stripping money and assets of public health care. \u201cShame on you Rick Scott,\u201d she added. \u201cWe depend on those services. Rich people like you don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d As Scott walked out the door, the unidentified woman called him an \u201cembarrassment to our state.\u201d\n\n***Today\u2019s SUNBURN is brought to you by Bright House Networks for Business, your trusted provider of industry leading communications and networking services for any size business \u2013 from startup to enterprise, and everything in between.

Democrat Bernie Sanders triumphed over Hillary Clinton but still faces a mathematically difficult path to the White House.\n\nTrump\u2019s defeat capped one of the worst periods of his campaign, a brutal stretch that highlighted his weaknesses with women and raised questions about his policy depth. While the billionaire businessman still leads the Republican field, Cruz and an array of anti-Trump forces hope Wisconsin signals the start of his decline.\n\n\u201cTonight is a turning point,\u201d Cruz told cheering supporters at a victory rally. \u201cIt is a call from the hardworking people of Wisconsin to America. We have a choice. A real choice.\u201d But Trump was unbowed. His campaign put out a biting statement: \u201cTed Cruz is worse than a puppet \u2014 he is a Trojan horse, being used by the party bosses attempting to steal the nomination from Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nFor Sanders, Wisconsin was the latest in a string of victories that have given him an incentive to keep competing against Clinton. But he still trails her in the pledged delegate count and has so far been unable to persuade superdelegates \u2014 the party officials who can back any candidate \u2014 to drop their allegiance to the former secretary of state and back his campaign. At a raucous rally in Wyoming, Sanders cast his victory as a sign of mounting momentum for his campaign. \u201cWith our victory tonight in Wisconsin, we have now won 7 out of 8 of the last caucuses and primaries,\u201d he declared.\n\nWHEN DOES HE DROP OUT? JOHN KASICH ALLIES TO HOLD D.C. BRIEFING WEDNESDAY via Anna Palmer of POLITICO \u2014 John Kasich\u2018s D.C. allies are holding a large meet-and-greet political briefing Wednesday afternoon with GOP operatives and donors, according to multiple sources. Bob Rusbuldt, co-chair of Kasich\u2019s steering committee, said the session is intended to answer questions and encourage people to support Kasich.\n\nFOR THE FIRST TIME the Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll shows Cruz leading the GOP field nationally with 39%, followed by Trump at 37% and Kasich at 23%.\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN IN DISARRAY via Kenneth Vogel, Ben Schreckinger and Eli Stokols of POLITICO \u2013 Morale sinks as key battleground state staff laid off, including senior data operative \u2026 As the final stretch of this hard fought GOP primary bogs down into a delegate fight among party insiders and operatives that likely won\u2019t be decided until the July convention in Cleveland, Trump\u2018s singular star power appears to be no longer enough \u2013 and his campaign\u2019s monthslong lack of attention to other fundamentals is emerging as a hindrance to his ability to clinch the nomination outright.\n\nFLORIDA CO-CHAIRWOMAN SUSIE WILES: NO \u201cDISARRAY\u201d IN TRUMP CAMPAIGN via AG Gancarski of Florida Politics \u2013 Ahead of the Wisconsin primary results, a popular narrative is that the Trump campaign is in \u201cdisarray.\u201d A POLITICO story declared that \u201cmorale sinks\u201d as \u201ckey battleground state staff\u201d has been jettisoned. Central to the POLITICO narrative: Florida, where the website says the \u201cdisarray\u201d is having tangible consequences. Huge, if true. But Wiles says the narrative is not. \u201cThe Trump campaign has been nontraditional, but very effective, since the first day. When a state\u2019s primary has been held, staff in that state are either moved go a state where the primary is yet to come. If they\u2019re unable to move, sometimes they remain in their home state working as volunteers and, in some cases, the campaign and the staff part ways. This is not disarray; it is planned,\u201d Wiles said. \u201cIn Florida we have a strong coalition of volunteers and a few highly effective staff as of this date. As we get closer to the general election, the staffing in Florida will be evaluated and the campaign will adjust as needed.\u201d\n\nINSIDE TRUMP\u2019S \u2018PRIVATIZED MERCENARY FORCE\u2019 via Kenneth Vogel and Brianna Gurciullo of POLITICO \u2013 A POLITICO investigation revealed that Trump has assembled a privately funded security and intelligence force with a far wider reach than other campaigns\u2019 private security operations: tracking and rooting out protesters, patrolling campaign events and supplementing the Secret Service\u2019s protection \u2026 The investigation \u2015 which utilized [FEC] reports, state licensing records, court filings and interview accounts or testimony from more than a dozen people who\u2019ve crossed paths with Trump\u2019s security \u2015 found that the tactics of Trump\u2019s team at times inflamed the already high tensions around his divisive campaign, rather than defusing them.\n\nEPILOGUE \u2014 JEB BUSH SUPER PAC OUTLINES PLAN TO RETURN $12 MILLION TO DONORS via Alex Leary of the Tampa Bay Times \u2013 Anyone who contributed $1,000 or more [will receive] at least a 10 percent refund \u2026 \u201cThis process will entail making over three-thousand (3,000+) contribution refunds and we anticipate starting and completing this process in May,\u201d reads a letter from treasurer Charlie Spies. Right to Rise raised a breathtaking $118 million and spent much of that trying to prop up Bush and knock down his opponents.\n\nEPILOGUE PART 2 \u2014 MARCO RUBIO BACKERS: RUN AGAIN via Manu Raju of CNN \u2013 Rubio dropped out of the GOP race, he made this clear: \u201cI\u2019ll be a private citizen in January.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s done with politics. In private conversations with supporters and donors over the last several weeks \u2026 Rubio repeatedly gets this advice: Run again, potentially in 2020, according to several people familiar with the conversations. And Rubio, sources said, is certainly open to it. Some of his allies are even urging Rubio to withhold supporting Ted Cruz because such endorsements have made little difference this campaign season and the two could face off again in a future contest. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s not damaged from the campaign at all,\u201d said Wayne Berman, a major Rubio donor who declined to reveal his own private discussions with the senator. \u201cI think everything that has happened in the campaign and since has enhanced his currency as a future candidate for public office.\u201d\n\nBTW, WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MARC CAPUTO STORY? \u2014 \u201cMarco Rubio nears Ted Cruz endorsement\u201d\n\nMEANWHILE \u2026 PANAMA PAPERS COULD ADD TO OUTRAGE IN PRESIDENTIAL RACE via Will Weissert of The Associated Press \u2013 The revelations in the Panama Papers could add to the populist outrage in the presidential race by confirming many of the fears of Bernie Sanders supporters on the left and contributing to the distrust that drives people to Donald Trump on the right. So far, the 11.5 million leaked documents have shed light mostly on foreign figures such as the prime minister of Iceland, who resigned after the public learned that he used a shell company to shelter large sums of money while his country\u2019s economy foundered. The reaction in the U.S. has been relatively muted. But voters and experts suggested that the papers could still validate the frustration of blue-collar Sanders supporters who feel that hard work is no longer enough to get ahead in America and the anger of Trump partisans who say it will take someone who knows the insider system to dismantle it.\n\n***Today\u2019s SUNBURN is brought to you by Jamestown Associates, winner of eight 2016 Reed Awards and 60 industry awards overall.

The Ethics Committee will further pursue the matter, which does not indicate violations necessarily occurred but ensures that a large ethics cloud hangs over Grayson as he campaigns to succeed Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate. Among the likely or potential violations: Grayson ran a hedge with that improperly used the congressman\u2019s name \u2026 greed to receive contingent fees in cases in which the federal government had a direct and substantial interest that were pending during his time in Congress \u2026 numerous \u201csignificant\u201d omissions from Grayson\u2019s financial disclosure forms \u2026 \u201cparticipated in multiple press interviews focused on his campaign for the U.S. Senate from his congressional office, and in some cases used campaign resources, including a campaign computer and campaign staff, to facilitate these interviews.\u201d Grayson denies any wrongdoing, and his lawyer released a blistering response to the OCE report that accused investigators of leaking information to Grayson\u2019s Democratic U.S. Senate opponent \u2026 Patrick Murphy.\n\nHOW ALAN GRAYSON\u2019S ETHICAL WOES ARE PLAYING \u2014 Orlando Weekly, House Ethics Office calls for \u2018further review\u2019 of allegations against Alan Grayson \u2013 \u201cGrayson said that the investigation fails to identify instances of actual ethics violations or violations of law.\u201d New York Times, Office of Congressional Ethics Cites Possible Violations by Alan Grayson \u2013 \u201cThe Congressional Ethics staff \u2014 made up of professional investigators overseen by a six-member board \u2014 found at least six possible violations of House rules or law \u2026\u201d Wall Street Journal, Report Details Potential Ethics Violations by US Rep. Alan Grayson \u2013 \u201cGrayson also operated a hedge fund \u2026 Nearly all of the money in the fund was held by his family members, but the fund had at least two other investors.\u201d McClatchy Washington Bureau, Race to replace Rubio in Senate roiled by probe of Alan Grayson \u2013 \u201cDavid Damron, Grayson\u2019s Orlando-based campaign communications director \u2026 \u2018Patrick Murphy and his D.C.-establishment allies are using this new political witch hunt to try to distract Florida voters from what they really care about \u2026\u201d Tampa Bay Times, Investigators find numerous potential ethics violations by Alan Grayson \u2013 \u201cHis lawyer released a blistering response \u2026 \u2018The referral itself verges on the demented, in all of its Captain Ahab attempts to spear the white whale by coming up with something \u2013 anything \u2026\u201d Miami New Times,Alan Grayson Claims Ethics Investigation Into His Business Dealings Is Political Witch Hunt \u2013 \u201cOf course, some critics question certain elements of Grayson\u2019s rebuttal \u2026 \u201c\n\nONLINE AD QUESTIONS TAXPAYER COST OF PATRICK MURPHY CAMPAIGN EVENT WITH JOE BIDEN via Alex Leary of the Tampa Bay Times \u2013 The ad will run primarily on Facebook, said Brian Burgess, whose client is Better Florida Alliance, a 501(c)(4) \u201cdedicated to educating Florida citizens on the effect of pro-growth economic policies on Florida\u2019s families and promote policies that encourage economic freedom and opportunity.\u201d The group does not have to disclose its donors. Burgess said the group has nearly 10,000 Facebook fans and the ad buy targets 2 million additional voters. The ad uses some of the \u201cb-roll\u201d that Murphy put up on his campaign website in the hope that friendly outside groups would use it for ads.\n\nCARLOS BERUFF BROADCASTING SPANISH ADS ON TV, RADIO IN REPUBLICAN U.S. SENATE RACE via Scott Powers of Florida Politics \u2013 Both ads briefly and vaguely follow the theme of the Cuban-American\u2019s arrival in the United States in the 1960s to pursue the American dream, and his concern that he now is disappointed that the American dream is being thwarted by business-as-usual politicians and government in Washington. The radio ad includes another theme: Beruff\u2019s criticism of President Barack Obama\u2019s initiative to open relations with Cuba, and the president\u2019s visit to Cuba last month. In the new 30-second TV ad, Beruff holds up a collage of family pictures and says, in Spanish, \u201cWe came in the \u201960s, in search of dreams and opportunities. After lots of sacrifice and plenty of effort, thanks to God, we achieved the American Dream. But today that American Dream is disappearing. This government has failed us. The politicians have failed us. I\u2019m Carlos Beruff, and I approve this message because it\u2019s time we rebuild our confidence in the American Dream.\u201d In the new 60-second radio ad, Beruff exchanges comments with an announcer, who begins by introducing him as, \u201cCarlos Beruff. Father. Homebuilder. Republican.\u201d\n\nSTEVE CRISAFULLI ENDORSES CARLOS LOPEZ-CANTERA IN U.S. SENATE RACE via Jenna Buzzacco-Foerster of Florida Politics \u2013 \u201cMy choice in this important race is not based on politics, but on a desire to have authentic and effective representation in Washington,\u201d said Crisafulli in a statement \u2026 \u201cWe need action, not more empty promises. Working with Carlos over the years, I have been able to see firsthand his focused leadership. Carlos has a fire and drive that is greatly needed in Washington. I look forward to doing all I can to support his campaign.\u201d Lopez-Cantera has received the backing of Attorney General Pam Bondi and more than half of the Republicans in the Florida Legislature.\n\nAUDREY GIBSON, MIA JONES BOTH \u201cABSOLUTELY\u201d EYEING CORRINE BROWN\u2019S CD 5 SEAT via Melissa Ross of Florida Politics \u2013 \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Jones, one of four veteran Jacksonville politicians seen as a viable contender to run in Brown\u2019s stead. The others are former Jax Mayor Alvin Brown, state Sen. Gibson, and former state Sen. Tony Hill. \u201cI believe that you have to keep all options open, and it would definitely be something that I would consider doing,\u201d Jones told WJCT. Gibson, a member of the Senate redistricting committee and intimately familiar with the redrawn map and the process, said she\u2019s also ready to vie for the congressional post. \u201cYes, I would definitely consider running in that district,\u201d Gibson said, while also pointing out much hinges on Brown\u2019s fate and whether she decides to run in the redrawn CD 5.\n\nBOB POE LOANS DISTRICT 10 CAMPAIGN $1.2 MILLION via Jeff Weiner of the Orlando Sentinel \u2013 Former State Democratic Chair Poe loaned his congressional bid $1.2 million and raised more than $130,000 in the first quarter of 2016 \u2026 \u201cAs a Democrat not beholden to anyone, I will be a bold and unapologetic voice for our community,\u201d Poe said in a statement. \u201cAnd because I don\u2019t have to rely on special interest contributions, my only special interest will be the people of the 10th Congressional District.\u201d\n\nDEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ AND PRIMARY OPPONENT TIM CANOVA EACH RAISE MORE THAN HALF $1 MILLION via Dan Sweeney of the South Florida Sun Sentinel \u2013 Wasserman Schultz raised $614,000 in the first three months of 2016 \u2026 Canova, a Nova Southeastern University law professor, raised $557,000 in the same period, his campaign said this week. Their close numbers could lead to a tight contest in the Aug. 30 Democratic primary. Canova is running an anti-establishment campaign against Wasserman Schultz who, as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, is a consummate insider.\n\nJEFF BRANDES, LORI BERMAN, RAY RODRIGUES LAUNCHING CAMPAIGN FOR SOLAR POWER TAX BREAKS via Mitch Perry of Florida Politics \u2013 \u201cBecause we\u2019ve moved to the August primary, we have a really short window in order to really spin up a campaign,\u201d said Brandes, who sponsored the bill in the Senate. \u201cWe think we\u2019ll be very active right up front, and we\u2019re going to be doing a lot of work in the next few weeks.\u201d The amendment would essentially be a tax break: It would exempt solar power equipment on homes from being counted toward a house\u2019s value for property tax purposes. It also would exempt from taxation solar energy devices on commercial and industrial properties. Berman and Ray Rodrigues sponsored the measure in the House, where it passed unanimously.\n\nHAPPENING TONIGHT: Former Florida House Speaker Allan Bense and state Sen.

Republican state Reps. Debbie Mayfield and Ritch Workman already have filed to run for the seat. \u201cAfter thoroughly considering this opportunity and the call by many in my community to run for the state Senate, weighted with what is best for our family when our children are at such a pivotal point in the lives, we have decided it is best that I not seek public office at this time,\u201d Haridopolos said in a statement \u2026 he made clear that he and his wife Stephanie will consider running for something in the future.\n\nNICE GUY WILTON SIMPSON LETS \u2018LOVE FLOW\u2019 WITH BELLAMY BROTHERS CONCERT FUNDRAISER APRIL 21 via Florida Politics \u2013 Simpson is letting the \u201clove flow\u201d in his re-election bid to the Florida Senate.

Reilly and Spicola start their new duties Wednesday \u2026 Reilly had worked for Scott in the 2010 campaign and has been a key aide to Majority Leader Dana Young \u2026 serving as deputy staff director in her office. A former assistant state attorney, Spicola had been general counsel Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR).

The \u201cFive Flags Mural\u201d also happens to depict a Confederate flag, which the Senate previously voted to remove from its official seal and insignia. Senate Democratic Leader Arthenia Joyner \u2026 explained that the flag is a \u201cpainful symbol of oppression.\u201d The name of the mural refers to the five flags that have flown over the state: U.S., Confederate, Spanish, French and British.\n\nFLORIDA REACHES SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IN KIDS\u2019 MEDICAID CASE via Kelli Kennedy of The Associated Press \u2013 Florida health officials have reached a settlement ending a decadeslong class-action lawsuit that alleged the state is violating federal mandates by failing to deliver critical health services to 2 million children on Medicaid. One of the biggest victories for the plaintiffs requires insurance plans to provide a \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d for pediatricians to earn rates that are on par with Medicare, which typically pays more than Medicaid. In later years, those reimbursement opportunities will extend to specialists, addressing a huge gap in the system by improving doctor participation in the Medicaid program and preventing children from having to travel long distances to receive treatment. Florida\u2019s Medicaid reimbursement rates are among the lowest in the country. Even state health officials have acknowledged a critical shortage of Medicaid specialists.\n\n6TH NURSERY GETS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH OK TO ENTER MEDICAL MARIJUANA BUSINESS via Jenna Buzzacco-Foerster of Florida Politics \u2013 [DOH] notified San Felasco Nurseries that it had been approved as a dispensing organization for the Northeast region \u2026 the nursery has 10 days to post a $5 million performance bond.

Now there are six cases exhibiting symptoms in the state. All are travel-associated, with no locally-acquired cases of Zika in Florida. There are 80 total cases in Florida; by county (number of cases): Miami Dade (32), Broward (12), Orange (5), Alachua (4), Osceola (4), Hillsborough (3), Lee (3), Brevard (2), Palm Beach (2), Polk (3) and a single case each in Clay, Collier, Santa Rosa, Seminole and St. John\u2019s counties. Based on CDC guidance, several pregnant women who have traveled to countries with local-transmission of Zika have received antibody testing, and of those, five have tested positive for the Zika virus. The DOH recommends women who are pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant postpone travel to Zika affected areas. The department also urges Floridians to drain standing water weekly, no matter how seemingly small. A couple drops of water in a bottle cap can be a breeding location for mosquitoes. Residents and visitors also need to use repellents when enjoying the Florida outdoors.\n\nACTUAL HEADLINE \u2014 \u201cFlorida Man Arrested After Trying to Sell Stolen Fuel on Craigslist, Facebook\u201c\n\nFROM SHERYL SANDBERG TO PETER CHERNIN: COUNTING DOWN POTENTIAL DISNEY SUCCESSORS via Brent Lang of Variety \u2013 Facebook COO Sandberg, who is already a Disney board member, \u2026 [at 46] would be a young enough to guide the company for decades, and has the Silicon Valley bona fides to help Disney adapt to the digital era. \u2026 21st Century Fox executive vice chairman Chase Carey \u2026 might be willing to jump ship \u2026 Chernin, the man who Carey replaced atop what was then News Corp., \u2026 is a known quantity with the investment community.\n\n***Situated in the heart of Downtown Tallahassee, 101 Restaurant combines southern hospitality with big city style.
