And you know what\u2019s coming: endless attempts to psychoanalyze the candidate, endless attempts to read significance into what she says or doesn\u2019t say about President Obama, endless thumb-sucking about her \u201cpositioning\u201d on this or that issue.\n\nPlease pay no attention. Personality-based political analysis is always a dubious venture \u2014 in my experience, pundits are terrible judges of character. Those old enough to remember the 2000 election may also remember how we were assured that George W. Bush was a nice, affable fellow who would pursue moderate, bipartisan policies.\n\nIn any case, there has never been a time in American history when the alleged personal traits of candidates mattered less. As we head into 2016, each party is quite unified on major policy issues \u2014 and these unified positions are very far from each other. The huge, substantive gulf between the parties will be reflected in the policy positions of whomever they nominate, and will almost surely be reflected in the actual policies adopted by whoever wins.\n\nFor example, any Democrat would, if elected, seek to maintain the basic U.S. social insurance programs \u2014 Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \u2014 in essentially their current form, while also preserving and extending the Affordable Care Act. Any Republican would seek to destroy Obamacare, make deep cuts in Medicaid, and probably try to convert Medicare into a voucher system.\n\nAny Democrat would retain the tax hikes on high-income Americans that went into effect in 2013, and possibly seek more. Any Republican would try to cut taxes on the wealthy \u2014 House Republicans plan to vote next week to repeal the estate tax \u2014 while slashing programs that aid low-income families.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAny Democrat would try to preserve the 2010 financial reform, which has recently been looking much more effective than critics suggested. Any Republican would seek to roll it back, eliminating both consumer protection and the extra regulation applied to large, \u201csystemically important\u201d financial institutions.\n\nAnd any Democrat would try to move forward on climate policy, through executive action if necessary, while any Republican \u2014 whether or not he is an outright climate-science denialist \u2014 would block efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nHow did the parties get this far apart? Political scientists suggest that it has a lot to do with income inequality. As the wealthy grow richer compared with everyone else, their policy preferences have moved to the right \u2014 and they have pulled the Republican Party ever further in their direction. Meanwhile, the influence of big money on Democrats has at least eroded a bit, now that Wall Street, furious over regulations and modest tax hikes, has deserted the party en masse. The result is a level of political polarization not seen since the Civil War.\n\nNow, some people won\u2019t want to acknowledge that the choices in the 2016 election are as stark as I\u2019ve asserted. Political commentators who specialize in covering personalities rather than issues will balk at the assertion that their alleged area of expertise matters not at all. Self-proclaimed centrists will look for a middle ground that doesn\u2019t actually exist. And as a result, we\u2019ll hear many assertions that the candidates don\u2019t really mean what they say. There will, however, be an asymmetry in the way this supposed gap between rhetoric and real views is presented.\n\nOn one side, suppose that Ms. Clinton is indeed the Democratic nominee. If so, you can be sure that she\u2019ll be accused, early and often, of insincerity, of not being the populist progressive she claims to be.\n\nOn the other side, suppose that the Republican nominee is a supposed moderate like Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio. In either case we\u2019d be sure to hear many assertions from political pundits that the candidate doesn\u2019t believe a lot of what he says. But in their cases this alleged insincerity would be presented as a virtue, not a vice \u2014 sure, Mr. Bush is saying crazy things about health care and climate change, but he doesn\u2019t really mean it, and he\u2019d be reasonable once in office. Just like his brother.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I\u2019m dreading the next 18 months, which will be full of sound bites and fury, signifying nothing. O.K., I guess we might learn a few things \u2014 Where will Ms. Clinton come out on trade agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership? How much influence will Republican Fed-bashers exert? \u2014 but the differences between the parties are so clear and dramatic that it\u2019s hard to see how anyone who has been paying attention could be undecided even now, or be induced to change his or her mind between now and the election.\n\nOne thing is for sure: American voters will be getting a real choice.
