The heightened attention could help complete the unfinished work of preventing lead from getting into children's bloodstreams, which can cause severe and permanent brain damage.\n\nAlthough water isn't the chief source of high lead levels in American children, it can account for 20 percent or more of overall lead exposure, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Lead paint and dust are greater factors and especially common in poor, urban areas where housing is old and likely to have lead in the paint and the soil. About 5,400 New Jersey children under the age of 6 were found to have lead levels above the federal standard in 2014.\n\nThe state has an opportunity to update its laws and practices while its leaders are paying attention. Gov. Christie's announcement Tuesday that he would add $10 million to lead abatement funds is welcome. Legislators should also train their sights on getting the administration to implement a 2008 law requiring inspections of one- and two-family rental homes at least once every five years. The administration has complained that there is \"no clear path to enforce\" the law, so a bill lighting that path should be passed.\n\nThe state also should raise its lead contamination standard to put it in line with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines, which are twice as tough. Appropriate standards would help raise awareness and concern among health-care professionals and parents about exposure levels that can hurt young children.\n\nSimilar attention to lead's toxicity caused the government to ban it from house paint and then gasoline decades ago, with dramatic results. Blood lead levels in children dropped 89 percent between 1976 and 2004. That's proof that acting responsibly to protect children works.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "philly-archives", "description": "New Jersey legislators are trying to correct an oversight in the state's environmental laws, which do not require schools to regularly test their water for lead.
