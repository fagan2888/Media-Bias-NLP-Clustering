Jimmy Fallon helpfully compiled a pros and cons list from last night’s State of the Union address. A pro, for example: “Obama hoped his speech would appeal to younger people.” The con: “It got awkward when he kept calling Americans ‘my bae.'”

Fallon’s best shot aimed at Obama’s “free” community college proposal. “Pro: He wants to make community college free. Con: Or as community college students put it, ‘Sounds great, but how much is it gonna cost?'”

And of course, Obama’s sit-down with YouTube stars after his speech could not go unnoticed. The “con” for that? “This was the first question: I can has Obamacare?”
