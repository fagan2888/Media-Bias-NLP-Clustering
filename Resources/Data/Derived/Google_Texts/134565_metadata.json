And while many commentators spoke learnedly of contagion, few articulated a real explanation for how the crisis spread as far and as fast as it did.\n\nRelated: 5 States That Are Still Foreclosure Hotspots\n\nA new paper by Hadiye Aslan of Georgia State University and Praveen Kumar of the University of Houston takes an almost epidemiological approach to investigating the causes of lenders\u2019 and investors\u2019 sudden loss of confidence in the creditworthiness of companies that had little likely connection to the subprime lending crisis.\n\nThe study, available here, finds that much of the reason for the loss of confidence in non-financial firms was a result not of investors suddenly concerned about invisible connections between them and the subprime mortgage market, but a measurable drop in the value of their corporate bonds, caused by bondholders\u2019 need to raise cash quickly.\n\nAs the subprime mortgage market crashed, large institutional investors and bond funds were faced with a two-pronged problem. Regulatory requirements forced some to rebalance their holdings with lower-risk investments, and worried investors demanded to redeem their shares for cash.\n\nThis created a need for liquid funds, and at that point in time, subprime mortgage holdings were anything but liquid. That meant that troubled institutional investors had to sell off other holdings at what Alan and Kumar characterize as \u201cfire sale\u201d prices. This created the impression of doubt in the value of the corporate bonds, as purchasers faced with a market glut, drove prices down.\n\nRelated: Is the Economy Losing Momentum?\n\nThe \u2018infection,\u2019 having been passed to firms not associated with the real estate markets, continued to do damage by raising interest rates on corporate debt and making companies less willing to invest. It also made it more difficult for them to react to moves by competitors who had the liquid assets needed to adopt new strategies or products.\n\n\u201cWe find that fire sales of corporate bonds did indeed have statistically and economically negative effects on the investment activity and economic performance of issuing firms,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMoreover, issuing firms facing large and \u201cdeep-pockets\u201d rivals [all things equal] lost market shares and obtained lower price-cost markups in their product markets, while their major suppliers and customers also exhibit significantly lower investment activity compared with matched firms not vertically linked to firms exposed to bond fire sales.\u201d\n\nThe paper\u2019s findings won\u2019t change the way most people remember the financial crisis, but for those who watch such things closely, it provides a nuanced look at what \u201ccontagion\u201d really meant that hasn\u2019t been available until now.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A recent paper by two economists explores what we really mean when we talk about the \u201ccontagion\u201d that helped a subprime mortgage market crisis that began in 2007 to spawn a full-blown financial crisis and, ultimately, the Great Recession.", "title": "A New Study Tracks the \u2018Contagion\u2019 that Led to the Great Recession", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/14/New-Study-Tracks-Contagion-Led-Great-Recession", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03132013_Going_Out_of_Business_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/14/New-Study-Tracks-Contagion-Led-Great-Recession", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03132013_Going_Out_of_Business_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A recent paper by two economists explores what we really mean when we talk about the \u201ccontagion\u201d that helped a subprime mortgage market crisis that began in 2007 to spawn a full-blown financial crisis and, ultimately, the Great Recession.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7f3\"", "article_summary": "This created a need for liquid funds, and at that point in time, subprime mortgage holdings were anything but liquid.\nAs the subprime mortgage market crashed, large institutional investors and bond funds were faced with a two-pronged problem.\nIt was as though the financial services industry had contracted some terrible disease, and passed it on to the non-financial sector.\nAnd while many commentators spoke learnedly of contagion, few articulated a real explanation for how the crisis spread as far and as fast as it did.\nRegulatory requirements forced some to rebalance their holdings with lower-risk investments, and worried investors demanded to redeem their shares for cash."}
