Dear Carolyn: I recently had occasion to drop off a package at my granddaughter’s afternoon preschool. Believing I was doing my daughter-in-law (DIL) a favor, I timed my drive to stop at my son and DIL’s house to pick up my granddaughter and save my DIL the trip to the school. Admittedly, I stopped unannounced, but we have a good relationship and often visit each other’s houses unannounced.
