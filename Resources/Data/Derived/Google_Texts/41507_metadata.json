He said that of children today, one-third of them will develop type 2 diabetes, and for minorities that number is even higher, with as many as one-half likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe disproportionate effect on minorities is one reason that Supervisor Malia Cohen called the measure \u201ccrucial\u201d during the meeting.\n\n\u201cBullets are not the only thing that are killing African American males,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cYou also have sugary beverages.\u201d\n\nBut Kim said today that she objected to the measure because of the disproportionate effect the tax will have on those same communities.\n\nCalling it a regressive flat tax, Kim said that it \u201cunfairly burdens low-income communities\u201d similar to other sin taxes such as high taxes on cigarettes.\n\nWhile agreeing with the policy goals of attempting to curb unhealthy habits, Kim suggested alternatives such as education, subsidizing healthier foods, policies to put healthier foods in corner liquor stores, and restricting sales with licenses like liquor licenses.\n\nMar sternly objected to Kim\u2019s objections, saying, \u201cMaybe you weren\u2019t listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear education isn\u2019t enough\u201d to improve health, he said.\n\nCohen called it \u201cdisingenuous\u201d to argue that the tax was regressive because the diseases caused by a high sugar diet so disproportionately affect low-income communities that the deterrent is most crucial there.\n\n\u201cThese diseases we are looking to solve are also regressive,\u201d she said.\n\nWiener said the comparison to a cigarette tax was apt, and that tobacco taxes are something he strongly supported. He said that he was disheartened that a recent statewide ballot measure to tax cigarettes failed but heartened that it received 73 percent support in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cTax policy is a critical part,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cigarette tax is a great model.\u201d\n\nOpponents who have formed a \u201cStop Unfair Beverage Taxes\u201d coalition said today that singling out sugary drinks for taxation is unfair as sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is down while rates of diabetes and obesity have continued to rise.\n\nBut Campos and Mar argued that sugary beverages are a big part of the problem because it was easier to consume large quantities of sugar in a drink and metabolize larger quantities of sugar.\n\nThe Hispanic Chambers of Commerce of San Francisco also released a statement objecting to the initiative \u2014 arguing that the new tax and increased prices will impact many already struggling businesses.\n\nSupervisor David Campos, who ultimately voted yes today, echoed the comments that the measure would level a regressive tax on low-income communities.\n\n\u201cI do believe in something like this I\u2019m going to err on the side of giving voters a choice,\u201d he said, but said that he thought there was \u201csomething Big Brother about this.\u201d\n\nHe and Kim said that the citywide conversation about it leading to the November election will at least improve education about the health effects of sugary drinks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "San Francisco voters will decide in November whether to tax sugary beverages at two cents per ounce.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"San Francisco Supervisors Put Soda Tax on Ballot\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/23\\/san-francisco-supervisors-put-soda-tax-on-ballot\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-23 09:14:02\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-23 10:14:48\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":20309,\"author_id\":\"237\",\"author_name\":\"KQED News Staff and Wires\",\"author_display_name\":\"KQED News Staff and Wires\",\"tags\":[\"Science\",\"Soda Tax\"],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/07\\/177844339.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "San Francisco voters will decide in November whether to tax sugary beverages at two cents per ounce.", "title": "San Francisco Supervisors Put Soda Tax on Ballot", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/23/san-francisco-supervisors-put-soda-tax-on-ballot/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/07/177844339-640x495.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "science,soda tax", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1cb\"", "article_summary": "The San Francisco Board of Supervisors approved a November ballot measure to tax soda and sugary drinks Tuesday afternoon, but not with the unanimous vote they were looking for.\nHe said that he was disheartened that a recent statewide ballot measure to tax cigarettes failed but heartened that it received 73 percent support in San Francisco.\nSupervisor David Campos, who ultimately voted yes today, echoed the comments that the measure would level a regressive tax on low-income communities.\nCalling it a regressive flat tax, Kim said that it \u201cunfairly burdens low-income communities\u201d similar to other sin taxes such as high taxes on cigarettes.\nThe Hispanic Chambers of Commerce of San Francisco also released a statement objecting to the initiative \u2014 arguing that the new tax and increased prices will impact many already struggling businesses."}
