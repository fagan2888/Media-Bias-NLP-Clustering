We are making history and we are proud of it.\u201d\n\nSanders has now raised $73 million on the year in his quest for the presidential nomination.\n\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner, raised a total of $112 million in 2015.\n\nThe self-proclaimed democratic socialist says he still has $28.4 million on hand, which should give him the resources to mount a formidable challenge to Clinton with just a month until ballots are cast in Iowa.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, which has burned through roughly two-thirds of its cash in order to build a high-powered, data-driven campaign, ended the year with $38 million in the bank.\n\nThe Sanders campaign increased its haul each quarter, reporting contributions of $15.2 million in the second quarter and $26.2 million in the third.\n\nIt also broke an off-year record set by President Obama in 2011 with more than 2.5 million donations this year.\n\nThe campaign said its average contribution was $27 and only a few hundred Sanders supporters have reached the $2,700 limit.\n\n\u201cBernie is the only candidate generating the kind of broad-based enthusiasm and excitement that Democrats must have in order to raise funds for a general election campaign and keep the White House and make gains in Congress,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nSanders and Clinton both outpaced the two Republican presidential candidates who have so far released their fundraising numbers for the last three months of the year.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) reported a healthy $20 million for the fourth quarter, while retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, despite a slide in the polls, said he raked in $23 million.\n\nCandidates are required to file their year-end earnings to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31.\n\n- Updated at 12:45 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The number falls just short of Hillary Clinton\u2019s self-reported $37 million raised in the quarter.", "description": "The number falls just short of Hillary Clinton\u2019s self-reported $37 million raised in the quarter.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The number falls just short of Hillary Clinton\u2019s self-reported $37 million raised in the quarter.", "title": "Sanders raises $33M in fourth quarter of 2015", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/264577-sanders-raises-33m-in-fourth-quarter-of-2015", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/sandersbernie06222015getty_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-02T12:49:04-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-02T12:49-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/264577-sanders-raises-33m-in-fourth-quarter-of-2015", "dcterms.date": "2016-01-02T12:14-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Elliot Smilowitz", "author": "Bradford Richardson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bernie Sanders,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-02T12:14:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-02T12:49:04-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/264577-sanders-raises-33m-in-fourth-quarter-of-2015", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The number falls just short of Hillary Clinton\u2019s self-reported $37 million raised in the quarter.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sanders raises $33M in fourth quarter of 2015"}, "dcterms.title": "Sanders raises $33M in fourth quarter of 2015"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\u201d Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, said in a statement Saturday.\nSen.\u2019 (I-Vt.) presidential campaign says it brought in $33 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nThe Sanders campaign increased its haul each quarter, reporting contributions of $15.2 million in the second quarter and $26.2 million in the third.\nThe number falls just short of Democratic rival Hillary Clinton\u2019s self-reported $37 million raised in the quarter.\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner, raised a total of $112 million in 2015."}
