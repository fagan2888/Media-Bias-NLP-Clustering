Snapdeal\n\nIndian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com said Wednesday it hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company\u2019s services keep pace with a boom in users.\n\nThe value of the goods sold on Snapdeal\u2019s online marketplace ballooned to $3.5 billion at the end of May, up from around $1 billion in August last year. The company is valued at $2 billion, making it India\u2019s fourth-most valuable startup, according to data compiled by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSnapdeal\u2019s employee headcount has exploded as it competes for customers with larger rival Flipkart Internet Pvt. and global giant Amazon.com. The company now employs 6,000 people, working in warehouses or on software updates, up from 1,300 in August last year.\n\nSnapdeal and other e-commerce companies are riding a boom driven by declining smartphone prices, which is allowing millions of Indians to go online for the first time. Many of them are shopping online.\n\nChandrasekaran will be working with Snapdeal\u2019s large group of 1,000 software engineers, which will double in size in the next year. They will be increasingly focused on improving Snapdeal\u2019s mobile application, which now accounts for 75% of the online marketplace\u2019s sales.\n\nChandrasekaran was most recently the chief product officer at Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s largest cellular service provider by sales. He resigned after 13 months on the job where he launched the Airtel mobile application and a popular music streaming app called Wynk, but also the hotly criticized Airtel Zero\u2014which offered access to certain mobile applications free-of-charge.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo  executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company\u2019s services keep pace with a boom in users.", "title": "India\u2019s Snapdeal Hires Former Yahoo Executive Anand Chandrasekaran", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/06/10/indias-snapdeal-hires-former-yahoo-executive-anand-chandrasekaran/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IV799_snapde_P_20150610055412.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "India\u2019s Snapdeal Hires Former Yahoo Executive Anand Chandrasekaran", "description": "Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo  executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company\u2019s services keep pace with a boom in users.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Sean Mclain", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Digits Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Digits", "article.summary": "Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo  executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company\u2019s services keep pace with a boom in users.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-10T10:42:27-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/06/10/indias-snapdeal-hires-former-yahoo-executive-anand-chandrasekaran/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DGB-42180", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Tech", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo  executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company\u2019s services keep pace with a boom in users.", "title": "India\u2019s Snapdeal Hires Former Yahoo Executive Anand Chandrasekaran", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/06/10/indias-snapdeal-hires-former-yahoo-executive-anand-chandrasekaran/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IV799_snapde_P_20150610055412.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Digits", "article.id": "BL-DGB-42180", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-10T10:42:27-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Indian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo executive, to be its chief product officer.\nChandrasekaran was most recently the chief product officer at Bharti Airtel, India\u2019s largest cellular service provider by sales.\nSnapdealIndian e-commerce company Snapdeal.com said Wednesday it hired Anand Chandrasekaran, a former Yahoo executive, to be its chief product officer to help the company\u2019s services keep pace with a boom in users.\nThey will be increasingly focused on improving Snapdeal\u2019s mobile application, which now accounts for 75% of the online marketplace\u2019s sales.\nThe value of the goods sold on Snapdeal\u2019s online marketplace ballooned to $3.5 billion at the end of May, up from around $1 billion in August last year."}
