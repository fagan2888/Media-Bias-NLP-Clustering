Burwell, which once again pitted health insurance for birth control against religious freedoms: Latest from Politics Can Trump Whitewater-Raft His Way to the White House? (1) The ACA, an unprecedented piece of socialistic overreach, is slowly transforming the republic into a bleak totalitarian dystopia. (2) Any public policy that offends a \u201ctraditional\u201d American religious sensibility\u2014mostly meaning certain strains of conservative Christianity\u2014is inherently suspect. (3) Women\u2019s health care is a dangerous and suspect thing because it may involve sex and thus fertility and thus contraception and thus maybe even abortions. (4) Medical care can be divided into \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d and \u201cthe important areas,\u201d which center on the needs of men. Thus, a health-insurance policy that explicitly excludes the needs of women, or remits them to a separate status, is not an anomaly; it is normal.\n\nThis time, it isn\u2019t a big corporation like Hobby Lobby seeking an exemption to covering birth control. It is a group of religious nonprofits claiming that filing the one-page form to enshrine their objection and get a birth-control accommodation \u201cfacilitates\u201d a sin\u2014making them participants in the sin. The feelings in the room were so intense that Paul Clement, one of the most equable and careful appellate advocates of his generation, actually claimed that that requiring his clients\u2014the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic nonprofit that provides elder-care services\u2014to certify their objection to providing contraceptive coverage was the same as if the government came \u201cinto one of the Little Sisters\u2019 homes and set up shop in a room \u2026 and then they operated a Title X [birth-control] clinic in our homes.\u201d Clement wasn\u2019t claiming that the form requirement would one day lead to Title X tyranny; he was arguing that they are exactly the same thing. \u201c[J]ust because this is more intangible, I don't think the principle is any different,\u201d he said. The moment was beyond surreal; it was Palinesque. Based on the strength of comments made from the bench, the most likely outcome is a 4-4 decision\u2014a nightmare result that means the Supreme Court will have to revisit the issue sometime soon. (An evenly divided Court means that the requirement will remain in place everywhere but the Eight Circuit.) And the stakes in Merrick Garland\u2019s nomination, and in the presidential election, will be dramatically underscored. Under the ACA, every new health-insurance policy is required to cover basic contraceptive services for female policyholders at no additional cost. Men and women pay the same premium, and women are able to receive contraception from their doctors precisely the same way any other patient receives medical services. However, \u201chouses of worship\u201d\u2014that is, religious nonprofit organizations whose sole function is a religious one\u2014are entirely exempt. Houses of worship need not provide contraceptive coverage to their employees at all.\n\nThere is, however, a huge universe of religious nonprofits that are not houses of worship\u2014hospitals, universities, social-service agencies, etc. And the religious sponsors of many of these nonprofits also have objections to some or all forms of contraception. A central tenet of the ACA, however, is that a full range of \u201cpreventive-care\u201d services must be available to the insured if at all possible\u2014and contraception, which demonstrably leads over time to better health outcomes for women who use it, must be among those services. They are to be provided \u201cseamlessly\u201d\u2014meaning that they are to be covered by the same policy as the main one, at no additional cost, and with no difference in the delivery and coverage. When the Department of Health and Human Services implemented the ACA\u2019s employer-coverage provision, then, it tried to pursue that objective by allowing religious nonprofits to disassociate themselves from contraceptive coverage without blocking it or removing it from employee plans. Under HHS regulations, religious nonprofits must notify the government of their objection to paying for or providing contraceptive coverage. Once the government is notified, it in turn notifies the employer\u2019s insurance company or plan administrator. The company or administrator\u2014instead of the religious nonprofit\u2014then must provide the coverage to female employees at no cost to the employees. What the houses of worship get is an \u201cexemption.\u201d The religious nonprofits, on the other hand, get an \u201caccommodation\u201d\u2014that is, a compromise\u2014a familiar technique in many religious-freedom cases, by which the government observes the concerns of religious people and organizations while at the same time achieving its goal. It\u2019s nothing new: In U.S. history, a conscientious objector to war has not needed to bear arms; but he or she has had to certify an objection and then do \u201calternative service.\u201d Kennedy asked why the government found it \u201cnecessary to hijack the plan\u201d in order to get women the coverage they are entitled to. Interestingly enough, in 2014\u2019s Hobby Lobby v. Burwell, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority ordered the government to offer precisely this accommodation to for-profit companies whose owners had religious objections to contraception: \u201c[T]his system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government\u2019s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote then. In a separate opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy hailed the accommodation as well, saying it \u201cequally furthers the Government\u2019s interest but does not impinge on the plaintiffs\u2019 religious beliefs.\u201d But that was 2014; in 2016, apparently, that alternative offers no respect to the nonprofits\u2019 religious liberty.\n\nThe objection now is that, as Clement put it, \u201cThey are going to hijack our health plans and provide the coverage against our will.\u201d A few moments later, Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014whose vote against the government is not in doubt\u2014picked up on the term \u201chijacking\u201d: \u201cIt seems to me that that\u2019s an accurate description of what the government wants to do,\u201d he said. Then, a few minutes later: \u201cThe government is hijacking their process, their insurance company, their third-party administrator.\u201d Finally, Kennedy took up the metaphor, asking why the government found it \u201cnecessary to hijack the plan\u201d in order to get female employees the coverage they are entitled to under the statute. The repetition of that word bodes ill for the government. Even more forebodingly, Roberts, Kennedy, and Alito seemed utterly oblivious to the other side of the question. If the plan \u201cbelongs\u201d to the employer (Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out that it does not, by law), then the benefits surely \u201cbelong\u201d to the employee. By definition, she has earned her lawful wages, which include government-required employee benefits. The decision of how to use those benefits\u2014of whether and when to conceive\u2014is a profoundly personal one that involves sensitive issues of health as well as ethical issues that are hers, and not the employers\u2019, to decide. Unlike a church employee, a woman who works for a hospital or university is often not a member of the sponsoring church; and whether she is or not, the conscience chiefly involved in contraception is hers, not that of a sacerdotal figure in a remote office. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli tried to bring that question to the fore. What the challengers were asking, he said, was that \u201cthose rights or those employees who may not share [the] petitioners\u2019 beliefs be extinguished.\u201d Alito wasn\u2019t interested in employees or their consciences, however. Did Verrilli not understand that this provision offended the important, the traditional, the conservative American religious groups? \u201cIt\u2019s not just Catholics and Baptists and evangelicals, but Orthodox Jews, Muslim groups, the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints, an Indian tribe, the Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye\u2014have said that this presents an unprecedented threat to religious liberty in this country,\u201d he said. And anyway, the conservatives suggested, what was the big deal about including contraception anyway? If it was bothering the employers, why shouldn\u2019t female employees just be required to go off somewhere and get some other kind of policy and pay for it themselves? Or why shouldn\u2019t the government just pay for it? Noel Francisco, arguing for the nonprofit objectors, suggested an \u201cuber-insurance policy where Aetna was the company that the government picked to provide contraceptive coverage to all women.\u201d Congress could change the ACA, they suggested, or make Title X coverage available to women who worked at religious nonprofits or pass an entirely new statute. Alito even suggested that Obama could issue some kind of executive order.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court took up the battle between birth-control coverage and religious freedom once more.", "author": "Garrett Epps", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court took up the battle between birth-control coverage and religious freedom once more.", "title": "Women's Health Takes a Backseat to Religion Again", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/03/GettyImages_517042598/facebook.jpg?1458768659", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/womens-health-takes-a-backseat-to-religion-again/475143/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2040\"", "article_summary": "Under HHS regulations, religious nonprofits must notify the government of their objection to paying for or providing contraceptive coverage.\nThere is, however, a huge universe of religious nonprofits that are not houses of worship\u2014hospitals, universities, social-service agencies, etc.\nIt is a group of religious nonprofits claiming that filing the one-page form to enshrine their objection and get a birth-control accommodation \u201cfacilitates\u201d a sin\u2014making them participants in the sin.\nHouses of worship need not provide contraceptive coverage to their employees at all.\nUnder the ACA, every new health-insurance policy is required to cover basic contraceptive services for female policyholders at no additional cost."}
