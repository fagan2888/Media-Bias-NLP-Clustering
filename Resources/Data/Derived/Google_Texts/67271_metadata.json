It\u2019s not their fault; women are hardwired to go for a certain type of guy. This explains why the \u201ccool guy\u201d stereotype remains more or less unchanged generation after generation. So, according to science, who are these men who are capable of effortlessly wooing women? The answer may be more obvious than you think.\n\nMen Who Drive Fast Cars\n\nResearchers in Austria found that women may subconsciously change their perception of a man based on the type of car that he drives. Instinctively, women prefer a dominant and powerful mate and will often associate a man\u2019s character or status with the type of car he chooses. More powerful cars, such as a Mustang or sports car, translate as a more powerful man \u2014 a characteristic women subconsciously look for in a mate.\n\n\u201cWhen we were having babies who were very dependent on us, we couldn\u2019t hunt and take care of ourselves, so we were looking for the man who had the most social status \u2014 who was the best hunter \u2014 who was going to bring home the biggest chunk of meat for our babies. It\u2019s the same thing today,\u201d explained Dr. Laura Berman, a sex educator and relationship therapist.\n\nMen With Hairy Faces But Smooth Bodies\n\nAccording to Pavol Prokop, a professor of biology at Trnava University in Slovakia, evolutionarily speaking, hairless men should be preferred in areas (or cultures) that are closer to the equator due to the increased parasitic threat. Interestingly, after a study comparing two countries with differing parasitic threats, Trnava \u201cfound no differences in women\u2019s preferences,\u201d with both groups going for men with less body hair. Theories suggest this preference may have come as a way to avoid lice and other parasites, but no one can say for sure.\n\nWhen it comes to facial hair, studies have shown the more hair, the better. An Australian study found that women prefer men with heavy stubble over clean-shaven men and men with a full beard. Our findings confirm that beardedness affects judgments of male socio-sexual attributes and suggests that an intermediate level of beardedness is most attractive while full-bearded men may be perceived as better fathers who could protect and invest in offspring,\" explained the researchers, as reported by The Huffington Post.\n\nMen With Deep Breathy Voice Who Holds Off On The Compliments\n\nWomen can\u2019t explain it, there\u2019s just something about a deep breathy voice that makes us weak in the knees. According to a British study, women prefer men with deeper voices because it\u2019s subconsciously perceived as a sign of masculinity. The study asked 60 women to rate the sex appeal of 10 male recorded voices, with results showing that the deeper breather voices, which were voices both masculine and tender, win in overall popularity. \"These results suggest that what makes the voice attractive are mostly properties that enhance the characteristics already in the averaged voice of the sex,\" explained the authors, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nWhat this deep breathy voice says is also important in winning a female\u2019s affection. A separate study found that women are less inclined to speak with men who present themselves as too friendly too fast, taking this as a sign of insincerity. The lead author of the study suggests another reason for this lack of enthusiasm for enthusiastic men: \u201cWomen may perceive a responsive man as vulnerable and less dominant,\u201d Gurit Birnbaum told Medical Daily via email.\n\nWhile women may not like men who initially come off as too nice, a separate study showed that over the long haul, ladies love a man who can make them laugh. Science has found that female brains are more perceptive to positive feelings in response to laughter. Female preference for funny men may stem from this biological difference.\n\nAbove All, Tall Men\n\nThe stereotype has been recognized across geographic and cultural boundaries. There\u2019s just something about tall men that women find irresistible. Unfortunately, this infatuation with tall men often leads to a denial of shorter men. A 2008 study of 382 college students found that only four percent of women would be in a relationship with someone who was shorter than them, Medical Daily reported. The reasoning for this, according to Dr. Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington, is because: \u201cWomen\u2019s cultural vision is being feminine, having a man big enough to make her feel protected.\u201d Schwartz added that many women hold this stereotype to a point where it excludes a lot of people they might be interested in otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "what, type, men, most, women, prefer, according, science", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although we all have a personal preference, instinctively women tend to be drawn to a certain \"type\" of man that most women find attractive.", "title": "What Women Want, According To Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-type-men-most-women-prefer-according-science-299252", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/women.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although we all have a personal preference, instinctively women tend to be drawn to a certain \"type\" of man that most women find attractive.", "title": "What Women Want, According To Science", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-type-men-most-women-prefer-according-science-299252", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/women.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/21/women.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-08-22T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-25T09:07:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although we all have a personal preference, instinctively women tend to be drawn to a certain \"type\" of man that most women find attractive."}, "article_summary": "An Australian study found that women prefer men with heavy stubble over clean-shaven men and men with a full beard.\nAccording to a British study, women prefer men with deeper voices because it\u2019s subconsciously perceived as a sign of masculinity.\nUnfortunately, this infatuation with tall men often leads to a denial of shorter men.\nSo, according to science, who are these men who are capable of effortlessly wooing women?\nThere\u2019s just something about tall men that women find irresistible."}
