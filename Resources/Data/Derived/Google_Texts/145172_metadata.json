The buys include more than 58,000 advertisements that are 30-seconds in length\u2013 the equivalent of 20 days of TV viewing.\n\nThese are just the ads filed with the Federal Communications Commission by traditional stations. Ads run on cable or satellite TV don\u2019t have to be reported to the FCC.\n\nNew ads this week include $1.9 million for more than 1,000 spots by >Crossroads GPS, a group closely associated with Karl Rove, the former adviser to President George W. Bush. The new buys, which began last week and are scheduled to run from mid-September through mid-October, bring the group\u2019s total ad spending in Colorado to $3.6 million.\n\nThe Republican Governor\u2019s Association spent just more than $1 million to begin airing ads in the race between incumbent Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper and GOP opponent and former U.S. Rep. Bob Beauprez.\n\nThe group scheduled ads through mid-September. Its first ad plays off Hickenlooper\u2019s recent game of pool with President Barack Obama.\n\nWho is paying for the ads by many outside groups isn\u2019t always clear.\n\nIt\u2019s the difference between \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cdisclosed\u201d money \u2013 and even when disclosure is required by state or federal laws, the money may still be difficult to trace.\n\nThe biggest outside ad spenders so far in Colorado are the Senate Majority Political Action Committee at almost $5.7 million and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at about $5.2 million. The two groups have ads scheduled through Election Day.\n\nThose two groups are supporting incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and targeting his GOP opponent, U.S. Rep. Cory Gardner. Both are registered with the Federal Election Commission and must report their donations and spending to the FEC.\n\nSenate Majority is a super PAC, which may take unlimited donations such as the $5 million each that billionaire businessman Tom Steyer and his NextGen Climate Action Committee, another super PAC, have donated.\n\nThe DSCC is considered a political party committee PAC, and may take donations of up to $32,400 from individuals and other committees.\n\nCrossroads GPS, on the other hand, is among the \u201cdark money\u201d groups. As a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, Crossroads doesn\u2019t have to disclose where its money came from. It doesn\u2019t have to disclose all its spending, either.\n\nCrossroads is running ads critical of Obamacare and Udall. Earlier this year, the League of Conservation Voters, another nonprofit that doesn\u2019t disclose donors, ran ads critical of Gardner.\n\nThe ability to track TV ad spending is one of the ways to see how much Crossroads, the League of Conservation Voters and similar nonprofits are spending.\n\nThen there are groups in which the distinction isn\u2019t so clear.\n\nThe Republican Governor\u2019s Association is a national 527 nonprofit that reports donations to the IRS but not the FEC. It recently formed an independent expenditure committee in Colorado, which may take unlimited contributions that must be disclosed. But if those contributions come from the parent group, it makes the money more difficult to trace. The group must first report its contributions to the Colorado Secretary of State on Sept. 1.\n\nThen there\u2019s Fair Share Action, which has purchased $249,410 in ads criticizing Gardner and the Koch brothers, who are affiliated with dark money groups Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners and others. While Fair Share is a super PAC that reports to the FEC, so far its only contribution this election cycle is from the House Majority PAC. The group doesn\u2019t have to report its contributions to the FEC until Oct. 15.\n\nWhat to look for this week: The RGA is paying $51,000 to air six 30-second spots during Thursday\u2019s final Denver Broncos preseason game with the Dallas Cowboys, which airs on KTVD.\n\nHere\u2019s a graphic look at the ad buys so far:", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Ads purchased by outside groups make up more than $38 million \u2013 almost 77 percent \u2013 of the total spending so far in Colorado.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"phone_number": "303-871-9191", "site_name": "Colorado Public Radio", "description": "Ads purchased by outside groups make up more than $38 million \u2013 almost 77 percent \u2013 of the total spending so far in Colorado.", "title": "Outside groups lead spending on Colo. political ads", "url": "http://www.cpr.org/news/story/outside-groups-lead-spending-colo-political-ads", "region": "Colorado", "locality": "Centennial", "fax_number": "303-733-3319", "street-address": "7409 S Alton Ct", "image": "http://www.cpr.org/sites/default/files/images/08262014.hickad.jpg", "postal-code": 80112, "type": "article", "email": "info@cpr.org", "country-name": "United States"}, "fb": {"app_id": 851183531577419}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The ability to track TV ad spending is one of the ways to see how much Crossroads, the League of Conservation Voters and similar nonprofits are spending.\nOutside groups stepped up to buy more than $5 million worth of the nearly $7 million in new political TV ad contracts last week.\nAds purchased by outside groups make up more than $38 million \u2013 almost 77 percent \u2013 of the total spending so far in Colorado.\nThe DSCC is considered a political party committee PAC, and may take donations of up to $32,400 from individuals and other committees.\nCrossroads GPS, on the other hand, is among the \u201cdark money\u201d groups."}
