Thoma Bravo acquired Blue Coat in 2012, taking it private in a $1.3 billion transaction.\n\nIn April, Raytheon Co.

As part of the transaction, Raytheon agreed to acquire Websense Inc. from Vista for $1.9 billion. Raytheon will contribute $1.57 billion in cash to the new company, of which $600 million will be a loan. The deal will result in an enterprise value of $2.3 billion for the new company, in which Raytheon will hold an 80 percent stake and Vista will keep about 20 percent, for a $335 million investment.\n\nThere was also Veritas Capital's purchase of BeyondTrust from PE and venture capital firm Insight Venture Partners.

FireEye picked up nPulse Technologies for $70 million in May, while IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) bought CrossIdeas and Lighthouse Security Group LLC in July and August, respectively.\n\nThe pace of acquisitions isn\u0092t expected to slow down as the urgency to fend against cyber threats continues to grow.
