Bruce Poliquin speaks to supporters gathered at Dysart\u2019s prior to his election as Maine\u2019s 2nd District representative in 2014.

Bruce Poliquin, a Republican, in November.\n\nDemocrats think 2014 was an aberration and that 2016 will be a different environment with the presidential campaign likely headlined by Democrat Hillary Clinton bringing higher turnout and different, more liberal voters. Last year, 283,000 voters cast ballots in the 2nd District race, 46,000 fewer than in 2012, when President Obama won 53 percent of district votes.\n\nMark Brewer, a University of Maine political science professor, said external factors should favor Democrats, calling the race a toss-up and Cain a strong candidate.\n\n\u201cThat all being said, Poliquin\u2019s going to be tough to beat in November of 2016,\u201d he said.\n\nPoliquin raised an eye-popping $700,000 in 2015\u2019s first three months, five times more than Cain and more than all but one House freshman. He has also gotten attention for some party-bucking votes, including one in January against repealing the Affordable Care Act and one on Friday against granting authority to fast-track a trade deal with Pacific Rim countries.\n\n\u201cI think everybody knows and everybody\u2019s seen that he\u2019s doing quite well on all of the ledgers,\u201d said Brent Littlefield, Poliquin\u2019s political adviser.\n\nIn 2014, outside groups spent nearly $3 million on the race \u2013 the most ever in a House race in Maine \u2013 but the next race figures to be pricier.\n\nIn the last campaign, the DCCC was caught flat-footed, only spending $11,000 to produce an ad against Poliquin that never ran while their counterpart, the National Republican Congressional Committee, spent nearly $1 million to advertise against Cain. She benefited from $440,000 in spending from EMILY\u2019s List, a group that helps elect Democratic women and that endorsed Cain on Tuesday after saying earlier this month that Poliquin was one of their 15 top targets in 2016 for his anti-abortion record.\n\nThis time, national Democrats are already heavily involved. The DCCC\u2019s political director, Ian Russell, was in Maine on June 4 and 5 for meetings in Portland, Augusta and Bangor with Cain, her staffers, Pingree, donors and operatives. Cain spokeswoman Sarah Russell called the meetings \u201ca chance to talk about the importance of this race and hear from supporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been impressed with the strong local support Emily Cain has earned in her district this cycle and last and with her record of getting things done for everyday Mainers,\u201d said DCCC spokesman Matt Thornton in a statement, adding, \u201cShe would undoubtedly make an excellent Democratic nominee in 2016.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The party plans hearty backing for Emily Cain after raising little money for her 2014 run for the 2nd Congressional District seat.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The party plans hearty backing for Emily Cain after raising little money for her 2014 run for the 2nd Congressional District seat.", "title": "Democrats rally early \u2028to position Cain for 2016 run against Poliquin - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/658201_democratic_convention_maine.jpg", "height": 876}, "updated_time": "2015-06-15T16:08:05-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/06/15/democrats-rally-early%e2%80%a8to-position-emily-cain-for-2016-run-against-poliquin/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The party plans hearty backing for Emily Cain after raising little money for her 2014 run for the 2nd Congressional District seat.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/658201_democratic_convention_maine.jpg", "title": "Democrats rally early \u2028to position Cain for 2016 run against Poliquin - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "News", "published_time": "2015-06-15T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T16:08:05-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Last year, 283,000 voters cast ballots in the 2nd District race, 46,000 fewer than in 2012, when President Obama won 53 percent of district votes.\nEmily Cain speaks at the Maine Democratic Convention in Bangor in 2014.\nMark Brewer, a University of Maine political science professor, said external factors should favor Democrats, calling the race a toss-up and Cain a strong candidate.\nBruce Poliquin speaks to supporters gathered at Dysart\u2019s prior to his election as Maine\u2019s 2nd District representative in 2014.\nDemocrat Emily Cain will be in Washington, D.C., on Monday for a \u201cwine reception\u201d fundraiser at the home of a California congressman to benefit her 2016 campaign for Maine\u2019s 2nd Congressional District."}
