Beaver Creek — Ted Ligety first came to the attention of the American public in 2006 when he won a surprise gold medal in combined at the Torino Olympics.

Then he was a relatively unknown 22-year-old from Park City, Utah. Since then he has won 24 World Cup races, five World Cup giant slalom titles, an Olympic gold medal in GS (2014), four world championships gold medals including three in 2013 and a world champs bronze.

At the world championships today he will be the strongest U.S. hope in the alpine combined, which consists of a downhill run this morning and one run of slalom this afternoon. He is the defending world champion in the event.

Ligety’s toughest challenge today may come from Alexis Pinturault of France.

“He probably is a better slalom skier than me, definitely a better slalom skier than me on most days,” Ligety said. “In downhill, hopefully I can put some time on him.”

Ligety, Pinturault and Marcel Hirscher of Austria have ruled giant slalom for years. Hirscher could contend in today’s combined, but he’s not good in downhill.

“Marcel is so far off in downhill that it could be a tough battle for him,” Ligety said. “Alexi is really good in downhill and he’s good in slalom.”

Ligety used to be really good in slalom, but his slalom is “hit or miss … Some days it’s really good, some days it’s a struggle.”

The combined downhill is scheduled for 10 a.m., with the slalom run scheduled for 2:15 p.m.
