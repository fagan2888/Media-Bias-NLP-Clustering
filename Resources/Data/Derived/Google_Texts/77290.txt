Minneapolis, MN

A public bus driver who crashed in Minneapolis died of natural causes.



The Hennepin County medical examiner's office on Sunday identified the bus driver as John L. Senior Jr., of Edina.



The southbound bus veered off Nicollet Mall, hit a lamppost and trash bins and scraped a building before coming to a stop.



A passenger on the bus was slightly hurt as was a bicyclist clipped by the bus.



The medical examiner said the 58-year-old Senior "suffered a sudden collapse" and died of "apparent natural causes" on Friday morning.



Passengers said they could see the driver suffering a medical episode before the bus went out of control.
