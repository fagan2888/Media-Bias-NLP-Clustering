There is growing concern that some people may not be aware of a new state requirement that demands you get a job to receive food stamps.

Beginning on April 1, a deadline could potentially leave thousands of people without a means to buy food.

That deadline is for food stamp recipients to prove they have a job or they lose their benefits.

Right now, the rule only applies to three counties - Cobb, Gwinnett and Hall.

People who are able-bodied without children and not working nor in an educational program will lose benefits.

Now there is quite a debate. In fact, there's already talk of a push in next year's legislature to expand the plan across all of Georgia.

The deadline requires proof of working 20 hours per week or enrollment in an education or training program for the same amount of time. Volunteering with a nonprofit counts, as well.

There are exemptions such as if you're receiving unemployment benefits or are pregnant. But the bottom line is that if people in those three counties are able-bodied, they can only get food stamps for three months during a three-year period without meeting those requirements.

The idea behind the new rule is that it will offer an incentive for people to find a job rather than rely on the state for assistance for a long period of time.

However, opponents say it's just not that simple and many people receiving assistance may not even realize April 1 is the first deadline to report a job.

As for where those recipients may have to turn next, some food banks in the three counties are wondering if they could see a higher demand because of this.

Of course, food stamps will be reinstated once those criteria are met so this could all be turned around. But it's important people know that first deadline is upon them.
