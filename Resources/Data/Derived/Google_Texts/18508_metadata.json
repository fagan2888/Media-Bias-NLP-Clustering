Poling Chapter 992, Vietnam Veterans of America, explains how the group wants to restore this mural depicting the sinking of the USAT Dorchester during World War II. (Shawne K.

(David Lane/Union Leader)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey come from all over, searching for the place where the Rev. Clark V. Poling spent his youth and found his calling. Some walk with canes; some bring their children.They all want to climb the mountain...Fifty years ago, most Americans knew the true story of the \"immortal chaplains\" - how four clergymen of different faiths laid down their lives for their comrades after their Army transport ship was hit by a German torpedo near Greenland on Feb. 3, 1943...Now a different generation of veterans wants to make sure the chaplains' sacrifice - and New Hampshire's connection to the story - is never forgotten.There were just 230 survivors among the more than 900 men aboard the USAT Dorchester. Many who were pulled from the frigid North Atlantic told rescuers how the chaplains had encouraged the men - most just frightened boys - to go over the side. And when the life jackets ran out, the chaplains all gave their own to others...Some recalled seeing the chaplains - a Catholic priest, a rabbi and two Protestant ministers - standing together, arms linked and praying, as the ship sank into the black sea. None of the four survived...One of those four heroes was Clark Vandersall Poling, who spent much of his youth in this small town.Another, the Rev. George Fox, served for a time as a minister in Rye before moving to Vermont.Both men became Army chaplains after the attack on Pearl Harbor...Clark Poling's father, the Rev. Daniel A. Poling, was a renowned preacher, and the family moved a lot. But they always returned to the family farm in Deering for the summers, according to Klee Murrel.Clark Poling was her uncle...Clark, who had a wife, a son and a baby on the way at the time of his death, had planned to buy a home in Deering when the war ended, Murrel said. He put down a $5 deposit before he left.After Clark's death, Murrel's father, Daniel K. Poling, bought the house instead...In 1951, the Legislature named the top of Deering's Wolf Hill \"Clark's Summit.\" For it was there that the future chaplain had found his calling.Family lore tells how the younger Poling had resisted following his father and older brother into the ministry; he was considering law. One day, he took his Bible and a backpack up Wolf Hill to contemplate his future...When his father climbed the mountain the next day to look for him, Clark told him that as he looked out from the summit, he became convinced that there was a God and that he should serve him in the ministry.Klee Murrel was born in 1945, so she never knew her famous uncle. But he was always a presence in the family, she said. \"Every coming-together, he was mentioned in the prayers.\"..And then there were the visitors. \"Men from the Dorchester would come to our house in search of my father,\" she said.She remembers sitting on the stairs and listening as a man spoke about the ship's sinking. \"He talked about how cold he was. That he never got over being cold.\"..\"He talked about seeing my uncle and the rest on the railing of the ship. He said they all gave everything. He never understood why they weren't saved and he was.\"\"I remember him crying. He said he had struggled with it for so long.\"..\"It was a night of terror, a night of grace,\" she said.Another time, a man from India came to climb the mountain. She's not sure how these strangers find the place but they do - and they know the story...\"They all know,\" she said.Wish honoredHer father's last wish, Murrel said, was to keep alive the memory of what his brother and the other chaplains had done. That's how the Daniel K. Poling Chapter 992 of Vietnam Veterans of America was formed.Klee's husband, Melvin, is chapter president; her father's home serves as its headquarters. Its members and their spouses have been keepers of the flame, taking visitors up to Clark's Summit when they arrive...But as time has passed, it's gotten more difficult for older folks to reach the summit. The trail winds through woods, but there are a few scrambles up rocky ledge.And the hilltop memorial has suffered some, from age and disrespect...For years, a light shone from atop the summit, mounted on a pole taken from a World War II destroyer, Klee Murrel said. \"It was supposed to be an eternal light,\" she recalled.But vandals kept breaking the light and eventually it was taken down. The bronze plaque on Clark's Summit that describes the chaplains' heroism has been defaced with graffiti.The VVA veterans want to recast the plaque and place it at their headquarters so that visitors who can't make it to the summit will have somewhere to pay their respects...They also want to restore a mural, depicting the sinking of the Dorchester, that was commissioned for a chapel at the original Poling homestead. And they hope to raise enough funds to commission an artist to re-create the mural on a barn at their chapter house.This is the purpose for which their group was formed, VVA chapter President Melvin Murrel said. \"We're going to do whatever we have to do to keep the message and the dream alive.\"..The message is about sacrifice and caring for one another, he said. \"They joined hands on the ship and gave away their life jackets so others could live.\"The veterans plan to launch a crowd-funding campaign for the restoration project later this year. Their efforts have the support of New Hampshire's two U.S. senators, Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Kelly Ayotte...Steve Monier, Ayotte's special assistant for military and veterans issues, said the \"selfless service\" of the chaplains continues to strike a chord today. \"It's quite a story, and it'll certainly resonate on Memorial Day, when we pay honor to those who gave the ultimate,\" he said...There's a memorial bench honoring the four chaplains at the state veterans cemetery in Boscawen.And Clark Poling's name is on the New Hampshire Marine Memorial at Hampton Beach, honoring military men lost at sea; his father spoke at its dedication on Memorial Day in 1957...All these years later, Klee Murrel said, the message of her uncle's final heroic act remains universal: \"We are our brother's keeper.\"For more details: www.vva992.org.swickham@unionleader.com..", "article_metadata": {"description": "They come from all over, searching for the place where the Rev.
