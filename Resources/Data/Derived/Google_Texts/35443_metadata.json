(Photo: Indianapolis Star file photo )\n\nHoosiers are using significantly more energy from renewable sources \u2014 including biofuels and wind \u2014 than they were just 10 years ago, a Purdue University expert told lawmakers Tuesday.\n\nBut the total amount of energy coming from those sources in the state remains small and less than the national average.\n\nIn 2002, less than 2 percent of the state\u2019s energy use came from renewable resources. By 2012 \u2014 the last year for which objective statistics are available \u2014 the rate increased to more than 5 percent, said Doug Gotham, director of the State Utility Forecasting Group, which is housed at Purdue.\n\nNationally, more than 9 percent of energy comes from renewable sources.\n\n\u201cThe major barrier to further growth in renewable energy continues to be the cost,\u201d Gotham told the legislative Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications. \u201cMost renewable energies have high capital costs.\u201d\n\nBut, he said, the longer-term costs of most of those renewable sources are much lower.\n\nThe numbers include fuel consumption for vehicles as well as for power and heating.\n\nWind now provides the largest share of renewable electric generation in the state. \u201cWe now have 3.5 percent of our electricity from wind,\u201d Gotham said. \u201cHistorically, it\u2019s only been 0.5 percent. In time we\u2019ll start to see (solar) grow as well.\u201d\n\nIn late 2012, developers installed 72 megawatts of solar photovoltaic equipment in Indiana, which has increased renewable energy use in the state. But that won\u2019t show up in the data until the 2013 numbers are released, Gotham said.\n\nThe numbers were part of the State Utility Forecasting Group\u2019s annual report to the legislative committee. The report shows that wind energy began growing in 2007, when several wind farms were installed in Northern Indiana.\n\nBut the growth in wind has slowed nationally and in Indiana, where only one wind farm has been commissioned in the last three years.\n\n\u201cThe factors that have resulted in the substantial slowing down of wind energy capacity expansion include the reduced availability of capital after the 2008 global financial crisis and the reduced competitiveness of wind in the face of abundant low cost natural gas as a result of the hydraulic fracking and horizontal drilling technological breakthroughs in the oil and gas extraction industry,\u201d the report said.\n\nGotham said Indiana is not as well positioned as some states to take advantage of solar, wind and hydroelectricity \u2014 at least not at the low power rates Hoosiers have generally enjoyed.\n\n\u201cIt depends on what you\u2019re willing to pay,\u201d Gotham said. \u201cGermany has worse solar resources but they have 30 percent of electricity coming from solar. But their electricity rates are three times as high.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1sEmzLL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hoosiers are using significantly more energy from renewable sources \u2014 including biofuels and wind \u2014 than they were just 10 years ago, a Purdue University expert told lawmakers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Hoosiers are using significantly more energy from renewable sources \u2014 including biofuels and wind \u2014 than they were just 10 years ago, a Purdue University expert told lawmakers.", "title": "Indiana boosts use of renewable energy", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/09/27/indiana-boosts-use-renewable-energy/16365091/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hoosiers are using significantly more energy from renewable sources \u2014 including biofuels and wind \u2014 than they were just 10 years ago, a Purdue University expert told lawmakers.", "title": "Indiana boosts use of renewable energy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f25767e5d6651236cb2418fcefd545eb4d48662e/c=261-0-1739-1478&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Purdue University", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Purdue University", "title": "Indiana boosts use of renewable energy", "author": "Lesley Weidenbener", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47542726d011ba13aa8a768494e4361eee26725e/c=446-0-1554-1478/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7c1bd53befd69964c08c1a8baa525231a4b9f42/c=261-0-1739-1478/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dfb09921d37090c8a5944bf2fd8f85618a9bc29e/c=14-0-1985-1478/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/487b8b0e169de5b4f9929ae2f60fb4e9d6f2c76d/c=0-176-2000-1301&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-27T21:56:42-04:00", "shorthed": "Indiana boosts use of renewable energy", "articleid": 16365091, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/585ea9b119831857bd0dc05216742ad131289d50/c=0-176-2000-1301/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f959386af953bb45dc1846eb91ee75d14cda8b31/c=584-0-1415-1478/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/27/windturbinesfile.jpg.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbff4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMost renewable energies have high capital costs.\u201dBut, he said, the longer-term costs of most of those renewable sources are much lower.\n\u201cThe major barrier to further growth in renewable energy continues to be the cost,\u201d Gotham told the legislative Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications.\nThe report shows that wind energy began growing in 2007, when several wind farms were installed in Northern Indiana.\nNationally, more than 9 percent of energy comes from renewable sources.\nIn time we\u2019ll start to see (solar) grow as well.\u201dIn late 2012, developers installed 72 megawatts of solar photovoltaic equipment in Indiana, which has increased renewable energy use in the state."}
