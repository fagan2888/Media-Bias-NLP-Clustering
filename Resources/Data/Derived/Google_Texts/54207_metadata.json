The proposal would increase the amount retirees under age 65 contribute to their health care insurance from the current 34 percent to almost half. He also wants to drop all retirees\u2019 spouses from the district\u2019s self-insured plan.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to balance their budget on the backs of the people who can least afford it,\u201d Cleaves said this week, noting that some retirees live at or below the poverty level and suffer from chronic diseases such as diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s or cancer.\n\nThe district is responding to pressure from the state and Shelby County government to pay down its liability for Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB), which are retirement benefits such as health care and life insurance but excluding pensions. Last year, the district\u2019s OPEB liability rose to $1.4 billion \u2014 close to the amount the district spends on K-12 education in an entire school year.\n\nBy not paying down the liability, the beleaguered district could face bankruptcy, according to Mike Swift, director of administration and finance for Shelby County government.\n\nHopson has said the district has no choice but to revise its retirement benefits and has suggested that those who are impacted should sign up for the federal Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in 2010 and expands Medicaid coverage to millions of low-income Americans.\n\n\u201cSomeone made a decision 40 to 50 years ago to offer more benefits to employees,\u201d Hopson said during a recent radio program. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re feeling the effect of those decisions because nobody put the money aside for those benefits.\u201d\n\nFormed in an historic 2013 merger of two large school districts in Memphis and Shelby County, Shelby County Schools is beset with financial and academic challenges. During the last two years, Hopson and the district\u2019s Board of Education have worked to get the school system\u2019s house in order under the weight of dwindling student enrollment, expensive academic intervention programs and decreasing property tax revenue. Last month, the board voted to cut $125 million from next school year\u2019s budget by laying off more than 350 employees, closing schools and pulling $25 million from its savings account.\n\nThe merger consolidated two districts that were self-insured and for decades had pledged to maintain employees benefits in retirement. Medicare would pick up a portion of those costs once retirees turned 65.\n\nIn the last decade, however, health care costs have outstripped inflation while the area\u2019s population has aged. The former districts, meanwhile, failed to keep up with the cost of health care and allowed their actuarial costs to balloon. For example, the former Memphis City Schools paid just $12 million toward its $1.1 billion liability, while the former Shelby County Schools paid $3.8 million toward its liability estimated at $342 million. Last year, the merged district paid $12 million toward its $1.4 billion liability.\n\nA 2014 state law requires local governments to pay 100 percent of their actuarial pension plan costs in the next six years. It stipulates that a district cannot change its pension plan but can revise health care benefits, according to county officials.\n\nSwift wants the district to pay the \u201cactuarial\u201d costs of its health insurance program \u2014 estimated at between $30 million and $40 million annually \u2014 to have enough money accumulated to fund all benefits.\n\nSchool administrators don\u2019t know how much the district will have to pay this year toward its OPEB fund because health care costs and the number of retiring employees fluctuates annually.\n\nDuring a budget hearing last week before the Shelby County Commission, during which school administrators asked for an extra $15 million in funding, several commissioners prodded Hopson to make larger OPEB payments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to us that they evaluate their priorities and deal with the issue,\u201d Swift said.\n\nElected school leaders have urged administrators to explore how to make cuts. \u201cWe can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said board member Chris Caldwell. \u201cThe big question mark is how much [do you fund it]? You have to balance at this juncture the needs of the children and the long-term consequences of not addressing it.\u201d\n\nSince the merger, several tweaks ordered by district leaders have caused the costs of insurance premiums and prescriptions to increase and teachers and retirees to gripe.\n\nEarlier this year, the district changed its health insurance provider from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee to Cigna, at a cost savings of $3.8 million. Blue Cross Blue Shield recently filed a lawsuit over the bidding process.\n\nLast month, David Pickler, a former school board member and the financial adviser for the Tennessee School Boards Association\u2019s trust account for employee retirement benefits, resigned amid complaints that he didn\u2019t properly invest the district\u2019s contributions worth about $36 million, exposing the district to market swings.\n\nSuch issues are rarely discussed or shared with leaders of the county\u2019s largest teachers union, even though they directly impact members, said Keith Williams, president of the Memphis Shelby County Education Association. \u201cThey\u2019re doing this to the retirees because they don\u2019t have to look them in the face every day,\u201d said Williams, who suggests that district cuts come from the salaries of central office staff instead of from the pockets of retirees.\n\nProposed benefits changes that are expected this month from Hopson would be far more sweeping and permanent than previous tweaks. Among the items he\u2019s suggested are the elimination of retirement health insurance for employees hired this year after July 1, and increasing premiums for retirees who smoke.\n\nFor her part, Cleaves has spoken with a lawyer but fears her 749-member organization, which charges annual dues of $10, won\u2019t be able to afford a legal challenge. She plans to comb through the union\u2019s past contracts to look for promises made.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our fault that the district didn\u2019t put enough money aside for the future,\u201d Cleaves said.\n\nContact Daarel Burnette II at dburnette@chalkbeat.org or (901) 260-3705.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: @Daarel, @chalkbeattn.\n\nLike us on Facebook.\n\nSign up for our newsletter for regular updates on Tennessee education news.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chalkbeat", "description": "As the financially strapped district explores cuts to retirement benefits, administrators say they have no choice, while retirees huddle to discuss their response.", "title": "Retirees fret as Shelby County Schools eyes retirement benefits", "url": "http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/tn/2015/05/13/retirees-fret-as-shelby-county-schools-eyes-retirement-benefit-revisions/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Teachers.jpg?fit=1200%2C900", "height": 900}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-13T23:02:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T04:05:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Teachers.jpg?fit=1200%2C900&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbb7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re feeling the effect of those decisions because nobody put the money aside for those benefits.\u201dFormed in an historic 2013 merger of two large school districts in Memphis and Shelby County, Shelby County Schools is beset with financial and academic challenges.\nFor example, the former Memphis City Schools paid just $12 million toward its $1.1 billion liability, while the former Shelby County Schools paid $3.8 million toward its liability estimated at $342 million.\nNow 70, retired and president of Shelby County\u2019s Retired Teachers Association, she finds herself on the verge of a fight in behalf of 8,000 retiree members who depend on financially strapped Shelby County Schools in their retirement.\nThe district is responding to pressure from the state and Shelby County government to pay down its liability for Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB), which are retirement benefits such as health care and life insurance but excluding pensions.\nBy not paying down the liability, the beleaguered district could face bankruptcy, according to Mike Swift, director of administration and finance for Shelby County government."}
