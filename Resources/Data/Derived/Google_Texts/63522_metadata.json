This was before Comedy Central anointed him the \"Funniest Person on Twitter,\" before his book deal for a collection of essays called Mother. Wife. Sister Human. Warrior. Falcon. Yardstick. Turban. Cabbage., which was a direct result of his hilarious Twitter presence, and before he hit 900,000 followers (and counting). I heard Delaney on the Risk! Podcast telling a story about how he got black out drunk, crashed into the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power building, and broke both his arms before landing in rehab.\n\nThe story had a typical Delaney combination of pathos, hilarity, and ejaculation. He went on an extended riff about what it\u2019s like to wipe your ass and masturbate without two fully functioning arms. He also talked about what it was like to be a total mess of an alcoholic, and how emotionally painful and difficult his rehabilitation was. That story is retold in his book, and it\u2019s just as funny, sad and true as I remembered it.\n\nSince Delaney is a master of the Tweet, we asked him for some advice about how to attract a following. He also talked about what he\u2019s learned from other people on Twitter, and why he\u2019s glad he was open about a serious bout with depression. We can\u2019t all have Susan Orlean call us her \"beloved,\" but we can hope to be at least one-tenth as charming and gross as Delaney.\n\nI started [Tweeting] in the beginning of 2009. It was towards the end of 2009 that sort of started humming. I was enjoying myself, having people pay attention, getting followed by people I admired, and that started to click for me.\n\nOn Twitter the idea is just to elicit some sort of response. Generally I go for laughter\u201475% of the time. The other 25% of time is passing information, shock, personal promotion of shows and the book and stuff. But generally Twitter is a silly thing. It\u2019s a diversion. It doesn\u2019t improve people\u2019s lives. It just sort of adds another way that you can waste your time. It\u2019s a double-edged sword. You can also hone your joke-writing ability, and connect with people. Because of the way I chose to use it and focus on it, it did improve my life as it led to other writing opportunities that paid money and opened doors to me.\n\nI like to be messy. And I\u2019ve written things that talk about my evolution (or de-evolution, as it were). I like talking about beliefs that I had that I\u2019ve outgrown. Sometimes people think I\u2019m a Democrat because I support the Affordable Care Act, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m massively behind the expansion of health care. If people want to be intellectually lazy, they can say I\u2019m a Democrat. I just care about people. I learned that firsthand when I paid for surgery myself [after my car accident] on three different credit cards.\n\nI\u2019m a straight guy, in a marriage. I just didn\u2019t know any transgender people. I\u2019ve read stuff from transgender people on Twitter, and I never would have before. My wife is a teacher and has transgender students, but Twitter helped normalize transgender people for me. I used to use the word \"tranny\" in a manner that would be derogatory or hurtful if you were on the receiving end. But Twitter exposed me to the idea that they\u2019re human people just like me with wants, needs, dreams, fears, and I don\u2019t do that anymore.\n\nTwitter accelerated the learning curve, where a straight white American guy where the world is classically considered to be my oyster, I now am delighted to be up to speed with the basic humanity of people born one gender who want to be another. I know that\u2019s long winded. But that was an awesome eye opening. It\u2019s helped reduce prejudices that I had.\n\nPeople don\u2019t get to know things about my family\u2014names or anything like that. I have kids, I have a wife. That is true, but beyond that, [I can\u2019t get behind] the idea of posting photographs of one\u2019s family online. I\u2019m the clown. I\u2019m the person for whom privacy doesn\u2019t have any value, because I have light brain damage. I\u2019m troubled but functional. My wife and kids are regular people, and if they want to seek out the limelight, that\u2019s their business, but it\u2019s not going to be through me.\n\nPeople think that because they\u2019re on Twitter or because people are following they can Tweet what they want. You have to respect the fact that people have made the effort\u2014even though it\u2019s not a huge effort\u2014they clicked follow on your picture. \"Oh I\u2019m stuck in traffic,\" \"Oh Breaking Bad was wild.\" If you\u2019re saying these things, say it in an interesting manner. If you know people are paying attention, honor that fact by trying to say something no one else can say. You can add nuance, urgency, fear. My advice would be: be original. If something is obvious, then think about it a little before you Tweet.\n\nImage: Flickr user Cameron Russell\n\nWhen I was going through the worst of my depression, I would think, if I make it through this, I really hope that I can speak about it in a way that might possibly be helpful to other people. If I can help anyone out\u2014anytime anybody contacts me because of what I\u2019ve written\u2014I\u2019m so happy. I feel like it\u2019s my primary purpose. It is fun, to make 5,000 people laugh, and that\u2019s wonderful. But to have one person say \"I\u2019m checking myself into the hospital,\" or \"I didn\u2019t know what I had, but now I know,\" it\u2019s the answering of a prayer.", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Rob Delaney On How To Be The Funniest Person On Twitter", "image": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/10/3019614-poster-p-1-rob-delaney-on-how-he-became-the-funniest-person-on-twitter.jpg", "description": "With a new book out, comedian Rob Delaney shares his completely accessible method for killing on Twitter."}, "description": "With a new book out, comedian Rob Delaney shares his completely accessible method for killing on Twitter.", "og": {"site_name": "Co.Create", "description": "With a new book out, comedian Rob Delaney shares his completely accessible method for killing on Twitter.", "title": "Rob Delaney On How To Be The Funniest Person On Twitter", "url": "http://www.fastcocreate.com/3019614/master-class/rob-delaney-on-how-to-be-the-funniest-person-on-twitter", "image": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/10/3019614-poster-p-1-rob-delaney-on-how-he-became-the-funniest-person-on-twitter.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "fastcocreate.com", "description": "With a new book out, comedian Rob Delaney shares his completely accessible method for killing on Twitter.", "title": "Rob Delaney On How To Be The Funniest Person On Twitter", "url": "http://www.fastcocreate.com/3019614/master-class/rob-delaney-on-how-to-be-the-funniest-person-on-twitter", "image": "http://a.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/620x350/poster/2013/10/3019614-poster-p-1-rob-delaney-on-how-he-became-the-funniest-person-on-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@JessGrose", "site": "@FastCoCreate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000062710915, "pages": 321331447886601, "app_id": 1563945053870390}, "keywords": "rob delaney,twitter,los angeles department of water and power,car accident,power building", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FastCoCreate", "section": "Master Class", "tag": "twitter", "published_time": "2013-11-04T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T19:38:58.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce94c\"", "article_summary": "This was before Comedy Central anointed him the \"Funniest Person on Twitter,\" before his book deal for a collection of essays called Mother.\nSometimes people think I\u2019m a Democrat because I support the Affordable Care Act, but I\u2019m not.\nIf people want to be intellectually lazy, they can say I\u2019m a Democrat.\nBut to have one person say \"I\u2019m checking myself into the hospital,\" or \"I didn\u2019t know what I had, but now I know,\" it\u2019s the answering of a prayer.\nSince Delaney is a master of the Tweet, we asked him for some advice about how to attract a following."}
