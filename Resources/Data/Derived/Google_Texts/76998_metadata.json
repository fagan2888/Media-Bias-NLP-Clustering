Not only was there an association between antibiotic use and a later diabetes diagnosis, but the more prescriptions of antibiotics a person filled out, the greater their risk.\n\nOn average, the team found that 0.8 prescriptions for antibiotics were filled out per year by diabetics, compared to 0.5 prescriptions by healthy controls. Though there wasn\u2019t a large difference seen among any individual antibiotic prescribed, the authors noticed a small increase in risk for those given narrow-spectrum and bactericidal antibiotics (the latter being antibiotics that directly kill rather than weaken bacteria).\n\nThe Danish study is only the latest to find a correlation between antibiotic use and diabetes, which the authors themselves note. This past March, a similar study of United Kingdom citizens published in the European Journal of Endocrinology found that repeated exposure to one of five popular antibiotic types (including penicillin) predicted an increase of \u201cdiabetic risk,\u201d after adjustment for known risk factors like Body Mass Index, smoking history, and history of cardiovascular artery disease.\n\nIn both studies, the authors theorized that antibiotics may exacerbate the development of diabetes by disturbing the microbial communities inside our bodies (specifically the gut microbiota) which influence our metabolism and weight \u2014 obesity also being a risk factor of the condition. However, as the authors admit, there remains the very real chance the relationship between antibiotics and diabetes could be more complicated than that.\n\n\"Although we cannot infer causality from this study, the findings raise the possibility that antibiotics could raise the risk of Type 2 diabetes. Another equally compelling explanation may be that people develop Type 2 diabetes over the course of years and face a greater risk of infection during that time,\u201d Mikkelsen said. Infections are known to be more common in prediabetics and diabetics than the healthy population.\n\nWhether antibiotic use serves as a canary in the coal mine or is a legitimate risk factor for type 2 diabetes, the authors are hopeful that further research on the link between the two continues.\n\n\"Diabetes is one of the greatest challenges facing modern health care, with a globally increasing incidence\" Mikkelsen said. \"Further investigation into long-term effect of antibiotic use on sugar metabolism and gut bacteria composition could reveal valuable answers about how to address this public health crisis. Patterns in antibiotic use may offer an opportunity to prevent the development of the disease or to diagnose it early.\"\n\nSource: Mikkelsen K, Knop F, Frost M, et al.
