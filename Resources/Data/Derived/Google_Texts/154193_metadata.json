By putting money into the pool, but taking little out for medical expenses they \"contribute to the system by spreading around risk,\" said Ceci Connolly, managing director for PwC's Health Research Institute. \"By not needing as much care, they help subsidize potentially sicker participants.\"\n\nThe state healthcare marketplaces, or exchanges, went online on Oct. 1, but have been plagued by technical issues and malfunctioning websites.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Young Uninsured Men Targets of 'Brosurance' Ads", "description": "Young Uninsured Men Targets of 'Brosurance' Ads", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/10/young-uninsured-men-targets-of-brosurance-ads/", "site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Ad campaign targets \"bros\" to buy Obamacare.", "title": "Young Uninsured Men Targets of 'Brosurance' Ads"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"Keg stands are crazy,\" reads the copy for the Brosurance spot, featuring three young men engaged in some classic fratboy antics.\nYoung, healthy people who do not receive insurance through their jobs typically went uninsured in the past.\nGetting the right mix of people, especially young, healthy individuals, is critical to the success of the program, experts and proponents say.\nThe campaign also targets mothers and pregnant women, but six of the eight ads are aimed at young men, a group insurance authorities say are the most needed and least likely to buy insurance.\n\"Brosurance\" is the most viral part of a \"Got Insurance\" campaign launched by the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and Progress Now to encourage the uninsured to purchase healthcare."}
