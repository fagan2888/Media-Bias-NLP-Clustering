And basically, call it the \u2018stupidity of the American voter\u2019 or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe White House was quick to reject Mr. Gruber\u2019s comments. Josh Earnest, the president\u2019s press secretary, said he disagreed \u201cvigorously with that assessment,\u201d and insisted that the \u201cprocess associated with the writing and passing and implementing of the Affordable Care Act has been extraordinarily transparent.\n\nMr. Gruber, an unabashed supporter of the Affordable Care Act, has expressed regret about his comments, telling MSNBC that he was \u201cspeaking off the cuff\u201d and that he \u201cspoke inappropriately\u201d at the academic conference where the video was taken. In an email on Friday, Mr. Gruber declined to comment further.\n\nBut the apology has done little to stave off a furious, new Republican assault on the president\u2019s health care law, using Mr. Gruber\u2019s words as ammunition.\n\nRepublican lawmakers, Tea Party activists and conservative pundits have declared Mr. Gruber to be their new truth-teller, using the videos as contemporaneous evidence that their own critiques of the health care law were supported, even by the most ardent backers of the president\u2019s efforts.\n\nA Twitter post on Friday from Speaker John A. Boehner said simply: \u201cArrogance + deception = #Obamacare.\u201d A news release from the Tea Party Express said that \u201cGruber oozes the elitist arrogance of the Obama administration that thinks their \u2018superior\u2019 Ivy League backgrounds will allow them to pull the wool over our eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said on Twitter on Friday that \u201cJonathan Gruber said what most Americans recognize: that #Obamacare was sold on a lie.\u201d The post linked to a news article with the headline: \u201cObamaCare Architect Thinks You\u2019re Stupid.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials rejected the idea that Mr. Gruber was the \u201carchitect\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. They noted he was never employed by the White House or any federal agency, though he was paid close to $400,000 as a consultant to the Department of Health and Human Services during 2009 and 2010.\n\nBut Mr. Gruber had become a high-profile booster of the president\u2019s signature domestic achievement and participated in its development. During the contentious debate in Congress, top Democrats frequently cited his analysis of the law\u2019s impacts. An invitation to a different October 2013 panel discussion listed him as: \u201ca key architect of the A.C.A., Dr. Jonathan Gruber.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Gruber also made headlines in July when a video surfaced that showed him agreeing that the health care law\u2019s tax subsidies were supposed to go only to states that set up their own health exchanges. Thirty-seven states chose not to. That put Mr. Gruber on the opposite side of the White House in a lawsuit that is heading to the Supreme Court.\n\nHe said at the time that he \u201cmade a mistake in some 2012 speeches,\u201d and reaffirmed his belief that the law\u2019s tax subsidies are proper and constitutional. But Republicans have decided to believe what they see on the videos.\n\n\u201cThe epic search of the Greek philosopher Diogenes for an honest man is finally over,\u201d Rich Lowry wrote in National Review on Friday. \u201c His name is Jonathan Gruber.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141114220013, "twitter": {"description": "Jonathan Gruber, an M.I.T. professor, appears in a video saying the American people were fooled about how the health care law works.", "creator": "shearm", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/us/politics/affordable-care-act-supporter-jonathan-gruber-ignites-fury-with-a-word-stupid.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003236717"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Affordable Care Act Supporter Ignites Fury With a Word: \u2018Stupid\u2019", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/14/multimedia/gruber-healthcare/gruber-healthcare-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/us/politics/affordable-care-act-supporter-jonathan-gruber-ignites-fury-with-a-word-stupid.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003236717", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/us/politics/affordable-care-act-supporter-jonathan-gruber-ignites-fury-with-a-word-stupid.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Care Act Supporter Ignites Fury With a Word: \u2018Stupid\u2019", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 14, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/michael_d_shear/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-11-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Republican Party", "published": "2014-11-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Gruber  Jonathan,United States Politics and Government,Republican Party", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael D.
