(Charles Dharapak/ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nObama's former \"Pastor in Chief\" Joshua DuBois affirmed in 2013 that the President was indeed a \"a deeply faithful President,\" citing his fondness for the Old Testament book of Job, the accounts of the prophet Isaiah and works by theologians such as C.S. Lewis.\n\n\"People are going to believe any range of things about any leader of the country,\" DuBois said in an interview with ABC News about those who questioned the sincerity of Obama's Christian faith.\n\n\"All the President can do is live out his Christian walk every single day. The detractors will do their detracting, but at the end of the day it's about his relationship with God and that relationship, from all that I can tell, is strong.\"\n\nThe Gallup poll results were based on the group's interviews in the first six months of 2014, when the President's job approval rating averaged 43% among Americans.\n\nllarson@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "LESLIE LARSON", "twitter": {"description": "Muslims have the most faith in President Obama\u2019s administration.", "title": "Muslims approve of Obama; Mormons don't", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/muslims-approve-obama-mormons-not-article-1.1863095", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1863099.1405082145!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Leslie Larson", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-11T12:27:56", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/muslims-approve-obama-mormons-not-article-1.1863095", "parsely-title": "Muslims approve of Obama; Mormons don't", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-11T08:27:56-0400", "sailthru.title": "Muslims approve of Obama; Mormons don't", "nydn_section": "Politics", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1863099.1405082145!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "description": "Muslims have the most faith in President Obama\u2019s administration.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Muslims have the most faith in President Obama\u2019s administration.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Muslims have the most faith in President Obama\u2019s administration.", "title": "Muslims approve of Obama; Mormons don't", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/muslims-approve-obama-mormons-not-article-1.1863095", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1863099.1405082145!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-prayer-breakfast.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "LESLIE LARSON", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1863099.1405082145!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/obama-prayer-breakfast.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7ee\"", "article_summary": "President Obama, at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2014, has a high approval rating among Muslims but is held in low regard by Catholics, Protestants and Mormons.\nConservative critics of Obama have long declared him the \u201cfirst Muslim President,\u201d though Obama has professed he is a Christian.\nMuslims have the most faith in President Obama\u2019s administration.\nMormons showed the lowest level of satisfaction with Obama (78% disapprove), colored no doubt by the President\u2019s defeat of Mormon Republican challenger Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.\nAmong religious groups in the U.S., followers of Islam were overwhelmingly the most approving of the President (72%), according to the results of a Gallup poll released Friday."}
