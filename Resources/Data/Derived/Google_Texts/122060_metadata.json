Earlier this year, he found a way to get his artwork out into the world, and customers\u2019 closets, when he started a silk-screening business, Noah Spengler Limited (NSL). And though it\u2019s just getting started, he\u2019s shipped t-shirts and sweatshirts with his designs as far as the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nHe built the press himself, by hand. He put together his screens himself, by hand. And, of course, all the drawings are his own, culled from his notebook and adapted for the wider world of apparel.\n\n\u201cJust about everything is made by hand,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the screens to the presses.\u201d\n\nHe taught himself everything about the process of silk screening online, including how to build the press.\n\nHe began drawing when he was 5 or 6, he said, and when he was a freshman in high school, he and his mother went to Juneau artist M.K. MacNaughton\u2019s studio, where he began painting. Though he\u2019s the one that came up with his own funding, his parents, Kasia and Tim Spengler, have been a big support for the business, he said.\n\nDrawing, though, is still his favorite - he likes the simplicity of its needs.\n\nRight now, he has four total designs that he prints on his shirts. One design is mountains and clouds, but others are more abstract, things he figured out through the process of creating.\n\n\u201cOnce I start drawing, I just draw more and more and more,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s been skiing since he was a kid, too, moving from racing to freeskiing when he was in his early teens. Now, freeskiers are his biggest clients.\n\nHe posted on a freeskiing website, www.newschoolers.com, this spring.\n\nThat website is what \u201cbrought it to life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat people wear, a lot of people (in the freeskiing community) sort of value it.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s got a website and is ready to grow.\n\nHe sponsors four freeskiing athletes around America, and is adding a few more to the roster, he said. He\u2019ll soon have business cards and a company logo, and is looking at getting his designs into local, and out-of-town, stores.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019m looking forward to getting into,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s also thinking beyond his bottom line. Spengler donates 10 percent of the profits from his business to the nonprofit Bread for the World.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough all my life to have food, but many people don\u2019t have that. (It\u2019s) just something that I can do to help people,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say being a high school junior with a business is free of challenges.\n\n\u201cTime can be kind of (limited), with a lot of homework and skiing in the winter,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it does all fit together \u2026 It\u2019s really just cool to see where it\u2019s going. It\u2019s just the beginning, I think.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Noah Spengler is a 17-year-old with a business he's created by hand.", "Author": "MARY CATHARINE MARTIN", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Noah Spengler is a 17-year-old with a business he\u2019s created by hand.", "title": "Making Local Work: Noah Spengler Limited", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/13/making-local-work-noah-spengler-limited/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/11/kid_businessman.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/11/kid_businessman.jpeg", "title": "Making Local Work: Noah Spengler Limited", "description": "Noah Spengler is a 17-year-old with a business he's created by hand.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) - Noah Spengler is a 17-year-old with a business he\u2019s created by hand.\nEarlier this year, he found a way to get his artwork out into the world, and customers\u2019 closets, when he started a silk-screening business, Noah Spengler Limited (NSL).\nHe posted on a freeskiing website, www.newschoolers.com, this spring.\nHe\u2019ll soon have business cards and a company logo, and is looking at getting his designs into local, and out-of-town, stores.\nAnd though it\u2019s just getting started, he\u2019s shipped t-shirts and sweatshirts with his designs as far as the United Kingdom and Australia."}
