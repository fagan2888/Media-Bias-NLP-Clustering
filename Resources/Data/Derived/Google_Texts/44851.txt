Dinesh D’Souza, the right-wing author, pundit and filmmaker, was indicted Thursday night for campaign finance fraud. According to the indictment, D’Souza, in support of his college friend’s challenge to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, had attempted to circumvent the $5,000 limit for individual donations by having other friends of his donate, too, and then reimbursing them later. It may be the low point of D’Souza’s life and career.

We say “may be” rather than “definitely is” because of the simple fact that, for much of the past two years, D’Souza’s time on this planet has been filled with ignominy and failure. As the Daily Beast’s David Sessions notes, D’Souza went from riding high on the success of his very profitable (and racist) “documentary” — “2016: Obama’s America” — to being forced to resign as president of King’s College, an evangelical school in New York City after becoming engaged with one woman while he was still married to another.

Yet even “2016” would come to bring D’Souza trouble. David Sain, the producer of the film, ultimately sued D’Souza, claiming the pundit had done a poor job managing the movie’s finances and had also kept producers and other stakeholders in the dark when it was time to make decisions about distribution and marketing. The lawsuit was eventually tossed by a judge, but the blemish on what was previously an absolute success was yet another bump on D’Souza’s as of late very rocky road.
