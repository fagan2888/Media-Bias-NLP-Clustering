In all, 651 CEOs or other company leaders participated, including 157 in the Capital Region. The respondents answered a 40-question survey. At the Times Union, reporters contacted several of the participating business leaders for follow-up questions and to gain additional insight. Their work appears here.

They're not too optimistic,\" he said. \"But for us, I can't say that.\"\n\nBut Wainman, too, is frustrated about his dealings with government, in this case the Town of East Greenbush.\n\nThe company is expanding there, and plans a new headquarters with 30 to 40 employees.\n\nAfter it put up a sign announcing its future home, \"the first call we got was from the building inspector asking if we had a permit.\"\n\nWainman said he'd expected a warmer welcome.\n\nOverall, CEOs in the Capital Region \u2014 Siena interviewed 157 of them for this report \u2014 were more optimistic about the economy than those in the other three upstate regions: Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo.\n\nThe confidence index of 110.4 \u2014 10.4 points above the break-even of 100, where pessimism and optimism are in balance \u2014 was the highest of the four regions and the highest at any time in the seven-year history of the survey.\n\nThirty-seven percent of the Capital Region's business leaders are optimistic, 48 percent are \"status quo,\" and just 15 percent are pessimistic, the survey found.\n\nOverall upstate, the figures are 31 percent optimistic, 45 percent \"status quo,\" and 24 pessimistic.\n\nBad news for job seekers: The optimism so far hasn't translated into plans to hire more people, said Levy.\n\n\"We're about equal in the numbers who say they plan to increase their workforce,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, just 1 percent of respondents said they plan to substantially increase hiring, the same percentage as in the other metropolitan areas. Another 25 percent locally said they'd \"moderately increase\" hiring, slightly less than the average in the other upstate metros. Ten percent, meanwhile, said they plan to reduce their workforce locally.\n\nComplete results for all four metropolitan areas may be found on the Times Union's website, at http://www.timesunion.com/sienasurvey\n\neanderson@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5323", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Government officials will find little comfort in what business leaders told Siena Research Institute.
