While most beers rely on carbon dioxide for fizz and flavor, nitro beer is infused with nitrogen gas, which results in smaller bubbles and a smoother, creamier beer.

"Changing from carbon dioxide to nitrogen is absolutely transformative," said Jim Koch, founder of Samuel Adams beer and chairman of Boston Beer Company. "The two will give you different flavors. It is a much more dramatic change in flavor than changing the hop variety."



Nitro beer is typically found on tap, due to the challenge and complexity in bottling or canning nitrogenated beers.



Many beer drinkers are already familiar with cans and bottles using plastic nitro widgets, thanks to the Diageo-owned Guinness brand and its iconic stout. That uses nitrogen-filled widgets to release the gas when the beer is opened, resulting in a "hiss."
