Now, counties must certify twice a year, but the monthly reports from recipients are no longer required. And modifications to benefits in the six-month period occur only if the recipient was due more, not less, money, records show.\n\nSince the change went into effect in July 2013, counties have seen an increase in the number of people collecting welfare, and the state set a 24-month expenditure record in June for Colorado Works, which is what the state calls its TANF program, state records show.\n\nThe documents conceded the change could increase money going to welfare recipients and keep them on the program longer.\n\n\u201cIn some circumstances, the Certification Period may result in a modest increase to a participant\u2019s grant, or may lengthen time spent in the program,\u201d the analysis portion of the document states. \u201cCost increases would be covered by the county\u2019s Colorado Works block grant.\u201d\n\nBut state figures show modest appears to be in the eye of the beholder or, in this case, bureaucrat.\n\nWhen the rule change went into effect in July 2013, about $10.7 million in federal TANF money went to counties for Colorado Works recipients, records show. And although the amount fluctuates \u2014 sometimes wildly \u2014 month to month, by June of this year taxpayers were spending $16.8 million a month for Colorado Works, records show.\n\nState Sen. Kevin Lundberg, a Berthoud Republican who sits on the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said he was not aware of the rule change or possible fiscal impact until a reporter told him about it.\n\n\u201cFar too many agencies shovel out the money as quickly they can,\u201d Lundberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s the entitlement attitude that the agency is there to provide benefits and the more people who get benefits, the more successful the agencies are. They are not supposed to be sugar daddies.\u201d\n\nLevetta Love, director of its Office of Economic Security, defended the change as helping to reduce county workloads, allowing social workers to make sure recipients have the skills and resources to transition off welfare.\n\n\u201cWe felt as a state that our customers needed to be able to stabilize before they were moved directly to a job\u2026 so that they would stay off assistance,\u201d Love said.\n\n\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The documents conceded the change could increase money going to welfare recipients and keep them on the program longer.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The documents conceded the change could increase money going to welfare recipients and keep them on the program longer.", "title": "Colorado\u2019s New Welfare Rule Increases Benefits, Costs Taxpayers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/200556773-001.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-18T20:42:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1AdqSjz"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The documents conceded the change could increase money going to welfare recipients and keep them on the program longer.", "title": "Colorado\u2019s New Welfare Rule Increases Benefits, Costs Taxpayers", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/200556773-001.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "welfare", "published_time": "2014-11-19T03:01:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-18T20:42:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "welfare, colorado, welfare waste, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe48ec\"", "article_summary": "And although the amount fluctuates \u2014 sometimes wildly \u2014 month to month, by June of this year taxpayers were spending $16.8 million a month for Colorado Works, records show.\nAnd modifications to benefits in the six-month period occur only if the recipient was due more, not less, money, records show.\nWhen the rule change went into effect in July 2013, about $10.7 million in federal TANF money went to counties for Colorado Works recipients, records show.\nBefore the change, counties had to certify welfare recipients\u2019 eligibility to receive benefits annually, but recipients had to submit monthly status reports to ensure they qualified for benefits and received the correct amount.\nThe documents conceded the change could increase money going to welfare recipients and keep them on the program longer."}
