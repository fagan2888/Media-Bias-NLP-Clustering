Colorado Republican Congressman and U.S. Senate Candidate Cory Gardner has suggested birth control pills should be over-the-counter as part of his campaign platform and stance on women's health. Instead of applauding Gardner's approach, which would greatly expand women's access to birth control, Planned Parenthood has come out against him. The justification? Obamacare and government dependence for women is better.\n\n\"If Cory Gardner and others were serious about expanding access to birth control, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to repeal the no-copay birth control benefit, reduce Title X funding for birth control, or cut women off from Planned Parenthood\u2019s preventive health services. This is simply a cynical political attempt to whitewash his terrible record and agenda for women's health. The reality is that Cory Gardner\u2019s proposal would actually cost women more by forcing them to pay out of pocket for the birth control that they are getting now at no cost thanks to the ACA. We would welcome a sincere conversation about expanding birth control access for women - sadly Cory Gardner has not offered one,\" Planned Parenthood Action Fund Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said in a statement.\n\nBig government leftists like Laugens wage their own war on women by making them more dependent on government and by treating them like victims. Planned Parenthood wants to limit access to contraception so long as it's \"free\" with a prescription through big government mandates in Obamacare and 100 percent higher healthcare premiums for women overall, proving that this isn't about access to birth control, but instead making women dependent on Uncle Sam at all costs.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ridiculous. .05/26/2016 2:27:11AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Ridiculous.", "title": "- Planned Parenthood Wants to Limit Women's Access to Birth Control to Save Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/09/09/planned-parenthood-wants-to-limit-womens-access-to-birth-control-n1889034", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/84/3ed8b3c5-b7b9-485e-a220-e1dc6cb6340e.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Ridiculous.", "title": "- Planned Parenthood Wants to Limit Women's Access to Birth Control to Save Obamacare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/09/09/planned-parenthood-wants-to-limit-womens-access-to-birth-control-n1889034", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/84/3ed8b3c5-b7b9-485e-a220-e1dc6cb6340e.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Planned Parenthood Wants to Limit Women's Access to Birth Control to Save Obamacare, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca533\"", "article_summary": "Instead of applauding Gardner's approach, which would greatly expand women's access to birth control, Planned Parenthood has come out against him.\nThis is simply a cynical political attempt to whitewash his terrible record and agenda for women's health.\n\"If Cory Gardner and others were serious about expanding access to birth control, they wouldn\u2019t be trying to repeal the no-copay birth control benefit, reduce Title X funding for birth control, or cut women off from Planned Parenthood\u2019s preventive health services.\nWe would welcome a sincere conversation about expanding birth control access for women - sadly Cory Gardner has not offered one,\" Planned Parenthood Action Fund Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens said in a statement.\nColorado Republican Congressman and U.S. Senate Candidate Cory Gardner has suggested birth control pills should be over-the-counter as part of his campaign platform and stance on women's health."}
