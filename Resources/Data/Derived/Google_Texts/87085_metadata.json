But under the same provision, most of the remainder of Obamacare may be unconstitutional.\n\nAs I reported in February, I have been involved in a multi-month study into the meaning of the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause and its implications for the ACA. The Origination Clause is the Constitution\u2019s rule that \u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\u201d My project was provoked by several federal lawsuits that claimed that because (1) the Supreme Court has held that the penalty for not buying insurance is a \u201ctax,\u201d and (2) the ACA law really originated in the Senate, therefore (3) the penalty was unconstitutionally adopted.\n\nHere\u2019s how the ACA became law: First, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3590, a bill to expand a tax credit and force certain corporations to pay income taxes earlier than previously required. When H.R. 3590 went to the Senate, that body \u201camended\u201d it to delete all six pages in the bill and insert the 2076-page ACA. This amendment \u201cin the nature of a substitute\u201d included not only the penalty for failing to purchase insurance, but a mass of other new taxes, appropriations, and regulations. The Senate then adopted the revised H.R. 3590 and sent it back to the House, which passed it.\n\nMany people instinctively react against this procedure, but instinctive reaction is not the same as constitutional law. My job was to reconstruct the actual meaning of the Origination Clause, not expound what I would like it to mean. I therefore reviewed the debates over the Clause at the Constitutional Convention and in the ensuing ratification contest. I then turned to 18th century legislative vocabulary, procedures, and practice. This required reviewing 50 years of British parliamentary records; examining several decades of legislative records in 14 American colonies and states; consulting 18th century treatises and other writings; and reviewing the records of the Continental Congress (1774-81), the Confederation Congress (1781-89), and the First Federal Congress (1789-91). Here is what I learned:\n\n* Any measure that alters the tax code to raise or reduce revenue is a \u201cBill for raising Revenue.\u201d Another way to state it is that any law that can be justified only by the Taxation Clause (I-8-1) rather than by some other enumerated power is a \u201cBill for raising Revenue.\u201d Thus, the original H.R. 3590 qualified as a \u201cBill for raising Revenue\u201d as the Constitution uses the term, even though it was revenue-neutral or revenue-negative.\n\n* The Constitution permits the Senate to adopt \u201cAmendments\u201d to \u201cBills for raising Revenue.\u201d\n\n* The Senate\u2019s \u201cAmendment\u201d of H.R. 3590 was what is called a \u201ccomplete substitute.\u201d I could find no precedents for complete substitutes in British parliamentary practice, but they did exist in early American practice.\n\n* The constitutional term \u201cAmendments\u201d is broad, but not unlimited in scope. As the Founders used the word, an \u201camendment\u201d might make virtually any kind of alteration in the underlying bill, BUT it had to address the same subject matter as the underlying bill. This rule also applied to amendments that, like H.R. 3590, were complete substitutes.\n\n* For constitutional purposes, all tax/revenue measures are deemed to address the same subject as all other tax/revenue measures. So even an amendment (or substitute) that completely changes the taxes in the underlying bill is a valid amendment.\n\n* Given the Supreme Court\u2019s decision that the penalty for not buying insurance is a \u201ctax\u201d (a decision that was erroneous, but is now settled law) the Senate was within the rightful scope of its amendment power by adding the penalty and other taxes to the original H.R. 3950.\n\n* However, the original H.R. 3590 addressed only taxes. The House could have added appropriations or regulations, but it did not. The Senate not only added the penalty/tax. It also inserted appropriations for various purposes and regulations on health care providers, employers, and insurance companies.\n\n*The added regulations did NOT address the same subject (revenue) as the underlying H.R. 3590. It was therefore outside the amendment power of the Senate to add those regulations. From an originalist point of view, those regulations are void as never properly enacted, even though the House voted for them.\n\n* This is true even though the Senate could have originated the regulations itself in a separate bill. When amending a revenue bill, the Senate does not have power as broad as it does when originating its own (non-revenue) bills.\n\n* In addition, the Senate inserted appropriations into H.R. 3590. These probably was also outside the Senate\u2019s amendment power.\n\nA court constrained by the Supreme Court\u2019s Obamacare decision, but otherwise applying the Constitution\u2019s original meaning, should rule as follows: It should uphold the ACA\u2019s taxes, including the penalty for not buying insurance, but strike down the regulations and appropriations in the law.\n\nYou can read the entire study here.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is the penalty for not buying insurance in the Affordable Care Act (ACA\u2014Obamacare) unconstitutional as a \u201ctax\u201d that originated in the Senate?", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "Is the penalty for not buying insurance in the Affordable Care Act (ACA\u2014Obamacare) unconstitutional as a \u201ctax\u201d that originated in the Senate?", "title": "The Results Are In: The Obamacare \"Penalty\" Didn\u2019t Violate the Origination Clause, but Obamacare\u2019s Regulations Did | Tenth Amendment Center", "url": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2014/05/27/the-results-are-in-the-obamacare-penalty-didnt-violate-the-origination-clause-but-obamacares-regulations-did/", "image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Constitution.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Constitution.jpg", "description": "Is the penalty for not buying insurance in the Affordable Care Act (ACA\u2014Obamacare) unconstitutional as a \u201ctax\u201d that originated in the Senate?", "card": "summary", "title": "The Results Are In: The Obamacare \"Penalty\" Didn\u2019t Violate the Origination Clause, but Obamacare\u2019s Regulations Did | Tenth Amendment Center"}, "fb": {"pages": 143173285763}, "keywords": "constitution origination clause,origination clause,obamacare penalty,obamacare origination,constitution", "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/tenthamendmentcenter", "tag": "constitution", "published_time": "2014-05-27T09:11:12Z", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T09:11:12Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd049f\"", "article_summary": "When amending a revenue bill, the Senate does not have power as broad as it does when originating its own (non-revenue) bills.\nUnder the Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause, the answer appears to be \u201cno\u201d\u2014the Senate\u2019s decision to add the penalty to the underlying bill was not a violation of that Clause.\n3590, a bill to expand a tax credit and force certain corporations to pay income taxes earlier than previously required.\nMy job was to reconstruct the actual meaning of the Origination Clause, not expound what I would like it to mean.\nIs the penalty for not buying insurance in the Affordable Care Act (ACA\u2014Obamacare) unconstitutional as a \u201ctax\u201d that originated in the Senate?"}
