An interesting acquisition for the team, because he will be the first tribal member to carry the team\u2019s namesake on his uniform.\n\n\u201cIt feels surreal,\u201d Motlow told The Seminole Tribune.\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d be able to play here. I\u2019m going to make the most of my opportunity and keep working.\u201d\n\nFSU head coach Jimbo Fisher said Motlow\u2019s Native heritage is truly meaningful for the team and the school. \u201cWe just want to represent the Seminole family for all they have done for us,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to have a family member wear that helmet.\u201d\n\nMotlow\u2019s grandmother is 100-percent Seminole and Motlow is one-fourth Seminole. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved FSU and they are a great program,\u201d he told Yahoo News. \u201cBut to be able to have a chance to represent the Nation, that\u2019s an extreme honor.\u201d\n\nRELATED:The 10 Best Twitter Comments About FSU's New Logo\n\nRELATED:ESPN Has \u2018No Comment' on Its College GameDay 'Minstrel Show'\n\nAt Tampa Catholic High School, Motlow was the Crusader\u2019s 2013 offensive player of the year and had 1,000 yards receiving as a senior. Now at FSU, Motlow said that he has to train twice as hard to keep up with his teammates, but his coaches are taking notice.\n\n\u201cI like what I see,\u201d said Lawrence Dawsey, FSU\u2019s co-offensive coordinator coach. \u201cJustin has good ball skills. He can run good routes and can catch the ball. He will be a good football player, but his head is spinning with the new offense and the tempo. But he\u2019s eager to learn, and not backing down.\u201d\n\nMotlow came to FSU as a walk-on, so he won\u2019t travel with the team, but he will suit up at home games. \"I just want to play football and get a great education,\" Motlow said to FlaVarsity.com. \"I feel very blessed to have the chance to do bott \u2013 if it works out.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Justin Motlow says that he\u2019s just happy to be playing football, but the 5-foot-11, 182-", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/03/seminole-makes-history-first-football-player-wear-fsu-jersey-156730", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/justin_motlow.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Seminole Makes History as First Football Player to Wear FSU Jersey"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-09-03T16:42-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/09/03/seminole-makes-history-first-football-player-wear-fsu-jersey-156730", "dc": {"title": "Seminole Makes History as First Football Player to Wear FSU Jersey"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Seminole Makes History as First Football Player to Wear FSU Jersey"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe106b\"", "article_summary": "He will be a good football player, but his head is spinning with the new offense and the tempo.\n\u201cIt feels surreal,\u201d Motlow told The Seminole Tribune.\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d be able to play here.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great honor to have a family member wear that helmet.\u201dMotlow\u2019s grandmother is 100-percent Seminole and Motlow is one-fourth Seminole.\nNow at FSU, Motlow said that he has to train twice as hard to keep up with his teammates, but his coaches are taking notice.\nThis season, Motlow, who is from Tampa, will suit up as a Florida State University Seminole."}
