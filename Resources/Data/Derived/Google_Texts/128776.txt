The parade of presidential candidates continues Friday at the Iowa State Fair.

Republican Ted Cruz took to the Des Moines Register Soapbox on Friday morning.

KCCI's Cynthia Fodor reports Cruz talked about abolishing the IRS, padlocking its office doors and send 90,000 IRS employees to the border to keep out illegal immigrants.



Cruz said he would also repeal Obamacare, abolish Common Core, secure the border and rebuild the military.

Cruz said he would rescind every executive action, defund Planned Parenthood and rip up the nuclear deal President Obama has reached with Iran.
