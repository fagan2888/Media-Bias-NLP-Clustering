The image location was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of where an Australian satellite viewed two objects two days earlier. The larger object was about as long as the one the Chinese satellite detected.\n\n\u201cThe news that I just received is that the Chinese ambassador received a satellite image of a floating object in the southern corridor and they will be sending ships to verify,\u201d Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters Saturday said.\n\nThe latest image is another clue in a baffling search for Flight 370, which went missing March 8 shortly after leaving Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.\n\nAfter about a week of confusion, authorities said pings sent by the Boeing 777 for several hours after it disappeared from air traffic control screens indicated that the plane ended up in one of two huge arcs: a northern corridor stretching from Malaysia up to Central Asia, or a southern corridor that stretches in an arch toward Antarctica.\n\nThe discovery of the two objects by the Australian satellite led several countries to send planes and ships to the area, about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) southwest of Australia. One of the objects spotted in the earlier satellite imagery was described as 24 meters (almost 80 feet) in length and the other was 5 meters (15 feet). But three days of searching have produced nothing.\n\nTwo military planes from China arrived Saturday in Perth to join Australian, New Zealand and U.S. aircraft in the search. Japanese planes will arrive Sunday and ships were in the area or on their way.\n\nThe flights Saturday in relatively good weather also did not yield any results, and it was not immediately known if the newly released Chinese satellite image would change the search area on Sunday.\n\nEven if both satellites detected the same object, it may be unrelated to the plane. One possibility is that it could have fallen off a cargo vessel.\n\nErik van Sebille, an oceanographer at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said the currents in the area typically move at about one meter (yard) per second although can sometimes move faster.\n\nBased on the typical speed, a current could theoretically move a floating object about 173 kilometers (107 miles) in two days.\n\nWarren Truss, Australia\u2019s acting prime minister while Tony Abbott is abroad, said before the new satellite data was announced that a complete search could take a long time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ships are heading to investigate a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean thanks to new images", "title": "Breaking: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 update: Chinese satellite finds object in Indian Ocean, may be possible wreckage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ships are heading to investigate a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean thanks to new images", "title": "Breaking: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 update: Chinese satellite finds object in Indian Ocean, may be possible wreckage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/22/breaking_malaysia_airlines_flight_mh370_update_chinese_satellite_finds_object_in_indian_ocean_may_be_possible_wreckage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/RTR3I4R4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ships are heading to investigate a remote stretch of the Indian Ocean thanks to new images", "title": "Breaking: Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 update: Chinese satellite finds object in Indian Ocean, may be possible wreckage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/RTR3I4R4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott McDonald and Rob Griffith", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Chinese satellite, Indian Ocean, malaysia airlines, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, MH370, new photos", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The larger object was about as long as the one the Chinese satellite detected.\nTopics: Chinese satellite, Indian Ocean, malaysia airlines, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, MH370, new photos, NewsKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 A satellite image released by China on Saturday offers a new sign that wreckage from a Malaysia Airlines plane lost for more than two weeks could be in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean where planes and ships have been searching for three days.\nThe flights Saturday in relatively good weather also did not yield any results, and it was not immediately known if the newly released Chinese satellite image would change the search area on Sunday.\nThe image location was about 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of where an Australian satellite viewed two objects two days earlier.\nChina\u2019s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense said on its website that a Chinese satellite took an image of an object 22 meters (72 feet) by 13 meters (43 feet) around noon Tuesday."}
