At 150 pages, the White House budget proposal for 2016 uses the term 26 times, predictably invoking it when referring to cuts and reductions in services. \"The Budget includes initiatives to improve the service we provide to the American public; to leverage the Federal Government\u2019s buying power to bring more value and efficiency to how we use taxpayer dollars...,\" President Barack Obama writes in his introductory message. \"The Budget includes proposals to consolidate and reorganize Government agencies to make them leaner and more efficient, and it increases the use of evidence and evaluation to ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely on programs that work.\"\n\nThere are countless examples of this reading of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d bleeding out of official rheotric and into mainstream political commentary. Consider Megan McArdle\u2019s recent meditation on prison reform in Bloomberg View, in which she points out that \u201cprison is \u2026 very expensive,\u201d and therefore, \u201cwhile we're punishing the criminal, we're also heavily punishing the taxpayer.\u201d Imagining tax payment as a kind of punishment is the upshot to the general use of the term, however innocuously the majority of its speakers may intend it. If money owed in taxes is imagined, as in the budget plan and McArdle\u2019s usage, to belong to the taxpayer, then programs operating off of public revenue do seem to have some obligation to correspond to their funders\u2019 consent, and serving the interests of others does seem unfair. But these are all obfuscations brought on by the term.\n\nThe same laws that determine that money deposited into a person\u2019s bank account belongs to that person also determine that taxes owed on that deposit do not. Public revenue is just that: a pool of public money to be used for the good of the public, not 300 million pools of private money each to be used to serve private individuals\u2019 interests. What is in the interest of the public may involve expenditures that can\u2019t be filed in a pay-in-cash-out formula, as the \u201ctaxpayer\u201d terminology would suggest. Kids, for example, usually don\u2019t pay taxes whatsoever, but spending on children is a necessary social function. Our roads and public utilities, too, are available to anyone inside our borders, not because they have been purchased, but because strong infrastructure provides for the common good.\n\nAlong with wrongly dividing the public into various private interest sets, taxpayer terminology also seems to subtly promote the idea that a person\u2019s share in our democratic governance should depend upon their contribution in taxes. If government should respond to the will of taxpayers because programs are incorrectly supposed to be financed on their dime, then those contributing larger shares would seem to be due greater consideration, like shareholders in a company. (It would also mean that the countless undocumented immigrants who contribute more than $10 billion a year in taxes ought to become voting citizens.) But this view is precisely contrary to the democratic vision invoked in historical verbiage like \u201cconsent of the governed,\u201d as it mistakes the source of a person\u2019s rights. Our share in democracy arises not from what we can pay into it, but from the fact that we are persons and personhood confers certain obligations and dues.\n\nWhereas \"taxpayers\" is strewn throughout political documents, \u201cpeople\u201d is associated with populist and revolutionary movements, and not for nothing. Power to the people, the evergreen revolutionary slogan trumpeted by popular fronts around the world, has a ring that power to the taxpayers does not precisely because it demands an inclusive view of public goods. The same could be said about the first line of the U.S. Constitution: \"We the Taxpayers\" would have been an odd construction for a nation born from a revolt against British taxation. So let's leave \"taxpayer\" to the IRS and remove it from everyday speech.
