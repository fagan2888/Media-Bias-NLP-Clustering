Those who oppose state's wolf hunt fail to understand damage wolves do here.

EDITOR: On January 7, Daily Herald Media published three "pro-wolf" letters. The writers live in Wyoming, Kentucky and New Jersey. I'm wondering if the authors of the letters have ever visited Oneida County in Wisconsin? Probably not. If they want the wolves in their states, let's ship some to them, because Wisconsin has too many.

Addressing the reference to ranchers' losses due to predation being less than the losses to diseases: The ranchers work hard to combat the diseases but are not allowed to do anything about wolves taking down their livestock. A mention of Lewis and Clark from the 1800s is not coupled with reminders that in those days people could shoot wolves that were harming their livestock.

There is no effective deterrent for wolves except for hunting and trapping. The Department of Natural Resources' management of deer herds in Wisconsin has depleted the deer population to such low numbers that the increase of uncontrolled predators, such as wolves, will greatly hinder their bouncing back.

In summary, we can live with 350 wolves. Let us harvest the many hundreds or more there are over 350 because this is 2015, not 1803 when there was plenty of space for all herds and packs. The writers should confine their concerns to Wyoming, Kentucky and New Jersey because, as evidenced by their letters, they don't know anything about problems wolves are causing in northern Wisconsin.
