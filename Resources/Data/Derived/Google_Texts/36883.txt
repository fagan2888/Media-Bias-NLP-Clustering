The past five years have been a whirlwind for Republican Scott Brown.

Once trailing Democrat Martha Coakley in the race to fill the late Sen. Ted Kennedy’s seat in Massachusetts by 30 points, Brown rode a wave of Tea Party fervor and anti-establishment sentiment to defeat Coakley by a five-point margin. The loss of the liberal lion’s seat hit Democrats hard, but the party knew it would have a much better chance of ousting Brown in 2012, when the seat’s full six-year term was up for election. Democrats scored a major coup when progressive champion and Wall Street foe Elizabeth Warren tossed her hat into the ring. After a hard-faught campaign, Warren bested Brown by eight points.

Few observers expected Brown to abandon electoral politics upon leaving office. He joined a corporate law firm and scored a gig as a Fox News contributor, ensuring he’d remain a familiar face to the conservative activists who’d prove crucial in his future endeavors.

Speculation surrounding his political ambitions never lurked far beneath the surface. Brown passed on the opportunity to run in the special election to replace Sen. John Kerry, who left to become President Obama’s secretary of state. A far better prize awaited him on Beacon Hill. After eight years of Democratic control under Gov. Deval Patrick, observers had several to believe that Bay Staters would return the governorship to a Republican in 2014. (And they did, narrowly electing businessman Charlie Baker over Coakley.) Indeed, some speculated that the very reason Brown passed on the race to fill Kerry’s seat was that he’d rather run for governor.
