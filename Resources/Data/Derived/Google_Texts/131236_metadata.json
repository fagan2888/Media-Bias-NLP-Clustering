The company believes that adding patient volume through consolidation is the best way to pursue the broader goal of keeping populations healthy, Chief Financial Officer Timothy O'Connor told the publication.\n\n\"Many of us believe that population health management is likely to continue. That means utilization of healthcare services will continue to go down,\" he said. \"As a result, hospitals want to care for a larger population of patients at the lowest utilization rate in order to sustain their financial viability.\"\n\nSome hospitals have also tailored their design to meet population health needs, FierceHealthcare has reported, spearheading efforts to make their campuses more convenient and community-friendly.\n\nBut health systems do not have to go it alone in the effort to better manage population health. Some of the most successful population health strategies include hospital-community partnerships; hospital-employer collaboration; consumer-tailored websites that allow patients to manage their health and access resources; and data-driven strategies such as segmenting the population via health-risk stratification, according to a recent thought paper from Aegis Health Group.\n\n\"These proactive plans address [hospitals'] local consumer population, turning them into engaged patients which should yield dividends as health systems navigate the value- and performance-based world to their advantage,\" Aegis President and CEO Phil Suiter said in an announcement.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the first Healthcare Finance News article\n\n- read the second Healthcare Finance News piece\n\n- check out the Aegis thought paper\n\n- here's the Aegis announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow one rural hospital is rethinking population health management\n\nHospitals work to address community needs in compliance with ACA\n\nThe future of population health management\n\nBetter population health requires hospital-community partnership\n\n3 keys to a successful population health management approach\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "With improving\u00a0population health management high on the list of many healthcare executives' goals, some hospitals have discovered that the best way to achieve this is to join forces with other facilities.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "With improving\u00a0population health management high on the list of many healthcare executives' goals, some hospitals have discovered that the best way to achieve this is to join forces with other facilities.", "title": "Hospitals go big to take on population health management", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospitals-go-big-take-population-health-management/2015-02-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,community benefit,hospitals mergers and acquisitions,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Population Health Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "To learn more:- here's the first Healthcare Finance News article- read the second Healthcare Finance News piece- check out the Aegis thought paper- here's the Aegis announcementRelated Articles:How one rural hospital is rethinking population health managementHospitals work to address community needs in compliance with ACAThe future of population health managementBetter population health requires hospital-community partnership3 keys to a successful population health management approach\nBut health systems do not have to go it alone in the effort to better manage population health.\n\"Many of us believe that population health management is likely to continue.\nSome hospitals have also tailored their design to meet population health needs, FierceHealthcare has reported, spearheading efforts to make their campuses more convenient and community-friendly.\nWith improving population health management high on the list of many healthcare executives' goals, some hospitals have discovered that the best way to achieve this is to join forces with other facilities."}
