Denver police have captured two robbery suspects near the intersection of Park Avenue West and Glenarm Place, according to the department’s Twitter account.

Police in patrol vehicles were chasing two people who robbed a jewelry store on the 700 block of Federal Boulevard around 11 a.m. Monday and fled in a sedan.

The suspects, a man and a woman, were armed, the Twitter report said. Police recovered weapons believed to have been used in the robbery.

There were no shots fired during the incident and there were no reported injuries, said Sonny Jackson, a Denver Police Department spokesman.

Joshua Hines, a construction worker, said he had a bird’s-eye view of the tail-end of the pursuit, which wrapped up on West Park Avenue near the intersection of Glenarm Place.

Hines heard vehicles “screeching” and he looked out a second-story window to see a Denver police officer in a patrol car perform a “pit maneuver,” forcing the suspect car up onto a sidewalk where it hit a tree.

“Two people got out of the car and ran down the alley,” Hines said, with officers right behind them.

A short time later an officer came out of the alley with one of the suspects in handcuffs, Hines said.

The other suspect was caught about a block away, according to Jackson.

The intersection and a couple of blocks in either direction were shut down as police chased the suspects and interviewed witnesses afterward. Motorists should expect delays in the area.

The names of the suspects, who remain in custody, were not immediately released.
