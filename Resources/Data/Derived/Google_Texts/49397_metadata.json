For starters, a small business owner recently profiled in The Wall Street Journal said that \"she doesn't plan to hire more workers since it would create an administrative burden for eventually complying with the law.\"\n\nAdditionally, The New York Times reported last week that \"Cities, counties, public schools and community colleges around the country have limited or reduced the work hours of part-time employees to avoid having to provide them with health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, state and local officials say.\"\n\nThese stories offer a glimpse into how the Affordable Care Act is really affecting everyday Americans' employment opportunities; even if Harry Reid thinks these stories are \"untrue.\"\n\nThese data have demonstrated that the Obama Administration does not deserve the American people's trust when it comes to healthcare, and this dupery is found in their policies towards America's seniors as well.\n\nAs former CBO Director (there's that pesky CBO again!) Douglas Holtz-Eakin recently chronicled, \"Obamacare financed its assault on existing insurance arrangements in part by $156 billion over 10 years in direct cuts to Medicare Advantage plans.\"\n\nThis is bad news for America's seniors.\n\nPer Holtz-Eakin's group, the American Action Forum, millions of seniors will be subject to plan cancellations, fewer plan options, higher premiums, reduced doctor networks and higher overall out-of-pocket costs for Medicare benefits as a result of these cuts.\n\nSeniors will be exposed to even more risk from the disruption caused by President Obama to Medicare Part D. Milliman recently calculated that \"Up to 50% of Part D plan choices may be eliminated or materially changed during 2015 and 2016 based on provisions in the Proposed Rule using assumptions derived from survey responses.\"\n\nIt's not fair to American seniors that their healthcare is raided by the Left in order to help pay for the failed program that is Obamacare. The disastrous policy ideas from liberals have shown that they don't work in real life. Here we have a great opportunity for conservatives to show the American people smart policy that helps lowers costs, improves access and actually helps their everyday lives.\n\nFollow John Murray on Twitter: www.twitter.com/jmurraydc", "article_metadata": {"description": "As we enter March, the nightmare that is Obamacare continues to seek and destroy the pocketbooks of hardworking Americans.\n\nJust recently, Americans have...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-03-02 13:50:42 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "As we enter March, the nightmare that is Obamacare continues to seek and destroy the pocketbooks of hardworking Americans.\n\nJust recently, Americans have...", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-murray/disincentivizing-work-and_b_4881049.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1464944/images/o-US_UK_CA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "jmurraydc", "description": "As we enter March, the nightmare that is Obamacare continues to seek and destroy the pocketbooks of hardworking Americans.\n\nJust recently, Americans have...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-03-01 13:50:42 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4881049", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "politics,labor,unemployment,obamacare,conservatives,liberals,policy,health care,Barack Obama,seniors", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "politics,labor,unemployment,obamacare,conservatives,liberals,policy,health care,Barack Obama,seniors", "published_time": "2014-03-01 13:50:42 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-05-01 05:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdd1\"", "article_summary": "It's not fair to American seniors that their healthcare is raided by the Left in order to help pay for the failed program that is Obamacare.\nStrange how the Obama Administration's support for the non-partisan office simply vanished once it was determined that Obamacare \"creates a disincentive to work.\"\nAs we enter March, the nightmare that is Obamacare continues to seek and destroy the pocketbooks of hardworking Americans.\nThe disastrous policy ideas from liberals have shown that they don't work in real life.\nThe Obama Administration, quick to dismiss the CBO's report, said it is \"subject to misinterpretation.\""}
