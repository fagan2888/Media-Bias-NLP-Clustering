Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN) Jeb Bush wants to eliminate what he considers "bloated, destructive welfare programs" and allow states to create tailor-made programs through block grants, according to a preview of a new policy proposal he's rolling out Friday.

"There are three things that will lift people out of poverty: work, marriage, and a high school education, at least," Bush said Wednesday at a town hall in New Hampshire when talking about his proposal. "You do those three things and it gives you a giant leap forward in terms of the probabilities of being lifted out of poverty."

His proposal comes ahead of a major summit on poverty in South Carolina on Saturday, hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Along with Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. Kasich, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are set to speak at the event.

Through what he calls "Right to Rise" block grants â€” taking the same name as his super PAC, Bush's plan would replace programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 Project-Based Rental Assistance and Public Housing Programs.

His plan is heavily focused on encouraging marriage and preventing out-of-wedlock childbirth, pointing to a number of statistics that show children that grow up in married households fare better in income and education.
