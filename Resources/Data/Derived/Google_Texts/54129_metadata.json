It has enabled more than 100,000 people to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously over the Internet, the Justice Department claimed.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2014 this Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison,\u201d U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement announcing the arrest. \u201cThose looking to follow in the footsteps of alleged cybercriminals should understand that we will return as many times as necessary to shut down noxious online criminal bazaars. We don\u2019t get tired.\u201d\n\nLike the previous incarnation of the site, Silk Road 2.0 is only accessible to people using the anonymous Tor software, and it sells drugs, fake identification cards and other illicit goods. Merchants exclusively use the largely anonymous virtual currency Bitcoin, which has contributed to persistent concerns that the money is an invitation to money laundering.\n\nAs of September, the site was generating at least $8 million in sales per month, the Justice Department claimed.\n\nThe original Silk Road site was shuttered by federal agents last October. Weeks later, the replacement site was launched to fill the void.\n\nBenthall was charged with counts of conspiring to traffic drugs, fake IDs, commit money laundering and hack into computers. The maximum penalties could land him in prison for decades.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The online black market, like its predecessor, specialized in selling drugs.", "description": "The online black market, like its predecessor, specialized in selling drugs.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The online black market, like its predecessor, specialized in selling drugs.", "title": "Feds arrest alleged leader of Silk Road 2.0", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/223196-feds-charge-leader-of-online-drug-marketplace", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-06T12:17:55-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-11-06T12:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/223196-feds-charge-leader-of-online-drug-marketplace", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-06T11:53-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Silk Road, Bitcoin,Blake Benthall,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-06T11:53:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T12:17:55-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/223196-feds-charge-leader-of-online-drug-marketplace", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The online black market, like its predecessor, specialized in selling drugs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds arrest alleged leader of Silk Road 2.0"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds arrest alleged leader of Silk Road 2.0"}, "article_summary": "Blake Benthall, 26, who went by \u201cDefcon\u201d and ran the Silk Road 2.0 website, was arrested in San Francisco on Wednesday and will appear in court on Thursday, authorities say.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2014 this Silk Road, in whatever form, is the road to prison,\u201d U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement announcing the arrest.\nThe original Silk Road site was shuttered by federal agents last October.\nThe Justice Department has arrested the alleged leader of an online black market that specialized in selling drugs.\nADVERTISEMENTSilk Road 2.0 was launched about one year ago, shortly after federal agents shut down its predecessor."}
