Photograph by Vincent Ricardel.\n\nThree years ago, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Washington, tapped Monsignor John Enzler to take over Catholic Charities, the primary social-welfare arm of the archdiocese. The move took many by surprise. Catholic Charities helps not only Catholics but anyone in need, which last year meant treating more than 15,000 patients at its clinics and in physicians\u2019 offices (200-plus doctors donated some $6.7 million worth of medical services to the poor last year), serving 5.5 million meals to the needy, and making more than 1,800 beds available every night, from shelters for the homeless to permanent housing for adults with disabilities.\n\nEnzler is a beloved priest who has used his people skills to make his name as a successful pastor\u2014and fundraiser\u2014at two of Washington\u2019s most prestigious parishes: Our Lady of Mercy in Potomac and Blessed Sacrament in Chevy Chase DC. Administration of a multifaceted social-welfare agency wasn\u2019t on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9; he was more accustomed to baptisms and confessions than budgets and conference calls.\n\nBut Wuerl didn\u2019t want a bureaucrat. He was looking for a \u201cpastor to the poor,\u201d Enzler explains: \u201cCardinal Wuerl says that we have a moral obligation to take care of the poor. At the macro level, he looks for people who can do the work.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nEver since Pope Francis walked out on the balcony of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica for the first time last March, Catholics and non-Catholics have been intrigued by his simple lifestyle, his frankness, and his exhortations to care for those in need. But as his papacy has progressed, the question for Vaticanologists has become how the new pontiff will give organizational heft to his rhetoric.\n\nAn answer came in December, when Francis named Wuerl to the Congregation for Bishops, a committee that recommends candidates to fill bishoprics in more than 5,000 dioceses around the world. The position\u2014which he\u2019ll fill while continuing as archbishop of Washington\u2014gives Wuerl a crucial voice in determining the next generation of Church leaders.\n\nJust as the College of Cardinals had picked Francis, an Argentinean bishop known for his pastoral approach to diocesan management, the pope has entrusted the scouting of new bishops to Wuerl, the man who chose a pastor like Monsignor Enzler to run Catholic Charities. The key to advancement, insiders understood, would be to infuse even administrative functions with pastoral zeal.\n\nThat\u2019s not what the wider world took from Wuerl\u2019s appointment. The American whom Wuerl is replacing on the Congregation for Bishops is the ultraconservative former archbishop of St. Louis, Cardinal Raymond Burke. In that city, Burke built a reputation as the US church\u2019s most prominent culture warrior. He made front-page news during the 2004 presidential campaign by saying that Senator John Kerry\u2014the Democratic candidate and a Catholic\u2014should be refused Holy Communion at Mass because of his pro-choice stance on abortion.\n\nIn the mainstream press, the switch was reported as a significant shift and a rebuke of Burke by Pope Francis, who wrote in his first official teaching document, Evangelii Gaudium, that the sacrament of Communion \u201cis not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak.\u201d\n\nBut Burke and Wuerl have a history on the issue that gives Wuerl\u2019s selection a personal tinge. Like most bishops, he counters Burke\u2019s arguments about Communion that it\u2019s not a priest\u2019s job to arbitrate political positions through the Eucharist. Wuerl has said he discerns two approaches to reaching out to people: \u201cOne is the pastoral, teaching mode, and the other is the canonical [or legal] approach. . . . I believe if we teach our people, we will not have a problem with our politicians.\u201d\n\nBut most bishops don\u2019t have nearly as many Catholic politicians coming to their Communion rails, and Wuerl\u2019s stance has made him a target for Burke\u2019s criticism.\n\nIn March 2009, Burke gave a video interview to the pro-life activist Randall Terry. When Terry criticized Wuerl and Arlington\u2019s bishop, Paul Loverde, for not denying Communion to pro-choice politicians, Burke said nothing in their defense.\n\nWuerl responded in an interview with AOL\u2019s Politics Daily that withholding the Eucharist \u201cwasn\u2019t a way we convinced Catholic politicians to appropriate the faith and live it and apply it.\u201d He dismissed politicizing the scarament as \u201cthe new way now to make your point.\u201d\n\nMore than a year later, when Pope Benedict XVI made both Burke and Wuerl cardinals at the same consistory at the Vatican, Wuerl reportedly reached out to Burke, suggesting that, whatever problems they\u2019d had in the past, it was time they became friends. Burke, according to someone who observed the scene, rebuffed the overture.\n\nWuerl, who celebrates about 150 public Masses a year, spends much of his time on parish visits.

Popes don\u2019t normally use staff decisions to settle personal scores. Nor should Wuerl\u2019s promotion be interpreted as a triumph for Catholic progressives. He\u2019s no firebrand, and only the most arch of archconservatives would consider him a liberal. Instead, he has a track record as a moderate intent on managing staff, reconciling budgets, and seeking compromise in a pastoral manner.\n\nIn May 2012, Georgetown University invited Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to speak at graduation just as Catholic hospitals and other religious institutions were fighting a provision of the Affordable Care Act mandating health-insurance coverage for birth control for all employees. Wuerl issued a statement criticizing the decision to select \u201ca featured speaker whose actions as a public official present the most direct challenge to religious liberty in recent history.\u201d But the kerfuffle didn\u2019t prevent him from appearing last October at the kickoff of the school\u2019s new Initiative on Catholic Social Thought and Public Life beside Georgetown president John DeGioia.\n\n\u201cNow, with Pope Francis, [the initiative] looks like an easy step,\u201d says John Carr, director of the center. \u201cBut in the beginning, when prospects were uncertain, Cardinal Wuerl offered personal support for its mission and its location at Georgetown.\u201d\n\nSays Stephen Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies, a think tank at Catholic University: \u201cCardinal Wuerl is not afraid to criticize, but he\u2019s more likely to simply roll up his sleeves and work for whatever good can be achieved.\u201d\n\nIf Wuerl is a signal to the Church, then, it may be that Francis is hoping the cardinal\u2019s tenure will be one of steadiness and seasoned decision-making. \u201cIt would be hard to name someone in our country who has a broader experience of the life of the Church,\u201d says Bishop Blase Cupich of Spokane. \u201cHis opinion is held in high regard by his brother bishops because he has consistently shown that he has the capacity to prudently and objectively reflect on his experience.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nIt\u2019s a part Wuerl has played before. As a young priest, he studied in Rome and returned there to a post in the curia\u2014the Church\u2019s central administration\u2014after a stint as a parish priest in Pittsburgh, his hometown. But when Pope John Paul II wanted to rein in a provocatively liberal bishop of Seattle in 1985, he appointed Wuerl auxiliary, with the difficult job of acting as the bishop\u2019s Vatican minder.\n\nAs bishop of Pittsburgh, a seat he held from 1988 until coming to Washington in 2006, Wuerl was one of the first bishops to announce a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for clergy sex abuse, even successfully battling a Vatican decision that ordered him to reinstate a priest he had suspended after the cleric was arrested for molesting a minor.\n\nA moderate like Wuerl, and the bishops he chooses, may signal a change in how the Church relates to the nation. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, headquartered in Washington, has long been a prominent voice in politics. For most of its history, the group steered clear of partisanship, advocating for the poor, a move that aligned them with Democrats, but against abortion, which aligned them with Republicans. In the past ten years, however, the bishops have tilted to the right, insisting that issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage had priority over other subjects. Their partisan edge cost the bishops some of their cachet, especially among their natural allies in social-justice circles.\n\nWuerl\u2014though he may not have Enzler\u2019s experience with rank-and-file parishioners\u2014may restore some of the American Church\u2019s profile in terms of putting the disadvantaged first.\n\nIn Washington, from his relative remove as cardinal, Enzler says, Wuerl has already shown his concern: \u201cHe guarantees we have the resources we need, giving more than $1 million from the annual Cardinal\u2019s Appeal. There is no micromanagement, just great commitment, great trust. He really supports our work.\u201d\n\nEnzler adds that Wuerl is proving himself more adept at hands-on ministry. \u201cA year ago, we began a weekly program to serve dinner to homeless men and women who don\u2019t get a lot of food at the shelters,\u201d he says. The cardinal, who attends board meetings at Enzler\u2019s headquarters on G Street, Northwest, across from the Martin Luther King Jr. library, has mingled with the 250 or so people who come to eat each week.\n\n\u201cWatching Cardinal Wuerl, seeing him greet the people, not dressed up in any regalia but as a simple priest, listening to them, wanting to be a part of their situation, it\u2019s really impressive,\u201d Enzler says. \u201cHe\u2019s completely comfortable with the people who come for dinner.\u201d\n\nNow the cardinal wants to visit Food & Friends, the program that assists people with HIV and other illnesses. \u201cHe always asks me, \u2018What\u2019s next?\u2019 \u201d Enzler says. \u201cHe wants to be a part of our work.\u201d\n\nEven as Wuerl moves higher in the Vatican\u2019s sometimes remote hierarchy, he seems to have acquired, in Pope Francis\u2019s phrase, the \u201csmell of the sheep.\u201d\n\nMichael Sean Winters (mswkna@aol.com) is a visiting fellow at Catholic University\u2019s Institute for Policy Research & Catholic Studies and author of the National Catholic Reporter blog Distinctly Catholic.
