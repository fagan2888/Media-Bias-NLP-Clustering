Some retired military members worry that people forget the meaning behind memorial day each year with all the shopping sales and barbecues.



The annual memorial day tribute at Mathis Field started almost 20 years ago honoring Vietnam Veterans.



Now they honor veterans of all wars.



Today's ceremony included the dedication of ten pavers placed at the memorial to remember loved ones who died fighting.



(Ed Bendinelli/ Retired Air Force) "Back in the Vietnam era we hated the war so we hated the warrior. Today, we may hate the war but we love the warrior, and that has made all the difference in the world to our military."



The Concho Valley Vietnam Veterans Memorial is at the entrance to Mathis Field Airport and features a Huey Helicopter on display.
