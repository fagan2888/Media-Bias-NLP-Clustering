You see, the middle class has become \u201chollowed out\u201d \u2014 and I am just one of tens of millions affected. Back in the glory days of 1971, 61 percent of American adults lived in \u201cmiddle-income\u201d households. Today? Just 50 percent. Half of us, my friends, have been hollowed out. Yet more evidence, if any were needed, that the American economy is fundamentally broken, riven asunder by rising inequality.\n\nSo went the typical write-up of Pew\u2019s results, which the tone of the Pew report itself encouraged (\u201cThe American Middle Class Is Losing Ground\u201d). Dig beneath its hollowing-out claim, however, and it becomes clear that the trend documented by Pew is hardly cause for alarm. The key is in understanding how Pew defines \u201cmiddle income\u201d and how changes in the fortunes of poor, middle-class, and rich Americans have affected who is included in this group. (Disclosure: I worked elsewhere at Pew \u2014 in the Economic Mobility Project \u2014 from 2008 to 2011. I still count friends there and am generally a fan of it and the Pew Research Center.)\n\nPew takes the median income in a given year \u2014 the one for the household richer than half and poorer than half of American homes \u2014 and computes a lower-income and upper-income bound based on the median. Specifically, if a household has an income at least two-thirds but no more than twice the median, it is considered \u201cmiddle income.\u201d\n\nRELATED: What \u2018Lost Decade\u2019?\n\nThe Pew Research Center Invents a Middle-Class Decline Note, first, that this is a wholly arbitrary definition. That means that alternative definitions \u2014 even those tied to the median, such as having income no less than half the median and no more than 1.5 times the median \u2014 will generally yield different trends in the size of the \u201cmiddle income\u201d group.\n\nMost obviously, the claim that this group is \u201cno longer the majority\u201d depends on the particular thresholds Pew has chosen. (By the way, about that minority status: Middle-income adults constitute 49.9 percent of the population in the most recent Pew results, which, given the limitations of surveys, is no different from 50.1 percent.) Consistent with the Pew results, my calculations using the same data and the same definition of \u201cmiddle income\u201d indicate that adults in these households were 61 percent of all adults in 1969 and 52 percent in 2007 (two business-cycle peaks).\n\nBut when I changed the definition of \u201cmiddle income\u201d to include households with as little as half the median, 61 percent of all adults were in that category in 2007 \u2014 a solid majority, though down from 70 percent in 1969. (In what follows, I stick with Pew\u2019s definition.)\n\nRELATED: Why We\u2019re Never Moving Away from Income Inequality\n\nAnother important point is that Pew\u2019s definition of \u201cmiddle income\u201d isn\u2019t anchored to any fixed standard of living. In fact, it represents a rising standard of living over time. Imagine that the incomes of the poor, middle, and rich all increase by 50 percent over time. The Pew measure would indicate that the share of adults who are \u201cmiddle income\u201d would be no higher than it was initially. It is not obvious why we should care that the middle class, in this example, is no larger over time. In fact, between 1969 and 2007, the household income of the median adult rose by 52 percent.\n\nThe declining share of the \u201cmiddle income\u201d group occurred because incomes grew less below the median and more above the median. Nevertheless, the 25th percentile (the income of the person poorer than 75 percent of adults) rose by 40 percent from 1969 to 2007. (The 90th percentile increased by 85 percent.) As a result, the median adult in the larger \u201clower income\u201d group in 2007 was better off by 48 percent than the median lower-income adult in 1969, and the median of the hollowed-out \u201cmiddle income group\u201d was higher by 54 percent.\n\nThose are impressive improvements in living standards even though the \u201cupper income\u201d group saw its median income rise by 66 percent. (Pew reports smaller gains between 1970 and 2014 \u2014 which it sometimes calls 1971 and 2015 \u2014 because it uses an inferior cost-of-living adjustment.)\n\nWhile middle-income adults, by Pew\u2019s definition, have shrunk by 11 percentage points as a share of the population since 1970, 7 points of that decline is due to more Americans\u2019 being in the upper-income group. Surely the better way to characterize the results is to note that 71 percent of adults are middle-income or better, which is down from only 75 percent in 1970. The slightly enlarged lower-income group \u2014 4 percentage points larger after 44 years! \u2014 has seen its median income rise by 42 percent (not the 28 percent Pew reports).\n\nIn the absence of any evidence that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of \u201cmiddle income\u201d adults as defined by Pew is worth worrying about, there are two ways to better evaluate how \u201cthe middle class\u201d is doing. One is to hold the lower and upper bounds of \u201cmiddle income\u201d adults at their cost-of-living-adjusted initial levels. When I do that, the share of adults who are \u201cmiddle income\u201d or better rises from 75 percent in 1969 to 84 percent in 2007, the share who are \u201clower income\u201d falling by over 9 percentage points.\n\nRELATED: The Left\u2019s Middle-Class Problem\n\nA second way to assess the health of the middle class is to report the increase in the average household income of adults in the middle fifth of the income distribution, where the lower and upper bounds of the middle fifth will differ every year but will always contain 20 percent of households. Using the Pew measure of household income, the middle fifth grew richer by 53 percent from 1969 to 2007.\n\nMy preferred measures showed a rise between 54 percent and 64 percent, depending on whether one adjusts for declining household size. This range actually understates the increase because noncash benefits cannot be counted as income before 1979. Too many analysts and observers are so hung up on inequality that it is self-evident to them that small increases in income polarization \u2014 as distinct from the large increase in income concentration at the top \u2014 constitute a devastation of the middle class. But it surely matters that the entire income distribution has moved up substantially alongside this modest increase in polarization.\n\nThe Financial Times produced an animated chart that displays the net effects of these changes. It is hard to watch it and conclude anything but that poor and middle-class Americans are both substantially better off than 45 years ago, when those with \u201cmiddle income\u201d were a larger group. A policy agenda designed with a crumbling middle class in mind is not only inappropriate, but it could actually hurt the living standards of the middle class in the process.\n\nThis article was originally published in National Review.
