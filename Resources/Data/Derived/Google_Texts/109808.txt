Apparently there is a place in the world where people have not yet been touched by the majesty that is “Star Wars.” Stephen Colbert explained on Friday’s “Late Show” that China isn’t all that familiar with the film “though they’re probably familiar with some of the toys,” showing a photo of a sweatshop.

Evidently, the original “Star Wars” came out at a time when China still suppressed all western media. Consequently, many have still never really seen it, so no one in China is freaking out this week the way we all are. So, Colbert took it upon himself to serve as the International “Star Wars” Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China and explain the film so they don’t seem lost.
