What the Pros Know\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t expect things to slow down either,\u201d Rent.com noted in a press release, as 63 percent of property managers predict that rental rents will continue to rise by an average of 6 percent in the next 12 months.\n\nHere are four reasons why rents will continue to climb:\n\nGentrification. In cities like San Jose, San Francisco or even in Brooklyn, New York, the tech bubble, as well as hipsters, have pushed rents higher, making it harder, even for middle-income residents to afford living there.\n\nAccording to research firm RealFacts, \u201cthe East Bay and North Bay are \u2018echo markets\u2019 where rents are rising and likely to go higher,\u201d reported the San Francisco Business Times on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s especially true as residents are forced out of increasingly wealthy enclaves such as San Francisco.\u201d\n\nNot enough supply. Even in Southern California, where the availability of housing has typically been plentiful, it has become more challenging to find affordable rental properties as new construction isn\u2019t keeping up with demand.\n\n\u201cRents continue to rise throughout the region as the demand for rental housing outpaces the completion of new units,\u201d according to a study from the University of Southern California\u2019s Lusk Center for Real Estate released at the beginning of October. \u201cThe average rent in all four regions [Los Angeles County, Orange County, Inland Empire and San Diego County] is projected to increase every quarter for the next two years.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 9 Most Expensive U.S. Rental Markets\n\nJob growth. This is also true in the Las Vegas area, where low supply of rentals coupled with substantial job growth has increased demand and prompted landlords to increase rents.\n\n\u201cHousing experts say as more people get jobs, rental rates go up,\u201d KLAS, Las Vegas local TV station reported last week. \u201cWhat used to go for $700 a month, for a two bed, two bath just a few years ago, we\u2019re seeing things go up between $850 and $950 a month now for the same thing,\u201d leasing agent Karen Sommer told the station.\n\nFewer Americans are buying. If millennials aren\u2019t living at their parents\u2019 home, they\u2019re likely renting and piling like sardines in apartments to make monthly payments. Additionally, even older Americans who did own prior to the recession are now renting for various reasons including lower credit, lower wages or simply unemployment.\n\n\u201cThe recession caused an influx of homeowners swapping their large homes for smaller apartments,\u201d said Rent.com, noting that 50 percent of property managers noticed an increase in former homeowners seeking apartment rentals since 2013. \u201cWith the millennial generation underemployed and facing high student loan defaults, it\u2019s not surprising most are unable to afford mortgage payments or may lack the credit to apply.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why First-Time Homebuyers Should Get Their Checkbooks Ready\n\nWhat does it mean for renters and the economy? Renters should be prepared to not only pay more for housing but also to benefit from fewer concessions.\n\n\u201cThe shift to lower vacancy rates has allowed property managers to transition from pushing concessions and compromising on rental rates, to increasing rents and forcing stricter application policies,\u201d Rent.com said in its report.\n\nEven if unemployment is falling and more people are finally being hired, it doesn\u2019t mean they have the extra income to pay inflated rents. Paying more for rents means that consumers will spend less in other parts of the economy or that they\u2019ll save less.\n\nHow can renters avoid the hike? While it\u2019s hard to avoid paying more, there are ways to mitigate the increase, such as searching for housing in the low season, the fall and winter, and doing in-depth research to fully understand a neighborhood and how much you should pay for certain amenities.\n\nRenters may be forced to renew their lease and ask for longer lease terms rather look elsewhere.\n\n\u201cRenewing a lease at the end of 12 months opens the door for landlords to increase rent,\u201d Rent.com noted. \u201cHowever, by signing a lease for 18 to 24 months, renters can lock in their rates.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Since the recession, the demand for rentals has continued to rise steadily, and real estate experts are predicting that rents will continue to rise for the foreseeable future.", "title": "There\u2019s Only One Way Rents Will Go: Sky High", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/28/There-s-Only-One-Way-Rents-Will-Go-Sky-High", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042012_Rentals_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/28/There-s-Only-One-Way-Rents-Will-Go-Sky-High", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01042012_Rentals_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Since the recession, the demand for rentals has continued to rise steadily, and real estate experts are predicting that rents will continue to rise for the foreseeable future.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda61b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHousing experts say as more people get jobs, rental rates go up,\u201d KLAS, Las Vegas local TV station reported last week.\nThis is also true in the Las Vegas area, where low supply of rentals coupled with substantial job growth has increased demand and prompted landlords to increase rents.\n\u201cRenewing a lease at the end of 12 months opens the door for landlords to increase rent,\u201d Rent.com noted.\nPaying more for rents means that consumers will spend less in other parts of the economy or that they\u2019ll save less.\n\u201cThe shift to lower vacancy rates has allowed property managers to transition from pushing concessions and compromising on rental rates, to increasing rents and forcing stricter application policies,\u201d Rent.com said in its report."}
