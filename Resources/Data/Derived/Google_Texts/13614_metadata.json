The city\u2019s public hospital system has been a burden on the budget for de-cades and a headache for the last four mayors, each of whom sought a way to make it sustainable. Now the expansion of health care under the Affordable Care Act has made NYC Health + Hospitals even less competitive. Yet, it is a crucial safety net for the uninsured in New York and a massive employer with more than 40,000 people on the payroll, making changes almost impossible, politically.\n\nWhat\u2019s a mayor to do? If you are Bill de Blasio, you increase your annual contribution by hundreds of millions of dollars, promise not to impose drastic layoffs or downsizing, and announce a somewhat vague plan to transform the system, which has 11 hospitals and about 70 clinics.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with the feeling of deja vu all over again. David Dinkins promised reforms to fix a \u201cmaze\u201d of problems. Nevertheless, Rudy Giuliani confronted red ink and poor care. He failed at privatizing the system, so he appointed a CEO who pledged to remake it to \u201ckeep it competitive.\u201d But the Bloomberg administration was forced to provide more money to stabilize the finances. It obviously did not succeed.\n\nNow the long-term trends in health care and the Affordable Care Act are making matters worse. The rise of outpatient centers and the emphasis on shorter hospital stays has reduced demand for beds throughout the city. The nonprofit hospitals, almost all of whom have better reputations than Health + Hospitals facilities, have targeted the Medicaid patients they once shunned to fill those beds.\n\nGiven new choices, those patients are increasingly choosing nonprofits rather than public hospitals. Even though Medicaid covers more people because of the Affordable Care Act, H+H has seen Medicaid managed-care patient stays decline while its rivals have seen increases.\n\nMeanwhile, H+H\u2019s insurance subsidiary is losing market shares among insurers targeting Medicaid recipients, while it has been able to attract only about 75,000 other customers. Approximately $1 billion in safety-net support payments will disappear over the next several years\u2014a 36% drop\u2014because the number of uninsured has declined.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s response follows the traditional playbook: Put in more money and promise a plan to make H+H better. His predecessors failed with that approach, and there is no reason to believe he will fare any better.\n\nGet Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.
