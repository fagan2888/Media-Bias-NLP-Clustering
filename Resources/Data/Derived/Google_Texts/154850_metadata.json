David Vitter launched an investigation Wednesday into how Congress was \u201cexempted\u201d from Obamacare, saying he could not fathom why thousands of employees on Capitol Hill were allowed to enroll in a D.C. exchange set aside for small businesses.\n\nThe Louisiana Republicans has made it one of his top priorities to highlight how Washington\u2019s lawmakers are treated under the Affordable Care Act, which requires members and certain staff to enter the health exchanges if they get insurance through their jobs.\n\nMr. Vitter objected when the Obama administration said Capitol Hill denizens could continue to collect an employer subsidy that pays for up to 75 percent of their premiums, noting regular Americans must rely on more limited, income-based tax credits.\n\nHis latest line of attack focuses on how both chambers of Congress were able to designate themselves as eligible for the D.C. exchange for small employers, or \u201cSHOP.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllowing Congress \u2014 which employs nearly 16,000 individuals \u2014 to determine itself as a \u2018small business\u2019 doesn\u2019t pass the common sense test,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cWe need to know exactly how and why this was allowed to happen, so we can fix this injustice and eliminate Washington\u2019s Obamacare Exemption.\u201d\n\nThe senator has requested documents that reveal how financial clerks at Congress and the D.C. exchange justified the arrangement.\n\nHis efforts parallel a legal challenge from Judicial Watch, which sued the D.C. exchange for allowing Congress to use its exchange.\n\nIn legal filings, the exchange has said city rules were trumped by federal regulations from the Office of Personnel Management.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
