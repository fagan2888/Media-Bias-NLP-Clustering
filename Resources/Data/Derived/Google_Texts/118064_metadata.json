But it\u2019s not without its trade-offs. Lower rates and higher volumes at hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices often translate into inferior service for patients \u2014 longer waits, rushed appointments, less help from the staff. And if you find yourself outside the network, it\u2019s apt to be very expensive, whether you intended to go out of network or not.\n\nThere have been numerous stories in the news recently about people who carefully take the time and effort to arrange for an in-network surgeon to perform an operation at an in-network hospital \u2014 only to find a bill in their mailbox a few weeks later for thousands of dollars from the out-of-network anesthesiologist, or pathologist, or assistant surgeon who were brought in on the operation without their knowledge and approval.\n\nOr the people who, even in the ambulance, have the presence of mind to request to be taken to an in-network hospital, only to find out later that the entire emergency room operations has been contracted out to an out-of-network provider who bills at three, five, even 10 times the in-network reimbursement rate.\n\nThere\u2019s no data on how often this happens, but as networks have tightened, industry experts say, it\u2019s happening more and more. A recent study ordered up by the Texas legislature found that half of the hospitals that participated in the networks of that state\u2019s three biggest health plans had no in-network emergency room doctors. And nationally, an estimated 65 percent of hospitals contract out some or all of their emergency room functions. Many of the largest ER contractors do not participate in any insurance networks.\n\nHospitals say they often have no choice but to rely on non-staff doctors because there are not enough willing to work on a hospital salary \u2014 or to put it another way, some hospitals refuse to pay the market rate. Hospitals also argue that scheduling of surgery is often so fluid and last-minute that there is not enough time to inform patients in advance that they will be treated by out-of-network specialists.\n\nSeveral states, including Maryland, California, Colorado and most recently New York, have passed laws restricting \u201cbalance billing\u201d by non-network providers for genuinely emergency services. In most cases, those laws leave it up to the hospitals and the patients\u2019 insurers to negotiate the payment. A similar restriction is contained Obamacare, although initially it only applies to newly established health plans.\n\nAs for those non-emergency surprises, a few states now require that hospitals notify patients in advance if non-network docs are going to be used, along with the estimated charges. But industry officials acknowledge they haven\u2019t yet found a workable solution.\n\nThere are times, of course, when people knowingly and willingly decide to go out of network to use a particular doctor or hospital, as I did last year when I needed an operation to repair my torn Achilles tendon. I had paid an extra premium each month to Anthem Blue Cross, Virginia\u2019s largest insurer, so I could have the choice of going out of network, with Anthem promising to pay 75 percent of the \u201callowable charge\u201d for that particular operation. My na\u00efve assumption, based on past practices, was that the \u201callowable charge\u201d bore some resemblance to what doctors were typically paid for such operations in the Washington area, either by Anthem or by other private insurers.\n\nAs you can see from the accompanying chart, that was not the case. My out-of-network surgeon billed just over $10,000 for the operation, which involved cutting and reattaching the tendon and sawing off a portion of my heel bone. Given the game that is medical billing these days, I knew that the bill was inflated and that Anthem\u2019s allowable charge would be significantly lower than that. But even I was surprised at how low. And so began a months-long journey to discover exactly how Anthem had arrived at a figure that was:\n\n\u25cfOnly 20 percent of what the typical surgeon billed for the operation in suburban Maryland, as determined by FAIR Health, an independent research group;\n\n\u25cf less than half of the average of in-network rates paid by private insurers at one leading hospital chain in the region; and\n\n\u25cf17 percent below what is paid by Medicare, which even Medicare acknowledges doesn\u2019t cover actual costs.\n\nIn searching for my answer, I sat for hours on hold at the 800-number to talk with a customer service specialist and her supervisor, whose patronizing message was that it was all my fault for going out of network in the first place. I filed numerous written appeals with two layers of hearing officers who explained that Anthem calculated its allowable charges based on Medicare\u2019s estimate of how much time, cost and expertise were involved in my operation, known in the industry as \u201cresource based relative value scales.\u201d\n\nThe office of the state insurance commissioner pointed me to page 59 of Anthem\u2019s annual \u201ccertificate of coverage\u201d filing which stated that allowable charges are based on one of five data sets, specifying which one or what formula would be applied to such data. It was only after speaking with a top official at Virginia\u2019s Department of Human Resource Management, which manages the health benefits for state employees (I am a professor at George Mason University) that the real answer was revealed:\n\nThe formula used by Anthem to calculate allowable charges is a proprietary trade secret. Or to put it another way, allowable charges are anything Anthem says they are.\n\nAs it turns out, Anthem is not alone in its effort to reduce payments to customers who exercise their option of going out of network. According to a study by Milliman, the benefits consultants, lots of other insurers have made the switch to calculating out-of-network reimbursements using Medicare rates as the benchmark rather than actual market rates. With doctors\u2019 bills averaging more than double the Medicare rates, the shift in benchmarks has resulted in a \u201csignificant\u201d reduction in out-of-network payments, Millman concluded. But even Rob Parke, one of the authors of the study, said he\u2019d never run across a plan such as Anthem\u2019s that sets allowable charges below Medicare rates. Typically, he said, they are 20 to 80 percent above.\n\nIn the competition to hold down health insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs are on the rise. In general, that\u2019s a good thing because it will finally force us consumers to be more cost conscious in our health care decisions. But it only works \u2014 and it will only be fair to consumers \u2014 if those prices are reasonable and transparent, rather than part of a sneaky effort by insurers to shortchange their customers. By that standard, Anthem Blue Cross, Virginia\u2019s largest health insurer fails the test \u2014 as does a state\u2019s insurance commissioner who seems to be more interested in defending the industry than protecting consumers.\n\nPostscript: I settled up with the surgeon for an amount less than his full bill, but several times Anthem\u2019s made-up allowable cost. I\u2019ve also switched to a high-deductible health plan with Aetna, which still uses market rates as its benchmark and has a Web site that allows customers to look up allowable charges for any procedure in advance.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "steven pearlstein, anthem, out of network charges, doctors, fees, health care, aetna", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Insurer\u2019s rate for tendon surgery was set below the amount Medicare pays, and the calculation used is shrouded.", "title": "Tendon surgery sheds light on the lack of clarity in some out-of-network pricing", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tendon-surgery-sheds-light-on-the-lack-of-clarity-in-some-out-of-network-pricing/2014/10/10/a2646334-50ad-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@StevePearlstein"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tendon-surgery-sheds-light-on-the-lack-of-clarity-in-some-out-of-network-pricing/2014/10/10/a2646334-50ad-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "steven pearlstein, anthem, out of network charges, doctors, fees, health care, aetna", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "a2646334-50ad-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Insurer\u2019s rate for tendon surgery was set below the amount Medicare pays, and the calculation used is shrouded."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2003\"", "article_summary": "Or to put it another way, allowable charges are anything Anthem says they are.\nBut even Rob Parke, one of the authors of the study, said he\u2019d never run across a plan such as Anthem\u2019s that sets allowable charges below Medicare rates.\nMy out-of-network surgeon billed just over $10,000 for the operation, which involved cutting and reattaching the tendon and sawing off a portion of my heel bone.\nIn most cases, those laws leave it up to the hospitals and the patients\u2019 insurers to negotiate the payment.\nIt\u2019s one reason \u2014 perhaps a big reason \u2014 why medical costs have begun to level off in recent years."}
