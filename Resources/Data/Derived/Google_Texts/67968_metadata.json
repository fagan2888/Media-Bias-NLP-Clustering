California is also number one for isolating Latino students.\n\n\u201cThe growth of segregation has been most dramatic for Latino students, particularly in the West, where there was substantial integration in the l960s, and segregation has soared,\u201d states the report. In suburban areas, Latino students are more segregated than their Black counterparts.\n\nThe study points to some areas of progress: \u201cContrary to many claims, the South has not gone back to the level of segregation before Brown. It has lost all of the additional progress made after l967 but is still the least segregated region for Black students.\u201d\n\nYet Gary Orfield, co-author of the study and co-director of the Civil Rights Project,\n\ndeclared in a statement released Thursday, \u201cIt is time to stop celebrating a version of history that ignores our last quarter century of retreat and begin to make new history by finding ways to apply the vision of Brown in a transformed, multiracial society in another century,\u201d\n\n_____________________\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.\n\nThis article was published by Common Dreams.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In past 60 years, some progress has been made, but education inequities remain endemic, finds UCLA report.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "In past 60 years, some progress has been made, but education inequities remain endemic, finds UCLA report.", "title": "'Brown At 60': Segregation Plaguing US Schools: Report", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/brown-60-segregation-plaguing-us-schools-report/190934/", "image": "http://www.commondreams.org/sites/commondreams.org/files/imce-images/protest_11.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-05-16T09:18:11-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In past 60 years, some progress has been made, but education inequities remain endemic, finds UCLA report.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/No-Child-Left-Behind_4x3-e1400249747507.jpg", "title": "'Brown At 60': Segregation Plaguing US Schools: Report", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "segregation", "published_time": "2014-05-17T05:00:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-16T09:18:11-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff2d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe growth of segregation has been most dramatic for Latino students, particularly in the West, where there was substantial integration in the l960s, and segregation has soared,\u201d states the report.\nSegregation is the worst in the \u201ccentral cities of the largest metropolitan areas,\u201d according to a report summary.\nIn suburban areas, Latino students are more segregated than their Black counterparts.\nThe study points to some areas of progress: \u201cContrary to many claims, the South has not gone back to the level of segregation before Brown.\nCalifornia is also number one for isolating Latino students."}
