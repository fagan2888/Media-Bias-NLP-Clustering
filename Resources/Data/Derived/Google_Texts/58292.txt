Starbucks is recalling a breakfast sandwich that could be contaminated with listeria.

The sausage, egg and cheddar cheese on English muffin sandwiches were sold in Oklahoma last Thursday and Friday.

Listeria can be deadly in children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. It can also cause miscarriages and stillbirths.
