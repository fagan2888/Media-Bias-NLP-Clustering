The Affordable Care Act explicitly states that only exchanges run by states can give out subsidies, but the dogged defenders of this hideous law claim that was just a \u201ctypo.\u201d Gruber has, in past appearances, strongly implied that the federal exchanges weren\u2019t supposed to give out subsidies, but he dismissed those statements as \u201cspeak-os.\u201d (In case you\u2019ve forgotten how idiotic ObamaCare is, and how dishonest its creators are, that\u2019s the exact word Gruber used.)\n\nLiberals blew a zillion pixels on screeds that insisted we were all just misunderstanding Gruber, or he just tripped over his tongue. Why would the designers of the Affordable Care Act sabotage their own magnificent supra-Constitutional law by planting legal bombs in its subsidy mechanisms, all but ensuring the demise of the program when the American people discovered how much it actually costs?\n\nWell, here comes the latest hugely embarrassing Jon Gruber video, a January 2012 appearance in which he confirms without ambiguity that federal exchange customers aren\u2019t supposed to receive subsidies, and explains exactly why: \u201cIf you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t accept an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits. But your citizens still pay the taxes to support this bill. So you\u2019re essentially saying to your citizens, you\u2019re going to pay all the taxes to support all the states in this country.\u201d\n\nNone of that is surprising \u2013 it\u2019s exactly how critics of ObamaCare say the subsidy trap was intended to work. There are contemporaneous comments from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s designers, including Gruber, to support that interpretation. Evidently some of the ObamaCare con artists realized the subsidy trap could backfire on them, grokking the possibility that most states might choose not to create exchanges, which is how things eventually shook out. The subsidy trap was supposed to make the \u201cchoice\u201d of states to create exchanges an illusion, just as your \u201cchoice\u201d not to participate in ObamaCare by keeping the health care plan you liked was a lie, but that would only work if most of the states did create exchanges, and the few holdouts collapsed under pressure from their constituents.\n\nInstead, ObamaCare is unpopular with the American public, only a few states set up exchanges, and some of those exchanges didn\u2019t work out very well. The loss of subsidies for federal customers is more likely to finish off ObamaCare than pressure reluctant state governments to fall in line. This video is the clearest, most indisputable evidence yet uncovered of how the subsidy trap was intended to work, and it should be utterly fatal to the Democrats\u2019 hopes of keeping the Affordable Care Act alive in the Supreme Court. The idea that laws can be rewritten on the fly, without due process, to meet the current needs of desperate politicians is despicable; rewriting them in clear defiance of what the drafters \u201creally meant\u201d reduces American government to satire.\n\nBut these are satirical times, so who knows? The Supreme Court hearing on ObamaCare should consist of a few minutes spent watching this video, followed by a unanimous verdict of \u201cYou gotta be kidding me, geddouddahere!\u201d from all of the justices (ideally set to music, and led by Justice Antonin Scalia.) Instead, it will probably remain a lengthy nail-biter.\n\nMeanwhile, this and the rest of America\u2019s Funniest Totalitarian Home Videos will doubtless come up when Jonathan Gruber drops by the House Oversight Committee next week. Would someone be so kind as to pull the media\u2019s heads out of Elizabeth Lauten\u2019s dumpster and ask if they plan to break the hardest \u201cnews\u201d embargo in history to report on these developments?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "The most unambiguous \"speak-o\" yet should make short work of ObamaCare at the Supreme Court.", "title": "New Gruber video confirms federal ObamaCare exchanges aren't supposed to give subsidies | Human Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jonathan_gruber_subsidies.png", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2014/12/03/new-gruber-video-confirms-federal-obamacare-exchanges-arent-supposed-to-give-subsidies/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "The most unambiguous \"speak-o\" yet should make short work of ObamaCare at the Supreme Court.", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jonathan_gruber_subsidies.png", "creator": "@@Doc_0", "description": "The most unambiguous \"speak-o\" yet should make short work of ObamaCare at the Supreme Court.", "card": "summary", "site": "@humanevents"}}, "article_summary": "Instead, ObamaCare is unpopular with the American public, only a few states set up exchanges, and some of those exchanges didn\u2019t work out very well.\nThe loss of subsidies for federal customers is more likely to finish off ObamaCare than pressure reluctant state governments to fall in line.\nLiberals blew a zillion pixels on screeds that insisted we were all just misunderstanding Gruber, or he just tripped over his tongue.\nWell, here comes the latest hugely embarrassing Jon Gruber video, a January 2012 appearance in which he confirms without ambiguity that federal exchange customers aren\u2019t supposed to receive subsidies, and explains exactly why: \u201cIf you\u2019re a state and you don\u2019t accept an exchange, that means your citizens don\u2019t get their tax credits.\nThere are contemporaneous comments from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s designers, including Gruber, to support that interpretation."}
