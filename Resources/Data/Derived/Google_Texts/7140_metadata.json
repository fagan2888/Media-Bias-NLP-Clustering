And according to The Advisory Board, the idea of waiting until ICD-11 as American Medical Association President Steve Stack suggested last week makes very little sense.\n\n\u201cTo say go straight to ICD-11 is mostly saying we shouldn\u2019t do anything for a long time,\u201d said Ed Hock, director of revenue cycle solutions for the consulting firm. \u201cA push to go to ICD-11 is really a push to not change at all for at least another five to seven years, and most likely longer than that.\u201d\n\nIf moving from the 14,000 codes under ICD-9 to 68,000 codes under ICD-10 is tough, it will be harder to move from ICD-9 to ICD-11, Hock said.\n\n[Also: AMA chief says US should wait for ICD-11]\n\n\u201cThese code sets will have continued to advance,\u201d said Hock, who added that it\u2019s too early to tell how many codes will be in ICD-11.\n\nPlenty of providers are ready to convert to ICD-10 on Oct. 1, Hock said.\n\nTwo recent House bills, which scored backing from the American Medical Association and The Heritage Foundation, have recently recommended delaying, transitioning or scuttling implementation. But both are seen as unlikely to go anywhere.\n\nThe American Medical Association has said the staggering number of new codes in ICD-10 will burden physicians who want to concentrate on quality care, and lead to reimbursement denials. While ICD-10 is used around the developed world, there are various adopted versions in different countries, and the U.S. is among the few to use the International Classification of Diseases to reimburse providers and physicians.\n\n[Also: ICD-10 bill surfaces, calls for delay, more study of rollout disruptions]\n\n\u201cAny time you go through a massive change, implementing a new IT system, you\u2019re going to have claim issues,\u201d Hock said. \u201cFirst and foremost, be prepared to minimize denials. I\u2019m wary of someone against moving to ICD-10 just because we\u2019re going to have denial.\u201d\n\nThe Heritage Foundation released a report this week recommending the codes not be used for payer reimbursement, but Hock said that too is a bad idea.\n\n\u201cA move away from using ICD codes for reimbursement would be a massive change for U.S. healthcare. If we think there\u2019s a lot of heated debate now, the idea of totally changing the way we reimburse, I think that would be an even more interesting discussion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s taken 30 years to approach implementation of ICD-10 in the United States.\n\n[Also: New ICD-10 bill asks for transition period]\n\nThe World Health Organization began work on ICD-10 in 1983, and completed it in 1992. However, it took until 2015 for the U.S. to implement it, Hock said.\n\nThe WHO released an early \u2018beta version\u2019 draft of ICD-11 in 2012, with the first full draft scheduled for release in 2017. Add time for feedback, edits, politics and IT upgrades and an ICD-11 timeline might also drag on, Hock said.\n\nHock promotes ICD-10 for boosting the ability for providers and payers to know more about what\u2019s going on with a patient.\n\nStack argues that ICD-10 is problematic in this area. That it requires a level of specificity clinicians say they may not be able to provide. Others say some of the codes are just plain nonsense.\n\nThere are codes for getting struck by a macaw; sucked into jet engine, subsequent encounter; stabbed while crocheting; and the often ridiculed, burns due to water skis on fire.\n\nHock laughs too, but under the root of the fun, is the rationale, he said.\n\n\u201cA lot of the codes are getting at what caused the injury, or this particular diagnosis,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the current code set, there\u2019s nothing between the first encounter and second encounter. There\u2019s no differentiation between medical procedures that use an open approach to those that are minimally invasive, he said.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical for health systems to understand how to provide better care,\u201d he said.\n\nPayers too will have more information to determine what happened, and how much to pay, he said.\n\nWhile some in revenue cycle might argue this gives payers another reason to deny claims, in a health system moving from fee-to-service to value of care, knowledge is power.\n\n\u201cThink about the power,\u201d Hock said, \u201cknowing why patients ended up in the hospital in a country trying to manage burgeoning healthcare costs.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/waiting-icd-11-not-answer-its-time-icd-10-consultant-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/firefeat.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Advisory Board revenue cycle head Ed Hock says punting on ICD-10 until the new code set is ready robs healthcare providers of the benefits of the Oct. 1 changeover.", "title": "Waiting for ICD-11 not the answer, it's time for ICD-10 consultant says"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/firefeat.jpg"}, "title": "Waiting for ICD-11 not the answer, it's time for ICD-10 consultant says", "description": "The Advisory Board revenue cycle head Ed Hock says punting on ICD-10 until the new code set is ready robs healthcare providers of the benefits of the Oct. 1 changeover.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "Not everyone is calling for the death of ICD-10 (in fact, few are).
