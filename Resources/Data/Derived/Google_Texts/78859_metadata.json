Ted Cruz\u2019s scathing assessment of President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy, a blistering critique that is positioning him as the most blazingly hawkish Republican to potentially run for president in 2016. He also tellingly dubbed it \u201cthe Obama-Clinton foreign policy,\u201d a subtle hint that he\u2019d lob much of the same argument against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she seeks the White House.\n\n\n\n[READ: Ted Cruz: Hillary As 'Radical' As Obama]\n\nThe Texas Republican spoke at a pair of foreign policy events in Washington this week, appearing before the Concerned Veterans for America on Tuesday and at the Foreign Policy Initiative conference Wednesday.\n\nIn a 45-minute conversation with The Weekly Standard\u2019s Bill Kristol on Wednesday afternoon, Cruz called for a larger defense budget, accused the Democratic administration of using politics to drive Pentagon decisions and cited what he viewed as \u201crepeated mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems the whole world is on fire right now,\u201d he said.\n\nRegarding Iran, Cruz said the administration is repeating the mistakes of former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, when he decided to relax sanctions on North Korea. North Korea subsequently made progress on its nuclear program.\n\n\n\n[ALSO: Mitt Romney Holds Early Lead in Quinnipiac Poll]\n\n\u201cAnd yet the administration seems hellbent on pursuing a fool-hearted deal just for the sake of the deal,\u201d he said of its approach to Iran.\n\nHe also said he thought the Obama administration\u2019s response to the crisis in Ukraine has been feckless.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is a complicated man. He\u2019s a KGB thug,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz took a more open-minded approach to Obama\u2019s likely pick of Ashton Carter as the next secretary of defense. He said he did not know Carter, a former top Pentagon official, but noted he \u201chas a good reputation.\u201d Cruz voted against the confirmation of outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, but declined to pile on his resignation, instead making a broader point about the cohesiveness of American foreign policy.\n\n\u201cIt is not encouraging that in six years now, we\u2019re now on to our fourth secretary of defense, particularly at a time when the world has gotten more and more dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n[MORE: Republicans Look Favorably on Governors for 2016]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Ted Cruz: The Most Hawkish of Them All?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Texas Republican is assembling a scathing critique of the \u2018Obama-Clinton\u2019 foreign policy.", "title": "Ted Cruz: The Most Hawkish of Them All?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/12/03/ted-cruz-the-most-hawkish-of-them-all", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/71/1e/fa5640714b7798190cbb132836cf/141203-cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ted Cruz: The Most Hawkish of Them All?", "description": "The Texas Republican is assembling a scathing critique of the \u2018Obama-Clinton\u2019 foreign policy.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,Pulse,picks,2016 presidential election,Cruz, Ted,Paul, Rand,Clinton, Hillary,Clinton, Bill,Bush, Jeb,politics,The Run 2016 [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Texas Republican is assembling a scathing critique of the \u2018Obama-Clinton\u2019 foreign policy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde43b\"", "article_summary": "[READ: Ted Cruz: Hillary As 'Radical' As Obama]The Texas Republican spoke at a pair of foreign policy events in Washington this week, appearing before the Concerned Veterans for America on Tuesday and at the Foreign Policy Initiative conference Wednesday.\nCruz took a more open-minded approach to Obama\u2019s likely pick of Ashton Carter as the next secretary of defense.\nRegarding Iran, Cruz said the administration is repeating the mistakes of former President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, when he decided to relax sanctions on North Korea.\nHe also tellingly dubbed it \u201cthe Obama-Clinton foreign policy,\u201d a subtle hint that he\u2019d lob much of the same argument against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she seeks the White House.\nHe\u2019s a KGB thug,\u201d Cruz said."}
