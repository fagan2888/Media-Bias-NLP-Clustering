Rob Williams saw three vehicles in the rushing waters of Rock Creek when his North Metro Fire & Rescue crew arrived after a section of Dillon Road collapsed in torrential rain Thursday morning.\n\nOne car was completely overturned, and the roaring creek was buffeting the vehicles. One man was able to climb through the window of his pickup truck without aid and get to safety, leaving two people trapped.\n\nThe emergency workers could hear cries for help coming from the partially submerged car, and decided to make that rescue first.\n\n\u201cWe hoped someone was alive in the second vehicle, but realized that he had been under water for quite a while,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThey lowered a two-man rescue raft into the creek, and Williams, and North Metro firefighter Brian Gaines climbed in.\n\nThey reached the car, broke out a window, helped him climb out, and gave him a life jacket, said Williams, 35.\n\n\u201cWhen he came out and saw the other vehicle he said \u2018My friend is in there, I\u2019m not sure who else is in there,'\u201d Williams said.\n\nThe rescuers took the man to safety and made a plan to get whoever was in the third vehicle out, then lowered the boat back into the water.\n\nWilliams, who has whitewater experience, and another firefighter, John Cook, made their way to the upside-down car and Williams climbed on top.\n\nHe could hear tapping coming from within, and the faint sound of a voice. \u201cI think he was standing on the roof and breathing in an air pocket,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firefighters hooked cables that stretched from a tow truck onto the car and the vehicle was winched onto its side.\n\nWilliams broke the window and handed the frightened occupant a life jacket. He could see that the man, who had been in the water for at least an hour, was tired and large enough that he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape through the window, Williams said.\n\n\u201cBy then the window was open,\u201d so he reached in and unlocked the door.\n\nRushing water was rocking the vehicle and the cable holding it shifting, so rescuers on the shore winched it into a standing position.\n\nWilliams and Cook pulled the man out.\n\nThe car had shifted closer to shore, and when the firefighters got the man out, other rescuers were able to reach him and carry him up the embankment, Williams said.\n\n\u201cIt was a great feeling, it was a great team effort.\u201d\n\nFirefighters from Lafayette and Westminster fire departments were also involved.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado flood: Desperate Rock Creek rescue is successful", "title": "Colorado flood: Desperate Rock Creek rescue is successful", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/12/colorado-flood-desperate-rock-creek-rescue-is-successful/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912_093826_broomfield-flooding-640-1.jpg", "height": 426}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130912_093826_broomfield-flooding-640-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-12T10:53:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:01:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27ae\"", "article_summary": "They lowered a two-man rescue raft into the creek, and Williams, and North Metro firefighter Brian Gaines climbed in.\nThe emergency workers could hear cries for help coming from the partially submerged car, and decided to make that rescue first.\nOne man was able to climb through the window of his pickup truck without aid and get to safety, leaving two people trapped.\nRob Williams saw three vehicles in the rushing waters of Rock Creek when his North Metro Fire & Rescue crew arrived after a section of Dillon Road collapsed in torrential rain Thursday morning.\nWilliams, who has whitewater experience, and another firefighter, John Cook, made their way to the upside-down car and Williams climbed on top."}
