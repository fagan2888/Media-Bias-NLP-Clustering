Technology takes what\u2019s scarce and makes it abundant.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cInvesting in Innovation\u201d conference \u2014 which began Thursday at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business and concludes Friday \u2014 brings industry experts from around the world who help investors find the best strategies to deliver positive returns while managing investment risk. The event is hosted by Darden\u2019s Richard A. Mayo Center for Asset Management. At the conclusion of day one of the conference, Darden Dean Robert F. Bruner formally announced the naming of the center for Darden alumnus Richard A. Mayo (MBA \u201968). Mayo received the honor for his lifetime contributions to the School.\n\nDiamandis, an innovator in the fields of space travel, incentive education and health care, provided leaders some tips on what the future holds for business:\n\n\u2022 We are going to enter the era of perfect knowledge, in which you can get information where and when you want and if and how you want it.\n\n\u2022 The only constant is change and the rate of change is increasing.\n\n\u2022 Competition is now the guy in the garage \u2014 the entrepreneur.\n\n\u2022 Disrupt your own business or someone else will.\n\nExamples of disruption? Skype gutted long distance. Craigslist helped drag down newspapers. Google sidelined libraries. Uber is slaying taxi businesses. \"Technology today is turning every two to three years,\u201d said Kathy Warden, corporate vice president and president of Northrop Grumman's Information Systems. \u201cIt took 10 years just a short time ago.\"\n\nChange is also hitting the energy business hard \u2014 but in a good way for America. New techniques for extracting oil from shale and the discovery of massive natural gas reserves will soon change America\u2019s dependency on foreign energy fuels.\n\n\u201cThe innovation done by early pioneers in shale exploration \u2014 people thought they were crazy,\u201d said Darden alumnus W. Barnes Hauptfuhrer (MBA/J.D. \u201981), chief executive officer of Chapter IV Investors LLC. \u201cThings have changed dramatically in the past five years. I call it the shale gas revolution. The shale oil revolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting time to be in the business,\u201d said Darden alumnus Robert S. Craine (MBA \u201979), president and founder of Lynx Production Company Inc. and Lynx LNG LLC, who has been an independent oil and gas producer for 30 years. \u201cHorizontal drilling and other advances we\u2019ve seen have come from independent oil companies. It used to be from big oil.\u201d\n\nLook for America to disrupt the world\u2019s economy. \u201cWe\u2019re not ready to export oil yet because of political issues, but America\u2019s production will change the world\u2019s supply and demand in a fundamental way,\u201d said Hauptfuhrer.\n\nCraine said the fallout from the new wealth of oil in America would change the geopolitics of the world, better the trade balance and fatten the country\u2019s budget. \u201cWe\u2019re getting the job done,\u201d he said.\n\nInnovations in health care are also on the way \u2014 with big changes expected quickly. But don\u2019t expect the Affordable Care Act to go away. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act caused a big fight, but we think it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d said Samuel D. Isaly, managing partner of OrbiMed Advisors. \u201cExcept at the beginning, I think it\u2019s been implemented fairly well.\u201d\n\nBut health costs have to be cut in a country with an aging population and one that spends 18 percent of its GDP on health care. It\u2019s unsustainable, the experts said.\n\nTechnological advances will transform health care, said Bryan Johnson, founder of the OS Fund and Braintree. But important ideas need to be funded and innovators need to be given capital to bring their dreams to life. Risk tolerance needs to be raised. Biological innovations can happen fast, Johnson said. \u201cThe return in biology will be phenomenal.\u201d\n\nDigital health care will include technology that will capture vital data from patients, analyze that data and spit out the results, he said.\n\nDarden alumnus Robert J. Hugin (MBA \u201985), chair and CEO of Celgene Corp., said the good thing about America is that \u201cpatients matter.\u201d If companies deliver drugs that help patients, \u201cyou will get reimbursed.\u201d\n\nHugin noted that 5 percent of patients run up 50 percent of health care costs. \u201cWe have to find a way to reduce that.\u201d\n\nThe day concluded with the announcement that Columbia Business School won the Darden @ Virginia Investing Challenge (DVIC), a stock pitch competition, which included 15 top business schools. Those business schools included:\n\n\u2022 Carnegie Mellon University (Tepper)\n\n\u2022 Columbia Business School\n\n\u2022 Cornell University (Johnson)\n\n\u2022 Duke University (Fuqua)\n\n\u2022 Georgetown University (McDonough)\n\n\u2022 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Sloan)\n\n\u2022 New York University (Stern)\n\n\u2022 Northwestern University (Kellogg)\n\n\u2022 University of California, Los Angeles (Anderson)\n\n\u2022 University of Chicago (Booth)\n\n\u2022 University of North Carolina (Kenan-Flagler)\n\n\u2022 University of Pennsylvania (Wharton)\n\n\u2022 University of Virginia (Darden)\n\n\u2022 Vanderbilt University (Owen)\n\n\u2022 Yale School of Management\n\nDarden Capital Management sponsored DVIC.
