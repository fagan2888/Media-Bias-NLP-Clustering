"Human additions to greenhouse gasses are increasing the average temperature of the globe," Reason's Science Correspondent Ron Bailey told Kmele Foster (who was reporting for Reason TV) at yesterday's Flood Wall Street Protest. There's a "scientific consensus" on that point. "The question is," says Bailey, "how long do we have before things become catastrophic, and there's not a consensus about that."

Bailey says that ironically many of the most promising solutions to climate change—nuclear power, improved solar panels, a carbon tax—rely on the very market mechanisms that the protesters oppose.

Check out Ron's reporting from yesterday's "washout" event (there were "about 1,000 protesters," most of them "nostalgic Occupy Wall Street veterans"), his dispatch from Sunday's massive People's Climate March, and his terrific review of Naomi Klein's This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate.
