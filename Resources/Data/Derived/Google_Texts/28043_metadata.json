Together they agreed Pile earning a master\u2019s degree would be fruitful and therefore worth the commitment.\n\nSoon after, the couple learned they were expecting twins. When Penn State accepted Pile into the program, the couple agreed to proceed with their plans.\n\nThen, on Jan. 12, 2015, Pile was promoted from regional director of operations to director of market development for HCR ManorCare, a role that covers 60 properties. It also happened to be the first day of Pile\u2019s second semester with Penn State. That evening, Kimberly\u2019s water broke -- two months premature.\n\nThe newborn twins, Logan and Olivia, spent 43 days in a neonatal intensive care unit before the Pile\u2019s were able to take their babies home.\n\n\u201cMy wife has been as supportive as one can be throughout the process,\u201d Pile said. \u201cWe came to conclusion that this program was the best for our family and we could manage it and work together. We have been a very good team. She is a great resource for me. She is my friend and rock and provides a lot of help. There is no way we would be able to get through it without working together.\u201d\n\nWith the support of his wife, Pile is able to work toward his master\u2019s degree and work full-time, all to enhance his skills in the area of short-term, post-hospital services and long-term care.\n\nThis career path began when Pile was an undergraduate student at York College of Pennsylvania where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in long-term care administration.\n\nHis father, Mark Pile, who worked in a community hospital in Somerset, Pennsylvania, was Pile\u2019s first mentor. That relationship led Pile to enroll in a couple of long-term care courses and then everything began to fall into place.\n\n\u201cAs a young person, being passionate about what you are doing and being in an industry where you feel you are helping people was important to me,\u201d Pile said. \u201cI also knew the industry was expanding and the degree helped me join a company with growth opportunities. Then it evolved into this next step, which is also opening doors.\u201d\n\nThe 13-course, 49-credit, 28-month program includes a weeklong intensive residency on the University Park campus in July that includes working on capstone projects with the faculty and networking with leaders in the health care industry.\n\nPenn State\u2019s unique approach to an online program, which includes time on University Park campus, is ultimately what convinced Pile to apply.\n\n\u201cThe hybrid component was important. The networking opportunities and the in-person connection with the cohort were very important. This is about how I can do my job better, evolve in health care industry, and adapt to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Pile said. \u201cAdditionally, Penn State\u2019s health policy administration undergraduate program and the online MHA program are very well respected in my industry.\u201d\n\nPile is one of 21 adult learners who make up the online MHA cohort.\n\n\u201cWe have military and CEO-level individuals, and we all have life events, and I\u2019m sure we will all have more as we go through the program. But I think that is why we are all in the program \u2013 because we are all committed to excellence despite challenges,\u201d Pile said.\n\nLearn more about the online MHA program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It does not get much more chaotic than Luke Pile\u2019s wife going into labor with twins on the same day he earned a promotion at work.
