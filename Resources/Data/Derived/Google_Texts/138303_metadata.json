According to IBISWorld Industry Analyst Stephen Hoopes, \u201cAn estimated 16.0% of domestic consumers lack medical insurance; while estimates of the share of consumers lacking dental insurance range from 26.0% to 42.0%, there exists a drastic difference between the two types of healthcare coverage.\u201d Dental insurance largely focuses on covering regular maintenance and preventative oral health treatments, while medical insurance emphasizes the coverage of unpredictable and urgent health ailments. Consequently, dental care costs and industry revenue are typically more stable than medical costs.\n\nOver the past five years, a consistent increase in healthcare expenditure (i.e. medical-cost inflation) boosted industry premiums and drove revenue growth. However, lower policy enrollment figures during the recession mitigated the Dental Insurance industry's performance over the period. As such, industry revenue is expected to increase at an annualized rate of only 1.2% over the five years to 2013, to reach $56.3 billion.\n\nRising unemployment during the recession directly damaged industry revenue through declines in group coverage and indirectly through lower per capita disposable income. Moreover, mounting competition from direct reimbursement and discount dental plans have tempered profit margins in recent years. \u201cYet, revenue growth is anticipated to pick up a slight 2.0% in 2013, primarily due to increases in workforce figures and disposable income levels,\u201d says Hoopes.\n\nOver the five years to 2018, industry revenue is forecast to increase. While the industry will benefit from an improving economic environment and favorable demographic trends, the enactment of healthcare reform provisions is expected to be the primary driver of growth. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act mandates increased dental care coverage, and the legislation primarily explains the rise in industry revenue expected in 2014 alone. Yet, many industry associations, particularly the American Dental Association, have argued that the legislation missed an opportunity to address further issues. More specifically, while 8.7 million children are anticipated to gain dental benefits under the PPACA, reducing the number of children without dental benefits by 55.0%, only 5.3 million adults are expected to gain coverage under the law.\n\nThe Dental Insurance industry operates with a medium level of market share concentration. The top companies in the industry are MetLife Inc., Delta Dental and Aetna. Industry concentration has increased over the five-year period, as downstream clients viewed dental insurance as an extra cost and cut dental coverage during the recession to save money. Consequently, industry firms have merged or acquired other companies to enter new geographic markets, cut costs and improve profitability. Moreover, following the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, consolidation trends in the dental insurance market have mirrored these trends in the broader Health and Medical Insurance industry (IBISWorld report 52411b).\n\nFor more information, visit IBISWorld\u2019s Dental Insurance in the US industry report page.\n\nFollow IBISWorld on Twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/IBISWorld.\n\nFriend IBISWorld on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/IBISWorld/121347533189.\n\nIBISWorld industry Report Key Topics\n\nThe Dental Insurance industry underwrites (i.e. assuming the risk and assigning premiums) dental insurance policies.
