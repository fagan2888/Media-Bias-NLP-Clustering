There are clear problems with Covered California, our state’s version of the Affordable Care Act.

Last week and this week, we published a two-part package titled, “Uncovered California,” reported by Tricia Caspers, our health reporter. Her examination showed several flaws, including: there are not enough primary care physicians to serve Covered California enrollees.

Covered California leaders were not entirely prepared for the flood of patients who are now seeking care.

Specialized – and sometimes lifesaving – services can be distant or unavailable.

Many patients, sometimes frustrated by the lack of basic services and access to physicians, are streaming into emergency rooms.

Our examination also showed that in many cases, the system is working fine. So “Uncovered California,” was not a wholesale indictment, but a focused critique.

We also found some providers who are responding with innovations. For instance, Dignity Health now employs “patient navigators” in several of its emergency rooms to assess what kind of care patients truly need. They can coordinate care and help schedule follow-up appointments.

So what are the answers? No doubt they are complex. They will involve political and economic negotiations.

Here are questions that can serve as starting points:

Can Covered California explore higher reimbursement rates to entice more physicians into the system?

Can physician assistants be engaged to provide more care and take a load off physicians who do serve Covered California patients?

Can our medical schools produce more primary care physicians?

Covered California is providing care to millions of residents. That’s a good thing.

But as our examination of the system showed, this patient can and should be even healthier.
