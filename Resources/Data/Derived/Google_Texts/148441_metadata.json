In order to avoid that, ETF is switching to higher deductible plans and is doubling out-of-pocket costs. The Cadillac tax kicks in when individual health plans exceed $10,200 for individuals and $27,500 for families, and is applied to every dollar above those thresholds. Current plans for state employees would be considered \"Cadillac\" plans.\n\nAt its May 19th meeting, the Group Insurance Board (GIB) in ETF agreed to make changes to the Coinsurance Uniform Benefits Plan, the Standard Plan, and the High Deductible Health Plan and Health Savings Account.\n\nThe vast majority of state employees are enrolled in the Coinsurance Plan. Under that plan, they currently do not pay anything for their annual deductibles. That will change to $250 for singles and $500 for families in 2016. The Out-of-pocket limits would go from $500 to $1000 for singles and from $1000 to $2000 for families. Routine preventive health services will not require a copay or deductible. These changes would affect both active and retired beneficiaries.\n\n\"With the 40% Excise Tax looming in 2018, savings achieved in 2016 and 2017 will minimize the changes that may be necessary in 2018,\" a report in the GIB's May 19th agenda reads.\n\nForbes magazine reports the goal is to create more equality among health plans across the country.\n\nThe International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans ran a survey and found that 62 percent of companies facing the Cadillac Tax are already making changes to avoid it.\n\nThese changes will save the state $80 million dollars over the next two years. That's already been factored into the state budget bill, which is currently making its way through the legislative process.\n\nIn addition to raising costs to avoid federal backlash, the budget bill also includes a provision to hopefully encourage employees to opt out of coverage all together. It would provide individuals with a one-time $2,000 opt out incentive payment.\n\nThe changes the GIB voted on were based on recommendations made by Segal Consulting.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "MacIver Institute", "description": "MacIver News Service - The federal law will hit employers who offer high-priced health plans with a 40 percent \"Cadillac tax\" starting in 2018.
