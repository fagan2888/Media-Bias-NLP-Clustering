During the CNN Republican presidential debate Thursday night, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump defended outsourcing the production of his companies' products.

He told the audience at the University of Miami that he will continue to "take advantage" of the cheaper production costs abroad as a sensible businessman would, but that he’s “the only one” who knows how to ameliorate the issue of American jobs going overseas.

“I’m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We’re allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it’s very, very hard for our companies in this country to compete,” said Trump.

“So I will take advantage of it, but I’m the one who knows how to change it. Nobody on this stage knows how to change it. I do. Believe me.”
