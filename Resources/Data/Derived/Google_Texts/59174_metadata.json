Stacie Mason, Sarasota\u2019s director of human resources, said she is standing by the changes.\n\nIt was on orders from the City Commission, she said, that her office hired consultants who designed the new plans to bring down an $81 million unfunded liability in the city\u2019s retiree benefits obligations. Meanwhile, she said, some retirees have not done enough to help the city save money on health care.\n\nHer office is trying to get some retirees off of the city\u2019s health care plans and into other coverage, possibly through Medicare or the Affordable Care Act. If everything works as hoped, she said, the unfunded liability could be down to $15 million after four years.\n\nThe city\u2019s obligation to pay for retirees\u2019 health and dental insurance has become a rare artifact from the past.\n\nCity employees hired after 1993 pay 100 percent of their medical after retirement, as is common in the private sector.\n\nIf police and fire retirees have become accustomed to having more say in these matters, they will find things are different now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a discussion about premiums with retirees,\u201d Mason said. \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate.\u201d\n\nChanges in the city\u2019s post-employment benefits were foreshadowed this summer, when the City Commission passed a new budget and covered a multi-million-dollar shortfall by decreasing payments into a benefit fund.\n\nCity commissioners voted unanimously for the health plan changes, and remained largely silent in the face of complaints from police and fire retirees.\n\nCommissioner Paul Caragiulo was the only commissioner who said he regretted his vote. He is scheduled to bring the issue back up for discussion at today\u2019s meeting.\n\nSingle retirees hired before 1993 will still have most or all of their health care covered by the city, and some will even pay less in the future. About three-quarters of the affected retirees are in that group. The big increases are in family plans, where the city is dramatically scaling back the amount it contributes to cover spouses and children of retirees.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t honor what they did for the city,\u201d Mason said. But the city\u2019s debt is fundamentally to the employee, she said, and not the rest of the family.\n\nThat is one example of a growing disconnect between some retirees\u2019 expectations and the thinking at City Hall.\n\nThe feeling among some retirees that they ought to have been consulted about the changes first is another. For much of their careers, the police and fire employees were represented by unions that negotiated these matters. Now they are not.\n\nAl Woodle, a retired SPD police captain who has sat on a city focus group on employee benefits, said he and other retirees understand that. They also understand the city\u2019s need to balance its books. And he conceded that there are simple measures that retirees could take to reduce health care costs.\n\nA health center that the city founded three years ago, for example, offers free medical appointments and mail-order prescription drugs to active employees and retirees. It could save the city hundreds of thousands in prescription drugs, but only about a third of retirees in the area use it.\n\n\u201cThere has been a little bit of difficulty getting some retirees to go,\u201d Woodle said. \u201cWe have been trying to do a better job of that.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he said, the retirees still want a seat at the table when decisions are made. In particular, he objected to Mason\u2019s idea of changing the benefits focus group\u2019s mission from developing long-term solutions to wellness education. Taken together with everything else, Woodle said, it feels like something is being taken away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real major shift from our perspective,\u201d Woodle said. \u201cWe were always told, you don\u2019t make a lot in money, but you\u2019re going to be taken care of in the long run. Now, they\u2019re starting to renege on it.\u201d\n\nWoodle said he is doing OK. He retired on an $80,000 pension and has a house in the country. But not everyone did as well. Some retirees are living on much smaller pensions, closer to $19,000, and will have a harder time paying any increases in medical costs.\n\nFor retirees who make less, and might be priced out of the city health plans, the city offers stipends to help pay for insurance through the Affordable Care Act or Medicare.\n\nRetirees can leave their plan to shop around and come back if they need to. Other benefits, like the city\u2019s \u201cwellness dollars,\u201d given as rewards for getting checkups and blood pressure exams, will be harder to earn in some cases.\n\nJan Thornburg, a spokeswoman for the city, said the new way of doing things might be more difficult, but city leaders were committed to reducing costs.\n\n\u201cThis has been really easy and it\u2019s been really comfortable for people\u201d for a long time, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make some changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Retired police and firefighters plan to keep fighting changes that the city has made to their health care plans, even though Sarasota officials insist they aren\u2019t budging.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-51323454-BFFE-4C20-83A5-6AA4347E953B-pubSH"}, "og": {"site_name": "HeraldTribune.com", "description": "Retired police and firefighters plan to keep fighting changes that the city has made to their health care plans, even though Sarasota officials insist they aren\u2019t budging.", "title": "Police and firefighters object to change in medical coverage", "url": "http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20141115/article/141119770", "image": "http://G52-SHweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=SH&Date=20141115&Category=ARTICLE&ArtNo=141119770&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20141115, "fb": {"app_id": 131646103569058}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-141119770-pubSH"}}, "keywords": "ENGLEWOOD (CHARLOTTE COUNTY, FL),  ENGLEWOOD (SARASOTA COUNTY, FL),  EEK (AK),  SKWENTNA (AK),  Social Issue"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab1a\"", "article_summary": "Her office is trying to get some retirees off of the city\u2019s health care plans and into other coverage, possibly through Medicare or the Affordable Care Act.\nThe city\u2019s obligation to pay for retirees\u2019 health and dental insurance has become a rare artifact from the past.\nSARASOTA - Retired police and firefighters plan to keep fighting changes that the city has made to their health care plans, even though Sarasota officials insist they aren\u2019t budging.\nMeanwhile, she said, some retirees have not done enough to help the city save money on health care.\nAnd he conceded that there are simple measures that retirees could take to reduce health care costs."}
