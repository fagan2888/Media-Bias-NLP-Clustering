Bobby Jindal had some harsh words for President Barack Obama Saturday as he gave the country\u2019s leader a little history lesson.\n\n\u201cI listened to the president last week as he appropriately conveyed Americans\u2019 revulsion at this savage act and our grief at the Foley family\u2019s loss. As usual, the president\u2019s words were very eloquent. To his credit, the president was unequivocal regarding the evil of this terrorist group, and he took the time to list some of their crimes against humanity,\u201d Jindal wrote in a Fox News op-ed.\n\n\u201cBut there is a major problem with the president\u2019s remarks. While he does a nice job of explaining our horror, his remarks on what America will do about it are insufficient, na\u00efve, and just plain weak.\u201d\n\nJindal then proceeded to tear apart the speech Obama gave after the video of ISIS beheading journalist James Foley surfaced line by line.\n\nObama: \u201cWe do what\u2019s necessary to see that justice is done and we act against ISIL, standing alongside others.\u201d Jindal\u2019s take: \u201cHere\u2019s an idea \u2014 How about we offer these people death instead of justice? I understand that the President of the United States should not be prone to wild rhetoric. But this is ridiculous. \u201cJustice\u201d generally conjures up images of a courtroom with a government provided defense attorney. Here\u2019s another way the president could phrase it, \u2018we will hunt them down and kill them.'\u201d Obama: The people of Iraq \u201cmust continue coming together to expel these terrorists from their community.\u201d Jindal\u2019s take: \u201cUm, no. They do not need to be expelled. They need to be eliminated.\u201d Obama: \u201cPeople like this ultimately fail. They fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy.\u201d Jindal\u2019s take: \u201cThis is the crux of the matter \u2013 we have a president who is disturbingly na\u00efve and holds a dangerous utopian view of the world and the dangers therein. Earlier this year, President Obama downplayed the danger of the ISIS, comparing these terrorists to a \u2018junior varsity\u2019 team that does not pose the same threat as Al-Qaeda. For him now to assert, \u2018people like this ultimately fail because the future is won by those who build and not destroy,\u2019 is flat out absurd. The truth is, these people will only fail if we cause them to fail. It is not inevitable. Causing them to fail requires that they be defeated, destroyed, and yes, killed.\u201d\n\nWhile most other Obama critics have stuck with the easier criticism of the optics of Obama\u2019s golf game following the speech, Jindal gets down to the core of the issue with the president\u2019s plan or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cIn World War II we did not win the future by building, we won it by destroying,\u201d Jindal wrote. \u201cUncomfortable or not, that is the truth. The murderous fools who cut the heads off of Americans must be destroyed, and sent to their reward, such as it is, in the next life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "AP Photo/Molly Riley Louisiana Gov.
