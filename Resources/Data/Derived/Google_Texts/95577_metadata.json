Rather, it's part of a \"transition\" to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThose customers, though, will receive notice by mail that their existing policy is no longer available and they should reach out to the Jacksonville-based company for guidance.\n\nThe canceled policies are those that don\u2019t offer coverage broad enough to be considered as \"qualified health plans\" under the Affordable Care Act. Qualified plans must include coverage for things like maternity and newborn care, mental health, substance abuse services and emergency services, among other things.\n\n\u201cEssentially, we have to put them into plans that are filed an approved as qualified health plans,\u201d said Jon Urbanek, one of the company\u2019s senior vice presidents.\n\nThe Times-Union reported the cancelations Tuesday, but company officials were unavailable to answer follow-up questions.\n\nHealth insurance companies across the country have been going through similar cancellations as they remove plans that are not qualified plans.\n\nUrbanek said he does not know how many people have enrolled with Florida Blue through online market places created under the new health care, commonly referred to as ObamaCare. Since going live Oct. 1, the federal-run marketplace has been dogged by long online wait times and people unable to sign up for coverage.\n\n\u201cWe look to the feds to provide us those, and I have not seen updated number,\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of know what applications we are taking in, I can\u2019t differentiate those.\u201d\n\nHe also said that the Department of Health and Human Services has not asked Florida Blue to withhold the number of people enrolling through online marketplaces. On Tuesday, a North Dakota newspaper reported Blue Cross and Blue Shield in that state had been told not to release enrollment numbers.\n\nThe company retracted that claim Wednesday, saying an employee \u201cmisunderstood internal discussion,\u201d according to the Forum of Fargo-Moorehead.\n\n\u201cI am not aware of that at all,\u201d Urbanek said.\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday, Florida Blue said it will offer affected customers \u201crecommendations for new plan options, and encourage them to contact us so we can help determine their best course of action.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is more of a transition,\u201d Urbanek said. \u201cWe are not terminating anyone\u2019s coverage.\u201d\n\nHe said that Florida Blue does not know exactly how much the Affordable Care Act will cost the company. During spring\u2019s legislative session, company lobbyists told lawmakers that it would cost an estimated $110 million.\n\nUrbanek did say he expected Florida Blue\u2019s enrollment numbers to grow under Obamacare, but could not supply specific estimates.\n\nMatt Dixon: (352) 233-0777", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tallahassee | A top Florida Blue official said Wednesday that the cancellation of 300,000 individual health insurance policies does not mean affected customers will lose coverage.
