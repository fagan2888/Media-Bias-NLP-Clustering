Many homes in that area are historic homes, built around the same time with similar architecture.\n\nThe Historic Preservation Alliance of Wichita & Sedgwick County says the home will be used as a venue that people can rent out for events like weddings.\n\nThe home will be placed on its new foundation on Monday or Tuesday. The process includes placing the home on steel beams, lubricating the beams with soap and sliding it into place.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A home built in 1902 was relocated to a permanent location; the process of moving the home shut down streets and electrical lines.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "A home built in 1902 was relocated to a permanent location; the process of moving the home shut down streets and electrical lines.", "title": "Historic home moved to Midtown", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Historic-home-moved-in-Midtown-352963921.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/633/BFC/633BFCF97B4C438384F89919EE643BA4", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/D3B/227/D3B22745B03A4C389A79B4D7FDEA7B29.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "A home built in 1902 was relocated to a permanent location; the process of moving the home shut down streets and electrical lines.", "title": "Historic home moved to Midtown", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Historic-home-moved-in-Midtown-352963921.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Historic+House+Midtown+Moved.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Historic home moved to Midtown", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Historic home moved to Midtown"}, "article_summary": "Quik-Trip made it possible for the home to be moved, but also required it moved so their gas station at Broadway and Murdock could expand.\nThe Victorian Style home was located at Topeka and Murdock; the home was moved in early September of 2015 to that location temporarily.\nMany homes in that area are historic homes, built around the same time with similar architecture.\nThe Historic Preservation Alliance of Wichita & Sedgwick County says the home will be used as a venue that people can rent out for events like weddings.\nThe process includes placing the home on steel beams, lubricating the beams with soap and sliding it into place."}
