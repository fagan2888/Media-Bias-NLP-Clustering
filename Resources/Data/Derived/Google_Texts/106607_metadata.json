He declined to give specific numbers.\n\nTo say this plan \u2013 pushed by the Gov. Gary Herbert-led GOP leaders in the House and Senate \u2013 fell flat is an understatement.\n\nHughes, in a night press conference, and Niederhauser, in his UtahPolicy interview, said it is back to the drawing board.\n\nThere won\u2019t be a special session for Medicaid expansion this fall, said Niederhauser. Hughes agreed, adding however, \u201cthere is the political will\u201d in the House GOP caucus to \u201chelp the needy.\u201d\n\nAnd sometime, someway, providing health insurance/care for the 31,000 low-income Utahns without coverage today will be accomplished.\n\nBut neither Hughes nor Niederhauser could say how that would be done exactly.\n\nAnd the issue will fall to January\u2019s 2016 general session \u2013 a default fallback proposal UtahPolicy reported during this past summer.\n\nHughes says House Republicans have been so beaten up over Medicaid expansion over the last six months, he doesn\u2019t think the added heat of an election year for the governor, all the 75-member House and half of the 29-member Senate will make much difference in the 2016 Legislature.\n\nNiederhauser admitted that some folks are talking about a small sales tax increase to come up with the state\u2019s share of the estimated $50 million a year expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would cost the state.\n\nUnder the gang\u2019s Utah Access Plus \u2013 which turned out to be a political disaster on Capitol Hill \u2013 16 different categories of health care professionals/industries would have picked up the state\u2019s $50 million share.\n\nAnd the health care industry would have taken on \u2013 through a complicated annually-adjusted formula \u2013 any Medicaid expansion cost increases.\n\nIt is that financial risk \u2013 which the House Republicans don\u2019t want taxpayer on the hook for \u2013 Hughes believes sunk Utah Access Plus with the health care community.\n\nWho in turn smashed House and Senate Republicans with massive lobbying.\n\nLast December, noted Hughes, the same health care industry leaders who killed this month Utah Access Plus went on the record in favor of Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah.\n\nHU put the financial risk of Medicaid expansion on Utah taxpayers. And the health care industry folks were just fine for that, noted Hughes.\n\nBut ask them to pay 7 cents on the dollar of new health care reimbursements under Obamacare -- and take on the state\u2019s financial risk \u2013 and all of a sudden they turned, killing Utah Access Plus.\n\nSo, even if there are hard feelings or not among House leaders and the House GOP caucus, Medicaid expansion is not dead.\n\nIt\u2019s just not feeling very well.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Frances Gibson, R-Mapleton, who works in the health care industry, said he voted no on UAP during Tuesday night\u2019s closed caucus.\n\nSo even House leadership couldn\u2019t agree on UAP.\n\nGibson said there is a way forward, although it may not be acceptable to the same folks who helped kill UAP.\n\nUtah would develop its own plan to take care of the 31,000 low-income folks who don\u2019t have health insurance now and fall between 0 percent and 100 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThose between 100 percent and 138 percent could qualify for some other health insurance subsidies and could also be helped by the state.\n\nThat plan would have enrollment caps and other safeguards so the state\u2019s General Fund \u2013 basically the state sales tax receipts \u2013 would not be at risk from Obamacare-like Medicaid expansion growth.\n\nThat, however, sounds very much like Utah Cares \u2013 the 2015 House GOP caucus\u2019s plan much criticized in the media and opposed by Herbert and Republicans in the state Senate. Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah and Utah Cares both died at the end of the 2015 Legislature, leaving the state with no Medicaid expansion.\n\nHughes said his caucus did not discuss a general tax hike for Medicaid expansion.\n\nSuch a tax hike \u201cis not an October idea,\u201d said Hughes, and would have to wait for the 2016 Legislature.\n\nNiederhauser said he\u2019s heard of increasing the state sales tax by a mere one-eighth of 1 percent, which would bring in around $50 million a year, or the amount of the state\u2019s share of Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nBut Niederhauser said he can\u2019t tell if that would have support in the Senate.\n\nHughes said the Utah Hospital Association last December was talking about kicking in $25 million a year toward the state\u2019s share of expansion, since hospitals would see the most from the $450 million Medicaid expansion would bring into the state each year.\n\nUtah hospitals are eating hundreds of millions of dollars a year (or passing it along to patients/insurance companies who can pay) in uncompensated care \u2013 much of it from their emergency rooms which under federal law must treat all injured or ill person regardless of whether they can pay or not.\n\n\u201cWe are having two different discussions,\u201d summarized Hughes.\n\nIf Utah finds a way to provide care to the needy without Obamacare\u2019s $450 million a year, then there are those (Herbert among them) who complain the state is turning away federal money.\n\nOr if people talk about money, then lawmakers are criticized for not caring about the truly needy.\n\nGOP House members are in a box.\n\nThere needs to be a way out of that box.\n\nAnd maybe over the next few months \u2013 Hughes says House Republicans are committed to find a way \u2013 another kind of compromise can be found.\n\nHughes said he was looking at the UAP defeat as a glass half-full \u2013 for the work of helping the needy will go forward.\n\nBut for now it has to look like House Republicans are gazing as through a glass darkly.\n\nAnd Medicaid expansion in Utah remains a real political albatross.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As expected, no Medicaid expansion for Utah \u2013 at least not now.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Bob Bernick", "og": {"url": "http://utahpolicy.com/index.php/features/today-at-utah-policy/7295-legislative-republicans-again-can-t-find-a-solution-for-medicaid-expansion", "site_name": "utahpolicy.com", "type": "article", "title": "Legislative Republicans Again Can't Find a Solution for Medicaid Expansion"}, "google-site-verification": "lihgswQmNHE4uzDhVlR0Saxekx4JgwwjFYC6fjhIvCM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And the health care industry would have taken on \u2013 through a complicated annually-adjusted formula \u2013 any Medicaid expansion cost increases.\nThere won\u2019t be a special session for Medicaid expansion this fall, said Niederhauser.\nUtah House Republicans came out of a four-hour closed-door meeting Tuesday night to say they don\u2019t have the votes for the latest idea: Utah Access Plus.\nSo, even if there are hard feelings or not among House leaders and the House GOP caucus, Medicaid expansion is not dead.\nBut for now it has to look like House Republicans are gazing as through a glass darkly."}
