As part of an interview with GOP presidential candidate John Kasich that aired on Tuesday’s CBS Evening News, anchor Scott Pelley fretted that Kasich might “tear out ObamaCare, root and branch, start all over again” and signal to the American people that they will be “going to war” to defeat ISIS.

The interview began with an extensive back-and-forth over whether or not Kasich’s still a viable candidate due to him having only won one state and lagging well behind Ted Cruz and Donald Trump in total delegates, before turning to policy.
