Although Americans have until Feb. 15 to enroll without paying a tax penalty, any applications completed in most states after 3 a.m. \u2013 or midnight Pacific time Dec. 15 \u2013 will not kick in Jan. 1, 2015, but will instead activated during the following month.\n\n\u201cFor the uninsured \u2013 many of whom have gone for years without coverage \u2013 that means this is the last opportunity to sign up in time to start the new year with the peace of mind that comes with health insurance,\u201d says Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, a non-profit grassroots organization that helps inform and enroll Americans in health plans.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, every American must purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Most Americans have coverage through employers, while seniors are covered by Medicare and low-income residents are covered by Medicaid. Those who fall into the gap \u2013 such as small-business owners or self-employed Americans \u2013 can buy private, government-subsidized health insurance through online marketplaces or exchanges.\n\nHealthcare.gov isn't the site every American can use \u2013 there are separate websites for the District of Columbia and 13 states. Open enrollment, the three-month period during which people can sign up for insurance, began Nov. 15 and will last until Feb. 15. There are some variations in deadlines by state. New York, for instance, has extended its deadline to Dec. 20. Other states announced extensions late Monday.\n\nWith some exceptions, most people who enrolled in the marketplaces last year will be automatically re-enrolled in coverage by Monday, and those who do not make changes to their old plan likely will see increases in their premium costs. About 70 percent of those who take the time to shop again on the marketplaces could get a cheaper deal, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Affordable Care Act", "title": "A State-by-State Look at Exchanges As Obamacare Deadline Looms", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Some states have extended their deadlines, but report solid enrollment outcomes.&nbsp;", "title": "A State-by-State Look at Exchanges As Obamacare Deadline Looms", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/15/a-state-by-state-look-at-exchanges-as-obamacare-deadline-looms", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/53/dc/bc596b8145a2adc1e6b457a49e71/141215-healthcare-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Some states have extended their deadlines, but report solid enrollment outcomes.&nbsp;", "card": "summary", "title": "A State-by-State Look at Exchanges As Obamacare Deadline Looms"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 15, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Kimberly Leonard,health care,Pulse,Affordable Care Act", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Some states have extended their deadlines, but report solid enrollment outcomes.&nbsp;"}, "article_summary": "Those who fall into the gap \u2013 such as small-business owners or self-employed Americans \u2013 can buy private, government-subsidized health insurance through online marketplaces or exchanges.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, every American must purchase health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\nAs the Dec. 15 deadline for signing up for health insurance under Obamacare closes, states are reporting an increase in their enrollment numbers, and some have decided to give consumers more time to pick a health plan.\nMost Americans have coverage through employers, while seniors are covered by Medicare and low-income residents are covered by Medicaid.\nOpen enrollment, the three-month period during which people can sign up for insurance, began Nov. 15 and will last until Feb. 15."}
