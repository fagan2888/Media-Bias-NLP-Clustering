But even as John Sopko, the Special Inspector General for Reconstruction in Afghanistan (SIGAR), warns again that the costly undertaking in war-torn Afghanistan is doomed to failure if the U.S. doesn\u2019t address several major issues to get the project under control, for the first time ever he\u2019s created a list of seven \u201chigh-risk\u201d areas that are \u201cespecially vulnerable\u201d to rampant waste, fraud and abuse moving into 2015.\n\nRelated: $100 Billion in Aid Squandered in Afghanistan\n\nThe U.S. has already paid out $104 billion on Afghanistan reconstruction efforts \u2013 more than what we spent on rebuilding Europe after World War II, as previously reported here. Accountants from SIGAR said as long ago as four years earlier that they could only track less than 10 percent of that money.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nAfter all the drone attacks and other devastation of war, the U.S. rebuilding projects were intended to leave a lasting positive legacy of U.S. involvement in Afghanistan\u2014schools, hospitals, roads, dams and bridges. Instead, we\u2019re leaving half-finished, unusable structures that cost American taxpayers a fortune.\n\nNow, as Sopko said in the new report, \u201cThe evidence is clear that American taxpayer dollars ... are being placed at unnecessarily high levels of risk by widespread failure to ... implement prudent countermeasures.\u201d\n\nHere are the seven biggest risks to the $104 billion reconstruction efforts based on the new report:\n\nONE: Corruption\n\nThe U.S.\u2019s anti-corruption strategy is failing. Sopko blames the U.S.\u2019s original strategy in Afghanistan for fostering a political climate conducive to corruption and stressed that he has often brought this to Congress\u2019 attention.\n\nRelated: Afghanistan\u2019s Corrupt Money Pit Wastes Another $3.6 Million\n\n\u201cSIGAR has long been concerned about the threat that corruption poses to the reconstruction effort,\u201d Sopko said in the report. \u201cEvery one of SIGAR\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress has highlighted this threat \u2013 from the looting of the Kabul Bank and the failures of Afghanistan\u2019s attorney general to prosecute senior officials, to the illegal land seizures and endemic extortion of ordinary Afghans for everyday services.\u201d\n\nTWO: Sustainability\n\nThe majority of the hundreds of billions already poured into reconstruction has gone to building roads, dams, hospitals, and schools \u2013 but the Afghans are not able to sustain much of that infrastructure without the continued financial support of the U.S. and other countries. In other words \u2013 when the money stops flowing, the structures won\u2019t last long.\n\nTHREE: Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF)\n\nThe questionable ability of the Afghan National Security Forces to stand on their own as the country\u2019s main police defense force is another top threat to the region\u2019s sustainability.\n\nRelated: U.S.\u2019s $7B War on Drugs Helped Grow Afghanistan\u2019s Heroin Biz\n\nAn earlier SIGAR audit found that the Afghan government would likely be incapable of fully sustaining ANSF facilities after the transition in 2014 and the expected decrease in U.S. and Coalition support. A separate audit found that no one knew the overall literacy rate of the ANSF \u2013 despite a $200 million contract to improve literacy among the forces.\n\nFOUR: Lax Oversight of On-Budget Support\n\nAuditors have consistently been concerned about the risks posed to U.S. funds that are provided to Afghanistan in the form of on-budget assistance. SIGAR says the U.S. has committed more than $7.7 billion in this form of assistance since 2002 \u2013 and there\u2019s been little oversight over much of that money. For example, SIGAR said the $236 million Partnership Contracts for Health program found that USAID \u201ccontinues to provide millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in direct assistance with little assurance that the Afghan Ministry of Public Health is using these funds as intended.\u201d\n\nFIVE: Failed Counter-Narcotics Strategy\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s narcotics problem is one of the top threats that could completely undermine the entire reconstruction effort, as Sopko has noted many times. So far, the U.S. has spent about $7.8 billion fighting the country\u2019s drug problem. So far that effort appears to be failing.\n\nSIX: Contract Management and Oversight\n\nDespite the billions we\u2019ve spent on Afghanistan, the federal government doesn\u2019t keep a central database to keep track of contract spending. As Sopko says in the report, \u201cNo one knows the precise value of contracting in the Afghanistan reconstruction effort.\u201d Not having structured accountability over this massive operation makes tax dollars vulnerable to waste and abuse.\n\nSEVEN: Lack of a Plan or Strategy\n\nThe auditors have routinely flagged the government\u2019s lack of implementation and operational planning as a huge threat to the efforts in Afghanistan. \u201cA lack of planning and strategy in making sure U.S. activities in Afghanistan actually contribute to overall national goals there threatens to cause agencies and projects to work at counter-purposes, spend money on frivolous endeavors, or fail to coordinate efforts to maximize impact,\u201d the report said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It's no surprise by now that the U.S.;s reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan are pron", "title": "7 Threats to U.S. Rebuilding Efforts in Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/11/7-Threats-US-Rebuilding-Efforts-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-06-19T074146Z_1_LYNXMPEA5I0AT_RTROPTP_2_AFGHANISTAN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/11/7-Threats-US-Rebuilding-Efforts-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2014-06-19T074146Z_1_LYNXMPEA5I0AT_RTROPTP_2_AFGHANISTAN.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It's no surprise by now that the U.S.;s reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan are pron", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It's no surprise by now that the U.S.;s reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan are prone to waste, fraud and abuse.\nRelated: $100 Billion in Aid Squandered in AfghanistanThe U.S. has already paid out $104 billion on Afghanistan reconstruction efforts \u2013 more than what we spent on rebuilding Europe after World War II, as previously reported here.\nSEVEN: Lack of a Plan or StrategyThe auditors have routinely flagged the government\u2019s lack of implementation and operational planning as a huge threat to the efforts in Afghanistan.\nSopko blames the U.S.\u2019s original strategy in Afghanistan for fostering a political climate conducive to corruption and stressed that he has often brought this to Congress\u2019 attention.\nSIX: Contract Management and OversightDespite the billions we\u2019ve spent on Afghanistan, the federal government doesn\u2019t keep a central database to keep track of contract spending."}
