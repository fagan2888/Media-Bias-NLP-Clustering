He appeared on online parody talk show \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d two weeks ago, and stopped by the \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d last week. During both appearances, he claimed that insurance costs could be as low as monthly cell phone bills.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cYou can, at this point, get health insurance for $100 a month or less. In some cases less than your cell phone bill or cable bill,\u201d Obama told DeGeneres.\n\nBut the math isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nThe government announced in September that the average premium cost for Americans without subsidies would be $328 for a mid-tier silver plan, but the cost varies nationwide.\n\nUnder the ACA, subsidies are available for those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which comes to about $45,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four. Those who do not have insurance by the end of open enrollment period will face a fine of $95 a year, or 1% of their annual income for failing to comply.\n\nFor some, opting for the fine may be the more affordable option until heftier penalties start in 2016.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nDifferences in pricing for coverage from state to state is a big part of the problem.\n\nFor example, according to in New York\u2019s state exchange website, New York State of Health, a New Yorker making $25,000 a year\u2014which is 218% of the federal poverty level\u2014 would qualify for a hefty subsidy to lower the cost of their insurance. For a silver plan on the state exchange, the middle tier of coverage, the lowest premium payment for an individual available on the \u201cwindow shopping feature\u201d is $138 a month. On the high end, a silver plan would cost $421 a month, with a subsidy.\n\nClick here to enlarge.\n\nHere\u2019s how ObamaCare premiums in New York stack up against a few typical monthly expenses:\n\nCell Phone Bills\n\nNationwide, the average monthly cell bill is less than the New York City premiums based on the data input.\n\nAccording to a report, Verizon (VZ) offers 2GB plans for about $90 a month, while AT&T (T) offers a similar 2GB plan for $80 a month. Both Sprint and T-Mobile (PCS) offer unlimited cell phone plans for $80 a month.\n\nCable Bills\n\nWhile there are many different cable plans and providers available, the NPD Group reports that on average, nationwide bills are about $90 a month, without internet bundled. The nationwide average is nearly $50 less than the lowest tier of silver coverage for a New Yorker making $25,000 a year.\n\nElectric Bills\n\nElectric bills can vary greatly nationwide, but according to the most recent data from the National Association of Home Builders in 2012, New Mexico residents faced the highest monthly electric bills at $122, which is still less expensive than coverage for a New Yorker making $25,000 a year.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 01:31:29 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "President Obama claimed insurance premiums can be as low as the average monthly cell phone bill in some cases.
