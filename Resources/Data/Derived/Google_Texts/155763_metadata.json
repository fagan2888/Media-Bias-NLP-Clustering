It was time to learn about the world I was living in and stand up for my beliefs.\"\n\nBenston will speak at Longmont's Martin Luther King Jr. celebration from 2 to 4 p.m. Monday at Silver Creek High School. He shared some of his stories with the Times-Call in the following Q&A.\n\nWhat was the reaction of your friends and family?\n\nMy only supporter from my home town was my minister, who was soon fired for driving me to the edge of town to begin my journey. My Southern mother was buried the day before I entered college. My dying Yankee father and my minister signed a letter disowning me when I was in jail in Mobile in October 1965. Malvern, Ark., was rigidly and totally segregated. Twenty-five years later I found friends in my home town.\n\nWhat marches are the most vivid now, almost 50 years later?\n\nI was clubbed unconscious on the (Edmund Pettis) Bridge on \"Bloody Sunday.\" I made it back into Selma through the horse charge. That night in Brown's Chapel the singing began again, bringing courage and determination back to the people. I led the internal security force at night for the March on Montgomery. I was severely beaten at later marches for the right to vote in Wilcox County, and later for the right for employment opportunities in Demopolis, which is described in the 2001 book, \"If White Kids Die.\"\n\nWere you constantly afraid for your life?\n\nA Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee pin is seen on Strider \"Arkansas\" Benston's vest Wednesday.

(Matthew Jonas / Longmont Times-Call)\n\nMy emotions ran the gamut, from terror and loneliness, to determination and fortitude, to profound joy and sense of the beloved community in our historic struggle for freedom, justice and dignity. I experienced profound love both from and with the local people and with many of the movement workers. The laughter and the tears were worth dying for.\n\nWho were your greatest influences?\n\nMy greatest mentors and partners were Fannie Lou Hamer; Annie Lee Cooper in Selma, who is portrayed by Oprah Winfrey in \"Selma\" ...; Stokely Carmichael, who invited me into the movement and saved my life when I was being held in Mobile, Ala.; the Rev. C.T. Vivian, who truly lived the Christian brotherhood of which he spoke; Sheyanne Webb, the 8-year-old girl who marched with us every day; Alice West who nurtured us all along with her seven children; the great Harry Belafonte, who was our guide and benefactor; Ella Baker, who made the movement happen; and Dr. Martin Luther King, who pointed the way with his courage and his eloquence. Some I dialogued with in great depth and length, some I followed. All, I learned greatly from, and built my life from that teaching.\n\nWhat was your greatest lesson from the civil rights movement?\n\nI have carried the light of freedom, which I learned in this great struggle, in every step that I have walked since. As a rank and file labor organizer on the docks in Chicago, where I raised my daughters, some of the time as a single parent, as a poet, a historian, an educator, an activist for peace and democracy, this light has always been my guide. The freedom songs still bring me courage and inspiration. \"Guide my feet, Lord, while I run this race. For I don't want to run this race in vain.\"\n\nWhitney Bryen: 303-684-5274, wbryen@times-call.com or twitter.com/soonerreporter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27345883/longmont-resident-remembers-selma-bloody-sunday", "modificationDate": "2015-01-18T21:10:02-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0118/20150118__19TCAMLKw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Whitney Bryen \n \n  Times-Call community reporter", "description": "Longmont resident Strider \"Arkansas\" Benston joined the civil rights movement in 1964 after witnessing a vigil lead by the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27345883:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-18T18:56:36-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27345883/longmont-resident-remembers-selma-bloody-sunday", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0118/20150118__19TCAMLKw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Longmont resident Strider \"Arkansas\" Benston joined the civil rights movement in 1964 after witnessing a vigil lead by the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.", "title": "Longmont resident remembers Selma, 'Bloody Sunday'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Longmont resident Strider \"Arkansas\" Benston joined the civil rights movement in 1964 after witnessing a vigil lead by the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.", "title": "Longmont resident remembers Selma, 'Bloody Sunday'", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27345883/longmont-resident-remembers-selma-bloody-sunday", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0118/20150118__19TCAMLKw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-18T18:56:36-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-01-18T18:56:36-0700", "sailthru.title": "Longmont resident remembers Selma, 'Bloody Sunday'", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Whitney BryenTimes-Call", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0118/20150118__19TCAMLKw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-01-18T16:05:01-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Strider \"Arkansas\" Benson talks about the civil rights movementStrider \"Arkansas\" Benston (Matthew Jonas / Longmont Times-Call)Longmont resident Strider \"Arkansas\" Benston joined the civil rights movement in 1964 after witnessing a vigil lead by the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.\nA Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee pin is seen on Strider \"Arkansas\" Benston's vest Wednesday.\n\"From that moment I was committed to the struggle for human rights,\" Benston said.\nWhat was your greatest lesson from the civil rights movement?\nEventually, Benston joined the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and moved to Selma, Ala., that winter, where the locals nicknamed him \"Arkansas,\" because he came from that state."}
