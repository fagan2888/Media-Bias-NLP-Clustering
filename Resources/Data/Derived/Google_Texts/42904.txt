Fort Collins climber Alan Arnette reached the summit of K2 on Sunday morning, his 58th birthday — although it was slightly before 9:30 p.m. Saturday local time.

Arnette, who became the oldest climber to reach the top of the second-highest peak in the world, was raising money for Alzheimer’s research.

“Mountain climbing is my passion, but ending Alzheimer’s is my purpose,” Arnette wrote in his blog about the excursion. “That is why I am climbing the world’s hardest mountain to fight one of the world’s deadliest diseases.”

Arnette helped his mother fight Alzheimer’s disease. She died in 2009 at age 83, and he came up with The 7 Summits Climb for Alzheimer’s fundraising effort.

Arnette spoke to The Denver Post about the goals of the fundraiser in 2012.
