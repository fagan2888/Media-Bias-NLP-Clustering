It marked the first day of a six-month enrollment period that will allow uninsured Americans to shop for a health plan that meets their needs. Considering the confusion that\u2019s been swirling around the health care reform law, it wasn\u2019t clear how many people would take advantage of the new opportunity to enroll for coverage on Tuesday. But initial reports suggest there was a strong public appetite for learning more about Obamacare, and enrollment centers around the country were swamped helping a flood of interested people sign up.\n\nHere are just a few examples of the people who were so eager to sign up for Obamacare that they started the process on the very first day:\n\nMary Jones from Alabama: Jones has gone without health insurance for years because she hasn\u2019t been able to afford it. Her husband is eligible for Medicare, but Jones\u2019 private insurance options are too expensive and offer coverage that\u2019s too skimpy for her needs. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling being able to have affordable health care and I thank God, the president, and the United States of America for being able to have it,\u201d Jones told the Anniston Star after signing up for a plan under Obamacare on Tuesday. Her husband, Marvin, agreed. \u201cThe premiums for this are lower, hundreds of dollars a month lower. And it offers all the coverage my wife needs,\u201d he noted.\n\nPhyllis Brown from Arizona: 58-year-old Brown lost her Medicaid coverage when the state contracted coverage for childless adults in 2011, and has gone uninsured since then. She\u2019s struggled with high blood pressure and heart problems, has been hospitalized four time, and ended up accumulating at least $20,000 in unpaid medical bills. She says she once went for months without taking her heart medication because she couldn\u2019t afford it. Now, under Obamacare, she\u2019s eligible for public insurance again. The Arizona Republic reports that Brown was \u201cthrilled\u201d to enroll on Tuesday. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big relief.\u201d\n\nAndrew Stryker from California: 34-year-old Stryker does freelance work in Los Angeles. He currently pays about $600 per month to stay on the insurance plan he got through his last job, and wants to get a cheaper plan under Obamacare. He logged onto California\u2019s exchange site on Tuesday \u2014 and even though the website had some delays, he waited it out until he could successfully complete the sign-up process. \u201cObviously three hours is a long time to wait, but it will save me over $6,000. For that, I would have waited all day,\u201d Styker told Wonkblog\u2019s Sarah Kliff.\n\nBrendan Mahoney from Connecticut: 30-year-old Mahoney is a law student who can\u2019t afford the premiums for the health plan that the University of Connecticut offers, and doesn\u2019t want to keep paying for the high-deductible plan that he purchased on his own. He logged onto his state\u2019s exchange website on Tuesday to see if he could get cheaper coverage under Obamacare \u2014 and he found out he\u2019s actually eligible for Medicaid thanks to the health law\u2019s expansion of the program. That means he won\u2019t have to pay any premiums at all next year. He had to try to the website twice, but then it worked well. \u201cOnce it got running, it was fast,\u201d Mahoney told the Hartford Courant. \u201cIt really made my day.\u201d\n\nSarah Heller from Delaware: 49-year-old Heller started the enrollment process on Tuesday with the help of a navigator. The Delaware News Journal reports that beginning to sign up for health insurance brought tears to her eyes. Heller doesn\u2019t have health insurance, and currently relies on a community health program for her essential care \u2014 but now, she wants to sign up for her own insurance plan. \u201cI\u2019m a wife, a mother of two, grandmother of three and a hardworking American,\u201d Heller said at a public event on Tuesday to mark the start of enrollment, noting that she wants insurance to make sure she can see her grandchildren grow up and enjoy attending their baseball games.\n\nAlex Gomez from Florida: Gomez, a 38-year-old father of four, is a self-employed painting contractor. He currently pays $500 each month for a high-deductible insurance plan, and he told a local NBC affiliate that he wants to purchase a cheaper plan under Obamacare. So he visited a local health center to figure out his options. \u201cNobody knows what Obamacare is. One person says it\u2019s going to be good, another person says it\u2019s going to be bad,\u201d Gomez noted. He didn\u2019t realize that he would be eligible for a federal subsidy to help him afford insurance on Florida\u2019s exchange \u2014 but he found out on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s good news for me,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nColton Cope from Kentucky: Cope is a 21-year-old student at Jefferson Community College. He works two part-time jobs, but he hasn\u2019t been able to afford health insurance for several years. He went to an Obamacare sign-up event at Jefferson Community & Technical College on Tuesday and found out that he qualified for Medicaid coverage under Obamacare\u2019s expansion of the program. Cope didn\u2019t sign up immediately, but he gathered the paperwork he\u2019ll need to do it. He told the Courier-Journal he didn\u2019t mind waiting to officially enroll because he\u2019s spent years worrying that he was \u201cone accident or medical issue away from bankruptcy.\u201d He walked out grinning, saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to have health insurance!\u201d\n\nPaula Triplett from Michigan: Triplett, a former community college teacher who is now on dialysis, currently pays $940 a month for her insurance. She can\u2019t go without the expensive coverage because she needs to be insured to remain on the kidney transplant list \u2014 and now, she\u2019s excited to be able to sign up for a cheaper option under Obamacare. She believes her premiums under the health law will drop to $250 a month. \u201cThis really is historic,\u201d Triplett told Michigan Live. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. This stuff is so good. I hope everybody takes a look at it.\u201d Even though Triplett had initial issues using the exchange website, she wasn\u2019t deterred by the glitches. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m not frustrated,\u201d she said, pointing out that there are probably delays because so many people are trying to use the website at the same time.\n\nPaula Thornhill from Virginia: Thornhill, a 31-year-old mother of seven, was the first person to apply for Obamacare in Prince George\u2019s County. Thornhill didn\u2019t initially know much about the health reform law, but she was eager to apply with the help of a community coordinator. Although her husband gets health insurance through his job, they can\u2019t currently afford to extend his coverage to Thornhill because the premiums are hundreds of dollars each month. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that they did come out with this affordable health care,\u201d she told the Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m relieved.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I couldn't wait,\" 58-year-old Phyllis Brown said in reference to signing up for Obamacare in Arizona. \"It's a big relief.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"I couldn't wait,\" 58-year-old Phyllis Brown said in reference to signing up for Obamacare in Arizona. \"It's a big relief.\"", "title": "Meet The People Who Were Eager To Sign Up For Obamacare On The Very First Day", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/10/02/2715871/obamacare-sign-up-first-day/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare-covered.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I couldn't wait,\" 58-year-old Phyllis Brown said in reference to signing up for Obamacare in Arizona. \"It's a big relief.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare-covered-321x214.jpg", "title": "Meet The People Who Were Eager To Sign Up For Obamacare On The Very First Day", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare-covered.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/obamacare-covered.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-02T10:56:38+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa4c\"", "article_summary": "It marked the first day of a six-month enrollment period that will allow uninsured Americans to shop for a health plan that meets their needs.\nHe works two part-time jobs, but he hasn\u2019t been able to afford health insurance for several years.\nThe Delaware News Journal reports that beginning to sign up for health insurance brought tears to her eyes.\nHeller doesn\u2019t have health insurance, and currently relies on a community health program for her essential care \u2014 but now, she wants to sign up for her own insurance plan.\nHe didn\u2019t realize that he would be eligible for a federal subsidy to help him afford insurance on Florida\u2019s exchange \u2014 but he found out on Tuesday."}
