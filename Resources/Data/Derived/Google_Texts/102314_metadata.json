In addition to her health, she has another big reason to succeed: Her affordable-housing apartment complex just went cold turkey.\n\nOn Jan. 1, Flagler Village, a 49-unit rental community of mostly duplexes near Key West, banned smoking on the grounds and inside all units.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a growing trend of residential multi-unit buildings and developments, both privately and government-owned, voluntarily to implement no-smoking policies.\n\nWith no-smoking laws enacted in much of the public domain \u2014 including airplanes, hotels, restaurants, bars, parks, schools, hospitals and public buildings \u2014 tobacco prevention specialists see places where people live as new territory to conquer.\n\n\u201cIn 2000, it was unheard of,\u201d said Matthew Competiello, program manager for the American Lung Association. \u201cBut over the past five or six years there has been a lot of demand for smoke-free housing.\u201d\n\nValencia Morris, the tobacco prevention specialist for the Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County, said complex-wide smoking bans are starting to become an \u201camenity.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people are wanting this, just like having a gym on the premises,\u201d she said.\n\nBut with an adult smoking population in Florida of 17.1 percent, according to a state survey conducted in 2010, extending smoking bans into residences definitely has been met with opposition.\n\n\u201cWe have ruffled some feathers,\u201d said Mitzy Cordova, manager of Flagler Village, which had smokers in 18 of the 49 units when its ban took effect.\n\n\u201cWhile most residents say \u2018Wow, Mitzy, this is great\u2019 \u2014 one has a newborn and lives next to a smoker and does not want her baby to breathe secondhand smoke, I have at least two that say they won\u2019t quit smoking in their homes no matter what,\u201d Cordova said.\n\nAmong those opposed to the ban at Flagler Village is Wayne Sepanik, who has lived there since it opened two years ago. And the semi-retired 63-year-old is a non-smoker.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s against their civil rights,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople moved here on the premise to have affordable housing and live a happy life and all of a sudden there is no smoking. It\u2019s an addiction and a sickness and a lot of people here can\u2019t afford to go anyplace else.\u201d\n\nBut Cordova says the law is on the side of property owners. \u201cThe right to smoke is not part of the Constitution,\u201d she said, adding that Flagler Village is not discriminating against smokers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not telling anybody they cannot smoke,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re telling them they cannot smoke on the property.\u201d\n\nIn the Keys, tourists have discovered that finding a hotel, guesthouse or vacation rental that allows smoking inside is almost impossible these days. In a 2010 post on TripAdvisor.com, a woman from Virginia wrote: \u201cLooking desperately for a nice, quality resort hotel in Key West that still allows smoking without being fined or condemned to the loading dock.\u201d\n\nBut the opposite has been true when trying to find nonsmoking residential rental community along the island chain. Donna Stayton, a health education program consultant with Tobacco Free Florida Keys, estimates she knows of only about 12 multi-unit developments in the Keys that ban smoking, and most have done so recently.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 SaukValley.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.saukvalley.com/2014/01/12/florida-community-joins-residential-housing-trend-to-ban-smoking/a80xoz2/", "image": "http://www.saukvalley.com/_internal/cimg!0/b5p1hgqjrebnw3qg1fz1nex95h1671m", "site_name": "SaukValley.com", "title": "Florida community joins residential housing trend to ban smoking"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "tout": {"article": {"id": "795e23ef-3ff5-486f-9d4c-1152733ea1e5"}}, "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1acf\"", "article_summary": "Among those opposed to the ban at Flagler Village is Wayne Sepanik, who has lived there since it opened two years ago.\nOn Jan. 1, Flagler Village, a 49-unit rental community of mostly duplexes near Key West, banned smoking on the grounds and inside all units.\n\u201cWe have ruffled some feathers,\u201d said Mitzy Cordova, manager of Flagler Village, which had smokers in 18 of the 49 units when its ban took effect.\n\u201cThe right to smoke is not part of the Constitution,\u201d she said, adding that Flagler Village is not discriminating against smokers.\nDonna Stayton, a health education program consultant with Tobacco Free Florida Keys, estimates she knows of only about 12 multi-unit developments in the Keys that ban smoking, and most have done so recently."}
