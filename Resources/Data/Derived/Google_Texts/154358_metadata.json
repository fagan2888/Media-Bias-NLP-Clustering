NBC 7\u2019s Consumer Bob has more. (Published Friday, Nov. 8, 2013)\n\nSharp Healthcare\u2019s Manager of Senior Services Alicia Flynn stood in the front of a movie theatre in San Diego Wednesday along with an audience of nearly 80 senior citizens to talk about Medicare.\n\nSan Diegan Bill Radatz was one of those attending the free seminar. He said he was hoping for, \u201cconcrete information about the plan next year if there\u2019s going to be any chances and a reassurance of confidence that it\u2019s going to function much like it did before.\u201d\n\nSharp Hospital holds the meetings every year but at this meeting there were new concerns regarding the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCovered California and the ACA, or so-called Obamacare, is not for seniors, Flynn said.\n\n\u201cIf you have Medicare, you\u2019re not eligible to purchase a plan through Covered California,\u201d she said.\n\nFlynn said there is a common misunderstanding about enrollment deadlines.\n\nOpen enrollment for Medicare ends December 7. While the first deadline for Covered California is December 15 if you want your coverage to start on January first.\n\nWhile seniors don't qualify for ACA, some plans may actually be impacted with some costs going up or down in price.\n\nSome participants have said their Medigap plans are increasing their monthly premium costs or their co-pays for certain services for 2014, Flynn said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why every year at open enrollment it\u2019s really important to reevaluate the plan you\u2019re in \u2013 what change has happened and take a look at what\u2019s changing for 2014,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, ACA is also working to eliminate the \u201cdonut hole\u201d \u2013 the gap in coverage for prescription drugs.\n\nThe gap will minimize each year with the goal is to completely eliminate it by 2020.\n\nMedigap plans are not offered through Covered California.\n\nThat's another reason why seminars like the one offered through Sharp, can help seniors get through this confusing time of year.\n\n\u201cThey come in with lots of questions and we get them all answered,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cThey leave knowing what they need to do,\u201d\n\nSharp Healthcare is offering more seminars throughout the county this month and next.
