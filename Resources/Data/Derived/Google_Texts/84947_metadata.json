The Donald has no policy.\n\nThis is not exactly news, but it is too often forgotten in the substance-free carnival that is the 2016 presidential race. Donald Trump\u2019s bright-shiny-object campaign style serves to obscure the substance void, leaving reporters endlessly chasing after his latest rhetorical bomb rather than pressing him on policy.\n\nNot, of course, that such questioning produces answers. Trump evades questions about how he would approach a particular problem with airy assurances about management and dealmaking. There\u2019s only so much follow-up that can be done in the face of this bombast.\n\nJoin me on a trip through a typical Trump stump speech, this one an hour-long stream-of-consciousness ramble just before the new year in South Carolina:\n\nThe crowd size. His poll numbers. Why he must attack Hillary Clinton. The media is the worst. The trade deficit with China. How much money Jeb Bush has wasted. Has he mentioned the polls? Matt Drudge, great guy. How bad a job Clinton did at State. How nice of Vladimir Putin to praise him. (No sarcasm intended.) His Ivy League pedigree and big vocabulary. Back to Clinton: \u201cShe just gives me a headache.\u201d\n\nAt a campaign event in Hilton Head, S.C., Republican front-runner Donald Trump criticized Jeb Bush for overspending on political advertisements and low poll numbers. (Reuters)\n\nHe\u2019s going to build the strongest military ever. Obamacare is a disaster. Common Core\u2019s dead. Trump\u2019s spent no money on his campaign and he\u2019s No. 1. Marco Rubio, nice guy but what about those somber ads with a black background? What great ratings those debates got.\n\nNot smart to answer questions about the Islamic State \u2014 he wants to be unpredictable. How bad the Iran nuclear deal is. The Iraq War, huge mistake. The environmentalists\u2019 attack on Trump\u2019s hair spray and how the spray is much better than the pump, with those blobs that get stuck and he needs to take a shower. By the way, he lives in a very nice apartment, and \u201cI don\u2019t think anything gets out\u201d into the atmosphere.\n\nThe hoax of global warming and the threat to the universe. Speaking of the universe, Miss Universe, and \u201coh, did I get rich\u201d off the pageant.\n\nHow many televisions he orders a year from South Korea and how we are using our military to support countries such as South Korea that don\u2019t need our help. His wall versus the Great Wall of China. Even his hats are made in America, and you can buy other things on his website, too.\n\nCarly Fiorina\u2019s a nice woman.\n\nChina\u2019s building military fortresses in the South China Sea and we\u2019re worrying about the environmental impact of a border wall with Mexico on toads and turtles? Wait until China has to deal with Carl Icahn.\n\nDon\u2019t worry about the cost of a wall. The Old Post Office building is coming in under budget. As is his campaign.\n\nBy the way, Clinton has lower energy than Bush. Trump\u2019s a nice person. He actually wants to help Syrian refugees, with a massive safe zone. Can you believe Angela Merkel was the person of the year and he wasn\u2019t? The wall \u2014 Mexico\u2019s going to pay.\n\nTed Cruz, he\u2019s a good guy.\n\nRemember the escalator in Trump Tower? The press that day looked like the Academy Awards. No one would be talking about illegal immigration if it weren\u2019t for Trump. More polls.\n\nBernie Sanders, a total disaster who wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent.\n\nBack to Clinton: He\u2019s the last person she wants to run against.\n\nTrump will save the Second Amendment. If only Parisians had guns. It wasn\u2019t politically correct for neighbors to report Islamic State sympathizers in San Bernardino, Calif. Trump\u2019s poll numbers went up after the attacks.\n\nThe trade stuff is easy. How we messed up Iraq. We\u2019re going to be rich, safe, strong again.\n\nReaders, this is no caricature \u2014 it\u2019s Trump unfiltered, alighting briefly on a topic, complicated or trivial, before flitting to the next. And it\u2019s not as if Trump bolsters his stump speech with policy depth in proposals or interviews. If Obamacare is a disaster, what\u2019s Trump\u2019s replacement? If Common Core is dead, what\u2019s his alternative?\n\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has estimated that Trump\u2019s tax plan \u2014 one subject he barely mentions \u2014 would cost $9.5 trillion over the first decade, not including added interest. In 2000, when a surplus was forecast, George W. Bush proposed cuts costing $1.3 trillion. They were extensively debated \u2014 in the campaign.\n\nTrump relies on his ability to dominate the news with provocative distractions, to repel serious questions until interviewers\u2019 time runs out. We in the media must find a way, if not to pierce the bluster, at least to expose it.\n\nRead more from Ruth Marcus\u2019s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump gives the public and the media the slip by constantly flitting between bombastic sound bites.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Donald Trump gives the public and the media the slip by constantly flitting between bombastic sound bites.", "title": "Why Teflon Trump is so hard to attack", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-teflon-trump-is-so-hard-to-attack/2016/01/05/7110ebec-b3d3-11e5-9388-466021d971de_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/01/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/GOP_2016_Trump-0e185-1552.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@RuthMarcus"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-teflon-trump-is-so-hard-to-attack/2016/01/05/7110ebec-b3d3-11e5-9388-466021d971de_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Ruth Marcus, donald trump, trump tax plan, trump policies, trump hilton head", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ruthmarcus"}, "eomportal-uuid": "7110ebec-b3d3-11e5-9388-466021d971de", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Ruth Marcus, donald trump, trump tax plan, trump policies, trump hilton head"}, "article_summary": "Trump relies on his ability to dominate the news with provocative distractions, to repel serious questions until interviewers\u2019 time runs out.\nTrump evades questions about how he would approach a particular problem with airy assurances about management and dealmaking.\nReaders, this is no caricature \u2014 it\u2019s Trump unfiltered, alighting briefly on a topic, complicated or trivial, before flitting to the next.\nBy the way, Clinton has lower energy than Bush.\nChina\u2019s building military fortresses in the South China Sea and we\u2019re worrying about the environmental impact of a border wall with Mexico on toads and turtles?"}
