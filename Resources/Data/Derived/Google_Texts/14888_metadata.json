Blunda. Middlesex County Democratic Chairman Kevin McCabe and state Senator Joe Vitale (D-19) had other ideas, and trusted in a political relationship they had forged with Diaz, which now appears jeopardized.\n\n\u201cWe disagree on this, that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t find common ground on other things,\u201d said Diaz, who highlighted in particular what she says is Vitale\u2019s public service record in Trenton.\n\nBut Diaz won\u2019t be buffaloed she said, and made another vow today.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely running again,\u201d she said.\n\nHaving deposed former Mayor Joe Vas in 2008, bank teller turned giant slayer Diaz won reelection to a second term in 2012. She is up for reelection in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing so many great things, I want to continue the progress,\u201d added the mayor, who this morning welcomed U.S. Senator Bob Menendez to a health fair at the Jewish Renaissance Medical Center in Perth Amboy in celebration of National Health Center Week to announce a federal grant that the center received this week.\n\nIn the crowd stood attorney Billy Delgado, whom Diaz defeated to win her second term in 2012.\n\nThe occasion marked the grand opening of the Jewish Renaissance Medical Center, a community healthcare operation that received an infusion of federal funds under the auspices of the Affordable Care Act. Menendez personally helped get the funding for the center and his name graces the building.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/wildaperth-e1441301990140.jpg?w=41", "description": "PERTH AMBOY - Embroiled in a backroom war with the county and district-wide leaders of her party, Mayor Wilda Diaz said she is \"determined\" to land her choice for law director in this historic wharf front city.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "PERTH AMBOY \u2013 Embroiled in a backroom war with the county and district-wide leaders of her party, Mayor Wilda Diaz said she is \u201cdetermined\u201d to land her choice for law director in \u2026", "title": "In Perth Amboy, Mayor Diaz to Run Next Year for Third Term", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2015/08/in-perth-amboy-mayor-diaz-to-run-next-year-for-third-term/", "image": {"width": 635, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/wildaperth-e1441301990140.jpg", "height": 781}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/wildaperth-e1441301990140.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-13 12:40:56", "sailthru.title": "In Perth Amboy, Mayor Diaz to Run Next Year for Third Term", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "wilda diaz, perth amboy, billy delgado, bob menendez", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2015-08-13T16:40:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-13T19:11:48+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/max"}, "sailthru.description": "PERTH AMBOY - Embroiled in a backroom war with the county and district-wide leaders of her party, Mayor Wilda Diaz said she is \"determined\" to land her choice for law director in this historic wharf front city.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/wildaperth-e1441301990140.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Wilda Diaz, Perth Amboy, Billy Delgado, Bob Menendez"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca130\"", "article_summary": "Having deposed former Mayor Joe Vas in 2008, bank teller turned giant slayer Diaz won reelection to a second term in 2012.\nIn the crowd stood attorney Billy Delgado, whom Diaz defeated to win her second term in 2012.\nBut Diaz won\u2019t be buffaloed she said, and made another vow today.\nDiaz wants attorney Arlene Quinones Perez installed as the replacement for attorney Mark J.
