President Bush signed Medicare Part D into law in 2003 to subsidize prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nThe Daily Caller has learned that the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Health will hold a hearing Feb. 26 in Room 2123 of the Rayburn Building entitled, \u201cMessing with Success: How CMS\u2019s Attack on the Part D Program Will Increase Costs and Reduce Choices for Seniors.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), a division of Kathleen Sebelius\u2019 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recently introduced a new proposed rule on the Federal Register called \u201cMedicare Program: Contract Year 2015 Policy and Technical Changes to the Medicare Advantage and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Programs.\u201d\n\nThe new rule \u201cwould revise the Medicare Advantage (MA) program (Part C) regulations and prescription drug benefit program (Part D) regulations to implement statutory requirements; strengthen beneficiary protections; exclude plans that perform poorly; improve program efficiencies; and clarify program requirements,\u201d according to the Federal Register.\n\nThe rule states that it also aims \u201cto implement certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe new rule\u2019s stated desire to \u201cstrengthen our ability to identify strong applicants for Part C and Part D program participation and remove consistently poor performers\u201d would give the Obama administration new authority to limit health insurance and prescription drug providers under the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs.\n\nThe Daily Caller has extensively reported on Obamacare\u2019s veritable destruction of the privately-run Medicare Advantage program, which Obamacare raids to the tune of $300 billion in a sweeping cut that begins to affect seniors in 2014. But the U.S. House subcommittee is principally concerned about the rule\u2019s impact on Medicare Part D.\n\nThe new CMS rule introduces \u201cpolicies that would undermine the integrity and success of the Medicare Part D program,\u201d according to the subcommittee.\n\n\u201cMedicare Part D, through its unique private sector-based competitive model, has given seniors access to quality and affordable health care choices for the past ten years. Subcommittee members look forward to hearing from CMS regarding the proposed rule and better understanding what effect it will have on the Medicare Part D program,\u201d according to the subcommittee.\n\n\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "House subcommittee hearing to analyze new rule's impact on Bush's signature health care program", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration is launching an \"attack\" on the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs as part of Obamacare that will result in higher costs and fewer health care options for seniors", "title": "REVEALED: Obama\u2019s \u2018attack\u2019 on Medicare Part D", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/22/revealed-obamas-attack-on-medicare-part-d/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BushObama-e1393129413281.jpg", "height": 440}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration is launching an \"attack\" on the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs as part of Obamacare that will result in...", "title": "REVEALED: Obama\u2019s \u2018attack\u2019 on Medicare Part D Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/22/revealed-obamas-attack-on-medicare-part-d/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BushObama-e1393129413281.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-22 23:26:08", "sailthru.title": "REVEALED: Obama's 'attack' on Medicare Part D", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "george-w-bush,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "cms,george w. bush,hhs,medicare part d", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration is launching an \"attack\" on the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs as part of Obamacare that will result in higher costs and fewer health care options for seniors", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/BushObama-e1393129413281.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1163\"", "article_summary": "The administration is quietly introducing \u201cpolicies that would undermine the integrity and success of the Medicare Part D program\u201d according to the subcommittee.\nPresident Bush signed Medicare Part D into law in 2003 to subsidize prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n4103967The Obama administration is launching an \u201cattack\u201d on the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D programs as part of Obamacare that will result in higher costs and fewer health care options for seniors, according to a U.S. House subcommittee.\nSubcommittee members look forward to hearing from CMS regarding the proposed rule and better understanding what effect it will have on the Medicare Part D program,\u201d according to the subcommittee.\nThe Daily Caller has extensively reported on Obamacare\u2019s veritable destruction of the privately-run Medicare Advantage program, which Obamacare raids to the tune of $300 billion in a sweeping cut that begins to affect seniors in 2014."}
