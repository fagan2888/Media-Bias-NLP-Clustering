These miniature human organs can also be to test new drugs effectively on human models rather than animal models.\n\nResearchers at the Danish Stem Cell Centre developed a 3-D culture method that can allow pancreatic cells to expand and \u201ctake a three-dimensional shape enabling them to multiply more freely,\u201d Professor Anne Grapin-Botton, author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cIt\u2019s like a plant where you use effective fertilizer, think of the laboratory like a garden and the scientist being the gardener.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur experiments reveal new aspects of pancreas development, such as a community effect by which small groups of cells better maintain progenitor properties and expand more efficiently than isolated cells, as well as the requirement for three-dimensionality,\u201d the authors write in the summary accompanying the study.\n\nThe scientists discovered that pancreas cells were able to develop better in a gel in three-dimensions rather than being flattened at the bottom of a culture plate. \u201cUnder optimal conditions, the initial clusters of a few cells have proliferated into 40,000 cells within a week,\u201d Grapin-Botton said in the press release. The types of cells used in this process are called progenitor cells \u2014 which are similar, but not the same as, stem cells. Stem cells are unlimited, replicating indefinitely. Progenitor cells, on the other hand, divide a limited number of times.\n\nAfter the progenitor cells grow a lot, they transform into digestive enzyme-producing cells and self-organize into \u201cbranched pancreatic organoids that are amazingly similar to the pancreas,\u201d Grapin-Botton explains. These special cells are also able to produce hormones like insulin, which is where the diabetes link comes in. The researchers believe that production of these types of cells could be used for diabetes therapy in the future in producing insulin-making cells for spare parts.\n\n\u201cWe show that the pancreatic cells care not only about how you feed them but need to be grown in the right physical environment,\u201d Grapin-Botton said. \u201cWe are now trying to adapt this method to human stem cells.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "miniature pancreas, diabetes, stem cells, 3d culture", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Danish researchers believe they have found a potential new diabetes therapy through growing miniature pancreatic organs.", "title": "Miniature Pancreas Grown By Danish Researchers From Stem Cells", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miniature-pancreas-grown-danish-researchers-stem-cells-holds-promise-diabetes-therapy-260383", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/19/8c83404ddc995e8e1699c1dc09dc784a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Danish researchers believe they have found a potential new diabetes therapy through growing miniature pancreatic organs.", "title": "Miniature Pancreas Grown By Danish Researchers From Stem Cells", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miniature-pancreas-grown-danish-researchers-stem-cells-holds-promise-diabetes-therapy-260383", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/19/8c83404ddc995e8e1699c1dc09dc784a.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/19/8c83404ddc995e8e1699c1dc09dc784a.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-10-19T18:50:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T18:50:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Danish researchers believe they have found a potential new diabetes therapy through growing miniature pancreatic organs."}, "article_summary": "The types of cells used in this process are called progenitor cells \u2014 which are similar, but not the same as, stem cells.\n\u201cWe are now trying to adapt this method to human stem cells.\u201d\nThe scientists discovered that pancreas cells were able to develop better in a gel in three-dimensions rather than being flattened at the bottom of a culture plate.\nProgenitor cells, on the other hand, divide a limited number of times.\nStem cells are unlimited, replicating indefinitely."}
