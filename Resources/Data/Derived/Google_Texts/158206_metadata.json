Again.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is working toward euthanizing health savings accounts (HSAs). Democrats have barely attempted to hide their preference for a single-payer health insurance system, so it only stands to reason they\u2019d work to pull the plug on the most attractive market option standing in the way.\n\nDemocrats have always hated HSAs because they put patients in charge of their own health spending (to a point \u2014 in some ways, HSA users are still swimming upstream against the health system\u2019s lack of price transparency.) But the market-driven approach has become increasingly popular in the last decade.\n\n\u201cIn the past seven years, [HSA] enrollment has climbed 18% a year on average,\u201d notes Investor\u2019s Business Daily. \u201cToday, there are almost 20 million enrollees who have more than $24 billion in their HSA accounts. Even the number crunchers in the Health and Human Services Department admit that these \u2018consumer-directed\u2019 health plans are helping to hold down costs.\u201d\n\nImagine where we\u2019d be without them.\n\nBack in March, just in time for ObamaCare\u2019s six-year anniversary, HHS issued new rules that will effectively end HSAs. Roy J. Ramthun, an expert on the subject often known as \u201cMr. HSA\u201d \u2014 president and founder of HSA Consulting after having led the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s implementation of HSAs upon enactment in 2003 \u2014 explains the impact of the rule changes:\n\n1) Plans must apply specific deductibles and out-of-pocket limits that are outside the requirements for HSA-qualified plans. 2) Plans must cover services below the deductible that are not considered \u201cpreventive care.\u201d\n\nIn other words, HSAs will still be legal, but ever fewer plans will meet the requirements. Ramthun writes, \u201c[I]t is only a matter of time before the HSA-qualified plans completely disappear. That could happen as early as 2017 even though the standard benefit designs are optional. By 2018, when the designs likely become mandatory, HSAs will cease to exist in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nSo we weren\u2019t the least bit surprised to find out this week that we face a major rate increase this summer for renewing our small business health insurance plan.\n\nHere\u2019s a peek into the window of the internal operations of our humble shop:\n\nOur full-time employees range in age from about 25 to 60 \u2014 the median age is 37. All of us are married, and some of our families include children (as in younger than 26 years of age). We\u2019re all of reasonable health and don\u2019t unduly burden the health care system with claims. Our plan is a high-deductible HSA, and it doesn\u2019t include eye or dental insurance.\n\nOne would reason, therefore, that our premiums would be low. And one would be dead wrong. That used to be true, but that was before ObamaCare. For the last several years, our premiums have gone up by double digits annually, and this year\u2019s 33% increase is among the highest so far. On top of that, our deductibles also rose last year. Since the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act came along, we now pay nearly four times as much \u2014 for less coverage.\n\nAnother note: Our plan doesn\u2019t actually qualify under ObamaCare\u2019s requirements, but it\u2019s \u201cgrandmothered\u201d for the time being. Changing anything will only make either the price go up or the coverage go down \u2014 or both.\n\nIt would be one thing if our experience were an outlier, but it\u2019s not; it\u2019s the norm. Health insurance premiums around the country are going up by double-digit percentages every year, and some by 50% or more. What ever happened to \u201cbending the cost curve down\u201d as Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats regularly promised? \u201cWe\u2019ll lower premiums by up to $2,500 for a typical family per year,\u201d he guaranteed. Reality is just the opposite. How is that in any way \u201caffordable\u201d?\n\nOr how about being able to keep one\u2019s doctor or one\u2019s plan? While millions of patients have been told to look for other doctors, millions of insurance plans have been canceled in recent years. Indeed, a large portion of the people signing up for coverage under ObamaCare had coverage they liked but lost.\n\nThis is all just part of the ObamaCare web of lies.\n\nIn 1785, Thomas Jefferson wrote, \u201c[H]e who permits himself to tell a lie once, finds it much easier to do it a second and a third time, till at length it becomes habitual; he tells lies without attending to it, and truths without the world\u2019s believing him.\u201d And that above all else defines Obama\u2019s pathetic legacy \u2014 not just on health care, either.\n\nIf there\u2019s a silver lining, it\u2019s this: With increasing frequency, Americans of every political stripe who have any issue with health care, whether a hangnail or heart transplant, a delay in a doctor\u2019s office or in critical care for a loved one, will tie blame for their discontent like a noose around the necks of Obama and his fellow Democrats, who are solely responsible for forcing this abomination upon the American people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Good news: Our insurance premiums are going up 33%.", "csrf-token": "PXuGeBb4f92v50l/OO5IKId+jJjwHxzlh2eMxI/z0jA=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Good news: Our insurance premiums are going up 33%.", "title": "ObamaCare Cost Curve Hits The Patriot Post.
