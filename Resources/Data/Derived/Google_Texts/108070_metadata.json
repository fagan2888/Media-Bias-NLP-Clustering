Fifty percent now disapprove of the health care law, while 39 percent approve. These percentages are similar to polls conducted earlier in the fall, but are more positive compared to last month, when disapproval reached an all-time high of 61 percent.\n\n\n\nStill, just 16 percent of Americans think sign-up on the health care exchanges has been going well \u2013 and far more, 58 percent, think it\u2019s not going well. However, the percentage that says it is not going well has dropped nine points since last month.\n\nBut just over a third sees some improvement in the sign-up process. Thirty-six percent think the signup for the health care exchanges is getting better. Forty-four percent think it is staying the same, and another 13 percent think it is getting worse.\n\nEven 33 percent of those who say the signup is not going well think the process is getting better.\n\nThe President: Ratings and Qualities\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s job approval rating has risen slightly from an all-time low of 37 percent last month to 42 percent now. Last month\u2019s low occurred as his administration weathered a highly-criticized roll out of the health care exchange website under the Affordable Care Act. Disapproval of how the president is handling his job is also down seven points \u2013 from 57 percent last month to 50 percent now.\n\nIn particular, there has been an improvement in the way Americans view the job President Obama is doing handling health care. While most Americans still disapprove of his handling of it, approval has risen nine points since November, from 32 percent (a record low) to 41 percent today.\n\nThere has also been a bump up in approval of his handling of foreign policy. Now, the percentage that approves (42 percent) is nearly even with disapproval (44 percent). Assessment of his handling of the economy remains at 37 percent - unchanged from last month.\n\nThe president\u2019s improved rating on handling health care is largely due to a rally by Democrats. Seventy percent of Democrats approve of the way Mr. Obama is handling health care, up 11 points from last month. Approval among Republicans and independents has also risen six points each, though most still disapprove.\n\nThe president has not made any headway since last month\u2019s poll on two measures: his honesty and whether or not he shares the priorities of most Americans. Americans are divided over whether President Obama is honest and trustworthy \u2013 49 percent say he is and 46 percent say he is not.\n\nThere is greater consensus that Mr. Obama does not share their priorities \u2013 58 percent of Americans say he does not.\n\nCongress\n\nApproval of how Congress is handling its job remains dismal. Only 10 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, just one percentage point above the all-time low of 9 percent. Eighty-three percent disapprove.\n\nThe Economy and Country\u2019s Direction\n\nWhile the nation\u2019s unemployment rate is now at a five year low, most Americans (61 percent) continue to say the economy is in bad shape. Thirty-seven percent now think the economy is good, a slight uptick from last month and at the same level it was in the summer.\n\nThe public\u2019s economic outlook isn\u2019t especially positive. Twenty-seven percent think the economy is getting better, while 30 percent say it is getting worse. Forty-two percent think it is staying the same.\n\nAs it has since 2008, the economy and jobs is the top concern for Americans (24 percent), followed by health care (13 percent), the budget and the national debt (6 percent), government issues (5 percent) and partisan politics (4 percent).\n\nAmericans remain mostly pessimistic about where the country his headed: 30 percent think it is headed in the right direction, but far more - 63 percent - say things are off on the wrong track.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nThis poll was conducted by telephone December 5-8, 2013 among 1,000 adults nationwide.
