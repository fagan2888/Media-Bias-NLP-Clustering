The aim was to see whether staying up late affected metabolism and body fat, regardless of how many hours of sleep the person got after finally going to bed.\n\nSorry, night owls, but the results are not encouraging.\n\n\u201cRegardless of lifestyle, people who stayed up late faced a higher risk of developing health problems like diabetes or reduced muscle mass than those who were early risers,\u201d study co-author Nan Hee Kim, M.D., an endocrinologist at Korea University College of Medicine, said in a news release.\n\n\u201cThis could be caused by night owls\u2019 tendency to have poorer sleep quality and to engage in unhealthy behaviors like smoking, late-night eating and a sedentary lifestyle,\u201d Kim added.\n\nFurthermore, those health risks stayed the same even when night owls got the same amount of sleep as the morning folks.\n\nThe study involved 1,620 adults ages 47 to 59, who answered questionnaires about their sleep habits and underwent tests to measure their blood glucose levels and body scans to measure fat and lean muscle mass. Based on the questionnaire results, 480 participants were classified as morning chronotypes, and 95 were categorized as evening chronotypes. The rest had a sleep-wake cycle between the two extremes.\n\nEven though the night owls tended to be younger, they had higher levels of body fat and triglycerides (fats in the blood) than early risers \u2014 possibly because of all that late-night snacking. Couch potato night owls also had less muscle mass.\n\nMen who were evening chronotypes were more likely to have diabetes and lower lean muscle mass than early risers. Among women, night owls tended to have more belly fat and a greater risk of metabolic syndrome, a cluster of symptoms that includes high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol that raise the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\n\nGet discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages. \u00bb\n\nThe study does not prove that habitually staying up late is bad for your health \u2014 although a growing amount of research indicates sleep patterns can affect health \u2014 only that there appears to be an association between greater health risks and being a night owl.\n\nAs Kim told LiveScience.com, while a person\u2019s wake-sleep cycle is affected by genetics, age, sex and sleeping environment, it can be modified by things like light, exercise and eating behavior.\n\nTo help move your body clock to an earlier bedtime, Kim suggested that night owls limit exposure to lights late at night and take melatonin, a natural chemical that helps people sleep.\n\nPhoto: hopshomemade/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\n\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "People who regularly stay up late have an increased risk of diabetes and other health problems, no matter how much sleep they eventually get.", "title": "Your Night Owl Habits Could Be Ruining Your Health", "url": "http://blog.aarp.org/2015/04/03/night-owls-at-higher-risk-for-diabetes-health-problems/", "creator": "@aarp", "site": "@aarp", "card": "summary"}, "estimated_publish_date": "2015-04-03", "Last-Modified": "2015-05-29EDT17:17:00", "keywords": "bulletin today, health talk, belly fat, blood pressure, candy sagon, cholesterol, diabetes, early risers, hdl cholesterol, insomnia, metabolism, morning people, night owls, research, sleep, stroke, study", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "false", "livefyreId": "350138:http://blog.aarp.org/2015/04/03/night-owls-at-higher-risk-for-diabetes-health-problems", "title": "Night Owls at Higher Risk for Diabetes, Health Problems", "comments": "on", "sponsorship": "on", "source": "aarp_washington_office", "description": "This could be caused by poorer sleep quality and engaging in unhealthy behaviors like smoking, late-night eating and a sedentary lifestyle.", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "Division:AARP.org", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpAdUnit": "Bulletin-Today", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/AARP"}, "pluckId": "http://www.aarp.org/vendor/blog/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "If you\u2019re middle-aged and a night owl, you\u2019re at a much higher risk for diabetes and other health problems than your early-riser friends \u2014 even if you\u2019re getting the same amount of sleep as they are.
