More than 74,000 residents have registered for insurance since 2010, according to the report.\n\nHealth Insurance Coverage in Connecticut:\n\nObamacare reduced the adult uninsured rate by 28.50 percent between 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe uninsured rate for whites is 50.92 percent lower than that for blacks.\n\nThe uninsured rate for whites is 72.00 percent lower than that for Hispanics.\n\nThe uninsured rate for higher-income households is 60.98 percent lower than that for lower-income households.\n\nThe rate of publicly insured is 31.77 percent.\n\nThe rate of privately insured is 68.23 percent.\n\nThe rate of employer-based health insurance coverage decreased by -3.50 percent between 2010 and 2014.\n\nThe uninsured rate pre-Obamacare was 9.09 percent and has fallen to a current rate of 6.93 percent, with 74,734 persons gaining health insurance coverage.\n\n\n\nFor the full WalletHub report click here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Bethel, CT Patch", "description": "The WalletHub study still shows that whites in Connecticut are much more likely to be insured than blacks or Hispanics.", "title": "Obamacare: CT Has 7th Lowest Uninsured Rate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/22817504/2015/11/T800x600/2015115647e46aa740d.png", "url": "http://patch.com/connecticut/bethel/obamacare-ct-has-7th-lowest-uninsured-rate-0", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Community Corner", "published_time": "2015-11-14T20:16:40-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-14T20:48:34-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Bethel, CT - The WalletHub study still shows that whites in Connecticut are much more likely to be insured than blacks or Hispanics.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The uninsured rate pre-Obamacare was 9.09 percent and has fallen to a current rate of 6.93 percent, with 74,734 persons gaining health insurance coverage.\nHealth Insurance Coverage in Connecticut:Obamacare reduced the adult uninsured rate by 28.50 percent between 2010 and 2014.\nThe uninsured rate for higher-income households is 60.98 percent lower than that for lower-income households.\nWhen it comes to having the most uninsured residents, Massachusetts was No.\nThe rate of employer-based health insurance coverage decreased by -3.50 percent between 2010 and 2014."}
