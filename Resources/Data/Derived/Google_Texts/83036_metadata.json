Other people (mostly men) wish they could maintain their raspy voice all day long. There\u2019s a reason why the voice we go to sleep with is markedly different from the one we wake up with. Actually, there are a couple of reasons for this common and temporary phenomenon. There are also easy ways to remedy a deep voice in the morning if you\u2019re not a fan of sounding like Bill Clinton when you wake up.\n\n\u201cMorning voice,\u201d or the deeper voice we all experience after getting up in the morning, is not to be confused with hoarseness, which tends to be a common symptom caused by a problem with the vocal cords or an inflamed larynx. According to the Cleveland Clinic, hoarseness can be caused by the common cold, upper respiratory tract infection, smoking, allergies, voice abuse, and gastroesophageal reflux or acid reflux \u2014 when stomach acid makes its way up the swallowing tube and irritates the vocal cords.\n\nA deeper voice in the morning is an inevitable result of a good night\u2019s rest. During sleep, the tissues in our throat collect fluid, which is also what causes our eyes to look puffy when we just wake up. Our lack of vocal cord use during the night also causes mucus to build up during the hours we spend asleep. People who breathe through their mouth during sleep quickly dry out their vocal cords. This lack of lubrication hinders our vocal cords from moving together, which creates the normal or higher pitch of our voice.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, \u2018morning voice\u2019 is caused by fluid collecting in the tissues of our throat and mucus building up overnight,\u201d Susan Berkley, author of Speak To Influence: How To Unlock The Hidden Power Of Your Voice, told Medical Daily. \u201cMouth breathing is more of a secondary cause. Acid reflux, which refers to stomach acid leaking back up the esophagus, can also result in the raspier voice we tend to wake up with. Eating a big meal before bed or a spicy meal can exasperate this problem. Sleep with your head elevated is one strategy for avoiding a raspy voice in the morning.\u201d\n\nIf you are one of the people who would rather not have their voice heard first thing in the morning, you are in luck. It doesn\u2019t take long to alleviate your raspy morning breath. Berkley suggests starting each morning out with two glasses of room temperature water complimented by a squeeze of lemon. This should be done before your morning coffee and tea, which can actually make your throat even drier. Next, while the warm and moist air from your morning shower relaxes your throat muscles, practice humming to \u201cwake up\u201d your voice.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "deeper, voice, in, the, morning", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A deeper voice in the morning is inevitable and caused by multiple factors that occur during the hours we spend asleep.", "title": "Why Your Voice Is Deeper In The Morning", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/raspy-voice-morning-heres-why-your-voice-changes-day-goes-318248", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/morning-voice.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A deeper voice in the morning is inevitable and caused by multiple factors that occur during the hours we spend asleep.", "title": "Why Your Voice Is Deeper In The Morning", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/raspy-voice-morning-heres-why-your-voice-changes-day-goes-318248", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/morning-voice.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/morning-voice.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-19T10:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-19T10:00:02-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A deeper voice in the morning is inevitable and caused by multiple factors that occur during the hours we spend asleep."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe27bc\"", "article_summary": "Other people (mostly men) wish they could maintain their raspy voice all day long.\nA deeper voice in the morning is an inevitable result of a good night\u2019s rest.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to alleviate your raspy morning breath.\nFor many people, a deeper voice in the morning is just one of the many reasons to avoid human contact before you\u2019ve had time to get ready for the day ahead.\n\u201cMorning voice,\u201d or the deeper voice we all experience after getting up in the morning, is not to be confused with hoarseness, which tends to be a common symptom caused by a problem with the vocal cords or an inflamed larynx."}
