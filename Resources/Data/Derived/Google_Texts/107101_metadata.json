But it may yet flex its muscle in state politics.\n\nWhile Bama and 75 other Football Bowl Subdivision teams played postseason games this season, the University of Alabama-Birmingham was one of only a few bowl-eligible teams that went uninvited. That\u2019s largely because of UAB President Ray Watts\u2019 recent decision to end the football, bowling and rifle teams at the university after the 2014-15 school year.\n\nWatts said the choice was financially motivated, but critics claim pressure from the Tuscaloosa sect of the University of Alabama System\u2019s Board of Trustees might have been the biggest factor.\n\nThe board previously nixed a 30,000-seat on-campus stadium for UAB (the team has played at aging Legion Field) and the hiring of Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher. Now the prevailing theory is the board pushed for elimination of the football program entirely, a theory Watts denied.\n\n\u201cLet me make it very clear: the board of trustees had no role in the strategic plan,\u201d Watts told reporters in November.\n\nBirmingham-area lawmaker Rep. Jack Williams, R-Vestavia Hills, says he will push a bill in the 2015 legislative session that would require UAB to play football, although a state political expert predicts the Legislature will punt.\n\n\u201cThere are many, many people \u2014 the overwhelming majority in this community \u2014 that think the City of Birmingham, Jefferson County, the metropolitan area is a richer place because of having an amenity such as UAB and UAB football, and having the college experience that provides for college students,\u201d Williams said at his news conference.\n\nWilliam Stewart, professor emeritus of political science at UA, thinks it\u2019s likely an unwinnable fight, perhaps on par with UAB defeating Alabama on the football field.\n\n\u201cI personally think that the University of Alabama has enough power to prevent legislation requiring a particular institution in its system from doing anything related to athletics that it doesn\u2019t want to do,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "UAB may yet flex its muscle in state politics.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "UAB may yet flex its muscle in state politics.", "title": "Lawmaker Wants to Pass Law Requiring Local University to Have a Football Team", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/image19.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-15T00:08:06+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DVbTKo"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "UAB may yet flex its muscle in state politics.", "title": "Lawmaker Wants to Pass Law Requiring Local University to Have a Football Team", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/image19.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "politics", "published_time": "2015-01-15T03:01:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T00:08:06+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "University of Alabama-Birmingham Football, University of Alabama, University of Alabama-Birmingham,UAB, college football"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d05\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s largely because of UAB President Ray Watts\u2019 recent decision to end the football, bowling and rifle teams at the university after the 2014-15 school year.\nNow the prevailing theory is the board pushed for elimination of the football program entirely, a theory Watts denied.\nWhile Bama and 75 other Football Bowl Subdivision teams played postseason games this season, the University of Alabama-Birmingham was one of only a few bowl-eligible teams that went uninvited.\n\u201cLet me make it very clear: the board of trustees had no role in the strategic plan,\u201d Watts told reporters in November.\nWilliam Stewart, professor emeritus of political science at UA, thinks it\u2019s likely an unwinnable fight, perhaps on par with UAB defeating Alabama on the football field."}
