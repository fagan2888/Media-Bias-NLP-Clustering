ET and is rerun on Fox Business and Fox News Channel throughout the weekend) is titled \"Be Reasonable.\"\n\nIt includes segments on some of the dodgier aspects of life in contemporary America (half of us believe in ghosts) and also one on how Reason magazine changed Stossel's journalism:\n\nTwenty years ago, I wasn't so rational. When neither liberal nor conservative publications made much sense to me, I discovered the libertarian magazine \"Reason,\" which is skeptical of both the left and right. Reason editors Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch (host of \"The Independents\") say libertarians are more rational than others.\n\nTune in tonight to check out the whole show. Details here.\n\nFollow along on Twitter, using the hashtags #STOSSEL and #Reason during the show.
