On Friday, however, he responded to one thing Trump keeps touting in his campaign, ABC News reports.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s pretty darn great right now,\u201d Obama told reporters.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s #SOTU: America is already great https://t.co/26mHhnlgYR by @OKnox pic.twitter.com/m15xmpEliN \u2014 Yahoo Politics (@YahooPolitics) January 13, 2016\n\nThe president is celebrating a stronger economy with a report demonstrating an increase in jobs. Obama said this proved that Republicans\u2019 \u201cdoomsday rhetoric\u201d more than a \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s comments expressed a need to set things straight with GOP critics following the jobs report.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect that these facts and this evidence will convince some of the politicians out there to change their doomsday rhetoric, talking about how terrible America is, but the American people should be proud of what they have achieved because this speaks to their resilience, innovation risk taking and grit,\u201d Obama said.\n\nA new Gallup poll reveals that Obama\u2019s approval rating is at 51 percent one day after the Republican debate in Detroit took place. Three of the candidates \u2014 Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Sen. Marco Rubio \u2014 spent more time arguing than addressing the issues presented. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio had a good night, addressing the issues and making the case that he\u2019s the most mature candidate among his rivals.\n\nAccording to the new Labor Department report, it showed employers added 242,000 workers in February. Obama saw this as a great opportunity to lash out at skeptics.\n\n\u201cOur businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that job-killing Obamacare bill,\u201d Obama said, referencing Republicans who skewer the health care bill they despise.\n\nObama avoided dropping Donald Trump\u2019s name in his remarks but made clear he\u2019s following the GOP presidential campaign.\n\nThe president said he looks forward to \u201cforcefully\u201d changing the discussion to a debate over investing in education and infrastructure and increasing wages, \u201cnot fantasy, not name-calling.\u201d\n\nTrump has resorted to vicious name-calling in the Republican campaign. His oft-repeated reference to Sen. Rubio as \u201clittle Marco\u201d and Sen. Cruz as \u201clying Ted Cruz\u201d has been a new turn in political in-fighting not ever before seen on a world stage. Even the size of hands and other body parts has played a role in this mud-slinging campaign that has become embarrassing for the country. The Republican party is suffering with Donald Trump as the front-runner. It\u2019s gotten so desperate for the party that Mitt Romney has come out and openly insulted Trump\u2019s run for the White House, implying he\u2019s the one who\u2019s a con-artist in an effort to sway votes away from him. It\u2019s not a favorable position for the party to be in if they want to win the 2016 presidency.\n\nFor his part, Obama doesn\u2019t see the doomsday position Republicans claim the nation is in. He views many as being pessimistic and unhinged in their policies.\n\nPresident Obama is certain to say something to nullify Trump, to the effect that America is great already #SOTU pic.twitter.com/iwU9ffugH2 \u2014 Doug Kempf (@dougkempf) January 13, 2016\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge gap between the rhetoric that\u2019s going on out there and the reality of success that we\u2019re seeing in America\u2019s economy even as we acknowledge that there\u2019s more work that can be done,\u201d Obama added.\n\nMarket Watch reports that the same report President Obama is celebrating also indicates that average hourly earnings declined.\n\nWrites one of its reports out on March 4, 2016, \u201cWages typically rise 3% to 4% a year when the economy is at full throttle, but they have been stuck in a 2% range for the past six years.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s comment that \u201cAmerica\u2019s is pretty darn great right now\u201d was meant to defy Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign slogan. Voters would argue it depends on what data you look at and the overall state of our country.\n\n[Photo by Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP]", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama's latest jab at Donald Trump was one directly aimed at the GOP presidential candidate's slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\" While Trump retains", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "President Obama\u2019s latest jab at Donald Trump was one directly aimed at the GOP presidential candidate\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d While Trump retains", "title": "President Obama\u2019s Latest Jab At Donald Trump: \u2018America\u2019s Pretty Darn Great Right Now\u2019", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2857886/president-obamas-latest-jab-at-donald-trump-americas-pretty-darn-great-right-now/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AP_940646756191-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-05T14:43:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T15:51:00+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AP_940646756191-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2016-03-05T14:43:47+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "barack obama,donald trump,obama america great,obama trump,president obama,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AP_940646756191-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama\u2019s latest jab at Donald Trump was one directly aimed at the GOP presidential candidate\u2019s slogan, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d While Trump retains"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Three of the candidates \u2014 Donald Trump, Sen.
