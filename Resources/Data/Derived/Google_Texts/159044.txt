BEND, Ore. -

A masked robber – possibly wearing a walking cast on one foot -- held up a northwest Bend gas station/convenience store early Tuesday and fled, eluding a search of the area, police said as they turned to the public for leads.

Officers responded shortly after 3 a.m. to the reported robbery at the College Way Chevron at 1400 NW College Way, said Sgt. Elizabeth Lawrence.

Employees told police they were inside the store when a lone male approached the counter and demanded money while keeping his right hand inside the pocket of his hoodie sweatshirt, Lawrence said.

The robber took an undisclosed amount of cash and fled on foot. A perimeter was set around the store and a Bend police K-9 team was deployed to search the area.

Lawrence said later the suspect had not been identified or located “as search efforts were exhausted.” The store workers were unhurt, she added.

The suspect was described as a white male adult, 5-foot-9 to 5-11 and 170 pounds, about 25 to 30 years of age. He was wearing a black mask covering his face, a black hooded sweatshirt, black pants and black gloves. The witnesses also said he wore one white tennis shoe and possibly a black soft walking cast or boot on his right foot.

Anyone with information that could help in the investigation was asked to contact Bend police at 541-693-6911.
