On Wednesday, the hosts of The Cycle on MSNBC mocked Republican alternatives to ObamaCare. When Toure read a quote from Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) saying he wants to replace the ACA with a more patient-centric plan, Josh Barro of The New York Times wondered, “what does that mean,” and added that “it can mean whatever the listener wants it to mean.”

Later in the discussion, Toure and Kystal Ball sarcastically threw out words to dismiss GOP alternatives to the current health care law. Ball shouted, “patient centric!...cheaper!...flexible!” Taking a cue from his fellow host, Toure cried, “yay!...freedom!...no more tyranny!” Barro rejected other conservative ideas, like selling insurance across state lines and tort reform, as insignificant solutions.

Barro delved deeper into why he felt Republican alternatives to ObamaCare would struggle to gain traction among voters:

Often, the way Republicans would prefer to do that would be even more expensive. For example, they’d like to move people off Medicaid on to private insurance. Private insurance costs more than Medicaid. So, you’d have to come up with extra money. Alternatively, you could have a plan that’s cheaper because it doesn't cover as many people and then you have to explain whose coverage you’re gonna take away.

Barro’s point was that the greater the specificity of a plan, the more likely it would be to alienate some voters: “So, either way, once you get specific, saying replace ObamaCare is less popular then when you just sort of generically say replace ObamaCare with something that’s better than ObamaCare.”

The Republicans – while it is true that they have yet to unite around a single plan – have produced several different specific alternatives to ObamaCare. However, the narrative has persisted that the GOP lacks any clear health care plan.
