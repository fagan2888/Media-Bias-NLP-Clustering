The photos show a cut on her inner lip and bruises on her arm. They have been deleted, but screenshots circulated Thursday on social media.\n\nCrowder played four years at Duke and tied the Atlantic Coast Conference record with 283 career receptions before he was drafted by Washington.\n\nThe team said it has been in touch with the NFL office \"and will continue to follow proper league protocol and assist them in any way we can to gather all of the facts.\"\n\nA call to Crowder's representative wasn't immediately returned.\n\nKammie Michael, a spokeswoman for the police department in Durham County, North Carolina, said her department has no record of any complaints against Crowder. His name also does not appear in the North Carolina court system's statewide online records.\n\nThe NFL said in a statement that it has been contacted by the team and is \"looking into the matter.'\"\n\nUnder a revised personal conduct policy that went into effect during 2014, the NFL suspends players without pay for a minimum of six games for violations involving assault, battery, domestic violence, dating violence, child abuse, other forms of family violence, or sexual assault, with consideration given to possible mitigating or aggravating circumstances.\n\nCopyright Associated Press / NBC4 Washington", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Washington Redskins say they are investigating what they called \"an off-field situation'\" involving fourth-round draft pick Jamison Crowder.
