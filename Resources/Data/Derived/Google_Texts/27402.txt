Sioux Falls, SD

Great Bear Recreation Park welcomed pros and amateurs alike to its third annual Adaptive Ski event February 28.

The event aims to make the enjoyment of downhill skiing accessible to everyone by catering to people with various impairments or disabilities.

More than 30 people from South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota applied to participate in this year's day-long outing. Each received an hour of private instruction, adaptive rental equipment, a lift ticket, and lunch, all free of cost.

Adaptive Program Director Rob Flannery says the event has been so successful, Great Bear intends to expand it season-long.

"Our hope is to transition into more of a sustainable program that runs every sunday next ski season so people that are in the area can come out and maybe progress through their skiing and really take hold of the sport," Flannery said.

The event was made possible by sponsor groups and the hard work of more than 50 volunteers, assistants, and instructors. Donors included the Alpine Society, IMED Mobility, Orthotic & Prosthetic Specialties, Inc., the VA, and Sanford.
