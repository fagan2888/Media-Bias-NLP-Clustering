Prosecutors wanted to send him to prison for 20 years, but a judge decided to give him no jail time at all after an expert witness for the defense testified that the defendant was suffering from \u201caffluenza.\u201d\n\nThis affliction, the psychologist testified, was a product of the defendant having spent his life in the lap of luxury. Having his parents\u2019 cash between himself and reality had left the killer of four of his neighbors unable to make the connection between his decisions \u2013 such as his decision to drive a two-ton truck down a residential street at 70 miles per hour while drunk out of his mind \u2013 and the potential consequences of those decisions.\n\nIn short, the defense team argued, their client was depraved because he wasn\u2019t deprived.\n\nThis argument seems to have worked on the judge, who sentenced the defendant to 10 years of probation after his wealthy family offered to pay for their son\u2019s confinement in a $450,000-per-year in-patient facility, where apparently young scions are therapeutically guided toward the insight that randomly slaughtering your fellow citizens as a predictable consequence of your own selfishness and stupidity is a bad thing to do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forget affluenza.
