After spending four months in a coma, completely non-responsive, a Tennessee woman awoke to learn she had already given birth to her son.

Sharista Giles, 20, was 26 weeks pregnant when she got in a car accident that sent her into a coma. Fearing for the lives of both Giles and her unborn baby, doctors performed an emergency cesarean section on the 1-pound, 14-ounce infant. Despite carrying only a 10 percent chance of survival, Giles emerged from her coma on Wednesday, acknowledging her father and seeing a picture of her son, who now weighs over 6 pounds.

"The doctors were telling us there was nothing else they could do," said Sharista’s mother, Beverly Giles, to ABC News. "They already gave up hope. We never gave up. She's fought this hard."

Giles’s family set up a GoFundMe campaign and a Facebook page to offer emotional support and help finance the young mother’s medical bills. Both mother and son are still recovering separately in the hospital, with Baby L — the temporary name given to the boy, until his mother can give him a proper name — still in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

Giles will get to see her son once doctors release him from the NICU. Her family says she already can’t get enough of her baby boy.

"[Her father] showed her a picture of her baby, and she followed the picture," Beverly Giles told ABC News. "When he turned around to put it back on the bulletin board, she turned her neck, her whole head trying to follow and find the picture again."
