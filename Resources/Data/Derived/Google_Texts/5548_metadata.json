The prevailing silence was unsettling because it sat in stark contrast to the chirping of the 5,000 fans during training camp. There were no fights. No pushing. No shoving. And little talking, save for San Francisco linebacker NaVorro Bowman accusing an official of a hometown call on a juggling reception by Denver\u2019s Cody Latimer.\n\nWith one play, Darian Stewart returned the cacophony to the Broncos sideline by intercepting a pass by the 49ers\u2019 Colin Kaepernick. Denver\u2019s defense boasts 12 sacks this preseason, and with tempered optimism, general manager John Elway said it is the most talented defense since he arrived in 2011.\n\nWATCH: Nick Ferguson: Broncos current defense can be as good as Orange Crush\n\nInterestingly, there is only one prominent new starter: Stewart. The conclusion remains easy to draw: Wade Phillips\u2019 3-4 defense fits the personnel better, and Stewart\u2019s addition fortified a secondary that aims to be the NFL\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\nSigned as a free agent from Baltimore, Stewart took hold of the free safety position in the spring and has only tightened his grip over the past month as the Broncos face the 49ers on Saturday in their preseason home debut.\n\n\u201cStewart has done a really good job, he\u2019s learned the defense, he really plays well,\u201d defensive coordinator Wade Phillips said. \u201cHe plays fast in the games. I like that about him.\u201d\n\nStewart struggled with inconsistency in Baltimore last season, losing his job at one point. However, he played his best game in the Ravens\u2019 playoff upset of the Steelers. Stewart replaced Rahim Moore, who signed with Houston as a free agent. They couldn\u2019t be more different. Stewart is softspoken. Moore is an energetic run-on sentence. Stewart seeks contact. Moore plays a deep center field.\n\nStewart\u2019s skill set makes him interchangeable with strong safety T.J. Ward, varying the defensive looks.\n\n\u201cThe defense is just pretty much straight forward. That has helped,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI am believing what I am seeing. Playing with T.J. helps. You know you can count on him. He has your back. \u201c\n\nA stout 5-foot-11, 214 pounds, Stewart has made three tackles in 42 snaps in the first two exhibition games. With two new starters last season, the secondary required time to gain trust, finally coalescing in November. The communication has improved dramatically this season, helped by Stewart\u2019s quick learning curve.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very smart and calm back there. That\u2019s what I like about him,\u201d Ward said. \u201cYou never really see him flustered, you never really see him out of position.\u201d\n\nPerformance and maintenance carry equal importance to Stewart. Playing at altitude and in a dry climate, leg issues are prevalent. Stewart has worked extensively on his flexibility.\n\n\u201cEvery off day I find something to keep my body right, whether that\u2019s stretching or massage,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd it helps that Coach (Gary) Kubiak takes care of his players like he does. You are already seeing the results.\u201d\n\nThrough two games, the first-string defense has not allowed a touchdown. There are reasons to believe, Stewart insisted, that this is a preview not just another preseason mirage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just coach Wade. He challenges us. Everyone\u2019s job is to get to the ball,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cWhen you have 11 guys with good speed, doing that, good things are going to continue to happen.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
