Because someone somewhere decided that that\u2019s what America needs right now.\n\nWhat we didn\u2019t know at the time was how adult it was going to be. C\u2019mon.\n\n[B]old as this creative decision was\u2014and executed quite successfully, too\u2014it\u2019s jarring, at best. At worst, it\u2019s a bastardization. This is a world where Fozzie knows what Grindr is. Where Kermit\u2019s new girlfriend (more on that later) makes sexual innuendos. Where Zoot is an alcoholic and there are jokes about Miss Piggy\u2019s pubic hair. Wocka wocka!\u2026 Every \u201cgrown up\u201d plot point, whether a work woe or a relationship drama, makes perfect sense in the greater Muppet universe. It\u2019s just that some of us don\u2019t want to live in a universe where Fozzie Bear knows what kind of fetish he would be on a gay sex hookup app.\n\nYou can get a taste of the humor in the clips below. When Kimmel asks Kermit how old his new girlfriend is, the reply comes back: \u201cOld enough.\u201d You\u2019ll never enjoy \u201cRainbow Connection\u201d again.\n\nThe problem with the show isn\u2019t that it won\u2019t be funny \u2014 the Kimmel clip is amusing as a parody of celebrity break-ups and famewhoring \u2014 but that there\u2019s just no way any of us will feel good watching it. Right? Give me a scenario where Miss Piggy makes a joke about getting waxed and somehow afterward you don\u2019t end up staring into a dimly lit bathroom mirror wondering why you ever stopped drinking. For every American over the age of, say, 35, this will be relentlessly traumatic. Which is not to say it\u2019ll do poorly in the ratings: Nothing attracts a crowd like a car crash.\n\nAmericans under 35 will love it, though, I bet. Exit question: When will Obama make his first cameo? Probably next spring to coincide with open enrollment for ObamaCare, I\u2019m thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Yeesh.", "title": "This new Muppet show is going to be a train wreck, isn\u2019t it?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/22/this-new-muppet-show-is-going-to-be-a-train-wreck-isnt-it/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-23T02:01:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T20:45:15+00:00"}, "keywords": "ABC, kermit, kimmel, muppets, piggy,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Wocka wocka!\u2026 Every \u201cgrown up\u201d plot point, whether a work woe or a relationship drama, makes perfect sense in the greater Muppet universe.\nThis new Muppet show is going to be a train wreck, isn\u2019t it?\nWhat we didn\u2019t know at the time was how adult it was going to be.\nWhen Kimmel asks Kermit how old his new girlfriend is, the reply comes back: \u201cOld enough.\u201d You\u2019ll never enjoy \u201cRainbow Connection\u201d again.\nWhich is not to say it\u2019ll do poorly in the ratings: Nothing attracts a crowd like a car crash."}
