Governor Rick Scott speaks to Florida news outlet WPBF.com (Screenshot)

Florida governor Rick Scott on Tuesday defended an attack ad targeting a local citizen who called him an asshole.

Scott told local news outlet WPBF that the video attacking former Lake Worth City Commissioner Cara Jennings was meant to “set the record straight.”

“You know, I talk to people every day as I travel the state,” he added.

Jennings publicly shamed Scott at a Starbucks in Gainesville last week. “You cut Medicaid so I couldn’t get Obamacare,” Jennings yelled at the Republican governor. “You’re an asshole. You don’t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.”

Video of the incident quickly became a viral Internet sensation.

In response, Scott’s political action committee published a video describing Jennings as a “latte liberal” and a “terribly rude woman.”

Jennings told WPBF that her choice of words “wasn’t the clearest one.”

“I think it would have been better if I had called him a polluter, or a criminal, or a murderer. I think that would have been more fitting,” she remarked.
