The office penthouse atop Nashville\u2019s 31-story Fifth Third Center gave members of the Senate Republican Caucus a fabulous view of the city.\n\nCaucus members assembled there Dec. 10 to celebrate the electoral victories of the previous month and to lay the groundwork for the 2015 legislative session convening a month later. The holidays were ahead and the mood was festive.\n\nToward the end, the caucus chairman, Sen. Bill Ketron of Murfreesboro, spoke to his colleagues about the American Legislative Exchange Council\u2019s annual \u201cpolicy summit\u201d in Washington, which he and six fellow senators attended the previous week. He said 22 Tennessee legislators attended the ALEC conference, which Ketron said was the most from any state.\n\nALEC is a conservative policy organization promoting \u201climited government, free markets, federalism\u201d and whose membership includes state lawmakers and corporate representatives from across the country. With Republicans in full control of 30 state legislatures, ALEC now rivals the centrist, nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures in attendance at its meetings.\n\nAnd intense criticism has accompanied that rise in power. Several national groups, from centrist to liberal, including the public interest group Common Cause, have attacked ALEC\u2019s blend of ideology, corporate partnership and attempts to pass legislation of its own.\n\n\u201cThey make their decisions based on politics and contributions rather than on best practices or best solutions to problems,\u201d Tennessee State Rep. Joe Armstrong, D-Knoxville, said when he quit ALEC three years ago. \u201cTheir agenda has become very self-serving and very partisan ... It\u2019s extremist.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Media and Democracy runs a website called \u201cALEC Exposed,\u201d that details criticism of the group.\n\nAdvice from Gingrich\n\nAt the Nashville meeting, Ketron told his caucus colleagues that former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke to several of the ALEC attendees about the GOP victories of 2014 and how to sustain them. \u201cNewt asked us to come back and challenge each and every one of you: We can\u2019t continue doing business the way we\u2019re doing it. Newt said that we\u2019re still conducting and running government the way we did in the \u201860s and \u201870s. We can\u2019t continue building brick and mortar and expanding the size of government. We\u2019ve got to be thinking smart and how do we compress it down.\u201d\n\nKetron also said that Tennesseans were front and center at the ALEC conference. \u201cWe\u2019re doing things right in Tennessee and they\u2019re looking at us. From bills to anything we\u2019re doing in Tennessee, they want to follow us.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as Republicans have enlarged their majorities in the Tennessee General Assembly, ALEC has become more ingrained in the culture of the legislature and its legislation. Eighteen Tennessee lawmakers billed just over $53,000 to taxpayers to attend ALEC conferences in 2014, not counting lawmakers who traveled on ALEC \u201cscholarships\u201d or other means, according expense records on the legislature\u2019s website.\n\nKetron, known to most Tennesseans for shepherding the wine-in-grocery-stores bill to passage last year, attended three ALEC meetings in 2014: a spring \u201ctask force\u201d in Kansas City, the main annual meeting in Dallas last summer, and the policy summit in Washington on Dec. 2-6.\n\nALEC is one of several national and regional organizations whose meetings are attended by Tennessee lawmakers. Others include the NCSL, Council of State Governments, Southern Legislative Council and the National Black Caucus of State Legislators.\n\nLittle need to lobby\n\nUnlike national groups like Americans For Prosperity that seek to influence state laws and policy from the outside of statehouse chambers through lobbying and political pressure, ALEC doesn\u2019t need to: Its members are the lawmakers themselves \u2014 and thus far more effective. It\u2019s not surprising that conservative legislators flock to its conferences and support its goals, just as black lawmakers attend NBCSL meetings.\n\nAside from conservative advocacy, another big difference between ALEC and other legislative groups is its membership of business and trade association executives, whose corporations largely fund ALEC. Corporate representatives are fully integrated into its structure, as voting members of its various policy \u201ctask forces\u201d alongside its legislative members.\n\nALEC\u2019s \u201cprivate enterprise advisory council\u201d helps govern the organization, along with a board of directors of 30 lawmakers. The council includes executives from Koch Companies, Exxon Mobil, State Farm, Pfizer, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the tobacco giant Altria, AT&T, National Federation of Independent Business, the alcoholic beverage giant Diageo, United Parcel Service, the for-profit online school company K-12 Inc., and the American Bail Coalition, representing the bail bond industry.\n\nALEC doesn\u2019t run political advertising or contribute to legislators\u2019 campaigns, but its corporate members do.\n\nFar more importantly, lawmakers bring home ideas, model bills and research from ALEC developed by its committees, task forces , \u201cALEC scholars\u201d and the corporate and foundation advisers that help support ALEC. One of its four \u201cBoard of Scholars\u201d members, for example, is economist-consultant Arthur Laffer of Murfreesboro, who championed tax cuts and supply-side economics as an adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Laffer, who has testified before Tennessee legislative committees, issues reports for ALEC that legislators cite as research for passing bills.\n\nWhen the Tennessee legislature approved a bill in 2011 allowing for-profit online \u201cvirtual schools\u201d to operate in Tennessee and receive the state\u2019s share of public school funding on the same per-pupil basis as regular schools for every student they enroll, it was through a model bill from ALEC \u2014 much of it word for word with parts tailored to Tennessee.\n\nVirginia-based K-12 Inc. lobbied for the bill. Almost immediately after passage, the company contracted with the small, rural Union County school district to open Tennessee Virtual Academy to students statewide. After four years of low performance on the state\u2019s standardized tests, the state Department of Education has ordered the school to close in June. A lawsuit is pending.\n\nDespite K-12 Inc.\u2019s presence on the ALEC advisory council and a phalanx of lobbyists it hired, the company failed to win legislative approval in April of a bill giving the school another year to raise its scores substantially. Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s office and Senate Education Committee Chairman Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, an original supporter of the school, worked to defeat the bill,\n\nHow to repeal Obamacare\n\nOne of ALEC\u2019s major nationwide initiatives has been successful in Tennessee: opposing implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act at the state level.\n\nALEC produced the \u201cState Legislators Guide to Repealing Obamacare,\u201d with \u201c14 specific recommendations to push back against Obamacare\u201d (including \u201cDecline to enforce ObamaCare\u2019s \u2018consumer protections\u2019 if such enforcement authority does not already exist in your state\u201d) and \u201c18 ALEC model bills that make health care more secure, affordable and accessible.\u201d\n\nThose include allowing consumers to buy health insurance across state lines and a \u201cHealth Care Freedom Act.\u201d Similar bills have been filed in Tennessee.\n\nState Rep. Curry Todd, R-Collierville, who is on ALEC\u2019s 30-member board of directors, said that despite its opposition to Obamacare, \u201cALEC was not involved\u201d in the successful effort to defeat Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, an alternative Medicaid expansion plan funded through the Affordable Care Act that would make coverage available to up to 280,000 uninsured working Tennesseans.\n\n\u201cThere were some groups that were involved with ALEC that were active in it but ... as far as ALEC coming down here and lobbying things, they haven\u2019t. They\u2019ve gotten a bad rap from some of the left-wing groups, which is unfortunate.\n\n\u201cOverall, we develop policy up there. Each individual member can take that policy and present it to their legislature and tailor it to their particular state. I\u2019m not aware of any ALEC legislation per se but some members may have taken some ideas\u201d home to present, Todd said.\n\nOne of ALEC\u2019s anti-Obamacare model bills calls for requiring legislative approval for expansion of Medicaid, blocking action solely by the governor. Tennessee lawmakers approved such a bill in 2014 sponsored by Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown. Although lawmakers would have to approve any Medicaid expansion through the state budget anyway, the 2014 bill was the precursor to this year\u2019s rejection of Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee.\n\nTennessee legislators in April approved a school voucher program for special needs children, giving parents of students with individualized education plans the state share of their per-pupil funding to help pay for private schools and private service providers.\n\nLarge parts of Senate Bill 27, the Individualized Education Act sponsored by Gresham and Rep. Debra Moody, R-Covington, resemble the ALEC model \u201cSpecial Needs Scholarship Program Act.\u201d\n\nTodd said the IEP model bill passed after he asked its supporters to narrow eligibility for the vouchers to children with the most severe disabilities, reducing the amount of money transferred from public schools to private providers.\n\n\u201cThe IEP bill is a good bill for kids with disabilities. It gives parents the right (to go elsewhere) if their kids are not getting the kinds of services they need,\u201d Todd said.\n\nPolicy differences\n\nIn 2012, two Tennessee Democrats, Armstrong and Rep. David Shepard of Dickson, resigned from ALEC over its policies. Armstrong said at the time that he was alienated by ALEC\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act despite years of advocating a \u201cnational solution\u201d to health care problems, and its support for bills requiring government-issued photo IDs for voting, which he called \u201cvoter suppression\u201d by targeting the elderly and minority voting rights.\n\nArmstrong also took exception to ALEC\u2019s backing of \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws in states including Tennessee and Florida, which broadens self-defense statues to allow the use of deadly force in more situations. It got national attention after the killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nThose and other issues led several of its corporate members to leave ALEC about that time. Since then, it has sought to move away from \u201csocial issues\u201d and focus on economic issues.\n\nBut Armstrong said last week\u2019s that he\u2019s not convinced. \u201cALEC is so much different from the other legislative organizations, like the Council of State governments and the NCSL. No one else had corporate members with full voting rights sitting on their policy committees. We thought they were going in the wrong direction and we felt ALEC was being controlled by outside interests and not legislators. That\u2019s the reason that I resigned from ALEC.\u201d\n\nArmstrong said that ALEC\u2019s influence is through the members themselves. \u201cAnd these companies that have lobbying interests: if they\u2019re able to make the policy through ALEC\u2019s committees and task forces and legislators take those policies back to statehouses across the country, that gives them a strong lobbying influence.\u201d\n\nAbout this series\n\nOut-of-state interests have long sought to influence public policy in Tennessee, but the scope of those efforts has grown to encompass millions of dollars in spending on political campaigns and the lobbying of those who are elected \u2014 with decidedly mixed results.\n\nCollaborating as the Tennessee News Network, Tennessee\u2019s four largest news organizations \u2014 The Commercial Appeal, The Tennessean, The Knoxville News Sentinel and The Chattanooga Times Free Press \u2014 produced this four-part series examining the influence.\n\nOther stories in the series include: Overview | Education | Guns | Americans For Prosperity", "article_metadata": {"title": "Outside Influence: ALEC's lawmaker members provide unique avenue to policy", "og": {"url": "http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/government/state/outside-influence-alecs-lawmaker-members-provide-unique-avenue-to-policy-ep-1064568889-324405851.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/alec_project1_17688114_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 456}, "type": "article", "description": "The conservative American Legislative Exchange Council doesn't lobby state legislators.
