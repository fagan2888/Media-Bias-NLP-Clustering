BOSTON (AP) — Thousands of people are braving rain, snow and wind to pay their final respects to former Boston Mayor Tom Menino, who died Thursday at the age of 71.

The mourners include Secretary of State John Kerry, Gov. Deval Patrick and Menino’s successor, Mayor Marty Walsh.

The majority of those standing in line Sunday were the ordinary Bostonians whose lives Menino touched during his more than 20 years in office, from former City Hall staffers to one man who recalled Menino presenting his young son a mathematics award.

Menino was the longest-serving mayor in Boston history.

He was diagnosed with cancer in February, shortly after leaving office. He announced Oct. 23 he was suspending treatment and a book tour to spend more time with family and friends.

Menino’s funeral is Monday.
