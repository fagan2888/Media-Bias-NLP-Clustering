Scott Walker, a Republican, said Thursday that President Barack Obama has helped the conservative movement expand during the past seven years.\n\nSince Obama took office in 2009, Walker noted, the number of Democratic governors across the United States has fallen from 28 to 18.\n\n\u201cThe only nice thing I can say about this president is he\u2019s been an incredible recruiter for conservative candidates,\u201d Walker said during the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor near Washington, D.C.\n\nHe cited Matt Bevin\u2019s unlikely win in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial race in November as evidence that the grassroots conservative movement has gained momentum under the Obama administration.\n\nBevin\u2019s defeat of Jack Conway, Kentucky\u2019s former Democratic attorney general, made him the state\u2019s third Republican governor since World War II and one of 31 GOP governors who currently hold office across the United States.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we see that kind of change is because Americans are looking for leadership that counters the failed policies of Barack Obama,\u201d Walker said.\n\nRepublicans also have seen their party grow in state legislatures. Since 2009, Walker said, roughly 1,000 new GOP lawmakers have been elected to state legislatures throughout the nation.\n\nWalker noted that 27 state legislatures were controlled entirely by Democrats when Obama took office, and eight were evenly split between the parties.\n\nToday, Democrats control 11 state legislatures. Eight remain split.\n\n\u201cThe conservative movement is alive and well in states all across America,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhy? Because our policies are working.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin governor pointed to Indiana Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s success in bringing the unemployment rate down to the lowest it has been since March 2011. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, meanwhile, has added 30,000 state residents to the workforce who previously were on welfare.\n\n\u201cPositive, commonsense, conservative reforms work on economic policy, they work on fiscal policy, they work on social policy,\u201d Walker said.\n\nRunning through Saturday, CPAC offers conservatives across the country an opportunity to gather with fellow activists and leaders for speeches, panels, exhibits, and other activities at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, just outside Washington, D.C.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama's \"been an incredible recruiter for conservative candidates.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama's \"been an incredible recruiter for conservative candidates.\"", "title": "Scott Walker: Obama Helped Conservatives Thrive", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160303_ScottWalker_Johnson1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-05T16:42:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/219HORb"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama's \"been an incredible recruiter for conservative candidates.\"", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160303_ScottWalker_Johnson1.jpg"}, "title": "Scott Walker: Obama Helped Conservatives Thrive", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "president", "published_time": "2016-03-03T10:54:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-05T16:42:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Scott Walker, Barack Obama, CPAC, Conservative Political Action Conference, Matt Bevin, Nikki Haley, Mike Pence, state legislature"}, "article_summary": "Scott Walker, a Republican, said Thursday that President Barack Obama has helped the conservative movement expand during the past seven years.\n\u201cPositive, commonsense, conservative reforms work on economic policy, they work on fiscal policy, they work on social policy,\u201d Walker said.\n\u201cThe reason why we see that kind of change is because Americans are looking for leadership that counters the failed policies of Barack Obama,\u201d Walker said.\nHe cited Matt Bevin\u2019s unlikely win in Kentucky\u2019s gubernatorial race in November as evidence that the grassroots conservative movement has gained momentum under the Obama administration.\nWalker noted that 27 state legislatures were controlled entirely by Democrats when Obama took office, and eight were evenly split between the parties."}
