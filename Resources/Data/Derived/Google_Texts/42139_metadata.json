Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he was not interested in serving as a justice on the Supreme Court Friday, telling a radio host that he had opportunities in the past \u201cto go to the bench,\u201d but that it was \u201cnot a desire of my heart.\u201d\n\nThe comments came during an interview with WBAP-AM host Chris Salcedo.\n\n\u201cEverybody mentions your name, a lot of people do, and the Supreme Court,\u201d Salcedo told Cruz. \u201dFrankly, all the times I\u2019ve interviewed you, I\u2019ve never asked if you have any aspirations or felt called if asked to serve on the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nThe host asked, \u201cI mean, I know you have the sharp intelligence to handle the job. But is it even something you even consider?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, Chris, I\u2019ll tell you. That is not a desire of my heart,\u201d Cruz replied.\n\n\u201cI have had several opportunities in the past to go to the bench, and I certainly deeply respect the job the justices do,\u201d the Texas senator added. \u201cBut I think our country is in crisis. And I think we need a strong conservative president who will appoint not just one, but two, three, four, five Supreme Court justices who are principled constitutionalists.\u201d\n\nCruz said he was \u201ccommitted to the fight of ensuring\u201d strong constitutionalists get placed on the court, but argued there are many other things he\u2019d like to influence.\n\n\u201cI believe that I can do a great more good fighting across the political spectrum because we also need leadership to repeal every word of Obamacare, to pass a flat-tax and abolish the IRS, to protect religious liberty and stop the federal government form violating our First Amendment rights and to stand with our friends and allies, especially the nation of Israel,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s name has been floated as a possible pick to replace the late Antonin Scalia. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, said he would \u201cthink about\u201d placing Cruz on the court earlier this year if he were to be elected president.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook:\n\nFollow @oliverdarcy\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Sen.
