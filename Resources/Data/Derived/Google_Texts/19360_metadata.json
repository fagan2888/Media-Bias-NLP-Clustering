Here is a look on who the Zaydis are:\n\n\u2014 Zaydis are a small branch of Shiite Islam, and the community is almost entirely located in Yemen. It is distinct from the \u201cTwelvers,\u201d Shiite Islam\u2019s largest branch, predominant in Lebanon, Iraq and Iran. Zaydis are estimated to make up at least 30 percent of Yemen\u2019s population of nearly 30 million people, and around 8 percent of the 70 million Shiites around the world.\n\n\u2014 Zaydi is considered to be the closest Shiite branch in doctrine to Sunni Islam. It is named after Zayd, the great-grandson of Imam Ali, whose descendants Shiites believe were the true leaders of Islam, or \u201cimams,\u201d after the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nTwelver Shiites, for example, trace a line of 12 imams, including Ali and his descendants. They believe the 12th imam vanished and one day will return as the messiah-like figure the Mahdi. Zaydis reject this doctrine and believe that anyone descending from the house of Ali is eligible for the Imamate.\n\n\u2014 The closeness of Zaydism to Sunni Islam is one reason sectarian differences in modern Yemen have rarely been strong. Zaydis are deeply integrated into the country\u2019s power structure, military and government. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, for example, was a Zaydi, but during his rule he often struck alliances with Sunni conservatives and he fought the Houthi rebels.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A look at Zaydi Shiites and Houthi rebels in Yemen", "title": "A look at Zaydi Shiites and Houthi rebels in Yemen", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A look at Zaydi Shiites and Houthi rebels in Yemen", "title": "A look at Zaydi Shiites and Houthi rebels in Yemen", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/04/a_look_at_zaydi_shiites_and_houthi_rebels_in_yemen/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/mideast-muslim-jewish-holidays-photo-gallery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A look at Zaydi Shiites and Houthi rebels in Yemen", "title": "A look at Zaydi Shiites and Houthi rebels in Yemen", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/mideast-muslim-jewish-holidays-photo-gallery.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7b5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsSANAA, Yemen (AP) \u2014 The Shiite rebels who seized Yemen\u2019s capital of Sanaa, known as the Houthis, are followers of the Zaydi branch of Shiite Islam.\nHere is a look on who the Zaydis are:\u2014 Zaydis are a small branch of Shiite Islam, and the community is almost entirely located in Yemen.\n\u2014 The closeness of Zaydism to Sunni Islam is one reason sectarian differences in modern Yemen have rarely been strong.\n\u2014 Zaydi is considered to be the closest Shiite branch in doctrine to Sunni Islam.\nFormer President Ali Abdullah Saleh, for example, was a Zaydi, but during his rule he often struck alliances with Sunni conservatives and he fought the Houthi rebels."}
