Not surprising is that there was not a whole lot of coverage from our mainstream media.\n\nNonetheless, just as with preceding Popes who have in similar fashion reminded people of the inherent moral worth of every person, Pope Francis is acutely aware of what is happening across the entire globe, and what seems to be the abandonment of our humanity on so many levels.\n\nIn this article, the Pope included the breakdown of the family unit and how this leads to the devaluation of the human person, and as such, the lack of regard we have for our vulnerable. From the article, Pope Francis: A society that fails to protect young and old \u2018has no future\u2019:\n\n\u201cThe family understood in this way remains the first and principle building block of society and of an economy on a human scale,\u201d he said. He added that the \u201cconsequences\u201d of family policy and breakdown \u201ctouch upon the various areas of the life of a society and a country.\u201d\n\nCleary, our culture is in a crisis on many levels. The Pope and so many other leading experts have argued that the deterioration of the family unit is playing a major role in this crisis, particularly when it comes to the defense of the sacredness of life.\n\nThe millions of people who have been deliberately killed in a relatively short period of time in our human existence is beyond all belief. If not for the tireless work of so many people and organizations fighting for life, especially against abortion, the numbers would be even worse, if one can even begin to comprehend that.\n\nAnd although the numbers may not compare to how many abortions take place on a daily basis on a global scale, I think people would be shocked if we were somehow able to track the number of people who are being euthanized on a daily basis. When you take into account the tens of thousands of health care facilities, hospitals, nursing homes, and hospices, which exist in just our nation, one can image the number of people falling victim to a culture that is more concerned about making a profit than protecting our medically vulnerable.\n\nNow with food and water (via a feeding tube) defined as medical treatment in all 50 states, removing it from the cognitively disabled, the elderly and others, is both legal and relatively easy depending upon which state one lives.\n\nIn fact, according to a report issued by the NRLC Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics in 2005, the laws of all but ten states may allow doctors and hospitals to disregard advance directives when they call for treatment, food, or fluids. I wonder just how many people are aware that physicians and ethics committees are now in the position to make these kinds of decisions \u2013 to remove food and water even if the person has expressed the desire to have this provided for them. And this is happening now, before Obamacare has become part of the day-to-day routine.\n\nFortunately, the Catholic Church does not view food and water, via feeding tube, as \u201cmedical treatment\u201d or artificial life support/extraordinary care. Sadly however, the Church seems to be a lone voice on this issue for those who need food and water to live.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nIn March 2004, Pope John Paul II clarified church teaching on this issue and said the feeding tubes that administer food and water are to be viewed as basic and ordinary care. The pope went on to say that if the person is not dying and can assimilate food and hydration via a feeding tube, then there is a moral obligation to continue to provide this care to the individual.\n\nMay we continue to pray for Pope Francis for his continued strength, and also for those in Catholic leadership, who remain silent, that they will find the courage to speak out against our culture\u2019s greatest evil; the deliberate taking of human life.\n\nThese prayers are especially needed here in the US with Obamacare taking over our health care system lead by an administration that has no regard for the value and dignity of our medically vulnerable, putting even more of our innocent in the cross hairs of their anti-life agenda.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope Francis: Societies That Don't Care for Elderly, Children \"Have No Future\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Recently, in an address to Catholics who came to Turin, Italy for the 47th annual Social Service Week, Pope Francis said the following, \u201cA population that doe", "title": "Pope Francis: Societies That Don\u2019t Care for Elderly, Children \u201cHave No Future\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2013/09/18/pope-francis-societies-that-dont-care-for-elderly-children-have-no-future/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/popefrancis11b-190x106.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "pope,francis,elderly,children,bobby schindler,future", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9205\"", "article_summary": "Fortunately, the Catholic Church does not view food and water, via feeding tube, as \u201cmedical treatment\u201d or artificial life support/extraordinary care.\nNonetheless, just as with preceding Popes who have in similar fashion reminded people of the inherent moral worth of every person, Pope Francis is acutely aware of what is happening across the entire globe, and what seems to be the abandonment of our humanity on so many levels.\nSadly however, the Church seems to be a lone voice on this issue for those who need food and water to live.\nIn this article, the Pope included the breakdown of the family unit and how this leads to the devaluation of the human person, and as such, the lack of regard we have for our vulnerable.\nIn March 2004, Pope John Paul II clarified church teaching on this issue and said the feeding tubes that administer food and water are to be viewed as basic and ordinary care."}
