The media\u2019s overuse of the term \u201cmigrants\u201d rather than people with names and identities continues to deliberately dehumanise people\u2014many of whom have a legal right to claim asylum.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nDavies\u2019 comments run parallel to David Cameron disgracefully branding those trying to enter the U.K. as \u201ca swarm\u201d and right-wing UKIP leader Nigel Farage also demanding British troops are drafted to Calais. With his spurious claims that it\u2019s \u2018\u2019only a matter of time before a British holidaymaker dies at the hands of the crisis,\u201d it\u2019s unlikely Farage meant to infer British lives matter more than the eight people who died this year taking ever-greater risks to enter the U.K.\u2014but that\u2019s how it sounded.\n\nEarlier in July, another mind-blowing display of ignorance from Immigration Minister James Brokenshire saw him inform the House of Lords that the majority risking their lives on the Mediterranean Sea are \u201ceconomic migrants \u2013 who are not fleeing persecution but are seeking a better life.\u2019\u2019 It was a truly startling statement considering the largest numbers of migrants are from Syria and Eritrea, two of the world\u2019s major refugee producing countries.\n\nChildren, pregnant women, and those fleeing for their lives are housed in fortress-like conditions in Calais. A short Guardian documentary (embedded below) made in 2014 reveals the true horror of the makeshift camps, which have no sanitation or running water. Many migrants make daily desperate attempts to escape, known as \u2018\u2019trying,\u2019\u2019 that involve sneaking on board vehicles and hitching rides to escape the misery.\n\nFew in power seem to have sufficient humanity to put themselves in the position of the migrants\u2014and pulling up the drawbridge is just one element of an increasingly inhumane reaction to a diabolical situation. The reactions of European leaders together with increasing swaths of the public appear to be nothing more than figuring out how to keep people out rather than how to help them.\n\nWe may think it\u2019s just the corridors of Whitehall and the media who are guilty of dehumanisation, but it\u2019s not. One only has to glance at the comment threads of articles in the press to see the fruits of the propaganda and scaremongering. Some commenters claim \u201cit\u2019s time for violence\u201d while calling for the use of water cannons and machine guns in the tunnel.\n\nDespite some rational thinking from Lib Dem leader, Tim Farron, who expressed concern that a humanitarian issue is being treated as a security one, the focus remains on the symptoms instead of the disease.\n\nIn a world where governments start, fund and back wars, then yell at those displaced as a result, do not be too disheartened\u2013after all, Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to do \u201ceverything he can\u201d to stop peoples\u2019 holidays being disrupted by the chaos.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One conservative MP stated believes \"migrants should be shipped to \u2018\u2019humane camps\u201d and that the U.K must cut benefits while \u201cpeople are put back in a kind and humane fashion.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Michaela Whitton | AntiMedia", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "One conservative MP stated believes \"migrants should be shipped to \u2018\u2019humane camps\u201d and that the U.K must cut benefits while \u201cpeople are put back in a kind and humane fashion.\u201d", "title": "UK Politicians Call For Army To Round Up Migrants And Put Them In Camps", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/uk-politicians-call-for-army-to-round-up-migrants-and-put-them-in-camps/208187/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Britain-Royal-Baby_Muha1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-31T13:12:55-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One conservative MP stated believes \"migrants should be shipped to \u2018\u2019humane camps\u201d and that the U.K must cut benefits while \u201cpeople are put back in a kind and humane fashion.\u201d", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Britain-Royal-Baby_Muha1.jpg", "title": "UK Politicians Call For Army To Round Up Migrants And Put Them In Camps", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "United Kingdom", "published_time": "2015-08-01T05:00:33-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-31T13:12:55-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "A short Guardian documentary (embedded below) made in 2014 reveals the true horror of the makeshift camps, which have no sanitation or running water.\nMany migrants make daily desperate attempts to escape, known as \u2018\u2019trying,\u2019\u2019 that involve sneaking on board vehicles and hitching rides to escape the misery.\nThe media\u2019s overuse of the term \u201cmigrants\u201d rather than people with names and identities continues to deliberately dehumanise people\u2014many of whom have a legal right to claim asylum.\nWe may think it\u2019s just the corridors of Whitehall and the media who are guilty of dehumanisation, but it\u2019s not.\nSome commenters claim \u201cit\u2019s time for violence\u201d while calling for the use of water cannons and machine guns in the tunnel."}
