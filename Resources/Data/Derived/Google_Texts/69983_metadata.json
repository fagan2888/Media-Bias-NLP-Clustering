Nonprofit group Friends of the Urban Forest is coming to the neighborhood (as well as to West Portal) to do a planting on August 1st. Applications are due June 24th, so if you\u2019ve been wanting to add a little green to your home or business, you\u2019ve still got about a week and a half to get one in.\n\nBen Carlson, who handles FUF's public relations, said the city still has a lot of untapped urban forest potential. \u201cWe think about half of [the] eligible spots in San Francisco have yet to be planted,\u201d he said. To be eligible, a sidewalk needs to have four feet of unobstructed space after a tree is planted, to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Trees must also steer clear of underground utilities, \"but there are plenty of unplanted spots that meet this criterion,\u201d noted Carlson.\n\nCurrently, 13.7 percent of San Francisco is covered by trees. That places the city near the bottom in a ranking of major U.S. cities\u2019 canopy coverage (it's currently 17th; Atlanta is first). To make matters worse, dying trees are outpacing new plantings. \u201cTrees, like people, die,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cAnd trees are being planted right now, but they\u2019re not replacing trees that are dying. So not only is our urban forest small, but it\u2019s shrinking.\u201d\n\nSan Francisco without (many) trees.

FUF is working to reverse this, collaborating with city agencies to devise an Urban Forest Plan to grow and fund the city\u2019s trees. It may include a ballot measure in 2016. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re working hard to do\u2014and we want property owners to know this\u2014is to get the city to take over responsibility for maintenance,\u201d Carlson said.\n\nTrees bring many benefits, including pollution reduction, greenhouse gas and storm runoff capture, noise absorption, bird habitats, lower crime, and even reduced driving speeds. Carlson also cited research showing that trees increase property values and time and money spent by shoppers in retail districts, which FUF cites when trying to persuade property owners and businesses to plant trees.\n\nCarlson said that while the drought hasn\u2019t affected FUF\u2019s planting frequency, it has affected tree mortality. \u201cTrees have been suffering because they\u2019re not getting enough water, and young trees have been suffering because the property owners aren't providing the recommended care. So we\u2019re really trying to frequently remind our tree recipients about the importance of watering.\u201d FUF's suggestions for water-wise tree care include evening watering to reduce evaporation, spreading water-retaining mulch, and using gator bags\u2014green vinyl bags that can be installed at the base of a tree to slowly release water into the soil.\n\nA gator bag on a FUF tree on 4th Avenue.

It\u2019s hit-and-miss. And the trees just make it look more inviting. There are a lot more birds outside of my window because of the trees, which is pleasing.\u201d\n\nFUF collects applications until they reach critical mass for a planting session in a neighborhood, usually at around 30 trees. If you sign up for a FUF tree, they\u2019ll take care of the preparation, which includes assessing and cutting the sidewalk, planting, and assisting with the follow-up care for the first three years, when trees need the most TLC. They also make tree species recommendations based on the neighborhood's climate and soil. Property owners pay a co-pay (typically $135) that covers about 25-30 percent of the tree's cost, and FUF picks up the rest.\n\nA FUF tree outside 9th Avenue's location of Nopalito. Photo: Caitlin Harrington/Hoodline\n\n\n\nSwitzer thinks the co-pay helps create a responsible mindset. \u201cI've found that when people pay [$135], which doesn\u2019t even cover [the tree's] cost, then they feel like they have a little ownership in it.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a renter who wants a tree, you can identify yourself as the tree's caretaker and fill out the downloadable forms\u2014but you\u2019ll also have to get your building\u2019s owner to sign them. Owners can also fill out and sign forms electronically.\n\nThe Inner Sunset ranks fairly high on canopy coverage relative to other neighborhoods, at 20.5 percent. (The highest, after Golden Gate Park and the Presidio, is Seacliff, with 29.3 percent coverage.) Still, lots of eligible space remains. Carlson mentioned the nearby Outer Sunset is among the least-covered neighborhoods, at 5 percent. He attributes the lack of trees to the more challenging climate and soil, a preference for parking spots, and cultural resistance from much of the neighborhood's sizable Asian population, due to the perception that trees can be bad feng shui.\n\nThe volunteer list for FUF's August 1st Inner Sunset planting is already full, but alternatives abound if you want to get your hands dirty. Volunteer opportunities around the city include plantings, tree-care outings, advocacy, and neighborhood outreach.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Friends of the Urban Forest/Flickr\n\nAfter each planting, volunteers and FUF staff meet for a picnic, often at one of the property owners' homes. \u201cWe make a tree planting easy, we make it affordable, and we make it fun,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cWe talk about how important it is to having a sense of community, when you meet up with your neighbors and plant trees in your neighborhood.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://assets.hoodline.com/assets/favicon/browserconfig-80c1823db2ad79011177211337cf8e5648470f95db18762e49d7af6e1c9dee6d.xml", "hoodline": {"neighborhood": "Inner Sunset", "env": "production"}, "description": "Residents have until June 24th to apply for a tree from the arboreal nonprofit.", "title": "Friends Of The Urban Forest Heads To The Inner Sunset | Hoodline", "og": {"site_name": "Hoodline", "description": "Residents have until June 24th to apply for a tree from the arboreal nonprofit.", "title": "Friends Of The Urban Forest Heads To The Inner Sunset | Hoodline", "url": "http://hoodline.com/2015/06/friends-of-the-urban-forest-heads-to-the-inner-sunset", "image": "https://hoodwork-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/story/image/9904/FUF_sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Residents have until June 24th to apply for a tree from the arboreal nonprofit.", "title": "Friends Of The Urban Forest Heads To The Inner Sunset | Hoodline", "url": "http://hoodline.com/2015/06/friends-of-the-urban-forest-heads-to-the-inner-sunset", "image": {"src": "https://hoodwork-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/story/image/9904/FUF_sign.jpg"}, "creator": "@caitharr", "site": "@hoodlineSF", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=814699998", "fb": {"app_id": 119795374731913}, "theme-color": "#ff3300", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://assets.hoodline.com/assets/favicon/mstile-144x144-a5d9ac240ecb5f088945b937339a44644ed7f26cc3189fd073689198b1e500cf.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "csrf-token": "UrGzGTzzh/WMzJFATnu56DclU28gpQZOa/warPTVZkFSvx9jvj97e7gj/ZS7yC+LDKHDD8M+f1XnBduAeBIixg=="}, "article_summary": "Photo: Friends of the Urban Forest/FlickrAfter each planting, volunteers and FUF staff meet for a picnic, often at one of the property owners' homes.\nNonprofit group Friends of the Urban Forest is coming to the neighborhood (as well as to West Portal) to do a planting on August 1st.\nBen Carlson, who handles FUF's public relations, said the city still has a lot of untapped urban forest potential.\n\u201cWe make a tree planting easy, we make it affordable, and we make it fun,\u201d Carlson said.\nFUF is working to reverse this, collaborating with city agencies to devise an Urban Forest Plan to grow and fund the city\u2019s trees."}
