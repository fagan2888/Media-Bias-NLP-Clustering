DENVER (CBS4) – At first glance, Colorado’s Thanksgivings are fairly bland, according to the folks at real estate website Estately.

They rank Colorado 25th among all U.S. states in their tongue-in-check and certainly not scientific Thanksgiving Misery Index, based on data culled from Facebook and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It measures holiday-related inevitabilities like drunk relatives, food poisoning, failures of favorite football teams and dinner devolving into an argument over politics. (Read their full methodology.)

But a closer inspection says Coloradans don’t really have that middling of a Thanksgiving. According to the site, we’re the sixth-most likely to bicker about politics and seventh-most likely to see our favorite NFL team lose on Thanksgiving. (What fun watching Peyton Manning get sacked must be against the backdrop of another discussion about Obamacare!)

We’re also the least enthusiastic about Black Friday sales, which is good or bad depending on your penchant for crowds.

By the way, Ohioans suffer through the most miserable Thanksgivings, while Hawaiians boast the best. Of course they do.
