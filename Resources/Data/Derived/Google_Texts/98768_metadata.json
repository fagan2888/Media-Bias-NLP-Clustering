Congress approved the program more than two decades ago to help clinics that serve impoverished, uninsured and at-risk populations to buy drugs at a cheaper rate.\n\nBut the program has come under fire in recent years, mostly by pharmaceutical companies that say the discounts are being used \u2014 and abused \u2014 by big hospital chains, rather than serving free-standing outpatient clinics that specialize in treating the uninsured.\n\nSavvy hospitals can buy up clinics that have such privileges built in, or move existing clinics from one parent hospital to another in order to get better drug prices, even if the patient population served by the clinic doesn\u2019t change and even though those populations usually have commercial or government insurance.\n\nUPMC spokeswoman Jennifer Yates said the accounting maneuver makes sense, financially.\n\n\u201cFor us, this was cost-saving measure\u201d that will save more than $10 million a year, she said. \u201cThis is something done industrywide, at hospitals across the country.\u201d That includes Highmark\u2019s Allegheny Health Network, which utilizes 340B discounts at West Penn Allegheny Cancer Institute, an outpatient clinic at Erie\u2019s Saint Vincent Hospital, and the Positive Health AIDS clinic at AGH.\n\nCancer and chemotherapeutic drugs are hugely expensive. In 2012, of the 12 new cancer treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 11 cost more than $100,000 for a year of treatment.\n\nThe savings that UPMC generates from its accounting changes, Ms. Yates said, would not necessarily be passed on to patients, but \u201cwill help us fund our reinvestment into research and cancer care.\u201d\n\nThat may be true, but that\u2019s not the original intent of the 340B program, said Rena M. Conti, assistant professor of health policy and economics at the University of Chicago.\n\nShe has been researching 340B use at oncology clinics (and other clinics that use high-priced injectable drugs), and she will be discussing that research this week in Washington, D.C., at a conference focused on overhauling 340B reform.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this all over. There appears to be an acceleration in affiliations\u201d between such clinics and institutions that have 340B discount privileges, Ms. Conti said.\n\nThe clinics and their affiliated hospitals cans save up to 50 percent off of the wholesale price of drugs. It\u2019s a major discount over the typical manufacturer\u2019s price and a substantial discount over the price a hospital or group-purchaser might pay.\n\nThe problem, Ms. Conti said, is that \u201cpatients and insures don\u2019t really share in the discount.\u201d\n\nHer research also shows when hospitals pair with clinics in order to spread their 340B buying privileges across a wider patient base, the affiliated clinics end up serving a more affluent, better insured population than the originating hospital.\n\nIn other words, the exact opposite effect of what the 340B program was created to do, Ms. Conti said. Instead of providing cheaper medicine to needy patients, \u201cThe entire purpose of the affiliation to is to gain access to the deep discounts that the program provides.\u201d\n\nHospitals say they need the discounts, particularly given intense cost pressures from insurers and the Affordable Care Act. Moreover, money saved on drugs at certain clinics \u2014 even if those clinics do not serve the poor \u2014 allows hospitals to spend more on charity and indigent care systemwide.\n\nFor UPMC rival Highmark, though, the shift looks to be less about drug costs than it is about the new outpatient designation.\n\nUPMC will be able to receive more money from insurer Highmark because different hospitals can command different prices, based on the type of patients and populations they see. Magee is a specialty women\u2019s hospital and thus can receive higher payments from Highmark, by way of the payment schedule that the two companies adhere to.\n\nThe shift represents another flare-up of a long-standing feud between the two health care giants. Highmark says that UPMC has for years been shifting procedures to Magee-Womens Hospital to secure higher reimbursements.\n\nHighmark is UPMC\u2019s largest non-government insurance partner, responsible for about 20 percent of UPMC\u2019s patient revenue.\n\nUPMC is \u201cchanneling orthopedic, bariatric and now medical oncology [treatments] to\u201d Magee, said Highmark spokesman Aaron Billger. \u201cIt\u2019s increasing the cost of care for consumers. ... It\u2019s millions of dollars more.\u201d\n\nBut UPMC says that such shifts are routine and happen at hospital systems everywhere. UPMC noted in the past that it had also shifted many procedures from more expensive hospitals to lower-reimbursement facilities, including the transfer of some open-heart and liver procedures from UPMC Presbyterian to UPMC Passavant, gynecology-oncology procedures from Magee to Passavant, and thoracic services from UPMC Shadyside to UPMC St. Margaret.\n\nThe paperwork shift also aggravates the ongoing rift between Highmark, the region\u2019s largest private insurer, and UPMC, its biggest hospital network, over cancer and oncology services. In April, Highmark announced that it would no longer be paying certain facility fee \u201cmarkups\u201d when it comes to cancer care provided in a hospital outpatient center, rather than in a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nMedicare rules allow health networks to claim much higher office reimbursement fees when services are provided in hospital outpatient clinic, rather than a physician\u2019s clinic.\n\nHighmark said the clinic markups \u2014 most of them coming from UPMC, the area\u2019s largest oncology provider \u2014 were costing the health insurer $200 million a year. UPMC called Highmark\u2019s refusal to pay those bills \u201can egregious contract violation.\u201d\n\nBill Toland: btoland@post-gazette.com or 412-263-2625.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UPMC\u2019s Hillman Cancer Center is based in Shadyside, but as of June 1, it\u2019s an outpatient clinic of Magee-Womens Hospital in Oakland.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "The sign on the door says UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, but as of June 1, the Shadyside cancer treatment facility became an outpatient clinic of Oakland\u2019s Magee-Womens Hospital.
