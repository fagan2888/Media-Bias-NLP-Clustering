Photo: AP\n\nNick Kyrgios's Wimbledon heroics have rocketed him past bad boy Bernard Tomic on the tennis rankings, but rather than leave him in his wake former Canberra professional Alun Jones believes Kyrgios could drag him back up.\n\nHaving beaten world No.1 Rafael Nadal to make the Wimbledon quarter-finals, Kyrgios will shoot up to about No.65 while Tomic will drop out of the top 100.\n\nOne star is on the rise, while the other is clearly fading.\n\nBut when Tomic was the same age as 19-year-old Kyrgios he was probably slightly ahead of the Canberra dynamo in every department except tournament wins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTomic was ranked 42, had won two Challenger titles and had impressive performances at the four grand slams.\n\nHe had made the quarter-finals of Wimbledon as an 18-year-old and had progressed to at least the second round of all four grand slam tournaments before he turned 20.\n\nKyrgios has won at three of the four and could add the US Open to the list next month.\n\nHe has also won four Challenger titles and a Futures crown.\n\nKyrgios's versatility is another string to his bow that Tomic lacks.\n\nAll of Tomic's titles have been on Australian hard courts, while Kyrgios has won on clay, grass and hard courts.\n\nHe's also won in Australia, the US, England and China.\n\nFormer world No.8 Mark Philippoussis said Kyrgios also had plenty of heart, something he thought Tomic lacked.\n\nTomic's fall from grace since he was a teenager has been stark, as the pitfalls of fast cars and partying took their toll on the 21-year-old.\n\nJones said Tomic had attracted a lot of negative publicity, but thought Kyrgios's emergence as our next great hope might take some of the spotlight and allow Tomic to refocus on his tennis.\n\nHe hoped it would allow two stars to emerge on the world stage.\n\n\"I think it will be good for Bernard, seeing someone younger than him, up-and-coming, come through and have such a good performance at Wimbledon,\" Jones said.\n\n\"He's had a lot of negative spotlight on him and I think Nick has taken a bit of that off him, which I think [Tomic] will enjoy.\n\n\"I still think Tomic has a lot of game and can still come back from where he is.\n\n\"It's exciting if he can get himself back, it's exciting having two young players with potential.\n\n\"I think Nick's a top 10 and I think Bernard can make his way up that way as well.\"\n\nJones had absolutely no concerns Kyrgios would struggle the same way Tomic has and backed Kyrgios's planned move back to Canberra to be closer to his tight-knit family.\n\nWhen Jones was on the world tour, he always wanted to visit his home town the few times he had the chance and said Todd Larkham, who will coach Kyrgios while he's in Canberra in the lead-up to the US Open, was the same.\n\nHe said Larkham knew the Kyrgios game from coaching him for seven years.\n\n\"I think it's a good move, he's pretty tight with his family and Todd Larkham's coached him for six or seven years so he knows Nick well, so I don't think it will be an issue,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Family keeps you grounded. If you're out there by yourself or in a different city you can easily get distracted, like we've seen with Bernard.\"\n\nHe also said there was a real buzz on the Canberra courts about the former Daramalan student's return. Youngsters were excited about the chance of seeing him practising on the local courts.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tennis, ACT Sport", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Canberra's Alun Jones believes Nick Kyrgios could drag Bernard Tomic back up the ATP rankings with him.&amp;#160;", "title": "Nick Kyrgios can help Bernard Tomic, says Alun Jones", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/nick-kyrgios-can-help-bernard-tomic-says-alun-jones-20140704-zsvy4.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/b/e/4/m/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsvy4.png/1404467971010.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/b/e/4/m/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.zsvy4.png/1404467971010.jpg"}, "description": "Canberra's Alun Jones believes Nick Kyrgios could drag Bernard Tomic back up the ATP rankings with him.&#160;", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nick Kyrgios can help Bernard Tomic, says Alun Jones"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Canberra's Alun Jones believes Nick Kyrgios could drag Bernard Tomic back up the ATP rankings with him.&#160;"}, "article_summary": "Bernard Tomic will soon be lower in the rankings than Nick Kyrgios.\n\"I still think Tomic has a lot of game and can still come back from where he is.\n\"He's had a lot of negative spotlight on him and I think Nick has taken a bit of that off him, which I think [Tomic] will enjoy.\n\"I think Nick's a top 10 and I think Bernard can make his way up that way as well.\"\nPhoto: APNick Kyrgios's Wimbledon heroics have rocketed him past bad boy Bernard Tomic on the tennis rankings, but rather than leave him in his wake former Canberra professional Alun Jones believes Kyrgios could drag him back up."}
