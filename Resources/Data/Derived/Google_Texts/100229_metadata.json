The 49-year-old woman told officers she woke up to find the man walking into her bedroom.\n\nSgt. Brian Sigman said the homeowner confronted him in her living room, at which time he was wielding a large samurai sword.\n\nThe woman thought the man was there to talk to her son, Sigman said. She went to contact her son, but he was still sleeping. When she went to tell the suspect her son was asleep, the suspect had left the residence with some of her property.\n\nPolice received numerous calls from neighbors who saw the suspect running through their backyards.\n\nThe homeowner woke her son, who armed himself with a large spear and chased the suspect, Sigman said.\n\nOfficers were unable to locate the suspect, but Sgt. Sigman said police likely know who he is, and he suffers from mental issues. Once located, the suspect faces a charge of aggravated burglary.\n\nSigman added that the suspect possibly knows the homeowner's son, that the two do Medieval reenactments.\n\nNo one was hurt in the ordeal. Anyone with information is asked to call police.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The incident happened around 8 a.m. Saturday in the 1800 block of South Hydraulic.", "language": "english", "author": "KAKE News", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-woman-wakes-to-sword-wielding-burglar-in-home-336655651.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/WPD-Wichita-Police-generic-car-4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The incident happened around 8 a.m. Saturday in the 1800 block of South Hydraulic.", "title": "Police: Wichita woman wakes to find sword-wielding burglar in home"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The incident happened around 8 a.m. Saturday in the 1800 block of South Hydraulic.", "title": "Police: Wichita woman wakes to find sword-wielding burglar in home", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Wichita-woman-wakes-to-sword-wielding-burglar-in-home-336655651.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/WPD-Wichita-Police-generic-car-4.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Police: Wichita woman wakes to find sword-wielding burglar in home", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Police Wichita woman wakes to, find swordwielding burglar in home"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1732\"", "article_summary": "Police say a woman woke up Saturday morning to find a sword-wielding burglar in her south Wichita home.\nThe woman thought the man was there to talk to her son, Sigman said.\nThe homeowner woke her son, who armed himself with a large spear and chased the suspect, Sigman said.\nThe 49-year-old woman told officers she woke up to find the man walking into her bedroom.\nWhen she went to tell the suspect her son was asleep, the suspect had left the residence with some of her property."}
