Bill Foster, D-Naperville, who runs unopposed in the Democratic primary.\n\nHerman White\n\nHerman White is a physicist who has worked at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia for 42 years.\n\nShould he win, the 11th Congressional District would have the distinction of putting two physicists on the ballot for the general election in November. Foster also is a physicist who formerly worked at Fermilab.\n\n\u201cI had one of my friends call me from Washington to tell me, \u2018We\u2019re biting at the bit to say we have two high-energy particle physicists running for Congress in the United States,\u2019 \u201d White said. \u201cI said, \u2018I hope that\u2019s the case.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHaving a scientist in Congress is an asset, White said, given the technical complexities involved in such issues as the Iranian nuclear deal. But he considers his community service more important in his prospective role as a congressman.\n\nWhite is a former member of the board of police and fire commissioners in the city of Naperville, where he lives, and of the board of directors of Edward Hospital. He is on the board of trustees at North Central College in Naperville, and he is the vice chair of the board for the Teachers Academy for Math and Science in Chicago.\n\nWhite believes his experience gives him practical insight on health care, education, student debt and public safety issues. He wants to see the federal budget passed on time, saying it would promote a serious discussion of how to balance spending with expenses.\n\nWhite supports changes and even repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but said repeal should only come after the government has something else in its place. He supports the prohibition of pre-existing condition exclusions in insurance policies.\n\n\u201cWe have to understand that we have something in place at the same time we repeal it, so we don\u2019t have people who one minute have health care and the next minute do not have health care,\u201d White said.\n\nNick Stella\n\nNick Stella of Darien is a cardiologist. He meets a lot of people, which Stella believes is an asset for Congress.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Kane County Chronicle", "og": {"url": "http://www.kcchronicle.com/2016/03/07/three-seek-republican-nomination-in-11th-congressional-district/aut510w/", "image": "http://www.kcchronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/kcpiq7w3zpny2e30nozlh8cgyi22sez", "site_name": "Kane County Chronicle", "description": "A physicist, a doctor and a DuPage County Board member have something in common: They are candidates in the Republican primary for the 11th Congressional District.", "title": "Three seek Republican nomination in 11th Congressional District"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kcchronicle", "image": "http://www.kcchronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/kcpiq7w3zpny2e30nozlh8cgyi22sez", "description": "A physicist, a doctor and a DuPage County Board member have something in common: They are candidates in the Republican primary for the 11th Congressional District.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Three seek Republican nomination in 11th Congressional District"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1089016044", "tout": {"article": {"id": "366a5702-26aa-4257-8ca1-bab2a41dba74"}}, "keywords": "#election2016, northaurora", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "A physicist, a doctor and a DuPage County Board member have something in common: They are candidates in the Republican primary for the 11th Congressional District.\nShould he win, the 11th Congressional District would have the distinction of putting two physicists on the ballot for the general election in November.\nWhite believes his experience gives him practical insight on health care, education, student debt and public safety issues.\nThe circuitous 11th District winds between Joliet to Aurora, taking in North Aurora and other towns.\nHerman WhiteHerman White is a physicist who has worked at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia for 42 years."}
