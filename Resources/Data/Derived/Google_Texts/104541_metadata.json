And the federal government \u2014 that leviathan in our lives that\u2019s bragging about only running a $500 billion deficit for 2014 \u2014 wants that three grand back.\n\n\u201cSince you are currently receiving VA benefits, we plan to withhold those benefits until the amount you were overpaid is recouped,\u201d the letter stated.\n\nSo, thanks to the federal government\u2019s own incompetence \u2014 it\u2019s not like Teson went to the office and robbed the till himself \u2014 his VA benefits are down to $6 a month.\n\nTeson doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s starving. He still has Social Security and his pension \u2013 his grown children are around if things get too tough for him and his wife of 67 years. Truth be told, he doesn\u2019t sound like he cares much one way or the other; he\u2019s 89 kyears old and he knows the score.\n\nBut $6 a month?\n\nThis is 2014. Five years ago, at the dawn of the Age of Obama, power-drunk Democrats decided to waste $800 billion \u2013 that\u2019s BILLION \u2014 on a 2009 stimulus that stimulated nothing. The next year progressives in the White HouseWhite House put up a half-billion taxpayer dollars in loan guarantees for a soon-to-be-bankrupt solar-powered con game called Solyndra (now all but forgotten in the Obama litany of corruption).\n\nAnd God only knows how many uncountable hundreds of millions have been spent on the disaster of Obamacare and all its works.\n\nBut this same government has no problem cutting an elderly man\u2019s benefits to $6 a month to get back $3,000 it gave him in the first place.\n\nIt\u2019s not just an insult to Teson, it\u2019s a disgrace to the rest of us \u2013 as this administration has been since one minute after noon on Jan. 20, 2009.\n\nBack in June 1944, a young sailor named Joe Teson could never have imagined his government would be paying him $6 a month in benefits for putting his life on the line for a country at war.\n\nIn 2014, it\u2019s just as hard to believe.\n\nCheck out the NYT report here.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A Navy veteran who braved German fire to land troops on the French coast on D-Day 70 years ago is taking a different kind of fire from his own Department of Veterans Affairs.
