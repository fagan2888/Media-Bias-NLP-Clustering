Monterey and San Benito counties together account for 62,000 of the state\u2019s nearly 2.6 million undocumented population, according to 2013 figures from the Public Policy Institute of California. In terms of sheer numbers, Los Angeles has the largest number of undocumented residents, at an estimated 814,000.\n\n\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition, said the county\u2019s vote sends \u201ca powerful signal that we can no longer exclude part of our community [from] our health care system.\u201d\n\n\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s landmark 2010 Affordable Care Act excluded undocumented immigrants from all publicly funded health care services, forcing many of them to wait it out until their health issues could no longer be ignored.\n\n\n\nThe exclusion prompted Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, to introduce a Health for All Bill last year, which would provide health care for all Californians regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\n\nTwo months ago, Gov. Jerry Brown budgeted $400,000 to provide health care for the state\u2019s undocumented children through Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people.\n\n\n\nLara\u2019s SB 10 bill, which will be taken up by the legislature next year, will allow all adults, including those who are undocumented, to enroll in Medi-Cal, provided they meet eligibility requirements.\n\n\n\nThat bill will also allow undocumented Californians to buy health insurance on the state\u2019s online exchange, Covered California, with their own money, provided the state succeeds in getting a federal waiver.\n\n\n\nThe Sept. 15 vote in Monterey County was the culmination of months of tireless work by the county-based non-profit membership organization Communities Organized for Relational Power in Action (COPA), said COPA leader Timothy McManus.\n\n\n\nCOPA leader Jack Herbig said that testimonials from a number of undocumented immigrants helped to persuade the County Health Department and the Board of Supervisors to vote for the pilot project.\n\nOne immigrant testified that she was constantly forced to have to decide whether to buy medication for one of her children or to put food on the table for her entire family.\n\n\n\nThe County Health Department is currently trying to determine which labs, pharmacies and health care outfits to fund to provide those specialty services.\n\n\n\nEven though the pilot project, designed to fill gaps in treatment provided by health care clinics, is set to end when the money runs out, health care advocates here are hoping the program will continue with other funding streams.\n\n\n\nBlue Shield Foundation has given the county $100,000 to administer the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "montereycounty, montreye, ACA, obamacare, undocumetedhealth, latinohealth,", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
