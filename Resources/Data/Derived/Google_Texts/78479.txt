The Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office is investigating an incident in which a driver was injured Saturday after one of his car windows shattered while he was driving and he later found what looked like a bullet inside the car.

The driver was traveling eastbound on East Arapahoe Road near South Potomac Street in Centennial when his driver-side window shattered as he was accelerating away from a stoplight, public information officer Julie Brooks said.

The driver was able to drive himself to the hospital.

“His dad later located what appeared to be a bullet inside the car,” Brooks said. “It appeared be a low-velocity glass break.”

The incident was reported to law enforcement around 11:10 a.m. Saturday, Brooks said.

The extent of the driver’s injuries was not immediately known. The investigation is ongoing, Brooks said.
