(Photo: Mike Tripp/The News Leader)Buy Photo\n\nROANOKE \u2014 Unionized store associates of Kroger may have reached an agreement after two days of negotiations.\n\nGoing on a strike may be off the table for Waynesboro and Staunton stores due to the deal, which is pending.\n\nThe tentative agreement includes higher pay, affordable health care and pension support for associates, a release said. No specifics were released on the agreement.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t release details of the latest offer publicly until all of our members have a chance to review it at the next meeting,\u201d said Rick Howell, a Kroger cashier who served on the union\u2019s bargaining team, in a release.\n\nUnion members are set to vote on the agreement June 8 in Roanoke.\n\nNegotiations were resumed after the Local 400 of the United Food & Commercial Workers, or UFCW, had voted to reject the company\u2019s previous offer and authorize a strike last week.\n\nWhat sparked the debate was when Kroger refused to provide its associates with paid sick days, and proposed to force all retired employees off the company-provided health care and onto Affordable Care Act exchanges funded by taxpayers, according to the Local 400 website.\n\nThe Waynesboro and Staunton stores are part of 41 Kroger stores that have been negotiating a contract with corporate officials for increased wages and benefits.\n\nThe tentative agreement affects 41 Kroger stores in the region stretching from Kingsport, Tennessee, to Harrisonburg. Approximately 3,000 of the affected associates are union members with Local 400 of the UFCW, a release said.\n\nFollow Laura Peters @peterslaura and @peterpants.
