Bernard Sanders\u2019 surprisingly strong candidacy for president has laid bare a sharp division within the Democratic coalition, pitting its activist base against the moderate-minded establishment.\n\nIt\u2019s a split Republicans \u2014 especially the ones focused on winning down-ballot races this fall \u2014 are now racing to exploit.\n\nThe GOP is betting that the ideological fight at the top of the Democratic ticket will filter down the ballot, exposing incumbents and establishment-favored candidates to thorny questions about their support \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of the self-described socialist and his polarizing agenda. The idea: Either candidates disavow support for the Vermont senator and alienate supposed progressive allies, or they embrace Sanders and suffer the consequences in November when Republicans tie them to politically problematic issues such as single-payer health care. In effect, it mirrors the approach Democrats have taken in recent presidential elections, when they have successfully tied Republican candidates to the sometimes damaging positions of their party's standard-bearer.\n\nThe strategy has special resonance now, after Sanders\u2019s unexpectedly strong second-place showing in the Iowa caucuses. And for a party whose candidates have been relentlessly pressed for months about Donald Trump, there\u2019s a palpable sense of relief and delight in giving Democrats a presidential headache of their own \u2014 one they hope lasts beyond even Sanders\u2019s White House bid.\n\n\"Socialism is a pretty hard sell to Americans who go to work and collect a paycheck,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s former chief of staff. \u201cRegardless of whether Sanders is the nominee or not, Democrats are going to be 'feeling the Bern' in an entirely different way when they try to explain this to voters next fall.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say they aren\u2019t worried, arguing Sanders \u2014 still a heavy underdog to win the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 is hardly the bogeyman that Trump is. But Republicans say there is ample evidence the conversation about Sanders and his agenda already has bubbled up into Democratic primaries.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, for instance, a debate last month among the three candidates seeking the Democratic nomination \u2014 former Rep. Joe Sestak, Braddock Mayor John Fetterman and onetime gubernatorial candidate Katie McGinty \u2014 veered into a topic that\u2019s become closely associated with Sanders\u2019s campaign: single-payer health care. The senator from Vermont has made overhauling the nation\u2019s health care system central to his campaign despite criticism from even some Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, that the plan is unfeasible and politically damaging in the general election. McGinty and Fetterman praised the concept of a single-payer system, though both said they wanted to preserve the existing system.\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, the presumed Democratic nominee for Senate, former Sen. Russ Feingold, has faced a flurry of questions recently about his former Senate colleague. At a January forum hosted by Marquette University Law School, Feingold \u2014 who has not endorsed for president \u2014 praised Sanders profusely.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an honorable person,\u201d Feingold said. \u201cHe\u2019s a committed progressive. I agree with him on many issues.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Bernie and I were holding out for an even stronger bill on the Affordable Care Act. We wanted a single-payer,\u201d he added, before catching himself. \u201cWe wanted an option, an option to opt in, a public option.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the former senator supports a single-payer approach, Feingold spokesman Michael Tyler said \"there can be an honest debate about how to achieve\" universal coverage. But the spokesman hastened to add that if Feingold were to win back his Senate seat, he does not plan to introduce single-payer legislation or push for its adoption.\n\n\"Right now, Russ is focused on increasing access to health care through the framework of the ACA,\" Tyler said.\n\nLinking Democratic candidates to both Sanders personally and his agenda \u2014 in particular his health care overhaul \u2014 is part of the GOP\u2019s formula. And it mirrors the plan of attack used by Democrats during Trump\u2019s rise to the top of the polls. For months, Democratic operatives have pushed Republican candidates whether they plan to support the New York billionaire should he become the party\u2019s presidential nominee. And every time he has said something controversial \u2014 such as his proposal to ban Muslim immigration to the United States \u2014 incumbents such as Sens. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio were asked if they agreed.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, are dismissive of the new strategy, believing that Sanders hasn\u2019t left as large an impression on the public as Trump or even Ted Cruz \u2013 and was much less likely to eventually win the nomination than either.\n\nEven if voters are paying close attention to the lawmaker from Vermont, they argue the conversation he\u2019s sparking is categorically different than the one Trump has started. Getting a question about single-payer, for instance, starts a conversation about improving access to health care \u2014 topics Democratic operatives say they are happy to discuss.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic nominees for president and our Senate candidates around the country are leading an important conversation about issues like college affordability, the wage gap and overall economic security for middle-class families,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee. \u201cBut Republican Senators and Senate candidates are being forced to answer for their toxic Presidential frontrunners, who have alienated moderate and swing voters by describing Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists and calling to ban all Muslims from entering the country. There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d\n\nThe best test case for the strategy might come in Wisconsin. Feingold \u2014 who before losing re-election in 2010 was considered one of the party\u2019s strongest voices in favor of the muscular brand of liberalism championed by Sanders \u2014 is a favorite target of Republicans because of his close ties to Sanders. An organization staffed by Feingold loyalists has backed Sanders before: In January 2015, before the Vermont Democrat started running for president, the group donated $1,000 to his campaign. The group, Progressives United, listed Sanders alongside Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as one of its \u201cchampions\u201d on its website.\n\nAny Sanders-related damage done to Feingold would come in the general election \u2014 he is running uncontested in the primary. But Senate Democrats have a handful of potentially competitive primaries this year, including in Pennsylvania, Florida, and \u2014 to a lesser extent \u2014 Ohio and Illinois. Sanders\u2019s popularity could present problems to the candidates running in those states, forcing some of them to choose between alienating his supporters in a primary and more moderate voters in a general election.\n\nRepublicans advise that in many of these cases, the questions about Sanders will happen naturally between sparring campaigns and an inquisitive media. In fact, according to some of the party\u2019s strategists, staying hands-off might be a better approach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you do anything very blatant yet,\u201d said one senior Republican strategist, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about party strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s more powerful if Democrats are fighting each other. So do it more behind the scenes, at least for now.\u201d\n\nContact Roarty at AlexRoarty@cqrollcall.com and follow him on Twitter at @Alex_Roarty.\n\nRelated: Russ Feingold Announces Senate Bid\n\nRoll Call Race Ratings Map: Ratings for Every House and Senate Race in 2016 Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
