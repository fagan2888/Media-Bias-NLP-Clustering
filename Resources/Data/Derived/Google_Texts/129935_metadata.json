REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4448026\n\nBarack Obama is ready to turn the page on the $1 trillion deficits that once defined his presidency. That\u2019s easy for him to say \u2014 he\u2019ll no longer be in office when everything blows up.\n\nYes, Monday\u2019s Congressional Budget Office report is consistent with his State of the Union assurances of \u201ca growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry and booming energy production.\u201d Especially shrinking deficits: the annual discrepancy between federal spending and revenues is projected to drop to $468 billion.\n\nWhile that\u2019s still a big number, it\u2019s the lowest of the Obama administration and amounts to only about two percent of the economy. Deficits peaked at $1.4 trillion.\n\nThat\u2019s the good news. The bad news is the deficit begins spiking again in 2017, the year Obama\u2019s successor will be sworn into office, before returning to $1 trillion a year in 2025.\n\nAll that red ink comes without another Great Recession, with the country\u2019s biggest wars supposedly ending, without any new big-ticket spending items.\n\nMedicaid spending will be double what it was when Obama took office, thanks in part to Obamacare. Spending on the health care exchanges, a mere $15 billion in 2014, will be just under $100 billion annually in only two years.\n\nBetween 2016 and 2025, the Obamacare Medicaid expansion will cost $920 billion and $1.1 trillion on health insurance subsidies. That\u2019s a rounding error away from $2 trillion.\n\nThink about that the next time you read a White House statement about \u201cdeficit-reducing health care reform.\u201d Obama has been pretending you can be Calvin Coolidge and Lyndon Johnson simultaneously for quite some time.\n\nThe CBO estimates 31 million people will still be uninsured.\n\nFederal spending on entitlements and interest payments on the debt will gobble up 100 percent of tax revenues by 2030, leaving deficits to pay for national defense and all the remaining discretionary spending.\n\nSome of this is due to projected higher interest rates, which if true will nearly quadruple interest payments on the debt by 2025. But health care accounts for a third of the total spending growth over the next ten years.\n\nIn 2013, Social Security paid out nine percent more than it received in noninterest income. That\u2019s expected to nearly double, averaging 17 percent over the next decade.\n\nBy 2039, the net federal debt will exceed the nation\u2019s economy. The gross debt already does.\n\nAll this should temper our enthusiasm for the short-term deficit reduction of the last couple years. The long-term fiscal picture still looks dire.\n\nThe baby boomers\u2019 retirement isn\u2019t Obama\u2019s fault. The fact that the major federal retirement programs are all still structured the way they were for the baby boomers\u2019 parents and grandparents is partly his fault. And the costs of Obamacare are almost entirely his fault (Congress deserves its share of the blame too).\n\nAfter six years of blaming George W. Bush for all the country\u2019s problems, Obama is ready to take credit for things getting better.\n\nBush dug a deeper hole for Obama than many conservatives are willing to admit. But by the standard Obama has set, he doesn\u2019t get to turn the page so quickly. We should judge his presidency by the size of the hole he digs for the next president.\n\nFrom the looks of things, that will be a hole big enough to fit trillions of dollars.\n\nW.
