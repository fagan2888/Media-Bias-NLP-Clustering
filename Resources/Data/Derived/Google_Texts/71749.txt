Wichita police are looking for two men who allegedly robbed another man early Saturday in a south Wichita hotel room.

The 61-year-old victim told arriving officers two men he knew entered his room at the unnamed hotel in the 4500 block of S Broadway with knives demanding his money, cigarettes and alcohol.

The alleged robbers left the room with the stolen items in an unknown direction. Police say the victim received minor injuries, but refused medical attention.
