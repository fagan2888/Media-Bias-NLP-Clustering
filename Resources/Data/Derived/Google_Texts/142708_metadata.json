What followed was a six-year odyssey, a constant exchange of emails and phone calls, discussions and agreements, prodding and pushing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two things you know about Ted: he\u2019s passionate and he\u2019s persistent,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cMost mornings when I get up, the first email I see is from him.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: NHL Winter Classic coming to D.C.\n\nLeonsis stood in front of a podium at Nationals Park on Tuesday and knew that in exactly 100 days, his idea would finally become reality. The sight behind him was one final confirmation. In the center of the baseball field, barriers and goalposts outlined the dimensions of a future hockey rink. The official logo of 2015 Winter Classic flashed on the jumbotron.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the city,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cThese events really are made for the fans, and our city deserves it. So it feels good to finally know that we\u2019re going to drop the puck New Year\u2019s Day \u2014 and we\u2019re just hoping for snow.\u201d\n\nNHL Commissioner Gary Bettman speaks during a press conference announcing the 2015 ... more >\n\nThe process of bringing the Winter Classic to Washington was a lengthy one. It took the joint effort of not only Leonsis and Bettman but also Major League Baseball, the Nationals and the city. Nationals principal owner Mark Lerner and general manager Mike Rizzo were on hand Tuesday, as was Mayor Vincent C. Gray. All parties involved seemed excited about the result.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty pumped about it,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cCommissioner Bettman always promised [Leonsis] we would get one, and he honored that commitment.\u201d\n\nBettman said the argument Leonsis made to him on Washington\u2019s behalf was pretty straightforward. The city has experience hosting major events. It has the aura of the nation\u2019s capital. It has a passionate, devoted and, perhaps most importantly, growing fanbase.\n\n\u201cAnd he pushed a little harder than that,\u201d Bettman said with a chuckle, \u201cbut that\u2019s it at 10,000 feet.\u201d\n\nThe event\u2019s presence in Washington says as much about the emergence of D.C. as a hockey town as anything else. \u201cThis game, if it\u2019s not already, will be sold out very quickly,\u201d Bettman said.\n\nCapitals captain Alex Ovechkin said he has seen tremendous growth in the team\u2019s fanbase since his arrival in 2005, both in numbers and enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cMy first year, I can do whatever I want and nobody was here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, like last night we went to restaurant and people was getting crazy like, \u2018Hi Alex, how\u2019s everything?\u2019 And they start asking [for] pictures, autographs. Hockey\u2019s going up right now. And we do good job to help that.\u201d\n\nOvechkin sported baseball pants and flip-flops in addition to the special jersey he will wear during the Winter Classic. Nicklas Backstrom and Braden Holtby were also on hand to model the jerseys, which are a deep red with a large \u201cW\u201d on the front. All three players later went down to the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse and took batting practice in the indoor cage. Holtby also posed for a photo with Nationals left fielder Bryce Harper.\n\nThe Winter Classic is more than three months away, separated by at least two playoff games at Nationals Park next weekend and perhaps many more. Plenty of baseball remains before it is time for hockey. But with the rink outlined on the field and the jerseys fresh out of the box, Leonsis couldn\u2019t help but think ahead.\n\n\u201cFor hockey in Washington D.C.,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a big moment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leonsis stood in front of a podium at Nationals Park on Tuesday and knew that in exactly 100 days, his idea would finally become reality.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Leonsis stood in front of a podium at Nationals Park on Tuesday and knew that in exactly 100 days, his idea would finally become reality.", "title": "Winter Classic in D.C. a dream come true for Ted Leonsis, Capitals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/23/winter-classic-dc-dream-come-true-ted-leonsis-capi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/23/winterclassic_016.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/23/winterclassic_016.jpg", "description": "Leonsis stood in front of a podium at Nationals Park on Tuesday and knew that in exactly 100 days, his idea would finally become reality.", "card": "summary", "title": "Winter Classic in D.C. a dream come true for Ted Leonsis, Capitals"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Ted Leonsis, Gary Bettman, Washington"}, "article_summary": "The official logo of 2015 Winter Classic flashed on the jumbotron.\nThe Winter Classic is more than three months away, separated by at least two playoff games at Nationals Park next weekend and perhaps many more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great day for the city,\u201d Leonsis said.\nOn New Year\u2019s Day in 2008, Capitals owner Ted Leonsis was watching the inaugural Winter Classic on television with his family when he first had the thought: What if this was happening in Washington?\nAnd we do good job to help that.\u201dOvechkin sported baseball pants and flip-flops in addition to the special jersey he will wear during the Winter Classic."}
