Though opponents call House Bill 1297 a fishing expedition to find something wrong with oil and gas operations, how can there be any harm in reviewing medical literature to determine whether health concerns exist?

The legislation sponsored by Rep. Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, would spend about $567,000 over three years to study health effects of oil and gas operations in Adams, Boulder, Larimer and Weld counties.

“The intent of the bill is to do a retrospective analysis of public health data to see if there are any red flags,”said Louis Irwin, aide to Sen. Irene Aguilar, D-Denver, who is a co-sponsor.

Researchers would screen already collected data to see if there is cause for more detailed epidemiological studies, he said.

The study also would include surveys of community members in affected counties to learn about their health and quality-of-life issues, followed by a closer look at at least two “conditions of interest.” The study, due Jan. 1, 2017, would later be submitted for peer review in a scientific journal.

Proponents say the study is necessary because health effects of oil and gas have not been adequately researched on the Front Range.

Opponents say several aspects of oil and gas production are already being examined, including an air quality study by Colorado State University and a study into drinking water and fracking by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Also, opponents argue the state has imposed strict regulations on the industry and that this study is an “invitation for a subjective attack on oil and gas.”

But that’s highly unlikely since the research will be done by the state Department of Public Health and Environment.

If there’s reason for concern, it’s that the health department’s work would be overseen by a politically appointed scientific committee. The legislation would be better without that feature.
