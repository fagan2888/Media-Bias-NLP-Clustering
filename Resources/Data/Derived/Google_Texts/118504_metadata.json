The focus is often on whether sex can kill you by precipitating a heart attack.\n\nHappily, these studies generally show that heart rates rise during intercourse, but tolerably. In a 2008 study, middle-aged subjects\u2019 heart rates jumped at the point of orgasm by only 21 beats per minute in men and 19 in women, about the same response as if they\u2019d just done a few jumping jacks. The risk for sex-related cardiac arrest is, in fact, vanishingly small, statistics show, though it may be greater when the act is extramarital.\n\nThe issue of sex as exercise, however, has remained largely unexplored. \u201cThere are these myths,\u201d including that sex burns at least 100 calories per session, said Antony D. Karelis, a professor of exercise science at the University of Quebec at Montreal who undertook a study, published in PLOS One in October, to look at how much energy is actually exerted during sex. \u201cBut nobody had tested\u201d those assumptions.\n\nTo do so, Karelis and his colleagues recruited 21 young heterosexual committed couples from the local area and had them jog on treadmills for 30 minutes, while researchers monitored their energy expenditure and other metrics, in order to provide a comparison for the physical demands of sex. The scientists next gave their volunteers unobtrusive armband activity monitors that gauge exertion in terms of calories and METs, or metabolic equivalent of task, a physiological measure comparing an activity to sitting perfectly still, which is a 1-MET task. Then the scientists sent the couples home, instructing them to complete at least one sex act a week for a month while wearing the armbands, and to fill out questionnaires about how each session made them feel, physically and psychologically, especially compared with running on the treadmill.\n\nWhen the researchers analyzed all of the resulting data, it was clear, Karelis said, that sex qualified as \u201cmoderate exercise,\u201d a 6-MET activity for men and 5.6-MET activity for women. That\u2019s the equivalent, according to various estimates, of playing doubles tennis or walking uphill. The jogging, by comparison, was more strenuous, an 8.5-MET activity for the men in the study and 8.4 for women. (Though some men, according to their activity monitors, used more energy for brief periods during sex than they did jogging.) The sex also burned four calories per minute for men and three per minute for women, during sessions that ranged from 10 to 57 minutes, including foreplay. (The average was 25 minutes.) Men burned about 9 calories per minute jogging and women about 7.\n\nOver all, the data reveal that \u201csex can be considered, at times, a significant exercise,\u201d Karelis said, worth encouraging in people who otherwise balk at working out. Ninety-eight percent of Karelis\u2019s volunteers reported that sex felt more fun than jogging. The other 2 percent, I suspect, will be back in the dating market soon.\n\nThis article appeared in the Dec. 8, 2013 issue of The New York Times Magazine", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/12/05nyt-sexercise-acropHF.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Do intimate acts count as working out?
