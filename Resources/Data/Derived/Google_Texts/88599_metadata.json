That\u2019s why the Obama administration pushed for a bailout.\n\nHere\u2019s the Obama administration\u2019s playbook: First, pass a law requiring the public to buy insurance-company products. Then impose big penalties on anyone who doesn\u2019t buy. Finally, when insurers still can\u2019t make money, bail them out using taxpayer dollars.\n\nOutrageous. Fortunately, Republicans in Congress showed backbone and refused to go along.

The omnibus bill reportedly contains a huge tax concession to the same industry.\n\nMoney is fungible, and this rewards the same players. The new deal suspends the health-insurance tax for a year. That tax applies to all health-insurance policies, not just ObamaCare. It was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act to help pay for it.\n\nSuspending the tax is in effect handing the industry an estimated $12 billion a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, exceeding even what insurers would\u2019ve received in a bailout.\n\n\u201cCongress shouldn\u2019t subsidize White House cronies,\u201d says Doug Badger, a former White House policy adviser.
