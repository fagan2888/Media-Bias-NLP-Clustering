About a quarter of those surveyed would also be open to receiving dialysis or MRIs in a retail clinic.\n\nIf even a fraction of consumers end up using at-home, online and retail options for those tests and treatments, traditional medical practices and health systems could lose billions of dollars in revenue \u2013 something nontraditional medical providers are betting on.\n\nNew entrants coming from a variety of industries \u201cregard their global reach, customer insights, commitment to transparency and trusted brands as critical assets to capture and dominate the fragmented health sector,\u201d Barnes wrote in her report.\n\nTwenty-six of 2013\u2019s Fortune 50 companies were new entrants in healthcare, PwC found, including seven retailers, eight technology and telecommunications companies and even two automakers looking for ways to add chronic disease care services to their products.\n\nHere\u2019s a glance at some of the moves into the healthcare market nontraditional companies have made recently:\n\nIn 2012, AT&T opened its mHealth platform to developers to tap into the mobile application boom.\n\nSamsung\u2019s new smartphone comes with a built-in heart rate monitor.\n\nApple is expected to unveil a mobile health product soon.\n\nTime Warner Cable is experimenting with the Cleveland Clinic in offering telehealth video consults.\n\nGoogle recently launched a company called Calico, offering few details other than a focus on aging and its related diseases.\n\nWalgreens, 37 on the Fortune list, has been targeting consumer health for some time, for instance offering some $400 million worth of immunizations annually, a 4 percent share of a $10 billion market.\n\nWal-Mart, which may turn out to be one of the biggest competitors for healthcare providers (and/or one of their most promising partners), debuted its $4 generic drug program in 2006 and has been looking for more health business ever since. Walk-in clinics affiliated with regional hospitals can now be found in many Walmart stores from Maine to California. Last year, Kaiser Permanente opened micro-clinics offer teleconferencing to KP nurses and physicians in two Walmart stores. That service is available to shoppers and store employees.\n\nBut all is not dire for traditional healthcare companies, wrote Barnes. Some have recognized the threat and have taken action, often by buying companies, partnering or creating new business lines.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, for instance, recently purchased digital health startup Audax. And in greater Philadelphia, Temple University Health System operates four \u201cReadyCare\u201d retail clinics; Einstein Health has two walk-in clinics, including one in a Shop Rite grocery store; Abington Health is in the midst of opening two urgent care centers; and the Rothman Institute, the region\u2019s largest orthopedic group, has several urgent care centers in the works after their first, in Marlton, N.J., opened last year.\n\nThese innovations by traditional healthcare companies not only allow them to compete with the new entrants (or head them off), they have the ability to reduce costs, noted Barnes in her report.\n\n\u201cA hospital with a value-based care contract could find it cost-effective to send patients to local retail clinic partners rather than surgeons to have post-operative stitches removed,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAs more nontraditional healthcare companies move into the space and traditional companies respond, \u201ctraditional healthcare business will look and feel like other consumer-oriented, technology-enabled industries,\u201d within the decade, predicted Barnes in the PwC report. \u201cSoon, (the healthcare market) will have its own Amazon.com-style, iconic, new economy brands.\u201d\n\nThis story is based on a report appearing on Healthcare Payer News.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/new-entrants-healthcare-market-threaten-traditional-businesses", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/walgreens_store_flickr_time_anchor.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "New entrants in the healthcare market could snatch billions of dollars of revenue from traditional healthcare companies if the traditional companies do not move faster to provide services in the setting consumers want.", "title": "New entrants into the healthcare market threaten traditional businesses"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/walgreens_store_flickr_time_anchor.jpg"}, "description": "New entrants in the healthcare market could snatch billions of dollars of revenue from traditional healthcare companies if the traditional companies do not move faster to provide services in the setting consumers want.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New entrants into the healthcare market threaten traditional businesses"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "New entrants in the healthcare market could snatch billions of dollars of revenue from traditional healthcare companies if the traditional companies do not move faster to provide services in the setting consumers want.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4dd\"", "article_summary": "New entrants in the healthcare market could snatch billions of dollars of revenue from traditional healthcare companies if the traditional companies do not move faster to provide services in the setting consumers want.\nAs more nontraditional healthcare companies move into the space and traditional companies respond, \u201ctraditional healthcare business will look and feel like other consumer-oriented, technology-enabled industries,\u201d within the decade, predicted Barnes in the PwC report.\nBut all is not dire for traditional healthcare companies, wrote Barnes.\nThese innovations by traditional healthcare companies not only allow them to compete with the new entrants (or head them off), they have the ability to reduce costs, noted Barnes in her report.\n\u201cSoon, (the healthcare market) will have its own Amazon.com-style, iconic, new economy brands.\u201dThis story is based on a report appearing on Healthcare Payer News."}
