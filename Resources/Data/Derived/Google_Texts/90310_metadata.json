It sure looks that way. Liberals, meanwhile, owe some apologies too.\n\nA little over a decade ago the Chicks' lead singer, Natalie Maines, told a London audience: \"Just so you know, we\u2019re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.\" This was less than two weeks before the shooting started in the Iraq war, and patriotic fervor was running high. Blowback came swiftly. Country-music stations stopped playing the Dixie Chicks. Their No. 1 single \"Travelin\u2019 Soldier\" fell off the charts. Critics started calling them the \"Ditsy Twits\" and the \"Vichy Chicks\" and even less flattering things. They received death threats.\n\nTo the left, this epitomized the \"stifling of dissent\" that all truly patriotic Americans should abhor. To conservatives, this was simply the free market in action. As a later piece in National Review put it, \"fans were also only exercising their own freedoms, in choosing not to buy albums. Radio stations were exercising their business freedom in choosing not to play songs that outraged their listeners and repelled their advertisers.\"\n\nBack then, you didn\u2019t see conservatives expressing the sort of alarm they have been voicing ever since Brandon Eich resigned as head of Mozilla. Six years ago Eich donated to California\u2019s Proposition 8, upholding traditional marriage. His recent elevation to CEO ignited a debate over that. Within days, Eich bowed to the pressure and stepped down.\n\nTo the right, this was a \"purge\" carried out by the \"thought police\" and the \"gay mafia\" that banishes the \"politically incorrect\" to the \"liberal gulag.\" Not quite government censorship\u2014but certainly a dangerous stifling of dissent and an example of, in Virginia Congressman Frank Wolf\u2019s words, \"mob rule.\" On the other side, many liberals defended the ouster as entirely appropriate. As one piece in The New York Times put it, Mozilla had simply realized its \"CEO\u2019s worldview is completely out of touch with the company's\u2014and America's\u2014values and vision for the future.\" Companies have a right to live their values, after all.\n\nReally? As Jonathan Tobin pointed out in Commentary, that\u2019s hardly the orthodox liberal view of Hobby Lobby. According to the liberal view, Hobby Lobby\u2019s desire not to arrange contraception for its employees is not an expression of the corporation's viewpoint, because corporations aren\u2019t people and they don\u2019t have any rights. Rather, liberals say Hobby Lobby is forcing its owners' values down its employees' throats. By that reasoning, Mozilla was forcing its values down an employee\u2019s throat\u2014Eich's\u2014and violating his right to have his own political opinions.\n\nLiberals have not been so understanding of other corporate entities, either. Two years ago the breast-cancer charity Susan G. Komen for the Cure found itself instantly reviled when it halted grants to Planned Parenthood. The blowback was so intense 26 U.S. senators signed a letter urging Komen to recant\u2014which it did only three days later. Komen's president and founder, Nancy Brinker, stepped aside. Conservatives were aghast.\n\nNor were liberals overly worried about the free-speech implications of the backlash against Chick-fil-A two years ago, when president Dan Cathy provoked outrage by expressing his own personal opposition to gay marriage. Conservatives, on the other hand, declared this a dangerous development in a culture war that threatened to silence anyone who strayed from the progressive party line.\n\nThis is a strange position for conservatives to take\u2014and not simply because of the Dixie Chicks episode. As a general rule, conservatives think social norms are best upheld not through government coercion but through the moral suasion of community mores. Since Hobby Lobby is the only case involving government compulsion, conservatives ought to feel sanguine about the other developments: Americans are working out their differences through the marketplace of ideas, even if the process sometimes looks rather unpretty.\n\nOf course there is more to it than that. Even when the First Amendment isn't implicated\u2014as it isn't in the Mozilla case\u2014it's reasonable to wonder where lines should be drawn. Few would object if a company fired a Nazi or a member of the Klan. But as Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit notes, Eich has been ousted for a 2008 view shared at the time by Barack Obama. (Obama, unlike Eich, has changed his position since then.)\n\nIf companies start policing executives' beliefs, then there is no reason to limit the scrutiny to one issue. Suppose abortion becomes a litmus test\u2014with some companies firing pro-life executives and others firing those who are pro-choice. Should companies vet their leaders\u2019 views on gun rights? Or drug legalization? What about universities\u2014many of which already view any conservative as barely tolerable? Should nonprofits and civic groups also enforce ideological conformity? They certainly have a right to. But having a right to X does not make X the prudent thing to do.\n\nPeople have a right to express\u2014and advocate for\u2014their opinions, and other people have a right to object. But there also is something to be said for the principle of live and let live: It\u2019s possible to disagree about an issue without despising those you disagree with.\n\nUnfortunately, as Barton Swaim put it in a recent Wall Street Journal review, America increasingly resembles a place where people \"speak of their country as if it has been overtaken by a hostile force with whom they share no premises or aims.\" If we all start excommunicating one another at the first sign of apostasy, it's going to become a very cold and lonely place.\n\nThis article originally appeared at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/14/bipartisan-hypocrisy-on-free-speech", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "From the Dixie Chicks to Mozilla, free speech is under fire from both right and left.", "title": "Bipartisan Hypocrisy on Free Speech"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "Do conservatives owe the Dixie Chicks an apology?
