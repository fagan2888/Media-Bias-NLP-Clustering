An organization dedicated to exposing people who pose as American service members is hoping that authorities will prosecute a Pennsylvania man it says recently posed as a decorated, active-duty U.S. Army Ranger.

Sean Yetman may be in hot water after being spotted on Black Friday at the Oxford Valley Mall near Philadelphia. He was wearing an Army uniform with patches showing that he was a Ranger and had won three Combat Infantryman badges.

But Ryan Burk, a veteran from the 101st Airborne Division, confronted Yetman with his cellphone camera.

"This is illegal," Burk told Yetman. "What you're doing is illegal because - you know what? I've worn that uniform and I've had friends get killed in Afghanistan."

The former paratrooper went on to describe Yetman's alleged stunt as "stolen valor at its finest."

Burk sent a copy of his video to the group Guardian of Valor, where spokesman Anthony Anderson says it wasn't too difficult to check out Yetman's claims.

"Once we got his name and his date of birth, submitted it, and did an emergency request for records, there was no record of him ever serving in the Army," says Anderson.

The group also learned that Yetman impersonated a police officer in 2003, one who had been killed in the line of duty.

"He pled guilty to that," Anderson says of Yetman. "They actually busted him riding around with a police officer's jacket and badge on."

A video uploaded to Youtube shows Yetman being confronted by Burk about his uniform, including the location of the American flag on his right arm, and being grilled about knowledge only a U.S. Army soldier would have.

The video, which includes offensive language, is on the Guardian website.

Anderson hopes that Yetman will be the first person prosecuted under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, which makes it a federal crime for someone to present themselves as a decorated military service member with the intent to obtain money, property "or other tangible benefit."
