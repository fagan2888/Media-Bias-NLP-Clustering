Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWas God purposely left off the National World War II Memorial?\n\nThat is a rumor that made the rounds on the Internet. As such, it became a \u201cmaliciously generated and widely distributed notion,\u201d as the National Park Service put it, and led to legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama Monday.\n\nNow God\u2019s getting a place on the National Mall. A plaque with a prayer is to be installed near the monument \u2013 a move that\u2019s not winning praise from groups who strongly support the separation of church and state.\n\nSo here\u2019s what happened: The claim was mainly inspired by the fact that a chunk of Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s speech to Congress after the bombing of Pearl Harbor was used on the memorial, but not the \u201cGod\u201d part.\n\nThe quote used on the 10-year-old memorial was, \u201cDecember 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy \u2026 no matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.\u201d\n\nThis part was chosen, according to the National Park Service in a memo addressing the \u201c World War II Memorial Inscription Controversy,\u201d because that's when Congress cheered loudest. (The American Battle Monuments Commission actually listened to audio recording.) The God reference comes three paragraphs later. \u201cWhenever one reads the entire speech, it becomes clear that the phrase \u2018so help us God\u2019 neither appears at the end of the speech nor remains omitted from the phrase that actually exists within the memorial,\u201d the undated NPS memo reads.\n\nBut the NPS memo didn\u2019t make the Godless-memorial-problem go away.\n\n\"People started emailing their members of Congress saying, 'This is ridiculous that we can't put God on this memorial.' Even though this wasn't the case at all,\" explained Kelly Damerow, director of federal and state government affairs at the Secular Coalition, a group fighting the project. \"So they actively moved to make it happen.\n\nEnter Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who sponsored legislation in the last Congress, and now this one, known as the \u201c World War II Memorial Prayer Act.\u201d The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to \u201cinstall in the area of the World War II Memorial in the District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on D-Day, June 6, 1944.\u201d Portman originally teamed up with then- Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn. This time around he linked up with Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who\u2019s seeking re-election in a red-ish state.\n\nOn June 5, Landrieu and Portman recited the prayer together on the Senate floor in honor of the 70th anniversary of D-Day, the bill was then passed by unanimous consent. The House passed the piece of legislation later that month. And on Monday, Obama signed the bill.\n\nGroups including the Ohio Christian Alliance and the Christian Coalition of America endorsed the legislation.\n\n\"President Roosevelt's prayer articulated the great crusade that was underway to liberate millions suffering under tyranny. He honored the war effort and paid tribute to the fallen and those veterans who fought courageously in the conflict. It is only fitting that succeeding generations learn of this prayer that was offered at that most poignant moment in our nation's history,\" Ohio Christian Alliance President Chris Long said in a statement after the Senate passed the bill.\n\nOn the other hand, the Secular Coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union were not too pleased once the president offered his signature.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really disappointed that the president signed it into law,\u201d said Heather Weaver, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s national religion program. \u201cWar memorials are meant to unite us in gratitude for veterans\u2019 service, but we believe that adding the prayer is actually a divisive act that sends a strong message of exclusion to the many Americans and service members who don\u2019t share these religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nAmanda K. Metskas, president of the Secular Coalition, said she wasn\u2019t surprised the prayer plaque had bipartisan support. \u201cYou know, I think a lot of people across the political spectrum are very comfortable with privileging religion in our politics right now,\u201d Metskas said.\n\nBoth groups and some like-minded allies are looking at their options on how to ultimately prevent the plaque.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "God Gets a Place on the National Mall", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Obama signed legislation permitting a prayer plaque to be erected on the World War II Memorial.", "title": "God Gets a Place on the National Mall", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/07/03/god-gets-a-place-on-the-national-mall", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/61/d0/d038ca794c8eb7d32285f56bc8bb/140703-wwiimemorial-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "God Gets a Place on the National Mall", "description": "Obama signed legislation permitting a prayer plaque to be erected on the World War II Memorial.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "July 3, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,picks,religion,World War II,Washington Whispers [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Obama signed legislation permitting a prayer plaque to be erected on the World War II Memorial."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1413\"", "article_summary": "Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty ImagesWas God purposely left off the National World War II Memorial?\nThe World War II Memorial Prayer Act allows for the installation of a prayer plaque at the Washington, D.C., landmark.\nNow God\u2019s getting a place on the National Mall.\n\"People started emailing their members of Congress saying, 'This is ridiculous that we can't put God on this memorial.'\n\u201cWe\u2019re really disappointed that the president signed it into law,\u201d said Heather Weaver, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s national religion program."}
