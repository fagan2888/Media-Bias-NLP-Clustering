Even if the child is married, not living at home or financially dependent on the parent, he or she is still eligible.\n\nThose enrolled in school will still have coverage even after graduation.\n\nEveryone in the United States should have some form of health insurance because a person\u2019s health is the most important thing.\n\nDoctor appointments are meaningless if it costs too much and skipping those appointments can lead to further health risks.\n\nCollege students are near the age where they need to start paying closer attention to their health, because their eating habits and choices made now will affect them later.\n\nSome young adults even face hereditary health risks, such as cancer or heart disease.\n\nFortunately, those under 26 do not have to worry about this. Although there are a couple steps that need to be taken before someone under 26 receives coverage.\n\nCollege students wanting to enroll under their parents\u2019 plan need to enroll before the open enrollment period.\n\nOpen enrollment to get health care coverage for 2014 ends on the 31st of this March.\n\nFor example, if Californians were to apply by March 15, they will be able to get health coverage by April 1, according to HealthCare.gov.\n\nUnder Covered California (California\u2019s enrollment website for Obamacare), people are able to reduce their health costs such as hospitalizations, emergency care and maternity care.\n\nThere are a lot of costs attributed to going to college, so much so that around two-thirds of college students are choosing to live at home with their parents in order to cut some costs.\n\nBut even with the relief that comes with not having to pay rent, an added cost of health insurance would probably still be too much for a student that may not be working to have to pay for.\n\nHaving an age range of 26 gives students some time to hopefully get their career started and get to the point where they can afford to pay for their own insurance and finally leave the safety of mom and pa.\n\nSome students may even be able to squeeze an extra year of being under their parent\u2019s health care. If they turn 26 in the middle of the health plan coverage, the coverage will extend until the next tax year (Dec. 31).\n\nThis is a fair amount of time students have where they won\u2019t have to worry about the cost of health insurance.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gives young adults nationwide the relief. While facing the new experiences of adulthood, there is one less thing to worry about.\n\nTending to one\u2019s health should not be something that a person questions. A young adult should not have to choose between paying to take care of their well being or next month\u2019s rent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.dailytitan.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamacare_fea-100x60.jpg", "description": "The cost for higher education is high enough to cause college students some stress.
