That market share includes plans sold both on the state-run health insurance market and in the so-called off-exchange market.\n\n\n\nNow, \"we want to grow across the board,\" Schlosser said.\n\n\n\nDoing so will be easier with Oscar's new round of funding. The capital infusion, about $65 million more than the prior investment, was led by Peter Thiel and Brian Singerman from Founders Fun and Li Ka-Shing of Horizon Ventures. The Wellington Management Fund and Goldman Sachs also participated, as did prior investors in Oscar.\n\nSchlosser said the money will be used primarily for building up the staff, which now stands at around 185 people\u2014100 or so more than at the start of 2014.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "New funding for start-up health insurer Oscar values it at $1.5 billion as the company eyes expansion in California and the group insurance market.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "A new round of funding could propel small, data-driven health insurer Oscar into a major playing field for Obamacare plans.", "title": "Oscar's Obamacare-fueled growth gets big boost", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/big-growth-big-dreams-for-data-driven-obamacare-insurer.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/04/17/102597677-Oscar.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new round of funding could propel small, data-driven health insurer Oscar into a major playing field for Obamacare plans.", "title": "Big growth, big dreams for data-driven Obamacare insurer", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/big-growth-big-dreams-for-data-driven-obamacare-insurer.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/04/17/102597677-Oscar.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Care, Health Insurance, Venture Capital, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, Amazon.com Inc, UnitedHealth Group Inc, Aetna Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-04-20T09:00:14-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T09:38:48-0400", "tag": "Aetna Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102597584, "news_keywords": "Oscar health insurance, Obamacare, venture capital, group insurance, California"}, "article_summary": "That market share includes plans sold both on the state-run health insurance market and in the so-called off-exchange market.\nThat's \"about twice as high as we originally thought we'd be after two years of operation,\" he said, noting that it's been less than two full years since Oscar's Obamacare policies have been in effect.\nOscar is \"incredibly happy\" with its rising membership, which now stands at around 40,000 customers, Schlosser said.\n\"I think we've come very far, very quickly,\" CEO and co-founder Mario Schlosser told CNBC.com.\nThe Wellington Management Fund and Goldman Sachs also participated, as did prior investors in Oscar."}
