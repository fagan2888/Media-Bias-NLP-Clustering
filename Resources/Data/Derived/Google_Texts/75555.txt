FLEMINGTON - Two Union County residents are facing a variety of charges after police stopped to investigate a person who was urinating on the side of Route 31 near the Flemington Circle.



Bereka Gelin, 24, of Elizabeth, and Pascal Exilus, 31, of Roselle, are facing charges of possessing a handgun, possessing a weapon by certain persons not to possess a handgun, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and possession of a handgun while in possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, Hunterdon County Prosecutor Anthony P. Kearns III said.



The two were arrested after Flemington Patrolman Robert Godown saw a vehicle parked on the side of northbound Route 31 by the Flemington Circle at about 4:38 a.m. Nov. 20.



Exilus, who was driving, was still in the vehicle while Gelin was outside urinating on the side of the road, Kearns said.



Exilus and Gelin were jailed in lieu of $100,000 bail set by Superior Court Judge Angela Borkowski.



The case is still under investigation and anyone with information is asked to call the Hunterdon County Prosecutorâ€™s Office at 908-788-1129.
