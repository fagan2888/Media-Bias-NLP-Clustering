(Photo: HEIDI HEILBRUNN/Staff)Buy Photo\n\nWhen a heart attack cost Charles Monnett his job, he lost his health insurance too.\n\nWithout medical care or medicine, his blood sugar spiked to dangerous levels, and he wound up in the hospital delirious from an infection.\n\n\u201cIf I had insurance, I would have been able to see a doctor ... and I would have been able to take care of myself and had what I needed,\u201d Monnett, 50, told The Greenville News. \u201cBut I started getting sicker and sicker.\u201d\n\nMonnett is like countless other people in Greenville County and elsewhere around the country who put off getting care because they have no insurance and wind up in worse shape, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit that advocates affordable health care for all Americans.\n\nA Commonwealth Fund survey of uninsured young adults between 19 and 31 in 2013 revealed that about half hadn\u2019t gone to the doctor when they were sick, filled a prescription, gotten a recommended test or follow-up visit or seen a specialist because of cost. And a third said their condition deteriorated as a result.\n\nPollack said it\u2019s common for people without insurance and living on a limited income to defer care when a health problem arises in the hopes that it will go away because they don\u2019t have the resources to pay for that care.\n\n\u201cToo often, it doesn\u2019t go away,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd for too many people, the delay in care can have the most severe consequences. A problem that could have been dealt with successfully at an early stage gets more severe and more complex ... and becomes something that ultimately can\u2019t be treated.\u201d\n\nPostponing care also can spark a downward spiral that leads to absenteeism from work and then job loss, bankruptcy and homelessness, which can be hard to emerge from, Pollack said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re having a health problem that can be remedied, but not getting care for it ... and you\u2019re fired,\u201d he said, \u201cyour economic situation gets worse ... and at some point, it may be very difficult to get that remedied.\u201d\n\nLosing it all\n\nMore than 16 percent of South Carolinians were uninsured in 2014, according to the U.S. Census. Greenville County\u2019s uninsured rate was 16.5 percent while Pickens County\u2019s was 13.6 percent.\n\nMonnett was one of them.\n\nFor most of his life, he\u2019d been doing tree trimming and landscaping work. But that was too physically demanding after he was diagnosed with diabetes.\n\n\u201cIt just took a toll on me,\u201d he said. \u201cMy body started slowing down and getting weaker.\u201d\n\nSo he found a job at a big box store in floor maintenance, where he worked until his heart attack in 2010.\n\n\u201cAfter that, I lost everything. And when Obamacare came out, I didn\u2019t even qualify for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Where do I go from here?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAmericans are eligible for Obamacare if they earn between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. A Medicaid expansion was designed for those with incomes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. But South Carolina was among the states that did not expand its Medicaid program. So Monnett fell into what's called the Medicaid Gap.\n\nThough he was supposed to be taking insulin for his diabetes, he couldn\u2019t afford it or the associated medical equipment, let alone doctor visits.\n\n\u201cI have no way to afford the several hundreds of dollars that it literally takes, when you figure the insulin, the syringes,\u201d he said. \u201cThat adds up. And I don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nThen in August as he was being released from the hospital, Monnett was linked up with Susan Fender.\n\nShe is a registered nurse and case manager for the Bon Secours St. Francis Healthy Outcomes Program, which seeks to find medical homes for chronically ill uninsured people in poverty.\n\nFinding help\n\nFender got Monnett established with a primary care provider \u2014 the Greenville Free Medical Clinic \u2014 and the medications he needs to stay healthy.\n\n\u201cThey knew I didn\u2019t have no insurance and no way to take care of myself,\u201d he said. \u201cThey provided a way. This clinic has been a blessing to me.\u201d\n\nFender is managing 400 patients like Monnett.\n\n\u201cA lot of referrals that come to me are people who are in the hospital,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd of the people I see, at least 80 to 90 percent are not eligible for (Obamacare) subsidies and we did not expand Medicaid in this state.\u201d\n\nMany are working, but often only part time and in low-paying jobs without benefits, she said, and the few who do have insurance find it almost impossible to pay the high deductibles and co-pays.\n\nOthers are disabled and awaiting Medicare coverage, she added, while still others are homeless.\n\nIn addition to linking them with a primary care provider, she arranges transportation to the doctor if they need it and connects them with other safety net providers in the community, such as mental health services, shelters and more permanent housing, food banks and other social services to try to help them get back on their feet.\n\nSince St. Francis started Healthy Outcomes just over a year ago, there has been a marked decline in hospitalization among the patients in the program, and about $1 million in savings, she said.\n\nBreaking the cycle\n\nWhen Monnett was admitted to the hospital, his blood sugar levels were between 600 and 700, Fender said. Normal is 100-120. And that uncontrolled blood sugar contributed to his developing potentially life-threatening sepsis, she said.\n\nThings are different now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been a matter of weeks,\u201d she said, \u201cand he looks tremendously better.\u201d\n\nWhile the program was designed to keep chronically ill people out of hospital ERs for non-emergent conditions and save money, it\u2019s benefiting the patients by keeping them healthier by providing them access to care.\n\nMonnett was not only able to see a doctor and get the medicine he needed, he was taught how to eat to keep his blood sugar more regulated.\n\n\u201cI was totally ignorant about some of the stuff I needed to know about diabetes,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t take it serious enough at all. But I am learning. Now I\u2019m measuring out my food by grams and carbohydrates (and) ... my sugars are from 99 to 140 and that is a whole new switch for me.\u201d\n\nMonnett said he feels so much better and is so encouraged now that he has care that he hopes to get back on his feet.\n\n\u201cThis program will help me do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout a sense of self-worth, without independence and motivation, you ain\u2019t going anywhere and you can\u2019t get that if you\u2019re always down in the dumps and in poor health. You can\u2019t break that cycle.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the Healthy Outcomes program, contact Natalie Dougherty at Bon Secours St. Francis Health System at 864-675-4302 or at Natalie_Dougherty@bshsi.org.\n\n#UNSEENGREENVILLE\n\nThis story is part of ongoing coverage by The Greenville News focusing on neighborhoods in the shadows of our community and the people who live there.
