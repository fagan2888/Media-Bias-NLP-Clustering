Thanksgiving is already in the rearview mirror for many presidential hopefuls meandering back on the campaign trail following their respective family feasts. Things get particularly busy by Sunday, when the candidates will go scrambling, willy-nilly, for voter attention in battleground states. But that\u2019s next week.\n\nFor now, Republican hopeful Donald Trump has the most high-profile event this weekend. He will be staging a jumbo rally at a big arena in Sarasota, Florida, followed by another on Monday at a Georgia coliseum, followed by yet another Tuesday at a New Hampshire athletic club, followed by still one more on Wednesday \u2014 this one staged at some fairgrounds in Virginia, not far from the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz is also on a busy schedule. He tours Iowa this weekend with Rep. Louie Gohmert at 15 different events, including a stop in Tama to eat taco pizza and another at the Crooked Antler Lodge in Van Horne. Mr. Cruz will be in Virginia by Monday.\n\nAll three Democratic hopefuls will attend a major event in New Hampshire on Sunday. Front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Bernard Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley star at the sold-out New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner at the biggest hotel in Manchester. Yes, C-SPAN will be there, beginning at 9:30 p.m. EST. Mrs. Clinton will also visit with Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, poised to launch a new \u201cHard Hats for Hillary\u201d voter initiative in the city.\n\nTHE CHANGING IMMIGRANTS\n\n\u201cImmigrants of today are unlike the immigrants of yesteryear. Although it is true that some still come for better education and free enterprise, most come out of necessity \u2014 they come because they don\u2019t want to die in war,\u201d writes Luma Simms, a contributor to The Federalist who was born in Iraq to Christian parents and currently lives in Arizona with her family.\n\n\u201cThis type of refugee situation, which has been going on since the Iraqi diaspora after Saddam was toppled and recently flared up again with the Syrian refugee crisis, brings people who see America as better than death. Hence, they will take whatever America wants to give but will keep themselves isolated. They have no interest in assimilating,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cSome Muslims have even taken to building their own home schooling cooperatives rather than sending their children to American public schools. How much American history do you think they will learn, and with what bias? Being accustomed to socialist countries, modern immigrants (refugee or otherwise) carry with them a predisposition for government as caretaker,\u201d Ms. Simms notes, adding that this prompts immigrants to typically vote Democratic, though most are social conservatives.\n\n\u201cMost Iraqis and Syrians I know say they would go back to their countries if there were a stable government. I suppose that\u2019s good incentives for some Americans \u2014 there\u2019s a way to unload some people. Self-deportation, anyone? I would venture to say that even Hispanic immigrants (legal and illegal) coming from Mexico and Latin America, to a certain extent, may feel the same way,\u201d she concludes.\n\nGIPPER GIFTS\n\nFrom the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation comes the \u201cTrust But Verify\u201d gift collection. Among items emblazoned with one of the 40th president\u2019s most famous phrases, plus his signature: coffee mug, money clip, leather portfolio, pen, desk box. Check things out in the museum store at ReaganFoundation.org or through an old-fashioned phone call to 800/998-7641.\n\nREGULATING THE CRAFT BREWERS\n\nSharp-eyed analysts have found yet another burden stemming from the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAmid Obamacare\u2019s 3,000 pages lies a regulation that may squeeze craft beer brewers out of business. Regulators claim that American consumers are not healthy because they are blissfully unaware of the amount of calories in beer,\u201d notes an new analysis from the National Taxpayers Union.\n\nNext year all brewers must include a detailed calorie count on every type of beer they produce. Failure to comply means craft brewers can\u2019t sell their beer in any restaurant chain with over 20 locations \u2014 a major blow to smaller operations. The Cato Institute also estimates the new labeling requirements will cost up to $77,000 to implement \u2014 doable for larger beer companies, a burden for local artisan brewers.\n\n\u201cThe increasingly small size of craft breweries means they are faced with a tough decision in light of the impending regulations: cut costs and possibly lay off workers to pay for the calorie labels, or be shut out of one of the most profitable markets for their product. Either way, it is a lose-lose situation for craft beer brewers and drinkers, an industry that grew 27.8 percent from 2013 to 2014 when it was left alone,\u201d says the taxpayer watchdog.\n\nWEEKEND REAL ESTATE\n\nFor sale: Mammoth Spring Victorian, built in 1890 in historic Mammoth Spring, Alabama.
