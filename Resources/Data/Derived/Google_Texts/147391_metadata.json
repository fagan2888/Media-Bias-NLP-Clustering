Come 2018, the tax on so-called Cadillac plans begins, and many expect it to be the next big debate to plague the ACA, reported Politico.\n\nThe tax on such plans--those exceeding $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for families--initially was introduced to slow the healthcare spending growth. While the name \"Cadillac tax\" may suggest otherwise, experts believe about one-third of employers will end up incurring the first-ever tax on healthcare benefits, according to Politico.\n\nOne selling point for employers offering health insurance to employees has been the idea that employers can write off from their taxes the cost of offering coverage.

For instance, many business have been pushing their workers out of high-cost plans and into ones with larger deductibles while also offering them health savings accounts, noted Politico.\n\n\"We continue to support the Affordable Care Act,\" Kim Anderson, senior director of the National Education Association's Center for Advocacy and Outreach, told Politico. But \"the excise tax on high-cost plans can randomly and unfairly cause hardship to American workers and their families. Congress must repeal the excise tax.\"\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the Politico article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEmployers find loopholes to avoid paying Cadillac tax\n\nConsumer-driven health plans on the rise\n\nSupport for 'Cadillac tax' running out of gas", "article_metadata": {"description": "The\u00a0Affordable Care Act turned five this year, but one major provision has yet to go into effect.
