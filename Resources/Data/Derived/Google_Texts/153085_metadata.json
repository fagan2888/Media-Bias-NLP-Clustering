Presumably, he already has a gig booked the next night as a pumpkin.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile the media suggest that Boehner\u2019s ouster came as a surprise, it came as no surprise to readers of Breitbart, who learned from Matt Boyle yesterday that Boehner would not be able to retain his speakership \u201cwithout Democratic votes.\u201d Boyle reported:\n\nThe day after Pope Francis addressed the Congress for the first time\u2014in front of a teary-eyed Boehner\u2014the Speaker had planned to move forward by bringing forth a resolution to vacate the chair, then holding a vote for his reelection intended to prove he had widespread support in the GOP conference\u2026.Boehner quickly learned again that he does not have enough support in the House GOP conference to win re-election and called off still-preliminary plans to hold the vote on Friday.\n\nBoehner simply headed off his own political demise at the pass \u2013 and in the process, slapped conservatives one last time. As a final parting gift, like a man leaving a lingering fart on a crowded elevator, Boehner will now sign onto a budget deal that would forestall a possible government shutdown over defunding of Planned Parenthood. According to Politico:\n\nNow that he doesn\u2019t have internal political considerations to weigh, Boehner is certain to push through a government-funding bill next week that funds Planned Parenthood and keeps the government open.\n\nAnd according to the Washington Post, it won\u2019t stop with giving Obama his budget:\n\nSome Republicans are speculating that Boehner\u2019s lame-duck status could free his hand to act on other measures that have bipartisan support but are despised by hard-line conservatives. Those measures could include a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, an extension of the federal debt ceiling, or a long-term highway bill. All of them have been opposed by the same conservatives who have pushed for Boehner\u2019s ouster. \u201cHe gets a chance to really go out on a high note and now I think you\u2019ll see a few things in October,\u201d said Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio). \u201cI expect to see a very busy month in October.\u201d\n\nAlready, establishment Republican members of Congress are praising Boehner\u2019s bravery in avoiding a shutdown, handing another major victory to President Obama and Democrats. Boehner, they say, has saved the Republican Party from the right-wing kooks who would ruin it by threatening to defund top Obama priorities. The idea here is that nutjobs like Ted Cruz threaten Republicans with electoral defeat. The conservative SmartSet\u2122 base this opinion on reams of data including massive Republican victories following Cruz\u2019s Obamacare government shutdown.\n\nIt was leadership like this that led to the conservative insurgence against Boehner that has been brewing for years, as covered extensively by Breitbart News.\n\nAccording to media reports, however, this was all wildly unexpected. The bizarre, spur-of-the-moment announcement apparently sprang from Boehner\u2019s visit with the Pope yesterday. Boehner asked the Pope to pray for him. According to Howard Kurtz of Fox News, Boehner decided this morning that he wanted to leave Congress:\n\nBoehner says he told his wife last night he might just quit today, then decided after getting his morning Starbucks \u2014 HowardKurtz (@HowardKurtz) September 25, 2015\n\nLet\u2019s assume, for the moment, that this was true \u2013 that Boehner knew the writing was on the wall, but decided not to fight after sipping a delicious cup of burnt-java steaming diarrhea from Starbucks. Boehner himself said he began thinking about retirement on Thursday night, then decided on Friday morning, \u201cToday\u2019s the day I\u2019m going to do this.\u201d That would be a microcosm of Boehner\u2019s tenure: a blustery belief in victory, followed by a spur-of-the-moment decision to quit.\n\nNo wonder Republicans need new leadership.\n\nPresident Obama, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid have been deeply ruthless advocates on behalf of the partisan left; their decisionmaking process has never been subject to whim. Boehner, who has been consistently outplayed by all three, is the sort of fellow who decides on a moment\u2019s notice to give up the third highest office in the United States. No wonder Boehner got bamboozled over sequestration (he told Republican House members that members of Congress would certainly prevent sequestration from ever taking effect), Obamacare and Planned Parenthood funding, cromnibus funding for executive amnesty, and prevention of the Iran deal.\n\nBoehner\u2019s exit is an excellent development for the Republican Party. At the very least, it should provide some clarity. Those who believe Boehner\u2019s legacy will be one of steady leadership through troubled waters, maintaining a Republican majority in the face of the Obama onslaught, will bring forward their candidate; those who believe Boehner\u2019s legacy will be turning Congress into an evolutionary relic will bring forward their own. The stakes are high; the likelihood of a compromise candidate, a political manipulator willing to grant seats at the table in exchange for power, is higher.\n\nBut Boehner seeks to prevent any conflict between those who think Republican leadership\u2019s main task is to maintain Republican leadership, and those who think Republican leadership\u2019s main task is to stop Obama\u2019s agenda. Instead, he said he had stepped down to stop the \u201cturmoil that\u2019s been churning now for the last couple months,\u201d which is \u201cnot good for the members, and it\u2019s not good for the institution.\u201d That, presumably, would be the same institution Boehner has disgraced by making it a rubber stamp for the dictatorial executive branch.\n\nThus, to quell any potential conflict, Boehner has even anointed a successor: Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). \u201cI think Kevin McCarthy would make an excellent Speaker.\u201d\n\nThat endorsement is a good indicator that the reverse is true.\n\nThe media have a dog in this fight: they want it to seem as though Boehner resigned out of personal annoyance with the stupid right-wing Republicans, rather than because he has become wildly unpopular with voters. But conservatives should not be fooled: we need no more John Boehners. And conservatives should fight to place a proven conservative ideologue at the top of the Congressional food chain, not another \u201cinstitutional\u201d Republican.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
