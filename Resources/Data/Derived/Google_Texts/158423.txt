No. The current administration and my opponent is so pro-oil, that they seem to think that the oil companies can do no wrong. Shell needs to stop running rigs aground, BP and Exxon needs to ensure that any spill can be successfully cleaned up contrary to their record. Paper towels and booms will just not suffice any more. Their are too many legislators with conflicts of interest that should not be voting on these issues and that includes my opponent.
