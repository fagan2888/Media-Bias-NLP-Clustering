For example, many of the complementary authorities to collect intelligence inside the United States are captured in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as amended.\n\nPart I of the order provides general objectives for the intelligence community as well as delineating responsibilities for key personnel in the intelligence community and for their respective organizations.\n\nPart II details the protection for Americans\u2019 civil liberties and bans assassinations and human experimentation.\n\nPart III outlines general provisions to include the explicit requirement that the intelligence community leadership \u201ccooperate with the Congress in the conduct of its responsibilities for oversight of intelligence activities[.]\u201d\n\nIn July 2008, President George W. Bush approved the most sweeping modifications to Executive Order 12333 to ensure that it would be aligned to the enactment of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).\n\nNotwithstanding those revisions in 2008 to incorporate the roles and responsibilities for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the revised order reinforced the overall framework for the activities of America\u2019s intelligence professionals along with specific direction and rules for the governance for the intelligence community and its individual component parts.\n\nThe 2008 amended order defines the roles and responsibilities of the director of national intelligence\u2014a position established in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\u2014and specifically emphasizes the need for intelligence sharing and intelligence community collaboration as it pertains to collection, dissemination, and analysis.\n\nThe revised Executive Order 12333 renewed the direction to intelligence community personnel that they must conduct all intelligence activities in manner that protects the civil liberties and privacy of all U.S. persons, regardless of their location overseas or within the United States.\n\nThe order makes the attorney general responsible to review and approve the procedures for obtaining and handling intelligence collection inside the United States.\n\nIn Jan. 2014, President Barack Obama signed Presidential Policy Directive 28, which expands signals intelligence collection procedures to non-U.S. persons outside the United States.\n\nNotwithstanding the revisions to Executive Order 12333, the order does not authorize the intelligence community to undertake electronic surveillance against U.S. persons, who, by definition, come under the protection of the U.S. Constitution and the Fourth Amendment in particular.\n\nIf there is a national security predicate to collect against a U.S. person, stringent collection approvals and oversight apply. The order calls for the \u201cleast intrusive collection techniques feasible within the United States or directed against United States persons abroad.\u201d\n\nAmerican intelligence is not authorized to apply \u201celectronic surveillance, unconsented physical searches, mail surveillance, physical surveillance, or monitoring devices\u201d unless approved by the head of an agency requesting the coverage as well as the attorney general.\n\nAs amended in 2008, the executive order requires that the director of national intelligence, when considering collection, analysis production, and dissemination of national intelligence, give \u201cfull consideration of the rights of United States persons, whether the information is to be collected inside or outside the United States.\u201d\n\nAll of the intelligence activities are to be conducted in a manner that intentionally constrains collection and dissemination of information on Americans, and those means of information collection and dissemination are subject to significant oversight.\n\nTo learn more about this topic, please join us on March 30 at The Heritage Foundation for an all-day series of in-depth conversations from an all-star lineup of experienced national security experts.\n\nPanelists include:", "article_metadata": {"description": "For more than 30 years every president has used Executive Order 12333 to provide both organizational and implementation direction.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For more than 30 years every president has used Executive Order 12333 to provide both organizational and implementation direction.", "title": "What Guides the US Intelligence Community", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160328_intel_RK.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-29T03:23:08+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UydVM2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For more than 30 years every president has used Executive Order 12333 to provide both organizational and implementation direction.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160328_intel_RK.jpg"}, "title": "What Guides the US Intelligence Community", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "homeland", "published_time": "2016-03-28T21:15:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T03:23:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Part I of the order provides general objectives for the intelligence community as well as delineating responsibilities for key personnel in the intelligence community and for their respective organizations.\nPart III outlines general provisions to include the explicit requirement that the intelligence community leadership \u201ccooperate with the Congress in the conduct of its responsibilities for oversight of intelligence activities[.\nFor more than 30 years, every president has used Executive Order 12333 to provide both organizational and implementation direction to the intelligence community.\nNotwithstanding those revisions in 2008 to incorporate the roles and responsibilities for the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the revised order reinforced the overall framework for the activities of America\u2019s intelligence professionals along with specific direction and rules for the governance for the intelligence community and its individual component parts.\nThe 2008 amended order defines the roles and responsibilities of the director of national intelligence\u2014a position established in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\u2014and specifically emphasizes the need for intelligence sharing and intelligence community collaboration as it pertains to collection, dissemination, and analysis."}
