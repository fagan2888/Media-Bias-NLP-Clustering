Obamacare has already helped \u201ctens of millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nWith more than 8 million people enrolled in health-care plans through Obamacare's insurance exchanges, the law is \u201clooking like a major policy success story,\u201d Krugman wrote.\n\n\u201cThis big improvement in American society is almost surely here to stay,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe conservative health care nightmare -- the one that led Republicans to go all-out against Bill Clinton\u2019s health plans in 1993 and Obamacare more recently -- is that once health care for everyone, or almost everyone, has been put in place, it will be hard to undo, because too many voters have a stake in the system. That\u2019s exactly what is happening.\u201d\n\n2. Obama has actually redistributed wealth.\n\nSure, billionaire investor Warren Buffett is still stumping for a minimum tax rate on all households earning $1 million or more a year. But the rich are paying more in taxes. As Krugman points out,Obama let some of his predecessor George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy expire, and there are provisions in the Affordable Care Act that tax the rich at higher rates to pay for health care.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, the financial aid in Obamacare -- expanded Medicaid, subsidies to help lower-income households pay insurance premiums -- goes disproportionately to less-well-off Americans,\u201d Krugman wrote. \u201cWhen conservatives accuse Obama of redistributing income, they\u2019re not completely wrong -- and liberals should give him credit.\u201d\n\n3. Wall Street reform, while incomplete, is a step up.\n\nPassed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is actually working, Krugman argued. The law designates some banks as \u201csystemically important financial institutions\u201d -- essentially labeling them too big to fail. While some would think Wall Street\u2019s greediest risk-takers would revel in such a classification, as it would seem to create a safety net for failure, banks instead fight to avoid it. It turns out Wall Street types are not happy about the added scrutiny and regulation that follows a bank's being stamped SIFI. And the Obama administration claims that Dodd-Frank gives regulators the ability to close down a failing SIFI without either bailing out its shareholders or bringing down the whole financial system.\n\nTo boot, Dodd-Frank created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Krugman argued is \u201cdoing more to crack down on predatory practices than anything we used to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis may not be the full overhaul of finance we should have had, and it\u2019s not as major as health reform,\u201d Krugman admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot better than nothing.\u201d\n\nAt the core of his essay, Krugman asked two questions: Has Obama changed the country for better? And will his achievements endure?\n\n\u201cThe answer to both questions,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis yes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Banks may still be too big to fail, wages are still flat, and the income gap is still widening, but economist Paul Krugman nevertheless calls President B...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-10-09 16:46:17 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Banks may still be too big to fail, wages are still flat, and the income gap is still widening, but economist Paul Krugman nevertheless calls President B...", "title": "Paul Krugman: Obama's Record On Fighting Inequality Better Than You Think", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/08/krugman-obama_n_5954108.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2146798/images/o-PAUL-KRUGMAN-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Banks may still be too big to fail, wages are still flat, and the income gap is still widening, but economist Paul Krugman nevertheless calls President B...", "creator": "AlexCKaufman", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2146798/images/o-PAUL-KRUGMAN-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Paul Krugman: Obama's Record On Fighting Inequality Better Than You Think", "site": "@HuffPostBiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-08 16:46:17 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5954108", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "business", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Krugman Obama,Paul Krugman,obama legacy,obamacare legacy,Obamacare success,dodd frank,Dodd-Frank Act,krugman rolling stone", "article": {"section": "Business", "tag": "Krugman Obama,Paul Krugman,obama legacy,obamacare legacy,Obamacare success,dodd frank,Dodd-Frank Act,krugman rolling stone", "published_time": "2014-10-08 16:46:17 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-10-08 16:59:06 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7ab\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut it\u2019s a lot better than nothing.\u201dAt the core of his essay, Krugman asked two questions: Has Obama changed the country for better?\nPassed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is actually working, Krugman argued.\nIt turns out Wall Street types are not happy about the added scrutiny and regulation that follows a bank's being stamped SIFI.\nWall Street reform, while incomplete, is a step up.\n\u201cMeanwhile, the financial aid in Obamacare -- expanded Medicaid, subsidies to help lower-income households pay insurance premiums -- goes disproportionately to less-well-off Americans,\u201d Krugman wrote."}
