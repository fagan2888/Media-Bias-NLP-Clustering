The Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s definitions of gender identity and sex stereotypes recognize that protections against sex discrimination should extend to not only Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual people, but to those of all gender identities \u2013 including Transgender individuals and people of non-binary genders.\n\nSection 1557 prohibits most insurers from discriminating on the basis of sex - including gender identity \u2013 when providing health coverage. Discrimination on the basis of gender identity includes:\n\n\u00b7 Blanket exclusions on any transition-related healthcare services;\n\n\u00b7 The denial or limitation of coverage for services used for gender transition when those services would normally be covered when treating a non-transition related health condition; and\n\n\u00b7 The refusal to cover treatment that is typically associated with one particular gender, because an individual identifies with another gender or is listed as having another gender in their medical records or on a personal form of identification.\n\nIt also requires that providers treat individuals in a manner consistent with their gender identity, including in access to health-care facilities. Wherever people are separated or labeled by gender, people are to be treated according to their self- identified gender. Section 1557 applies to all health programs and activities, any part of which receives any Federal financial assistance.\n\nAt this point you\u2019re probably asking yourself, \u201cwhat does this all mean and how will it play out in real life?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s assume Joe goes to his physician\u2019s office with a healthcare plan provided through the marketplace. Joe is seeking hormone therapy as he begins his transition. During testing, Joe is initially told by his physician that he must use the restroom associated with his sex assigned at birth. That same physician then tells him that his insurance will not cover this particular type of hormone treatment as his gender on his birth certificate does not align with the gender on his medical records and his treatment plan is typically not associated with that gender. Under Section 1557 regulations Joe\u2019s insurance provider can be found to be discriminating on the basis of sex as can Joe's physician for preventing him from using facilities consistent with his self-identified gender.\n\nNow let\u2019s move to Alyssa \u2013 Alyssa calls her health insurance provider and is told that if she seeks any transition- related health care services they will not be covered. Under the Section 1557 regulations, Alyssa\u2019s insurance provider can be found to be discriminating on the basis of gender identity which is a form of sex discrimination.\n\nFinally onto Sue \u2013 Sue, who identifies as bisexual, goes to her physician for treatment of a chronic illness and informs them that she has a new partner who is female. Sue\u2019s physician, who was always cordial and receptive, begins to act discourteous and dismissive prior to declining to treat her further. Under the Section 1557 regulations, Sue\u2019s physician can be found to be discriminating based on her stereotypes regarding with whom women should be in relationships which is a type of sex discrimination.\n\nSection 1557 regulations explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity \u2013 making it clear that most insurers cannot deny or limit coverage because a treatment is related to an individual\u2019s gender transition. In addition, the regulation prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex stereotyping, which covers discrimination against lesbian, gay, and bisexual people as well as transgender people.
