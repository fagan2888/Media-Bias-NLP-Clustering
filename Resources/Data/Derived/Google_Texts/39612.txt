How do top chefs celebrate Thanksgiving? Whether you’re cooking a traditional turkey or looking for an alternative, a few of New York’s notable chefs shared some tips with The Wall Street Journal about making your Thanksgiving meal memorable.

“Tradition is what Thanksgiving is all about,” said Elizabeth Karmel, executive chef at Hill Country Barbecue. “I am all abut the turkey, but I learned very early on that the best way to prepare a turkey is to either smoke it or grill it.”

“If you want to do non-traditional, I love whole fish, to be honest with you, on Thanksgiving,” said Dale Talde of Talde Restaurant, who said Thanksgiving was a “learned holiday” for his Filipino family.

Paul Liebrandt, chef at The Elm agreed that fish is a great alternative to turkey and recommended topping it with truffle butter. “You could do a beautiful piece of maybe black bass or a beautiful piece of roasted Atlantic salmon or king salmon, it’s in season right now.”

“If you don’t eat fish, maybe something like taking a piece of this beautiful red curry squash and treating it like a turkey,” said Mr. Liebrandt. “It would be absolutely delicious.”
