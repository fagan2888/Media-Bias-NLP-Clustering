Support staff workers are not part of collective bargaining, and the wage increase is based on the recommendation that was approved by the full board, he said.\n\n\u201cLast year the support staff received a flat raise,\u201d Lech said. \u201cThis year it is a percentage increase.\u201d\n\nSupport staff wages totaled more than $2.38 million for 2015-16. The 4 percent increase, or more than $178,300 increase, on each current employee\u2019s hourly wage for the 2016-17 school term totals more than $2.56 million of the budget.\n\nThe Jamestown Public School District has six categories of support staff that range from paraeducators, custodians and food service staff to kitchen, front desk, librarians, custodians and groundskeepers. The positions also include clerks and secretaries, coordinators, technology workers, homeschool coordinators, test examiners, therapists and department managers.\n\nKen Aune, the music teacher at Jamestown Middle School, presented the Health Insurance Committee report, noting the teachers health insurance fund has a four-month cushion over expenses.\n\n\u201cThe fund is being used well,\u201d Aune said.\n\nThe Health Insurance Committee is working with a consultant to navigate changes with health care laws in the coming year to help avoid unnecessary taxes and costs, he said. Teachers should expect an increase in payments that will be \u201cresponsible and reasonable,\u201d he said.\n\nAn ongoing 18-month study of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in a push to develop its own clinic site that would provide urgent care and general practitioner services for membership, Aune said. This would require partnering with one other area employer to reach the preferred 500 members to make it efficient and cost effective, he said.\n\nThe School Board also unanimously approved a $305,880 bid with bonding from Steve Hutcherson to replace the PoolPak, a heating and dehumidifier unit at the Jamestown High School swimming pool. The School Board also approved an additional $48,930 for air conditioning that will be installed during the construction.\n\nBoth items will come from the school district\u2019s building fund, Lech said.\n\nThe School Board received a written report from Jodi Bayer, president of the Roosevelt Elementary School Parent Teacher Organization. Bayer reported that after seven years of working on a very active board there is little to no parent involvement for the current year, which resulted in the organization disbanding in March.\n\n\u201cWe are trying hard to re-engage families to take on the mantle of leadership but we have not been successful,\u201d Lech said.\n\nAn April 22 letter from the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction said Jamestown Public School District is in substantial compliance with 17 compliance and performance indicators of the Individuals with Disabilities Act.\n\n\u201cThe Jamestown School District and the James Valley Special Education Unit received the highest designation of meets requirements,\u201d Lech said. \u201cI believe it shows the district and unit\u2019s commitment to our students with special needs.\u201d\n\nIn other business, the School Board:\n\n\u2022 unanimously approved $176,028 in textbook purchases for JMS and JHS.\n\n\u2022 recognized Jamestown High School students Mikayla Patel, Kassi Manley, Julia Breidenbach and Emily Lauinger for placing among the finalists at the state speech competition.\n\n\u2022 recognized Lauinger and Patel for being named to the North Dakota All State Speech Team.\n\n\u2022 recognized Fran Silbernagel for his commitment to recycling for the school district.\n\n\u2022 unanimously approved a boys soccer co-op agreement with Pingree-Buchanan Public Schools.\n\n\u2022 unanimously approved the release of contracts for teachers Jodi Zimmerman and Ashley Vinje, and approved hiring Lisa Anderson as an elementary counselor.\n\n\u2022 unanimously approved no-cost tuition agreements for a Barnes County North senior to attend Jamestown Public School and for a JHS sophomore and junior to attend Barnes County North Public School.\n\ntlaventure@jamestownsun.com\n\n(701) 952-8455", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,local,Education", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tom LaVenture", "og": {"site_name": "Jamestown Sun", "description": "The Jamestown Public School Board on Monday approved a 4 percent pay raise for about 150 support staff workers.
