Advocates say only 10 states engage in this optional recovery, and California is the most aggressive state taking advantage of the law.\n\nSB33, a pending Senate bill introduced in 2014 by California state Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), would abolish this practice of the California government.\n\nSeen as Property Rights Violation\n\nGennady Stolyarov, editor-in-chief of The Rational Argumentator, says Confiscation of the estates of deceased Medicaid recipients is an unconscionable violation of private property rights, especially with Medicaid becoming the sole recourse for paying for health care for a growing segment of the population.\n\n\u201cFor such Medicaid recipients, a modest home may be one of their only major assets and a significant source of economic stability and hope for a more prosperous future,\u201d Stolyarov said. \u201cIf a deceased person\u2019s home is confiscated by Medi-Cal or another state\u2019s Medicaid program, then it cannot be passed to surviving family members, who might struggle to find an affordable shelter as a result.\u201d\n\nStolyarov says the estate recovery program is an example of an extremely hardhearted government program that forces people to suffer because of family members\u2019 prior debts or health care needs.\n\n\u201cA person should not lose the family home because one of his or her deceased parents had little or no income and took recourse to Medicaid to pay for treatments for terminal cancer or another terrible disease,\u201d Stolyarov said. \u201cThis is especially true given the fact most Medicaid recipients have no easy way of knowing their estates are put in jeopardy when they sign up for the program.\u201d\n\nThis situation also sends a cautionary message about socialized health care arrangements purporting to provide \u201cfree\u201d medical care, Stolyarov says.\n\n\u201cThere is always a cost, and there are always strings attached when any aspect of health care is centrally planned,\u201d said Stolyarov.\n\nLikened to Death Tax\n\nSeton Motley, president of the public policy organization Less Government, says it\u2019s unfair for Medi-Cal to engage in estate recovery when citizens have been paying into the program for years in the expectation it will cover them at the end of their life.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. House of Representatives just passed a repeal of the death tax,\u201d Motley said. \u201cThis is another death tax, and the Republicans\u2019 message should be, \u2018This is a death tax too, and we\u2019re getting rid of the states\u2019 option to come after you when you are already dead.\u2019\u201d\n\nSally Pipes, president of the Pacific Research Institute, agrees Medi-Cal\u2019s asset recovery system is just a second death tax.\n\n\u201cCalifornia needs more revenue because people with money are leaving the state and people who [rely on] entitlements are coming into the state,\u201d Pipes said.\n\nThe government and the people who are still in California can\u2019t afford all the entitlement programs the state has, and for the government to take funds from people who are on Medi-Cal or from their estate is just wrong, Pipes says.\n\n\u201cI like to say the Department of Motor Vehicles doesn\u2019t offer insurance to people, and it doesn\u2019t sell cars,\u201d Pipes said. \u201cSo why should the California health care system and Medi-Cal make decisions about what kind of care people can get and whether they have coverage or not? It\u2019s completely wrong.\n\n\u201cBut the state needs the money,\u201d Pipes said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the liberal mentality to take it.\u201d\n\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is managing editor of Health Care News.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nSen.
