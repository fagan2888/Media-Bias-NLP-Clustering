For workers, that can be good and bad.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nAn Uber car is seen parked with the driver's lunch left on the dashboard in Los Angeles, Calif.\n\nMillions of Americans now work in the so-called \u201cgig economy,\u201d where hours and pay are variable and benefits are of the few or none variety.\n\nIt spans all manner of services from home health care to janitorial work, to employment that happens at the touch of an app (odd jobs via TaskRabbit, home cleaning from Handy, and of course Uber of Lyft for rides).\n\nPlenty of people find a be-your\u200b-own-boss \u200bfulfill\u200b\u200bment, but in general the gig sector comes with lower pay and lower job satisfaction than standard jobs. It's also the arena of legal controversies \u2013 including a prominent hearing scheduled for Thursday on whether many of these workers should be classified as employees rather than independent contractors.\n\nRecommended: Do you belong on the road? Take our driver's test.\n\n\u200bSo now, a question of the times is whether gig-economy workers are entitled to greater protections and support, either from enforcing existing labor laws or crafting new laws designed for an era of work without formal jobs.\n\n\u201cA lot of people like the flexibility. The biggest downside is that our social insurance system has been built around jobs,\u201d says Gerald Friedman, an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.\n\nProtections designed for people who work as employees include the minimum wage, overtime pay, family and medical leave, unemployment insurance, and workers\u2019 compensation for people injured at work. Similarly, the prevailing systems of health insurance and retirement savings also were designed for people working traditional jobs.\n\nThe issue is a hot one in part because of the rise of services where an app purports to be a middleman between customers and contractors. But it\u2019s also welling up as a political concern because the post-recession job market has remained far weaker than normal \u2013 with many Americans feeling stuck in part-time or on-demand work.\n\nWhat it's like working for Uber\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Uber has become the symbolic focal point, facing a hearing in federal court in California Thursday that could open the doors to a major class-action lawsuit. If the lawsuit goes ahead, it could challenge the view that sharing economy workers should be classified as independent contractors rather than employees, who would be entitled to benefits and minimum wage protections.\n\nRecommended: With big growth for the sharing economy, has it become selfish?\n\nDepending on how you look at it, the company called Uber is either a marvel of digital-age convenience or a fundamental threat to the notion that honest work arranged by a large company should come with decent pay and benefits attached. In this case, Uber has an estimated market value of some $50 billion.\n\nThe controversy goes far beyond the business of hailing rides by smartphone app. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton recently struck an ambivalent note, acknowledging the innovation that\u2019s occurring but saying that \u201cit\u2019s also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.\u201d\n\nShe stopped short of taking a side specifically in the Uber lawsuit, but urged a crackdown in general on \u201con bosses who exploit employees by mis-classifying them as contractors.\u201d\n\nWhy does the Uber case seem complicated?\n\nFor one thing, many of the drivers have no complaint with the company about their status. Lots of them already have other jobs \u2014 in many cases full time ones \u2014 and give rides as a way to earn some extra income on the side.\n\n\u201cYou make pretty good money\u201d if you manage to show up in a location where prices are surging due to high demand, says Jason, one Chicago-area Uber driver who asked that his full name not be used in this article.\n\nHe and his wife both work other jobs, which come with benefits. The Uber income is helping them put aside some money to help their 10-year-old twin boys go to college.\n\nSo, from Jason\u2019s view, the driving gig is what it is. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine doing Uber as my only job,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it pays enough.\u201d\n\nYet he calls it the perfect part-time job. He finds it pleasant to converse with customers, and he sets his own hours. \u201cThe vast majority of people are very, very friendly, to the point where it\u2019s restored my faith in humanity.\u201d\n\nAnd Jason has no problem with the contractor label \u2013 including the extra tax work required as he reports his ride-based income and figures out the related deductions for mileage on his car. (The gig economy is also called the 1099 economy, named after the IRS form that independent contractors use instead of a W-2 form for wages.)\n\nSimilarly, Alex is a relatively new Uber driver in Philadelphia, who sees it as a decent source of part-time income. He\u2019s getting a second degree in computer science while his wife works as a nurse.\n\nBut he\u2019s not counting on it beyond the short term: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of drivers making more over time,\u201d Alex says, referring to instances in various cities where Uber has reduced fares.\n\nEmployer or not?\n\nThe lawsuit says Uber acts like an employer by setting prices (it then takes a cut of the revenue from each ride), having the power to fire drivers, and setting forth \u201ca litany of detailed requirements\u201d on things like conduct with customers and vehicle cleanliness.\n\nUber says it\u2019s not an employer because it doesn\u2019t hire people or set their hours.\n\nThe firm also points to the high number of drivers who say they have other full- or part-time jobs, and who cite setting their own schedule as a key reason they\u2019re Uber drivers. Many use their cars to drive for rival services such as Lyft, whereas a traditional employee wouldn\u2019t typically work for a competing firm.\n\nMany gig economy firms are facing similar legal obstacles. Handy, a housecleaning app, is facing lawsuits from contractors in California and Massachusetts. Lyft, Shyp, and laundry-service Washio all have seen similar lawsuits filed against them.\n\nAnd the California labor board in June ruled that an Uber worker should be classified as an employee \u2013 a ruling that only affects that employee. A Florida labor board made a similar ruling in May. Both are being appealed by the company.\n\n\u201cDefendants hold themselves out as nothing more than a neutral technological platform, designed simply to enable drivers and passengers to transact the business of transportation,\u201d the California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office. \u201cThe reality, however, is that defendants are involved in every aspect of the operation.\u201d\n\nIn an online forum for Uber drivers (\u200bUberPeople.net)\u200b, one participant described things this way: \"Uber's whole game regarding everything is to make everything some weird frayed-line, grey area where nothing is their responsibility. It's ride share but Uber is \"everyone's private driver\". We're IC but we have rules, answer to bosses, and can be fired. We're illegal cabs but it's okay because we're not cabs. We earn $35/hr except we \u200b... don't\u200b.\"\u200b\n\nA benefit-less economy?\n\nUber and other app-based services occupy a specific niche in the economy, but also symbolize the broader questions surrounding the gig economy. Perhaps the most basic are these: Is the economy evolving away from full-time jobs with benefits, and if so what should be done about it?\n\nIt may take a while for the answers to become clear.\n\nThe overall size of the gig economy, for example, is hard to pin down. According to data from the General Social Survey, the number of people working as independent contractors fell slightly between 2006 and 2010. But the number of temp-agency and on-call workers edged up, and the number of part-time workers surged due to the recession, according to the same survey, summarized in a recent Government Accountability Office report.\n\nWhat\u2019s clearer, though, is that an era when workers often had long tenure at a single employer, and when jobs came with health benefits, paid vacations, and defined pensions, has been gradually fading.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act was designed to help address the health insurance piece of that puzzle. It aims to help the uninsured shop for coverage in a marketplace, often with federal tax subsidies.\n\nOther pieces of the puzzle may need new legislation, from new income-support programs to job training. Some policy experts have proposed a new \u201cdependent contractor\u201d classification of work, with a package of benefits supported by a tax on employers.\n\nFor its part, the Labor Department recently weighed in with guidelines seeking to clarify the line between employees and contractors.\n\nDavid Weil, the department's wage-and-hour admin\u200bistrator, said such clarification \"may be more important now than ever\u200b\" due to the spread of misclassification.\u200b The issue, he wrote, \"has critical implications for the legal protections that workers receive, particularly when misclassification occurs in industries employing low wage workers.\n\nThe long history of job insecurity\n\nFor better or worse, job and income insecurity has historically been more the rule than the exception. The US was largely a nation of farmers, then a newly industrial nation where workers had few protections.\n\n\u201cThe idea of a career with a job ladder \u2026 [and] benefits is barely a hundred years old,\u201d says Professor Friedman in Massachusetts.\n\nOver time, he says, companies began investing substantially in worker training, partly to ensure they didn\u2019t run short of good workers during boom times in the post-war era of the 1950s and beyond.\n\nThese days, with labor not looking like such a scarce commodity, the pendulum seems to have swung the other way. Many employers have been striving to drive down their fixed costs for labor.\n\nMany app-based services are based on the idea of workers fending for themselves. TaskRabbit makes clear that its \u201ctaskers\u201d aren\u2019t employees but independent contractors who bargain for their own pay rates and choose their own hours and jobs.\n\nOther businesses in the app arena have started to shift toward an employee model. Some Instacart shoppers are now cruising through grocery stores as employees.\n\nThe shift toward more fluid work arrangements has an important up side, Friedman says. The trend can help ensure that workers don\u2019t feel trapped in the wrong job. \u201cSo many people\u2019s parents were stuck in jobs they hated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for people\u2019s morale,\u201d or for the overall economy.\n\nAnd at Uber, some drivers say the work can be a main source of income, even under their current status as contractors.\n\nEddie Moreno, a driver in North Miami Beach, Fla., says he makes $18 to $30 an hour, depending on how busy he stays and whether he can hit the sweet spots where prices are surging.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a set plan for how you\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re not going to make it,\u201d Mr. Moreno says. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to waste gas\u201d chasing price surges that prove to be fleeting.\n\nThe work has its challenges. Moreno describes one instance where his driver rating fell, apparently because one customer was too inebriated to use the app normally.\n\nFor Moreno, the work beats restaurant jobs he\u2019s tried in the past, so he doesn\u2019t worry much about whether his label is officially employer or contractor. But he\u2019s also looking ahead to other career options.\n\n\u201cI want to help people,\u201d perhaps through work as a fitness trainer or in health care, he says.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "93be1fe7a38fb8feabc00963a8cf223f", "sailthru.author": "Mark Trumbull", "description": "The success of ride-sharing service Uber typifies a new class of business without benefits or regular hours or job security.
