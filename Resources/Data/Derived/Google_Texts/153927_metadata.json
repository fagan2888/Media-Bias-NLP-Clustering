(Photo: Staff Sgt. Joy Dulen/Army)\n\nTricare will begin covering the cost of breast pumps and lactation counseling services for new moms starting July 1.\n\nUnder an update to the Tricare policy manual released Friday, the military health program will expand lactation benefits for new mothers to include manual or electric breast pumps, some supplies and outpatient counseling services.\n\nThe change is retroactive to Dec. 19, 2014, so Tricare beneficiaries who obtained these supplies or services on or after that date may be eligible for reimbursement if they meet the requirements.\n\nAccording to the new policy, Tricare will cover \u2014 at no cost or co-payment \u2014 one manual or standard electric breast pump per birth as well as supplies such as power adapters, storage bags and special bottles to beneficiaries with a prescription.\n\nBreast pump kits also are covered, as are outpatient lactation counseling services \u2014 up to six sessions \u2014 provided the counseling is done by a Tricare-approved provider.\n\nCovered items must be obtained from a Tricare-authorized provider, supplier or vendor to be covered, but according to Tricare, any civilian store or pharmacy meets that criterion.\n\nIf items are purchased at a retail store or online, beneficiaries need to file a claim for reimbursement.\n\nTo be eligible for reimbursement, Tricare beneficiaries must file a claim form along with a current prescription and itemized receipts for equipment and supplies.\n\nThe fiscal 2015 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Defense Health Agency change its lactation coverage policies to align them with the provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which requires private insurers to cover rental or purchase of breast pumps, support and counseling at no cost.\n\nThe new policy also provides for coverage of hospital-grade breast pumps for moms whose infants are unable to nurse directly because of illness, birth defects, adoption or other medical conditions.\n\nIt does not pay for supplies such as batteries and battery packs, regular baby bottles, travel bags, cleaning supplies, nursing bras and pads and other tangential nursing items, such as specialty garments or medicated ointments.\n\nA Tricare official said more details on the benefit and its implementation will be released sometime in the next two weeks.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://militari.ly/1IyZ2TZ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tricare will begin covering the cost of breast pumps and lactation counseling services for new moms starting July 1.", "og": {"site_name": "MilitaryTimes", "description": "Tricare will begin covering the cost of breast pumps and lactation counseling services for new moms starting July 1.", "title": "Breast pumps, nursing supplies to be covered by Tricare", "url": "http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/benefits/health-care/2015/06/08/breastfeeding-tricare-ndaa-2015-covered/28685915/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/militarytimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tricare will begin covering the cost of breast pumps and lactation counseling services for new moms starting July 1.", "title": "Breast pumps, nursing supplies to be covered by Tricare", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20b76c0d2a02af7ed6565fa1a244e51146ab6253/c=720-0-3568-2848&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/08/GGM/MilitaryTimes/635693750202355511-1972454.jpg", "creator": "@MilitaryTimes", "site": "@MilitaryTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 349179911903738}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Tricare, nursing, lactation, breastfeeding, Defense Department, Defense Health Agency, health benefits"}, "article_summary": "Joy Dulen/Army)Tricare will begin covering the cost of breast pumps and lactation counseling services for new moms starting July 1.\nIt does not pay for supplies such as batteries and battery packs, regular baby bottles, travel bags, cleaning supplies, nursing bras and pads and other tangential nursing items, such as specialty garments or medicated ointments.\nBreast pump kits also are covered, as are outpatient lactation counseling services \u2014 up to six sessions \u2014 provided the counseling is done by a Tricare-approved provider.\nUnder an update to the Tricare policy manual released Friday, the military health program will expand lactation benefits for new mothers to include manual or electric breast pumps, some supplies and outpatient counseling services.\nTo be eligible for reimbursement, Tricare beneficiaries must file a claim form along with a current prescription and itemized receipts for equipment and supplies."}
