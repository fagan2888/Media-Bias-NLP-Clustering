A joint initiative by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor is examining Form 5500 filings for the plan year ending in 2011 to smoke out those sponsors that have yet to file but were required to.

The initiative is being overseen by the Employee Plans Compliance Unit at the IRS and the Office of the Chief Accountant at the DOL, according to information released on the IRSâ€™s website earlier in September.
