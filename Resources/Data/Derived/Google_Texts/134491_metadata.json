But the claim that Republicans would increase Medicare costs by $6,000 per beneficiary is a story Democrats use to scare senior citizens \u2014 and it\u2019s just as false.\n\nThe fact is, the current Republican proposal is modeled on a plan that would lower seniors\u2019 Medicare premiums and total medical costs by 6 percent, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. And past and present GOP \u201cpremium support\u201d proposals wouldn\u2019t have applied to anyone already getting Medicare.\n\nFurthermore, CBO has now effectively retracted the $6,000 figure on which Democrats have always tried to base their claim.\n\nRepublicans have their own fairy tale about Medicare \u2014 the claim that Democrats are paying for Obamacare \u201con the backs\u201d of seniors by cutting $700 billion in benefits. Both of these distortions are currently on display in a high-profile Senate race in Kentucky.\n\nThe latest example of Democrats\u2019 spooky tale shows up in a TV ad by Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic opponent of Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\n\nThe Grimes TV spot first appeared July 8. In it, she sits next to an older man, Don Disney of Cloverlick, Kentucky, who puts the old Democratic ghost story in the form of a question for McConnell: \u201cSenator, I\u2019m a retired coal miner and I want to know how you could have voted to raise my Medicare costs by $6,000.\u201d\n\nThe answer is, McConnell did no such thing. Nor did any other Republican.\n\nThe 2011 GOP Plan\n\nThe Grimes ad cites McConnell\u2019s 2011 vote in favor of considering the nonbinding budget resolution that had been drafted by Rep. Paul Ryan and passed by the Republican-controlled House. That budget called for phasing out traditional, government-administered Medicare and replacing it gradually with a \u201cpremium support\u201d system of government-subsidized private insurance (similar to the current Medicare Advantage plans already preferred by 30 percent of today\u2019s seniors).\n\nIt\u2019s true that CBO\u2019s analysis of that plan estimated that anyone enrolled in the \u201cpremium support\u201d plans would pay $6,000 more in 2020 than under traditional Medicare. But the retired coal miner in Grimes\u2019 ad would not have been among them \u2014 nor would anyone already on Medicare. The original Ryan plan proposed to phase in the new system only for those younger than 55, as they reached age 65.\n\nIn the past we\u2019ve repeatedly called out Democrats for stating or implying that the 2011 plan would have cost $6,000 more for current Medicare recipients. In this case, the claim is stated plainly. Disney\u2019s reference to \u201cmy Medicare costs\u201d leads us to assume \u2014 as any viewer surely would \u2014 that he is already on Medicare. Seniors generally qualify for Medicare at age 65. When we spoke to Disney by phone, he would not give his age, and neither would the Grimes campaign. The McConnell campaign puts Disney\u2019s age at 75.\n\nCBO\u2019s Retracted Figure\n\nIt\u2019s also now clear that the CBO\u2019s $6,000 estimate was wrong to begin with, and CBO has effectively retracted it. CBO now says its 2011 report was a \u201crough analysis\u201d based on assumptions that have proven invalid.\n\nIn a report issued Sept. 18, it says the earlier figure was based on assumptions that have turned out to be incorrect. \u201cCBO projected for that earlier report that health care spending covered by private plans would be much higher initially and would grow faster than the agency currently estimates,\u201d CBO said. The same goes for premiums charged by private health plans, which have turned out to be lower than CBO estimated in 2011.\n\nAlso, CBO said that \u201cthere [have] been substantial improvements in CBO\u2019s modeling of the behavior of beneficiaries and insurers\u201d since the original estimate. It said the earlier estimate failed to capture \u201cthe full effects of a competitive system on federal spending or payments by beneficiaries.\u201d\n\nCBO did not give a new figure. But it said that the 2011 estimate was \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than it is currently estimating for either of two \u201cpremium support\u201d options covered by the Sept. 18 report.\n\nOne of those \u201cpremium support\u201d options, in fact, would produce a 6 percent savings in total health costs \u2014 counting both premiums and out-of-pocket payments for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance. And in fact, that\u2019s the model for the current GOP proposal.\n\nTo be sure, CBO noted that Ryan\u2019s 2011 plan differed from the options it was evaluating. For one, the old Ryan plan did not include traditional Medicare as a premium-support option, which would have put pressure on private insurers to keep payment rates to providers low. But the current GOP plan keeps traditional Medicare as an option.\n\nThe 2014 GOP Plan\n\nAs we have noted before, the plan Ryan proposed in 2011 was a work in progress. His budget plans in subsequent years have been more generous in regard to Medicare spending. His latest is modeled on the more generous of the two options that CBO studied.\n\nThe key change in the 2014 Ryan plan is to base the amount the federal government would pay for each beneficiary on the average of all bids submitted by private insurance companies plus traditional Medicare, rather than on the second-lowest bid as earlier Ryan plans had done. The 2011 plan was even less generous than that, tying the growth of premium-support payments to inflation.\n\nCBO found that if the average-bid method is implemented in 2018, beneficiaries would pay in 2020 an average of 6 percent less in total costs \u2014 for Medicare Part A (hospitalization) and Part B (physician services) combined \u2014 than under the current system.\n\nOn the other hand, if the government sets the amount it will pay based on the second-lowest bid from insurers, then total costs to beneficiaries would go up \u2014 by 11 percent.\n\nCBO did not give a dollar amount of the change in beneficiary costs for either option \u2014 except to say both were much lower than its 2011 estimate for Ryan\u2019s old plan. It also estimated that taxpayers would see a savings of 4 percent in 2020 under the average-bid option, and 11 percent under the less generous second-lowest-bid option.\n\nThe latest Ryan budget changes to the more generous average-bid method, according to Derrick Dockery, a spokesman for the House Budget Committee. He confirmed to us by email: \u201cThe most recent budget (for fiscal year 2015) referenced CBO\u2019s report and moved to an average-bid model.\u201d The House Budget Committee\u2019s latest budget report notes (on page 59) that CBO \u201cfound that a program in which the premium support payment was based on the average bid of participating plans would result in savings for affected beneficiaries as well as the federal government.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s most recent budget plan also scrapped a cap on Medicare spending contained in earlier versions.\n\nThe latest GOP plan differs from the CBO \u201caverage bid\u201d proposal in a couple of ways. CBO\u2019s plan would begin in 2018, but Ryan\u2019s latest plan would start in 2024. Also, Ryan\u2019s plan would keep those who were age 55 or older in 2013 in traditional Medicare, while the CBO plan would give everybody the choice of traditional Medicare or a subsidized private plan. Thus, the potential savings to the government and beneficiaries would be less under Ryan\u2019s latest plan than under CBO\u2019s.\n\nCampaign Responses\n\nIn defense of its ad, the Grimes campaign cites a potential cost to retired coal miner Disney (and other seniors) from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, which the 2011 Ryan plan also proposed. Obamacare provides no-cost preventive care, such as cancer screenings, and slowly closes the so-called \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage. Those benefits would have been scrapped under Ryan\u2019s 2011 budget, as well as the most recent one.\n\nSo the Grimes ad might have been right if Disney had just said McConnell voted to cut his benefits \u2014 without any reference to a $6,000 figure. But how much would depend heavily on whether or not Disney is enrolled in Medicare\u2019s Part D, which provides prescription drug coverage, and on whether he is among the relative few who have drug costs high enough to place them in the \u201cdoughnut hole\u201d coverage gap.\n\nUnder the doughnut hole this year, Medicare Part D covers prescription costs, minus a deductible and copays, up to $2,850 in total costs for a beneficiary. Coverage doesn\u2019t pick back up again until a beneficiary reaches $4,550 in total out-of-pocket expenses, or $6,691 in total drug costs. The ACA began offering discounts on drugs purchased in the gap in 2011 and slowly closes the gap by 2020.\n\nBut the odds are, Disney isn\u2019t among those affected. Of the more than 49.4 million covered by Medicare, about 7.9 million saved money on prescription drugs because of the ACA, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s roughly 16 percent. In Kentucky, in 2013, the ACA discounts saved 82,261 beneficiaries an average of $985, HHS said. That\u2019s way short of $6,000, even assuming Disney was among those beneficiaries.\n\nAs we\u2019ve noted, McConnell\u2019s 2011 vote was on a motion to proceed to consider the Ryan budget. The motion failed on a mostly party-line vote, so there was no Senate vote on the Ryan budget itself. The McConnell campaign said, \u201cThere is no way to speculate if [McConnell] would have voted for final passage without having debated amendments.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true enough, and we won\u2019t speculate how McConnell might have voted, or what amendments he might have supported, if any. We\u2019ll just note that his campaign isn\u2019t saying anything about those matters, one way or the other.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s Equally Misleading Claim\n\nProving that Democrats aren\u2019t the only ones with years-old senior-scare tactics, the McConnell campaign launched a response ad that makes its own misleading claim about Medicare. It says that Obamacare \u201ccuts $700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare,\u201d a tired line that we deemed a whopper in 2012, and before.\n\nThe GOP talking point is misleading for several reasons: The Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t slash $700 billion from the current Medicare budget; instead, this is a cut in the future growth of spending over a decade. Furthermore, the reductions apply to payments made to hospitals and other non-physician providers, and it remains to be seen whether those would translate into reduced services. Finally \u2014 and most ironic \u2014 that same $700 billion in \u201ccuts\u201d is part of the Ryan budget plan that McConnell voted to consider.\n\nThe McConnell camp launched the ad just one day after the Grimes ad aired. Citing an Associated Press fact-check of Grimes\u2019 TV spot, the McConnell response says that news media said Grimes was using \u201cshaky claims to mischaracterize Mitch McConnell\u2019s record.\u201d On screen, we see \u201cshaky claims\u201d and \u201cmischaracterizing Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s voting record,\u201d two accurate quotes from the AP\u2019s July 8 article, with the latter quote coming from the photo caption. The ad also says the media called the Medicare claim \u201claughable,\u201d an accurate quote from a June Washington Post fact-check of the same $6,000 claim from Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall. The Post\u2018s Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler, wrote that the old chestnut was \u201cso out of date as to be laughable.\u201d\n\nSo far so good for the McConnell response, but the Kentucky senator couldn\u2019t leave well enough alone. The ad continues: \u201cThe truth? Grimes supports Obamacare, which cuts 700 billion from seniors\u2019 Medicare. That\u2019s how Obama and Grimes will pay for Obamacare.\u201d On screen, we see the false line that \u201cObama and Grimes will pay for Obamacare on the backs of Kentucky seniors.\u201d\n\nGrimes hasn\u2019t said she supports the Medicare financing provision of the ACA, and it remains to be seen whether seniors in Kentucky or anywhere else will feel any effect from those reductions in the growth of future payments to hospitals and insurance companies.\n\nGrimes hasn\u2019t said whether or not she would have voted for the Affordable Care Act, but instead has supported working to \u201cfix\u201d the law and has criticized McConnell\u2019s call for a full repeal. According to the Courier-Journal, she issued a statement in the spring saying that the ACA \u201cis not perfect,\u201d adding: \u201cWe must investigate and address the botched national roll-out, offer relief to small businesses, make sure individuals can keep their current plans, and address affordability issues.\u201d\n\nThe more glaring problem with McConnell\u2019s claim about Medicare \u201ccuts\u201d is that the money isn\u2019t being taken away from seniors. By reducing the future growth of a decade of Medicare spending by $700 billion, the ACA \u2014 and, also, Ryan\u2019s GOP budget \u2014 stretches out Medicare financing so it lasts longer than was previously expected. Most of the savings come from reducing the growth of payments to hospitals, which are paid by Medicare Part A, funded by payroll taxes.\n\nRyan\u2019s budget keeps the ACA\u2019s cuts, because \u2014 confusing campaign rhetoric to the contrary \u2014 both parties want to slow the growth of Medicare spending, as we\u2019ve explained in detail before.\n\nWe called the 2012 presidential election \u201ca campaign full of Mediscare.\u201d The 2014 midterms are no different.\n\n\u2014 Brooks Jackson, Robert Farley and Lori Robertson\n\n\n\nCorrection, Aug. 28: We originally wrote that the no-cost preventive care for Medicare beneficiaries under the Affordable Care Act included flu shots. The ACA requires private plans on the individual and small-group markets to cover flu shots without cost-sharing, but Medicare already had done so since 1993.
