That way, we would escape the debility and indignity that accompany old age and avoid being burdens to our children and other loved ones. And we would have the solace of not outliving our productivity. After all, he writes, \u201cby 75, creativity, originality, and productivity are pretty much gone for the vast, vast majority of us.\u201d Emanuel has no plan to commit suicide if he reaches seventy-five, he says. But he plans to reject all medical treatments, even routine ones, that go beyond the palliative.\n\nEmanuel rightly mocks \u201cAmerican immortals\u201d who seem to believe they should (and maybe will!) live forever. And, in a culture like ours, which values youth and professional achievement virtually above everything else, his argument has a kind of plausibility. I\u2019ve had 25-year-old students tell me they already feel over the hill. Why linger on into your eighties or nineties, when your best days and accomplishments are far behind you? Plus, society would save lots of money if people stopped seeking medical care at seventy-five.\n\nNonetheless, there\u2019s a serious flaw in Emanuel\u2019s thinking. Strength, health, creativity\u0097these are good things, but they are not the only things that give life meaning. From a Christian perspective, for example, the point of life is to express gratitude to and love for the Lord, and this we can do at any age. In the fullness of time, God will call each of us; until then, we have to try our best. There\u2019s no point rushing Him.\n\nNot everyone believes this, of course. But one needn\u2019t be a Christian, or a religious believer of any kind, to appreciate that old age has some things to offer. \u201cFor old men who are reasonable and neither cross-grained nor churlish find old age tolerable enough: whereas unreason and churlishness cause uneasiness at every time of life,\u201d said the pagan Cicero. And one needn\u2019t be a religious believer to see that the elderly may still have much to contribute to us, even if they are weak, sick, and no longer able to write symphonies.\n\nIn a lovely response to Emanuel, my friend, John McGinnis, explains this, offering his own parents as an example. John does a much better job than I could, so I\u2019ll just quote him:\n\nBut youth and good health do not measure humanity. Millions in diminished health enjoy life, being with their relatives, laughing at old movies, even just sitting in the breeze and sunshine. And their relatives and friends enjoy being with them. Indeed, they may find in the elderly\u2019s struggle with aging an inspiration and a reaffirmation of life. In caring for the frail, weak and sometimes woebegone, they may also expand their own sympathies and express some small measure of gratitude for the debt of a good upbringing that can never be fully repaid. That is certainly my experience watching my parents age well past 75. I have never admired my father more than when at the cusp of ninety he faces down his own infirmities and cares for my mother who has Parkinson\u2019s disease. And although much is taken from my mother, much abides\u0097her concern for others, her delight in reading new novels and rereading old ones. Emanuel argues that in seeing the decline of those we love, we may forget our happy memories of them in their years of vigor and achievement. But those memories do not need to summoned at particular times, because they infuse my being. In any event, the most valuable memories of all are not defined by physical wellbeing but by spirit and character. For so many people beyond 75 the forging of character continues and the power of their spirit at their end will instruct us by example at our own.\n\nFor one important thing, though, Emanuel is to be commended. Most of us do our best to ignore our mortality and the questions it raises about how we\u2019re living our lives. As Pascal observed long ago, people will do pretty much anything to distract themselves and avoid thinking about it. That\u2019s not wise; even a long life goes by so very fast. Every writer knows the benefits of deadlines: They force you to concentrate and get serious. Well, Emanuel says, he\u2019s given himself a deadline.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "In a much-discussed Atlantic essay, \u201cWhy I Hope to Die at 75,\u201d Ezekiel Emanuel\u0097physician, public commentator, and prominent supporter of the Affordable Care Act\u0097argues that we\u2019d all be better off if we died at 75.
