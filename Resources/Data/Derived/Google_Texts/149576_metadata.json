Nevada\u2019s status as a purple state and its Latino population are catching candidates\u2019 attention. (Isaac Brekken/For The Washington Post)\n\nLaura Aguilera is 19 and works seven days a week in this city in the baking Nevada desert to earn money for nursing school. So, she explained after a 10-hour shift at Los Lupes Mexican restaurant, \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to focus on who is running for president yet.\u201d\n\nBut unprecedented efforts to get Aguilera\u2019s attention are beginning all around her because her vote, and those of the growing number of Latinos who live in battleground states like this one, is considered vital to winning the White House in 2016.\n\nJeb Bush and Marco Rubio, the two Republican presidential candidates seen as having the greatest chance to make inroads with the Latino vote that traditionally leans Democratic, recently stopped in Nevada, Bush showcasing his fluent Spanish and Rubio highlighting that he is the son of Cuban immigrants. Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed 1,200 Latino leaders gathered in Las Vegas last week and said that she would do more than President Obama \u2014 and certainly far more than any Republican rival \u2014 to stop deportations and enact \u00adimmigration reform.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign is registering voters outside Hispanic grocery stores and churches, while a conservative group backed by the billionaire Koch brothers is compiling valuable contact lists as it offers free services, such as driver\u2019s license prep classes, in Spanish. And, critically for a demographic that skews young, campaigns are creating bilingual Web sites, videos and messaging for Facebook and other digital platforms.\n\n\u201cI have never seen the Latino vote prioritized in this way \u2014 and this early \u2014 in a meaningful way,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Alex, president of the Democratic-backed Latino Victory Project.\n\nPotential voter Laura Aguilera, 19, has little time to focus on politics, but cares about immigration: \u201cIt\u2019s a really important issue for me.\u201d (Isaac Brekken/For The Washington Post)\n\nBecause Nevada hosts one of the first primaries and is a purple state \u2014 it went for Obama for president in 2008 and 2012 but overwhelmingly reelected Republican Brian Sandoval for governor in 2014 \u2014 both parties are putting in early and extra efforts here. Twenty-seven percent of Nevada\u2019s population, and about 16 percent of its eligible voters, are Hispanic, and each party sees the vote of Aguilera and people like her as both critical and gettable.\n\n\u201cI am way more interested in what the person says, not what party they are from,\u201d Aguilera said.\n\nThe U.S.-born daughter of Mexican immigrants, she is the face of a changing state and nation. Her city of 18,262 people ringed by spectacular red rock that rises out of the desert was founded by a few Mormon families a century ago. Because of nearby Nellis Air Force Base and \u201can old-fashioned, flag-waving community feel,\u201d many retired military veterans settled here, Mayor Allan Litman said.\n\nAbout 15 years ago, Mesquite got into the casino business, and thousands more people, many of them of Mexican heritage, moved in and went to work in the new hotels and restaurants.\n\n\u201cThe makeup of the city has dramatically changed,\u201d said Litman, 72, who teaches a spin class at the rec center. Half of all school-age children and as much as 30 percent of the town is Hispanic.\n\nNationally, 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year, making them eligible to vote. The largest numbers of Latinos live in California and Texas. But the focus on the Latino vote for 2016 is sharpest in states both parties see as up for grabs: Nevada, Florida, New Mexico, Colorado and a handful of others, such as Virginia, where no party is dominant and Latinos, though not as numerous, can play a significant role.\n\nObama won all of these states in 2012.\n\nJust look at the electoral college map, said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a center-left think tank. \u201cThere is no path for Republicans to win the presidency in 2016 without flipping heavily Hispanic states\u201d that went for Obama, he said, which is why \u201cunprecedented amounts of money will be spent speaking to this community.\u201d\n\nDaniel Garza, the executive director of LIBRE, the Koch-backed initiative offering free services to Hispanics in many battleground states, said Republicans cannot afford to have the Democrats win 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, as Obama did in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe intend to double down our efforts\u201d in this \u201cconstituency at a crossroads,\u201d Garza said. Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t need to win a majority, just inch it up.\u201d\n\nMore Latinos are registered as Democrats, but Republicans say they see an opening because so many are young and without hardened, partisan voting habits and because many hold some conservative social values, including opposition to abortion rights.\n\nSo far, Clinton\u2019s campaign is the most visible on the ground in Nevada, with staff already beginning to knock on doors.\n\nMany people interviewed said they had never heard of Marco Rubio. But the senator from Florida is hoping his life story, as the son of a hardworking hotel bartender from Cuba who worked in Las Vegas for years, will resonate. He has signed on Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison to chair his campaign in Nevada.\n\nAnd there is speculation about whether Bush will ask Sandoval, the popular governor, to be his running mate. Bush\u2019s son, George P., was in Reno last week, reminding people that his mom is from Mexico. \u201cClaro que s\u00ed\u201d \u2014 \u201cof course\u201d \u2014 the younger Bush said, when asked if his father would be speaking more Spanish, as he did at his campaign kickoff in Miami.\n\nThe most difficult issue for Republican candidates has been how to deal with the 11 million undocumented immigrants, many of them Latino, in the country. Latinos want a path to citizenship for their relatives, but many in the GOP base \u2014 those needed to win the primary \u2014 are dead-set against rewarding those who entered the country illegally. There has been fierce Republican opposition to Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, which would provide legal status to many of the undocumented and remove the threat of their deportation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really important issue for me,\u201d said Aguilera, who said a close relative who has worked in the United States for nearly 20 years cannot return to Mexico to see her family. If she does, she can\u2019t come back because she has no legal papers.\n\n\u201cNot a single Republican candidate, announced or potential, is clearly and consistently supporting a path to citizenship. Not one,\u201d Clinton said at a Nevada stop this month. \u201cWhen they talk about \u2018legal status,\u2019 that is code for second-class status.\u201d\n\nBut many Latinos interviewed said they were disappointed with Obama for not fulfilling promises to do more and are fed up with all politicians. Last November, they stayed home, and exceedingly low Latino turnout has been widely seen as helping Republicans in Nevada take control of the legislature for the first time in nearly a century, win statewide offices, and knock off a Democratic House member in what was considered a very safe district.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in 2014 spooked the hell out of Democrats, and they realize they don\u2019t own the Latino vote,\u201d Garza said.\n\nAlex, from the Latino Victory Project, said the battle is on to engage disaffected voters, and a major effort will be made to target \u201cthe firsts\u201d in families \u2014 the first to speak English, the first to attend college, the \u201cinfluentials\u201d who can sway other relatives to vote.\n\nDemocrats are making a special effort to win over Latino women, including setting up women-to-women phone banks that will tap grandmothers, moms and daughters to support Clinton.\n\nAcross the board, more women than men vote for Democrats, and many observers say women in Latino families can be especially influential.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a woman in the White House,\u201d said Rocio Ramirez, 42, who was shopping at the Wal-Mart in Mesquite with her daughter. She said that she voted for Obama and, before that, for George W. Bush, but that the only interesting thing in this race, at least so far, was that finally a woman might change things up.\n\nBut over at the La Mexicana Market, Roger Rojas said he voted for Obama but now thinks he will vote Republican. \u201cI just feel maybe a Republican will get us back on track again.\u201d His father, who was working behind the meat counter, where a huge statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe rested, got his permanent residency because of Ronald Reagan, he said. While his father is still not a citizen and therefore can\u2019t vote, his U.S.-born son will. \u201cReagan was the last president that did anything for us, and I have been really disappointed in Obama.\u201d\n\nAmanda Renteria, a Latina who serves as Clinton\u2019s political director, said Latinos will ultimately vote for Democrats because their policies more closely align with Latino interests, from immigration reform to an increased minimum wage to affordable health care.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the track record of Republicans over the course of history, they haven\u2019t been with them,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked about efforts to focus on women in the Latino community, Renteria said, \u201cWe have all been influenced by the strong Latina, the woman who keeps the family together.\u201d Since Clinton is a grandmother \u2014 an abuelita \u2014 it might be a good idea to start \u201cabuelitas for Hillary.\u201d\n\nBecause social media has vastly changed since 2012, Renteria said big efforts are underway to connect with Latinos where they get their news \u2014 often on their phones.\n\nShe said that in the campaign\u2019s conversations with Spanish-language media, the reaction has been: \u201cWow. You haven\u2019t been here so early. Thanks for not showing up two weeks before the election.\u201d\n\nAguilera, who works as a hostess at a Mexican restaurant on the weekends and at a health clinic during the week, said she is waiting to hear candidates tell her \u201cwhere our country is going to be in 20 years.\u201d And, she said, \u201cI want to hear that they will fix immigration and make things more equal for everybody.\u201d\n\nThen, she said, she will get her brother and cousin to go to the polls with her and vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Like never before, both parties see the growing Hispanic population as a key to gaining the White House.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/maryjordandc", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Like never before, both parties see the growing Hispanic population as a key to gaining the White House.", "title": "The race is on for the Latino vote", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-race-is-on-for-the-latino-vote/2015/06/21/69cdec4e-6a83-467e-b15c-e0d65cd94cb4_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/06/08/Others/Images/2015-06-08/Latino_Vote_101433785507.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marycjordan"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-race-is-on-for-the-latino-vote/2015/06/21/69cdec4e-6a83-467e-b15c-e0d65cd94cb4_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Latinos; Latino vote", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/maryjordandc"}, "eomportal-uuid": "69cdec4e-6a83-467e-b15c-e0d65cd94cb4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Latinos; Latino vote"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI have never seen the Latino vote prioritized in this way \u2014 and this early \u2014 in a meaningful way,\u201d said Crist\u00f3bal Alex, president of the Democratic-backed Latino Victory Project.\n\u201cWhat happened in 2014 spooked the hell out of Democrats, and they realize they don\u2019t own the Latino vote,\u201d Garza said.\nBut over at the La Mexicana Market, Roger Rojas said he voted for Obama but now thinks he will vote Republican.\nAcross the board, more women than men vote for Democrats, and many observers say women in Latino families can be especially influential.\nDemocrats are making a special effort to win over Latino women, including setting up women-to-women phone banks that will tap grandmothers, moms and daughters to support Clinton."}
