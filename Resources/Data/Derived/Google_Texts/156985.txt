INDIANA, Pa. (AP) - Jim Caviezel is being honored by a Pennsylvania museum dedicated to actor Jimmy Stewart.

Caviezel stars in the TV series “Person of Interest” and became widely known for his role in the movie “The Passion of the Christ.” He will receive the Harvey Award at an Aug. 29 fundraiser by the Jimmy Stewart foundation.

The foundation and museum are based in Stewart’s hometown of Indiana, Pennsylvania, about 45 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.

Past winners include Carol Burnett, Janet Leigh and Shirley Jones. The Harvey Award is named for the 1950 film in which Stewart befriends an invisible rabbit.

It’s typically given to someone with connections to Stewart. The foundation says “Caviezel’s personal relationship with Jimmy Stewart acted as a catalyst to his own success as an actor.”
