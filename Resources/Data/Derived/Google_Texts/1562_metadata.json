(Sandy Lindquist)\n\nRocky Mountain National Park staff continues to examine the condition of facilities and trails to determine which areas can be reopened. Debris is being removed and facilities cleaned where needed. A Facilities Management team is assessing the scope and scale of the flood damage and risk to park facilities, roads, and infrastructure as an initial step in determining long-term repair and rehabilitation needs.\n\nFor those hoping to visit Rocky Mountain National Park this weekend, here is a breakdown of how to get here and what is open.\n\nThose wishing to access Rocky Mountain National Park from the east should leave Interstate 70 at exit 243, follow State Highway 119 north from the Blackhawk area to Nederland. Then follow State Highway 72 to Highway 7. Follow Highway 7 north to Estes Park. A GPS may not show this route, so consider using a paper map.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you are coming from the west, take Highway 34 north from Granby to Grand Lake where you will enter the park via Trail Ridge Road. The Alpine Visitor Center, located at 11,796 feet, is open from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nAll trails on the WEST side of the park, including Milner Pass, Mount Ida, and Ute West Trails are open for day use only. Timber Creek Campground is open, and, for now, no camping fee will be charged.\n\nTrail Ridge Road is open to both east and west bound visitor traffic and the communities of Grand Lake and Estes Park are open and welcoming visitors. Because weather conditions may change rapidly, particularly in spring and fall, park visitors should be prepared to adjust travel plans accordingly and are encouraged to call the park's Trail Ridge Road recorded status line at 970-586-1222. Commercial traffic is once again prohibited on Trail Ridge Road.\n\nIf you are driving Trail Ridge Road, the Alpine Ridge Trail, Tundra Communities Trail, Alpine View Trail, and Hidden Valley Accessible Trail are open. All other trails on the EAST side of the park are currently closed.\n\nFor Rocky Mountain National Park information, call the Information Office at 970-586-1206.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.eptrail.com/ci_24151571/what-is-open-at-rocky-mountain-national-park", "modificationDate": "2013-09-22T10:34:33-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site28/2013/0922/20130922_103417_RMNPalluvialfan_300.jpg", "endDate": "2023-09-22T10:31:00-0600", "description": "Rocky Mountain National Park staff continues to examine the condition of facilities and trails to determine which areas can be reopened.
