Buckley. Encounter Books (December 2014), $19.99.\n\nAt 91, James L. Buckley is arguably the only living American who can articulate on the basis of his own biography a coherent argument about the proper political and legal limits of federal and state government.\n\nBuckley, the younger brother of conservative legend William F. Buckley, is one of a handful of Americans who have served at the highest levels of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches.\n\nElected to the U.S. Senate in 1970 on the Republican and Conservative Party tickets, Buckley served a single term, after which he joined the Reagan administration as an undersecretary of state and later joined the bench of the venerable U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n\nIndeed, \u201cSaving Congress from Itself,\u201d Buckley\u2019s taut brief for ending federal grants to the states, draws on his \u201cexperience as a United States Senator who has some knowledge of the temptations faced by elected officials, and as a federal appellate judge who has had to deal with the costly litigation that opaque regulations can generate.\u201d\n\nIn the book, Buckley proposes a straightforward plan that would \u201cresult in a major reduction in federal spending while freeing Congress to focus on the critical national issues that are its unique responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe central problem he examines concerns the federal government\u2019s costly, inefficient, and democracy-eroding tendency to shoulder local burdens it\u2019s just not competent to handle. \u201cCongress\u2019s current dysfunction,\u201d Buckley writes, \u201cis rooted in its assumption, over the years, of more responsibilities than it can handle\u2026Its members now live a treadmill existence that no longer allows them time to study, learn, and think things through. Instead, they substitute political reflex for thought.\u201d\n\nFocusing Congress\u2019s Attention by Limiting Its Power It was not always thus. At one point in the not-too-distant past, Congress considered its constitutional authority limited to matters of \u201cgeneral,\u201d that is, national, importance. Buckley plumbs the depths of the legal dispute, which originated in the Constitution\u2019s enumerated powers, in its \u201cgeneral Welfare\u201d clause, and in the Tenth Amendment.\n\nThese stricter notions of the \u2018general Welfare\u2019 gave way to the contemporary interpretation of the term to mean, colloquially, \u2018anything generally good for any Americans.\u2019 At its most basic, the Constitution in Article I, Section 8 expressly assigns certain limited powers to Congress in furtherance of the \u201cgeneral Welfare.\u201d These include the powers to: tax and borrow, establish naturalization rules, coin money, punish piracy, declare war, raise armies, and regulate interstate and international commerce. Meanwhile, the Tenth Amendment \u201creserve[s] to the States\u201d any powers not delegated to the federal government.\n\nIn 1822, President James Monroe vetoed a road repair bill he deemed unconstitutional because Congress\u2019s power to spend was properly limited \u201cto purposes of common defense and of general, not local, national, not State, benefit.\u201d\n\nBut gradually, these stricter notions of the \u201cgeneral Welfare\u201d gave way, especially amidst the New Deal, to the contemporary interpretation of the term to mean, colloquially, \u201canything generally good for any Americans.\u201d\n\nAlas, that understanding of \u201cthe general Welfare\u201d has become as unquestioned as it is absurd. \u201cIf the spending power is to be limited only by Congress\u2019 notion of the general welfare,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor wrote in a 1987 dissent, \u201cthe Spending Clause gives power to the Congress\u2026to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed. This was not the Framers\u2019 plan, and it is not the meaning of the Spending Clause.\u201d Sadly, her brethren disagreed.\n\nFederal Grants Are Ruining Federalism But so what? Shouldn\u2019t Congress provide for all Americans? Buckley spends the bulk of this elegant, slim volume illuminating the three key problems with federal grants to states: they\u2019re expensive, they\u2019re inefficient, and they\u2019re corrosive.\n\nThe three key problems with federal grants to states: they\u2019re expensive, they\u2019re inefficient, and they\u2019re corrosive. First, expense. Buckley reckons that grants-in-aid cost the federal government $700 billion annually: an estimated $641 billion in direct costs in FY2015, plus another $60 billion in federal administrative costs. States, counties, and municipalities also shoulder the financial and operational burdens of implementing the grants, which include navigating the vicissitudes of outdated federal regulations, such as the \u201clocally prevailing wage\u201d requirements of the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act, and expending untold sums on lobbying at the federal level.\n\nSecond, efficiency. Federal funding enables states and their subdivisions to externalize the costs of the various programs, and thus spend \u201cother people\u2019s money\u201d in improvident ways. Grants-in-aid incentivize overspending in the same way a per-diem spurs a traveling employee to \u201cuse it or lose it.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently capped its contributions to Rhode Island\u2019s Medicaid program, and liberated the state from some of the more onerous Medicaid regulations, costs actually declined, as did emergency room utilization and appointment wait-times.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, corrosion. \u201cOne of the most insidious aspects of grants-in-aid programs,\u201d Buckley explains, \u201cis the diffusion of responsibility that makes them so attractive to federal and state officials alike.\u201d The federal government\u2019s offer of, say, a $100 million contribution to an infrastructure project is often enough to tip the scales that state officials use to assess the project\u2019s worthiness\u2014and, by extension, to channel state money away from more pressing (albeit relatively more expensive) concerns not deserving of federal attention.\n\nState officials lose their connection to their constituents the more they become administrators of federal regulations. For instance, he highlights his native Connecticut\u2019s construction of a 9.4-mile dedicated \u201cbusway\u201d of minimal utility, secured by $459 million in federal funds and only $113 million in state monies. He also cites his own senatorial experience and quotes a 1992 Supreme Court holding that \u201caccountability is thus diminished when, due to federal coercion, elected state officials cannot regulate in accordance with the views of the local electorate in matters not pre-empted by federal regulation.\u201d\n\nWorst of all, state officials lose their connection to their constituents the more they become administrators of federal regulations, and states cease to serve as laboratories for democracy the more uniform those strictures become. \u201cThe surest way to kill state initiatives,\u201d Buckley writes, \u201cis to impose federal regulatory straitjackets on them.\u201d\n\nWho Will Spearhead This Reform? Buckley\u2019s proposed solution is simple: immediately terminate all federal programs offering grants to states, counties, and cities, and replace them with block grants to states that would taper off over several years.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a handful of lawmakers who embody Buckleyite ideals of restraint might take up his call. While he predicts this scheme will \u201cappall the political establishment and the private interests that benefit from grants-in-aid programs\u201d\u2014witness, for instance, the chattering class\u2019s furious denunciation of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s proposal to block-grant Medicaid\u2014Buckley reasons that \u201cAmericans across the political spectrum will be able to embrace my reform both as taxpayers and citizens.\u201d (Buckley also appends some clever arguments for term limits and campaign finance reform; he was, after all, the lead plaintiff in the landmark 1976 Supreme Court case Buckley v. Valeo.)\n\nIt\u2019s true that a handful of lawmakers who embody Buckleyite ideals of restraint might take up his call. Unfortunately, those happy few either, like Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, lack any serious national following or, like former Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn, recently threw in the towel.\n\n\u201cUnder the Constitution, the federal government\u2019s sole purpose is to protect our liberty, not provide us things,\u201d Amash wrote in a 2013 op-ed. \u201cThe government protects liberty by defending the nation from foreign attack, maintaining open trade among the states and foreign nations, and pursuing a few other limited functions.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Amash went on to observe, \u201cthis limited role for the federal government takes courage to embrace. It is easier to keep providing things\u2014using other people\u2019s money and incurring large debts. But that is not what the Constitution allows, and it is not what works. Providing things, where necessary, is for local governments, religious institutions, charities, families, and friends.\u201d\n\nCoburn, too, proved to be a bipartisan side-thorn, stinging big-government Democrats and earmarking Republicans alike. \u201cTo those of you through the years whom I have offended, I truly apologize,\u201d Coburn said during his farewell address in November. \u201cI believe the enumerated powers meant something,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I have offended, I believe it has been on the basis of my belief in Article I, Section 8.\u201d\n\nBy and large, fiscal conservatives seem far more animated by sexier causes, like repealing or defunding Obamacare, or aim at financially fatter targets, like Medicare or Social Security reform. Alas, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a groundswell among supporters of either party\u2014let alone in the Supreme Court\u2014to restore the Section 8 limits to their proper place in our political order.\n\nSure, the 2012 GOP platform lamented the federal government\u2019s unfortunate tendency to \u201cperform functions that are better performed by the States\u201d and declared that whether \u201clegislation is a State or federal matter must be determined in accordance with the Tenth Amendment, in conjunction with Article I, Section 8.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, it decried Medicaid as \u201csimply too big and too flawed to be managed in its current condition from Washington\u201d and instead, like Ryan, called for \u201cblock-granting the program to the States, providing the States with the flexibility to design programs that meet the needs of their low income citizens.\u201d\n\nAnd, yes, some bedrock originalist lawmakers like Sen. Mike Lee offer airplay to \u201cthe notion that the Constitution gives the federal government only limited, enumerated powers, while reserving all other powers to the states,\u201d as Lee put it in \u201cThe Freedom Agenda,\u201d his 2011 book exhorting passage of a balanced-budget constitutional amendment.\n\nBut by and large, fiscal conservatives seem far more animated by sexier causes, like repealing or defunding Obamacare, or aim at financially fatter targets, like Medicare or Social Security reform. So-called \u201cprocess\u201d issues like limitations on Article 1, Section 8 are more dull (Lee writes that he thought \u201cvoters would be bored\u201d hearing about it), more complex (as Supreme Court jurisprudence has evinced), and less partisan (congressional Republicans, too, indulge the temptation to reward their constituents with local funding), and therefore much less of a focus for policymakers.\n\nBuckley appears to recognize the challenges his proposal will confront, acknowledging that it would \u201cdeny members of Congress their easiest paths to reelection, threaten the jobs of the thousands of employees of the federal agencies and bureaus that oversee the programs, deprive governors and mayors of their readiest access to funds they don\u2019t have to raise from their own taxpayers, and distress the hordes of special interests that rely on the programs.\u201d (Is that all?)
