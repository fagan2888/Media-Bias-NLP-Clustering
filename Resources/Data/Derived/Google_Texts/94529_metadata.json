In 2014, Kroger stock was up 63 percent and Costco was up 21 percent. On Dec. 31, the King Sooper gas station at Broadway and Table Mesa was selling regular gas for $2.09 per gallon. Seemed reasonable to me at the time. Unfortunately, I learned Costco at their Superior station that day was selling regular at $1.68 per gallon. A difference of $0.41 per gallon. Why should this be?\n\nKroger prices its gas as if it is a mom-and-pop station not a high-volume buyer. True, I could have reduced the price at the KS station if I had bought $400 worth of qualifying KS merchandise this month and used my points to reduce the price $0.40 on one fill up. It is also true that you must buy a $55 annual Costco membership, but with it there is no limit to the number of cars I could fill with cheap gas. Maybe the tremendous performance in the Kroger stock is due to the fact they are slow to pass cost reductions onto their customers?\n\nGeorge Narcavage\n\nBoulder", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/letters/ci_27252382/george-narcavage-gas-prices-costco-vs-kroger", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Letters to the editor", "endDate": "2016-01-03T20:36:45-0700", "description": "Costco is a large company, $33 billion in assets, but so is Kroger (King Soopers), $29 billion.
