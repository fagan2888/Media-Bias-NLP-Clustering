DU and UND don\u2019t have to try hard to dislike each other.\n\nAfter Denver\u2019s 4-1, runaway victory the night before, North Dakota coach Dave Hakstol inserted some muscle into his lineup, perhaps hoping to push the Pioneers around. He added 185-pound defenseman Nick Mattson and freshman lefty Johnny Simonson.\n\nBut while No. 11 Denver and No. 1 North Dakota traded ill will early on, matching retribution penalties, the two new bruisers from Grand Forks put North Dakota out front.\n\nMattson\u2019s slap shot goal off two posts, after Simonson won the puck in the corner, set North Dakota on its way to a victory over the Pioneers at Magness Arena.\n\nPHOTOS: Denver University vs. North Dakota\n\n\u201cOur biggest problem is we never came down from the high from last night,\u201d DU coach Jim Montgomery said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how many hours of sleep our guys got. The emotion we spent feeling good about ourselves really cost us a lot of energy.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakota (13-4-2, 6-3-1 National Collegiate Hockey Conference) salvaged a split at Denver (10-5-0, 4-3-0) for the fourth consecutive year. UND snapped the Pioneers\u2019 streak of wins over top-ranked teams at four. Denver last lost to a No. 1 team in March 2011, against North Dakota in an NCAA Tournament Midwest Regional.\n\nMattson\u2019s goal, nearly 14 minutes in, came after Simonson dug out the puck in the corner. Mattson skated a U-turn, then sliced toward the middle in front of two DU defenders. His wrist shot, while he was falling down, hit off both posts behind Pios goaltender Tanner Jaillet.\n\nNorth Dakota dominated the first period, with a 15-7 shot advantage. It set up a rush of goals in the second period.\n\nNorth Dakota\u2019s Bryn Chyzyk broke out down the left side, feigned a shot to freeze Jaillet, then slipped a pass to Nick Schmaltz for a goal from the far side.\n\nLess than two minutes later, North Dakota\u2019s Michael Parks rushed a similar play from the right side, wrapping a pass back to left wing Drake Caggiula, the NCHC\u2019s leading scorer, for an easy one-timer.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were going to come out strong after we took it to them on Friday,\u201d Denver sophomore defenseman Will Butcher said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t catch us off guard, but we didn\u2019t come out as sharp and quick.\u201d\n\nDenver erased the shutout in the third when Josiah Didier set up Nolan Zajac for a slap shot goal from the top of the right circle that beat North Dakota\u2019s Zane McIntyre.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU Pioneers can\u2019t complete sweep of No. 1 North Dakota hockey team", "title": "DU Pioneers can\u2019t complete sweep of No. 1 North Dakota hockey team", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/13/du-pioneers-cant-complete-sweep-of-no-1-north-dakota-hockey-team/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213__du-hitp1.jpg", "height": 493}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213__du-hitp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-13T21:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:33:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfb8b\"", "article_summary": "1 North Dakota traded ill will early on, matching retribution penalties, the two new bruisers from Grand Forks put North Dakota out front.\n1 team in March 2011, against North Dakota in an NCAA Tournament Midwest Regional.\nBad blood boiled over even before the puck dropped Saturday night in the University of Denver\u2019s 3-1 loss to North Dakota.\nAfter Denver\u2019s 4-1, runaway victory the night before, North Dakota coach Dave Hakstol inserted some muscle into his lineup, perhaps hoping to push the Pioneers around.\nPHOTOS: Denver University vs. North Dakota\u201cOur biggest problem is we never came down from the high from last night,\u201d DU coach Jim Montgomery said."}
