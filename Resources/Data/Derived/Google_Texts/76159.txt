RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Lionel Messi’s final act in the 2014 World Cup was lifting a free kick high over the bar, wasting Argentina’s last chance to equalize in the final against Germany.

It was far from fitting finish for the four-time world player of the year.

This was supposed to be Messi’s World Cup, just like the 1986 tournament belonged to another Argentine great, Diego Maradona.

But after carrying his team through the group stage in Brazil with four goals, Messi seemed to run out of steam.

In the final Sunday, he created chances but, like the rest of the team, lacked the finishing touch to turn the game for Argentina.

He was a picture of disappointment as he collected the trophy for the tournament’s best player.
