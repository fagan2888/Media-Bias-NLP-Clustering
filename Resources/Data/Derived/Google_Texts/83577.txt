A separate provision that allows 50 percent of the cost of improvements to be written off under “bonus deprecation” would be extended for five years, and would be expanded to cover stores and restaurants that are owned rather than just those that are leased.

Section 179 expensing, which determines the amount of an investment a small business is allowed to write off entirely in the first year rather than being depreciated over multiple years, would be made permanent and its level would be increased.

The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which gives retailers a tax incentive to hire the disabled, welfare recipients and other economically challenged individuals, would be renewed for five years.

By sorting out which provisions should be made permanent, which should be extended for a short time and which should be phased out, French said the tax relief measure “will be a stepping stone to more fundamental tax reform that provides U.S. businesses with a more competitive tax rate, increases investment in the United States, increases wages in the United States, and helps the consumer.”

Between the two bills, the Affordable Care Act’s so-called Cadillac Tax on high-value health insurance plans and a tax on medical devices would be delayed for two years, along with a one-year delay in a health insurance tax.

Also included is language protecting businesses from liability when they share information about cyber threats with the government.

“Sharing information on cyber threats will create an atmosphere of community vigilance that will ensure that consumer’s sensitive data is kept safe,” French said.
