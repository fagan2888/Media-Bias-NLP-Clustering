Okay. It\u2019s really none of those things. Trump isn\u2019t a straight-talker. He\u2019s rude. Trump isn\u2019t drawing the line against political correctness. He\u2019s spewing racist and sexist bile.\n\nTrundle on over to his website and try to tease out what the guy stands for. Policy positions are hard to find. You will find out a lot about how super awesome Donald Trump is.\n\nReally, Trump\u2019s rhetoric isn\u2019t that fresh or original. You can get its image every day of the week in the comments section of any article dealing with politics. It comes in loud and clear from anonymous bloats who spend their days trolling the internet with their straight-talk on everything from immigration to Obamacare. Facts hardly matter. Debate will not focus on the issues. It\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re stupid\u201d all day long.\n\nThe Donald is perfect for this sort. He\u2019s a troll. Hostile, self-righteous, insulting, flexible with the truth, indifferent to reason.\n\nChallenge Trump on ideas, and he\u2019ll attack you as a human being. Perfect troll.\n\nPolitical debate in this country has hardly been Lincoln v. Douglas for sometime now. But everyday political discourse on the internet is beyond rot now. And even the \u201chigh\u201d debate of, for example, a Republican primary is more mudpit than rational exchange of ideas. The highlight reel of shouts and insults is shameful. Almost nothing resolves in serious question and response.\n\nIn such a world, the likes of Trump will thrive. There\u2019s a shade of truth in the explanation that he is an answer to the stale sound bites of scripted politicians whose cliches are only eclipsed by those of professional athletes. But it\u2019s entirely possible to be unscripted without being a jerk or a bully. That isn\u2019t the Trump way, of course. And it apparently isn\u2019t what Trump\u2019s America hungers for. The more belittling and mean-spirited he is, the more he seems to gain popularity. The more cravenly he manipulates and twists his party, the more advantage he wins.\n\nThe columnist David Brooks recently said that Trump will hold steady at about 20 percent of the Republican vote \u2013 that this is his fortress and it will neither grow greatly nor shrink much. That may well be true. But what does it say of those 20 percent? What America are they living in? And how can the rest of us avoid it?", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2RhbGxhc21vcm5pbmd2aWV3c2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wOC9raW5nLW9mLXRoZS10cm9sbHMtd2VsY29tZS10by1kb25hbGQtdHJ1bXBzLWFtZXJpY2EuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Rudolph Bush", "og": {"site_name": "Opinion Blog", "description": "There's supposed to be some deep mystery to Donald Trump's appeal that the squares and elites in the media and politics can't figure out.
