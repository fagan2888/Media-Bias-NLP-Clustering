More than 1,000 mental health clinicians at Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California are threatening to go out on strike.\n\n\n\nApproximately 1,500 psychologists and other mental health clinicians at Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California are threatening to go out on strike.\n\nCalifornia regulators fined Kaiser $4 million in 2013 for failing to provide timely mental health treatment. Northern California members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers say things haven't changed.\n\nNUHW chapter President Clement Papazian complained patients still aren\u2019t able to see a provider when they need one.\n\n\u201cIt takes a long time to get in, and then once they\u2019re in, it takes a long time to get them back,\" Papazian said. \"And what we know about quality mental health care is it\u2019s extremely dosage dependent.\u201d\n\nKaiser officials say they\u2019ve hired nearly 500 therapists since 2011, and plan to hire 350 more by the end of this year. But union members say an increase in patients, through Obamacare, has greatly outpaced any increased hiring.\n\nThe union and Kaiser have been trying to hammer out a labor agreement for more than four years.\n\nUnion clinicians statewide held a five-day strike in January. Kaiser officials claim the union is threatening another walkout to gain an advantage at the bargaining table.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 1,000 mental health clinicians at Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California are threatening to go out on strike.", "author": "Kenny Goldberg", "og": {"site_name": "KPBS Public Media", "description": "More than 1,000 mental health clinicians at Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California are threatening to go out on strike.", "title": "California Kaiser Therapists Threaten To Walk Out", "url": "http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/22/kaiser-therapists-threaten-walk-out/", "image": "https://kpbs.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/news/tease/2015/10/22/kp-strike_wide-cb34679c7aebfd32cb852bbf7690543a314070a2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "has_audio": 1, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "KPBS", "fb": {"app_id": 131056773055}, "apiKpbs": "159258 %##% California Kaiser Therapists Threaten To Walk Out", "keywords": "News, Health, Region, California", "verify-v1": "zHHWZpwcl/kpXf/ZbbmtRN41TWDeCfjQil8LGROx/LA=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd07df\"", "article_summary": "More than 1,000 mental health clinicians at Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California are threatening to go out on strike.\nApproximately 1,500 psychologists and other mental health clinicians at Kaiser Permanente facilities in Northern California are threatening to go out on strike.\nCalifornia regulators fined Kaiser $4 million in 2013 for failing to provide timely mental health treatment.\nNorthern California members of the National Union of Healthcare Workers say things haven't changed.\nUnion clinicians statewide held a five-day strike in January."}
