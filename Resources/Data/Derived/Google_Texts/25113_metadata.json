Bush. \u201cWhenever I saw a negative article about [Al] Gore, I put it in with the paychecks of my 8,000 employees,\u201d he said . \u201cI had my managers do a survey on every employee. If they liked Bush, we made them register to vote. But not if they liked Gore.\u201d\n\nBefore the 2012 race, Siegel was even less subtle , sending each of his employees a letter saying President Obama\u2019s re-election would \u201cthreaten your job.\u201d He added at the time, \u201cI can no longer support a system that penalizes the productive and gives to the unproductive.\u201d Siegel went on to say if Obama raised his taxes, \u201cI will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company.\u201d\n\nPolitically, Siegel\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t work out well, and Obama was re-elected. Economically, however, Siegel has fared extremely well, despite that rascally president raising his taxes. Scott Keyes explained this morning:\n\nJust over two years after penning that company-wide email, Siegel informed Westgate employees that instead of layoffs, he would boost their minimum wage to $10 per hour beginning in 2015. In fact, according to Siegel, 2014 was a banner year. \u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the best year in our history and I wanted to do something to show my gratitude for the employees who make that possible,\u201d Siegel said in announcing the wage hike. He also recently told the Orlando Business Journal that \u201cthings have never been better.\u201d\n\nImagine that.\n\nObama actually raised Siegel\u2019s taxes \u2013 and implemented the Affordable Care Act, and kept federal regulations in place, and left Dodd-Frank safeguards largely in place \u2013 and instead of reducing the size of his company, Siegel expanded it.\n\nThe system that \u201cpenalizes the productive and gives to the unproductive\u201d seems to be going quite well for the co-star of the \u201c Queen of Versailles \u201d documentary.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The nation's largest time-share developer warned his employees in 2012: a vote for Obama would put their jobs at risk.
