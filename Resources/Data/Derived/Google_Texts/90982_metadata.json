While GE continues to make bulbs for consumers, it\u2019s concentrating on technologically advanced industrial and commercial lighting products \u2014 like a streetlamp that calls authorities when a gun is fired.\u201d (The story does not identify any potential buyers by name.)\n\n\n\nBloomberg notes that GE\u2019s retreat from consumer-focused businesses \u201chas been rapid,\u201d as it has divested units that made microwaves, refrigerators and TVs, and that offered credit cards or savings accounts. \u201cLighting is the only division not already divested or in the process of being sold as part of GE\u2019s dramatic restructuring to focus on heavy-duty industrial equipment,\u201d Bloomberg says.\n\n\n\nBeth Comstock, vice chair and head of the business innovations unit that includes lighting, tells Bloomberg, \u201cThe lighting industry has become somewhat commoditized. We like where we are, but the focus on our future really is on the smart, connected, commercial space for lighting.\u201d\n\n\n\nGE Lighting, formed in 1879, has changed with the times as the \u201cpush for more energy-efficient bulbs has led to the phase-out of incandescent technology in recent years,\u201d the story notes.\n\n\n\nEven so, \u201cThe legacy lighting business \u2014 we continue to evaluate our options,\u201d Jeff Bornstein, GE\u2019s chief financial officer, tells Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s a business that shrinks every day, every quarter as the world continues to transition away from old technology to new technology.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s focus is on a new business called Current, which, as Bloomberg puts it, \u201cblends portions of the commercial lighting business with GE\u2019s growing energy-focused operations, and smart LED bulbs for the home.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things we\u2019re learning about what you can do with a light source,\u201d said Maryrose Sylvester, Current\u2019s CEO and formerly head of GE Lighting. \u201cThere is a technology shift going on in the lighting industry that is probably more dramatic than anyone expected.\u201d\n\n\n\nCrain\u2019s last year produced a special section that looked at the history and future of GE Lighting and Nela Park. You can find those stories here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heart of it all\n\nThe action in the banking industry these days \u201cis on Main Street, not Wall Street,\u201d Forbes says, and Northeast Ohio has emerged as a particular force.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe falling share prices and declining CEO pay across Wall Street may not abate in 2016 as the industry adapts to post-crisis regulations, which significantly penalize being too-big-to-fail,\u201d Forbes says.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, \u201cthere is an unheralded crop of regional banks that are growing their earnings by increasing their lending and expanding their footprints,\u201d according to the story. \u201cMany of these Main Street banks are growing organically, taking regional market share from the JPMorgan\u2019s and Citigroup\u2019s of the world.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and that\n\nA prime example is the $3.4 billion takeover of Akron-based FirstMerit Corp. by Columbus-based Huntington Bancshares , which Forbes says \u201cexemplifies this undercurrent of change across the United States.\u201d Huntington\u2019s acquisition will also expand its footprint outside of Ohio and into Chicago and Wisconsin.Similarly, Forbes notes, Cleveland-based KeyCorp is pursuing a merger with First Niagara , which would expand Key\u2019s presence in western New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts.\u201cIn each of these cases, consolidation should drive firms well in excess of $100 billion in assets, a tenth of the size of trillion dollar too-big-to-fail firms, but enough to have the scale to offer the mobile banking services customers expect while being able to also manage regulatory burdens,\u201d Forbes says. \u201cAnd this trend may be in the early stages.\u201dOn Main Street, Forbes concludes, \u201cbanks recovered far more slowly from the crisis, hampered in part by the implicit guarantees lavished on their too-big-to-fail counterparts, in addition to weaker-than-expected economic growth. But it seems they are now hitting their stride just as Wall Street firms stumble, burdened by regulation and concerns over the global economy.\u201d\n\nThat's the spirit!: The Ohio Department of Commerce\u2019s Division of Liquor Control reports that sales of spirituous liquor in the state reached a record $1.018 billion last year, an increase of 7.34%, exceeding last year\u2019s total by about $70 million.\n\n\n\nRetail sales in 2015 were $731 million, an increase of about 8%. Wholesale transactions \u2014 liquor purchased by retail permit holders such as restaurants, bars and clubs \u2014 were $287.1 million, an increase of 5.5%.\n\n\n\nHere are the 10 best-selling brands of spirituous liquor by gallons sold in Ohio for 2015:\n\n\n\n\u2022 Jack Daniels Tennessee Whiskey \u2013 379,492 gallons\n\n\n\n\u2022 Fireball Cinnamon Whiskey \u2013 298,406 gallons\n\n\n\n\u2022 Crown Royal Canadian Whiskey \u2013 291,609 gallons\n\n\n\n\u2022 Captain Morgan Spiced Rum \u2013 288,676 gallons\n\n\n\n\u2022 Bacardi Superior Light Rum \u2013 287,901 gallons\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2022 Smirnoff Vodka \u2013 283,801 gallons\u2022 Absolut Vodka \u2013 272,521 gallons\u2022 Black Velvet Canadian Whiskey \u2013 266,670 gallons\u2022 Tito\u2019s Handmade Vodka \u2013 259,328 gallons\u2022 Kamchatka Vodka \u2013 250,578 gallonsIn a Republican primary, there\u2019s not a greater insult than this The New York Times says a national conservative group, the American Future Fund , plans to spend $1 million on ads in New Hampshire that brand Ohio Gov. John Kasich an \u201cObama Republican,\u201d according to the group\u2019s chief strategist.The group \u201cwill run a commercial that goes after Mr. Kasich for supporting Common Core educational standards and expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d according to the story. It shows an image of Kasich smiling, face to face with Barack Obama, and calls him \u201cone of the few Republican governors to cheerlead Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\u201dThe ad closes: \u201cJohn Kasich \u2014 Not a conservative. Not even a moderate. An Obama Republican.\u201d New Day for America , a super PAC supporting Kasich, plans to file a complaint with the New Hampshire station WMUR and the Federal Election Commission about the ads. \u201cThe first-in-the-nation primary will be decided by New Hampshire voters, not faceless out-of-state millionaires,\u201d Connie Wehrkamp, a spokeswoman for the group, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "A deal would make sense after the company this month agreed to sell its century-old home appliances division to China's Qingdao Haier Co. for $5.4 billion, the news service says.
