It\u2019s a suburban relic anchored by a Kmart, Family Dollar and coin laundry. Twelve storefronts in the plaza are empty. The barbershop is not the kind of place where you\u2019d expect to find the CEO of a state paying for a trim. But every few weeks, a navy blue SUV pulls into the parking lot, and Gov. Brian Sandoval steps out.\n\nAt public appearances and in campaign ads, Sandoval looks like a man whose haircuts are fashioned by stylists. But the governor waits his turn for a $14 trim surrounded by trophy buck mounts and bobblehead dolls in a strip mall 30 miles from the Capitol.\n\nWhen Sandoval walked in Oct. 16, he was met with handshakes and fawning. A customer who had been alerted the governor was coming handed Sandoval a grocery bag full of venison steaks. A picture of Sandoval and a local Boy Scout troop hangs on the wall. A collegiate pennant from Sandoval\u2019s son\u2019s college also has a coveted spot. No one talks politics. Why would they?\n\nSandoval\u2019s re-election campaign came without the negative ads, debates and vitriol seen in other statewide races. Despite being vulnerable on a number of fronts \u2014 education and health care among them \u2014 Sandoval didn\u2019t draw a single serious challenger. Even U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, the architect of the state\u2019s Democratic machine, couldn\u2019t persuade anyone to step forward.\n\nLIFE OF BRIAN: A timeline of Sandoval, from birth to mansion \u00b01963: Sandoval is born Aug. 5, the son of Ron and Gloria, in Redding, Calif. \u00b0 1970: The Sandoval family moves to Fallon before moving to Sparks two years later. \u00b01981: Sandoval graduates from Bishop Manogue High School, where he was a star athlete. \u00b01984: Sandoval lands an internship with Republican Sen. Paul Laxalt, who rose to national prominence because of his close relationship with President Ronald Reagan. \u00b01986: Sandoval graduates from UNR with degrees in English and economics. \u00b01989: Sandoval graduates from Ohio State University\u2019s Moritz College of Law. \u00b01989 to 1994: Sandoval works as a lawyer at a private practice in Reno. \u00b01994 to 1998: Sandoval runs for and wins two terms in the state Assembly. \u00b01999 Gov. Kenny Guinn selects Sandoval as youngest chairman in the history of the Nevada Gaming Commission. \u00b02001: Sandoval resigns from the Gaming Commission to run for attorney general. \u00b02002: Sandoval is elected as Nevada\u2019s first Latino attorney general \u00b02005 Sandoval resigns as attorney general. The U.S Senate confirms him as a federal judge. \u00b02009 Sandoval resigns as a federal judge to run for governor. \u00b02010 Sandoval wins first term as Nevada governor.\n\nSo why is a governor with an imperfect record being treated as untouchable? The answer lies partly in Sandoval\u2019s connections to the state\u2019s tight power structure and partly because of his knack to keep headlines positive while maintaining a clean-cut image that goes beyond his regularly trimmed hair.\n\nSeeing Sandoval sitting in a barber\u2019s chair surrounded by people he has known for years presents a stark irony. Tuesday, if all goes as expected, Sandoval will be elected for a second term as governor. Like his barber who sees him every few weeks for some casual banter and has known him for years, voters kind of know Sandoval and kind of don\u2019t. He has been around forever and is an affable presence but also is cautious to the point of being somewhat mysterious.\n\nIf you ask most Nevadans, \u201cwho really is Brian Sandoval?,\u201d you\u2019re likely to be met with a long pause and bewildered expression. And yet, in a time when politics seems overpopulated with cartoonish figures stamping out extremist claims so they\u2019re memorable, having a governor who defies easy categorization feels almost like a virtue.\n\nAs the barber leans into his work, he is inches from Sandoval\u2019s head. And what goes on inside that head will affect the future of the state and, as it appears Sandoval is starting to attract national attention, perhaps the national landscape, as well. In this day and age, Sandoval is a politician unlike most others, and he raises interesting questions for friend and foe alike.\n\nIn 2013, Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, pondered taking a run at Sandoval in the midterm election. He opted to stay out of the race.\n\nThere were viable attacks, Sisolak said. On Sandoval\u2019s watch, the state bused mentally ill patients from Las Vegas to California. Sandoval oversaw the flawed software rollout of the state\u2019s health care exchange system. Nevada remains No. 45 in unemployment, the state\u2019s foreclosure rate is the highest in the nation, and our public school system is among the worst.\n\nMoreover, Sandoval flip-flopped \u2014 first supporting, then criticizing \u2014 on embattled Bunkerville rancher Cliven Bundy and the militia members who came to defend him and face down federal officials. Sandoval initially lambasted the Bureau of Land Management, calling its sending of armed federal agents to remove Bundy\u2019s cattle from federal land \u201coffensive\u201d and its move to create First Amendment areas to limit where people can protest \u201ctrampling on Nevadans\u2019 fundamental rights under the U.S. Constitution.\u201d But days later, Sandoval backed down, coming out hard against Bundy after violence erupted on the ranch and Bundy made off-the-cuff comments about slavery. Sandoval called Bundy \u201cdisgusting and offensive\u201d and said he \u201cin no way ... reflects the values of Nevadans.\u201d\n\nBut trying to knock off Sandoval would have been \u201can uphill battle,\u201d Sisolak said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just likable,\u201d Sisolak said. \u201cHe looks good. He sounds good. He makes all the right appearances. He keeps out of trouble, and he\u2019s the beneficiary of very good timing.\u201d\n\nWhen Sandoval first ran for governor, his platform was \u201cgetting Nevada working again.\u201d By all accounts, the state has bolstered its employment numbers since 2010.\n\nMore than 100,000 jobs have returned to Nevada (although some may say that\u2019s more a function of the recovering economy than policy). The state unemployment rate has decreased faster than 49 states since the end of the recession, and Sandoval landed Tesla Motors\u2019 battery plant, which promises to bring more work for Nevadans.\n\n\u201cIt takes a hell of a lot of work and commitment\u201d to lure such a company, said Pete Ernaut, a Sandoval adviser and longtime friend. \u201cThis governor has put in that time.\u201d\n\nAs for mental health, the Affordable Care Act and education funding, Democrats haven\u2019t taken to grandstanding against Sandoval. State lawmakers and the governor \u201cown it together,\u201d said Billy Vassiliadis, a Democratic strategist and lobbyist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s Teflon, or it\u2019s just the reality of the situation,\u201d Vassiliadis said.\n\nSandoval is one of Nevada\u2019s adopted native sons. He was born in Redding, Calif., and moved to New Mexico and Utah before his family settled in Northern Nevada in 1969. His father was a career engineer with the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nHis family first lived in Fallon but settled in Sparks, on a dirt road that\u2019s now cookie-cutter suburbia. There were no sidewalks, paved driveways or sewer systems. Sandoval\u2019s father bought sheep for his sons to tend.\n\n\u201cMy first job was cleaning sheep pens. It was good practice for what I do now,\u201d Sandoval said with a laugh.\n\nSandoval was in 4-H, a varsity athlete and class president at Bishop Manogue High School. He kept sheepherding, too, and used the money to help pay for college.\n\nAt UNR, he built relationships with some of the most important people in his life: his future wife, Kathleen, and his two closest advisers, Ernaut and legislative lobbyist Greg Ferraro. During college, Sandoval kept on the straight and narrow. \u201cHe was a regular guy who didn\u2019t go haywire like the rest of us,\u201d Ernaut said.\n\nSandoval graduated in 1986 with degrees in English and economics. He studied law at Ohio State University and began to grow his political network. He interned for U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt in 1984.\n\nIn 1989, Sandoval returned to Reno to work in private practice. A few years later, he started his own firm, litigating civil cases.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Sandoval to foray into public life. Voters elected him to the state Assembly in 1994 and 1996.\n\nNear the end of his second term, Sandoval began a trend that has remained a staple of his career: vacating one office for another.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Bob Miller appointed Sandoval to a four-year term on the Nevada Gaming Commission. Gov. Kenny Guinn later selected Sandoval, then 35, the youngest commission chairman ever.\n\nThree years into the Gaming Commission term, Sandoval resigned to run for attorney general. Ernaut and Ferraro were by his side as advisers to his campaign.\n\nSandoval ran against Democrat John Hunt. At the time, it was the most expensive attorney general race in Nevada history. Sandoval won a landslide victory in November 2002, making him the first Latino to win statewide elected office.\n\nThree years later, Sen. Harry Reid recommended him to the federal bench. Sandoval left the Attorney General\u2019s Office to become a U.S. District Court judge.\n\nNearly four years later, he left the lifetime appointment to run for governor with the help of Ernaut and Ferraro. Sandoval is one of only three federal judges nationally who\u2019ve left the bench to become governor. The last was Maine\u2019s Albion Parris in 1822.\n\nSandoval arrived in the governor\u2019s office at a low point in Nevada history. The housing market was in shambles. Tourists weren\u2019t visiting. The state\u2019s coffers were empty.\n\nIn the primary, Sandoval defeated GOP Gov. Jim Gibbons, a sitting duck embattled by sexual assault allegations and the recession. More impressively, he defeated Harry Reid\u2019s son Rory by 80,000 votes to be elected the first Latino governor in the state.\n\nWhen he took office in 2011, Sandoval proved he wasn\u2019t a typical Republican. One of his first decisions was encouraging the Legislature to extend $1.2 billion in tax hikes that were scheduled to sunset.\n\nDuring the same legislative session, Sandoval did something no other Republican governor would: Create a state-run health insurance exchange to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Sandoval\u2019s move gave the state control over how the Affordable Care Act would be instituted in Nevada, rather than leave such decisions to lawmakers in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere were hopes of enrolling 118,000 uninsured Nevadans, but the exchange quickly spun out of control.\n\nInternal reports detail miscommunication between contractors and the state. The reports also show the governor\u2019s staff knew about serious flaws in the program before the exchange launched in October 2013. Consumers experienced problems with enrolling and billing, and the exchange fired Xerox, its contractor. The state unplugged the system and is scheduled to connect to the federal government\u2019s system this month.\n\nIt\u2019s also no secret that Nevada\u2019s public education system is among the nation\u2019s worst. Since 2009, there have been more than $700 million in education cuts, and Sandoval has been criticized for not being aggressive enough in seeking more funding for schools.\n\nWhen the governor proposed $135 million in new funding for public education in his 2013 budget, Democrats said it was too little and knocked him for not supporting tax increases that would generate more money for K-12 students. His proposal for a payroll tax reduction for businesses only fueled his critics\u2019 fire.\n\n\u201cWith very little new revenue, we don\u2019t know how the governor plans to pay for these expenditures while cutting taxes,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mo Denis, D-Las Vegas, said at the time.\n\nThe 2013 legislative session ended with about $120 million in new funding for schools, with boosts in construction money, programs for non-native English speakers and increases in per-pupil spending, but far from enough to appease those who believe the state\u2019s K-12 system is grossly underfunded. The budget paved the way for this year\u2019s margin tax ballot initiative, which would generate about $700 million by imposing a 2 percent tax on businesses generating more than $1 million in annual revenue.\n\nEarly reports indicate the tax is in trouble, meaning Sandoval will go into the 2015 session facing high expectations on school funding.\n\nSandoval says he has a plan to create a more sustainable flow of money for public schools, but he hasn\u2019t said what it is. The plan will be released after the election. The governor hasn\u2019t hinted whether he will raise taxes.\n\nMental health services also have challenged the Sandoval administration.\n\nIn 2013, it was uncovered that Nevada secretly bused mental health patients to California and left them there. State health officials gave a Rawson-Neal Psychiatric Hospital patient, James F.C. Brown, a one-way bus ticket from Las Vegas to Sacramento.\n\nBrown\u2019s story sparked outrage and uncovered a practice that became coined \u201cGreyhound therapy.\u201d\n\nSheila Leslie, a former Democrat state lawmaker, said the busing scandal took no one in state government by surprise. It had been years in the making. Mental health is the first place lawmakers cut when revenue gets tight, she said, because there are \u201cfew legislators and constituents who care.\u201d\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, the Legislature cut $80 million from the mental health budget; about 364 jobs were cut.\n\n\u201cThe surprising thing is that the governor and his folks didn\u2019t jump on the issue sooner than they did,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should have realized that it was going on.\u201d\n\nThe Sandoval administration fired two staff members and disciplined three others for the scandal. Then-director of the Department of Health and Human Services, Mike Willden, kept his job. He now works as the governor\u2019s chief of staff.\n\nSandoval and his staff also pumped more money into state mental health programs. They boosted funding by at least $30 million, and Sandoval signed an executive order to create the Behavioral Health and Wellness Council to oversee state programs and make recommendations. Since June, it has advocated for and Sandoval has awarded at least $3.5 million in state funding. More than 100 beds for mental health patients have been added to hospitals statewide, and the state is working with federal officials to try to land more lucrative reimbursements for treating the mentally ill at local hospitals.\n\nThe man who cuts Sandoval\u2019s hair \u2014 the only man who cuts it \u2014 is Don Diehl, the garrulous proprietor of the Paradise Park Barber Shop. He has cut three generations of Sandoval hair, including Sandoval\u2019s father and son.\n\nNo one can make appointments at the barber shop, not even the governor.\n\n\u201cThey say (Sandoval) has the best hair and best teeth,\u201d Diehl said. \u201cDean Heller is not doing too bad either. It used to be (Bill) Raggio.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s hair sits parted on the right. Diehl has tried different styles. None worked.\n\nAfter the trim, Sandoval said his goodbyes and headed for the door, then turned quickly: \u201cDid I pay you?\u201d he asked Diehl, not realizing he already slipped his barber money.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d Diehl said.\n\nThe governor walked out the door and hopped into his SUV. It was back to business.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s loyal,\u201d Diehl said. \u201cWe believe in Brian and his ways. Not just out of politics. Out of friendship.\u201d\u200b", "article_metadata": {"description": "At public appearances and in campaign ads, Sandoval looks like a man whose haircuts are fashioned by stylists.
