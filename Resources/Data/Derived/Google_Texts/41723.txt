Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” fill-in host Mark Steyn interviewed Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, about his positions on terrorism and the recently passed omnibus spending bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama last week.

Paul also took on Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), one of Paul’s opponents for the GOP nod, who has missed a lot votes in the U.S. Senate while campaigning for president.

“It may have been the most important vote of the year, but certainly the largest spending bill of the year,” Paul said. “And yeah, I think if you are being paid by the taxpayer, you should show up and vote. And so I think this is a big issue. And for him to say he’s only going to show up when it’s a close vote, I don’t think that passes muster. And I think really that he ought to just resign or probably give his pay back because he’s not really earning his pay at this point.”

“But yeah, this spending bill was something that was horrendous,” he continued. “It was a $1.1 trillion spending bill. It bust the budget caps and it also shows that the complicity on deficit spending. Both parties deserve some blame here. That’s what I’ve been saying all along. The right wants military spending. The left wants left spending. But in order to get what they want, the right has to give the left welfare spending. Everybody gets what they want except for the taxpayer who gets stuck with the bill.”
