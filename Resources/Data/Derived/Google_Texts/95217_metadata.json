Another chase took place along the bike path on the banks of the Tiber River.\n\nDetails of the plot of the Sam Mendes-directed film had been a well-guarded secret until Bond producer EON Productions acknowledged in December that an early version of the script was among material stolen in the Sony Pictures cyberattack. Details have since circulated online.\n\nNevertheless, curious Romans have come out in droves to take in scenes of the 20-day shoot, which followed an initial one in London.\n\n\u201cI hope to see James Bond. Someone told me that there is also Monica Bellucci,\u201d said Floriana Sacco, 36, as she watched an apparent funeral scene being shot outside EUR\u2019s civic museum. \u201cWe hope that as all other film settings in Rome, it will be beautiful and it will be good publicity to this beautiful city.\u201d\n\nCity officials expect as much as 1 million euros ($1.1 million) in permit fees alone, and that the total boost to the Eternal City could be several times that given the extras, security guards, film crews, catering services and hotels being used.\n\nRome\u2019s historic center has provided the backdrop to several major motion pictures in recent years, including Woody Allen\u2019s 2012 romance \u201cTo Rome With Love,\u201d and Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s 2013 \u201cThe Great Beauty,\u201d which went on to win an Oscar for best foreign film.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After surviving the Sony hack, production for the new James Bond thriller \"SPECTRE\" has moved to Rome, where crowds are gathering to catch a glimpse of 007 and the oldest Bond girl yet, 50-year-old Monica Bellucci.", "Author": "TRISHA THOMAS", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "After surviving the Sony hack, production for the new James Bond thriller \u201cSPECTRE\u201d has moved to Rome, where crowds are gathering to catch a glimpse of 007 and the oldest Bond girl yet, 50-year-old Monica Bellucci.", "title": "007 production moves to Rome with oldest Bond girl, Bellucci", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/24/007-production-moves-to-rome-with-oldest-bond-girl/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/24/f969d955dd120e086f0f6a706700dd50.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/24/f969d955dd120e086f0f6a706700dd50.jpg", "title": "007 production moves to Rome with oldest Bond girl, Bellucci", "description": "After surviving the Sony hack, production for the new James Bond thriller \"SPECTRE\" has moved to Rome, where crowds are gathering to catch a glimpse of 007 and the oldest Bond girl yet, 50-year-old Mo", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f74\"", "article_summary": "ROME (AP) - After surviving the Sony hack, production for the new James Bond thriller \u201cSPECTRE\u201d has moved to Rome, where crowds are gathering to catch a glimpse of 007 and the oldest Bond girl yet, 50-year-old Monica Bellucci.\n\u201cI hope to see James Bond.\nThe main thoroughfare of central Rome, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, was closed to traffic early Tuesday for a nighttime car chase scene featuring Bond\u2019s silver Aston Martin.\nSomeone told me that there is also Monica Bellucci,\u201d said Floriana Sacco, 36, as she watched an apparent funeral scene being shot outside EUR\u2019s civic museum.\nNevertheless, curious Romans have come out in droves to take in scenes of the 20-day shoot, which followed an initial one in London."}
