Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of President Barack Obama on illegal immigration.

A CNN poll found that 61% disapprove of how Obama is handling the issue, and only 35% approve. Obama’s disapproval rating on the issue is at its highest in nearly five years.

The poll was conducted May 29-June 1 as the Obama administration was releasing hundreds of illegal immigrants it could not process in Texas in Arizona. The federal government did not even inform Arizona officials it would be dropping off illegal immigrants at random bus stops. The Obama administration has also indicated that it will unilaterally ease deportations if Congress does not pass an amnesty bill in the next six weeks.

The poll’s margin of error is +/- three percentage points.
