But whereas the Wildcats (19-18-2) had zero quality scoring opportunities the Friars had at least two \u2014 each coming during the same sequence.\n\n..\n\nNoel Acciari burst down the slot and unloaded a shot that was blocked by Danny Tirone (31 saves). The rebound came to Brian Pinho who rifled a shot that hit the crossbar.\n\n\n\nThe Wildcats\u2019 offense was so ineffective during the first period that they went 6:26 without a shot and managed only that one shot during the first 11:10.\n\n..\n\nTirone did his best to keep the Friars (23-13-2) off the scoreboard during the period\u2019s lone power play when he recorded three saves.\n\n\n\nAt period\u2019s end, Providence had outshot New Hampshire, 8-3.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire killed off another penalty early in the second period (holding Providence to zero shots) when the one Wildcat who\u2019s feasted on the Friars this season gave his team a 1-0 lead.\n\n..\n\nShane Eiserman, who was positioned near the left boards, passed to Grayson Downing in the high slot and Downing blasted a slap shot that clanged in off the bottom of the crossbar and behind Jon Gillies (25) at 7:06.\n\n..\n\nThe goal was Downing\u2019s fifth in five games against Providence.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire came within inches of taking a 2-0 lead into intermission when Brett Pesce\u2019s shot hit the left post with just under three minutes remaining.\n\n..\n\nThe fact only two minor penalties were assessed during the first two periods was noteworthy because, at various stages of the second, play morphed into a series of \u201cmini-scrums\u201d that could have escalated into something more serious.\n\n..\n\nUNH\u2019s lead only lasted 80 seconds into the third period when PC tied it during a scramble in front of the net.\n\n\n\nTirone blocked shots by Brandon Tanev and Acciari. But when the Wildcats were unable to clear the puck, Nick Saracino buried it at 1:20.\n\n..\n\nSaracino now has 8-6-14 totals in 14 career games against the Wildcats.\n\n\n\nUNH went on a power play shortly after Saracino\u2019s goal but failed to put a single shot on Gillies.\n\n\n\nThe Friars then had their chance to break the tie during a power play but Tirone blocked a flurry of shots (five to be precise).\n\n..\n\nUNH had one more opportunity to win the game in regulation when it went on a power play with 2:05 left but only managed one shot on goal.\n\n\n\nPC\u2019s Josh Monk was whistled for boarding at 1:09 of overtime but the Wildcats came up empty on their third power play.\n\n..\n\nUNH\u2019s Matt Willows had a golden opportunity to win it when his shot off a rebound hit the left side of the net midway through the extra session.\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just thrilling.
