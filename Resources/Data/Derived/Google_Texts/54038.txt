KRMG reports that Sen. Ted Cruz has planned a campaign rally, scheduled to take place in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Thursday, August 13th. The “This is Cruz Country Rally” will take place at the Union Performing Arts Center, 6636 S. Mingo Road, from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.

In June, Cruz told KRMG that his number one priority will be to terminate the Affordable Care Act.

“I intend to make 2016 a referendum on repealing Obamacare,” Cruz stated. “It’s the biggest job killer in this country, right now, today.”

Cruz stated that the only solution is complete repeal.

“If we come out of November, 2016 with a mandate from the people to get rid of this law, that’s how we come in with a new president in January, 2017, we repeal Obamacare, and then we immediately turn around and pass common-sense health care reform,” Cruz exclaimed.

Cruz is currently at 4th place, with 6.7 percent support.
