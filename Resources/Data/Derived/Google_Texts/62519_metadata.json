Gabrielle Giffords [D-Ariz.], January 2011; Joe Paterno, January 2012).\n\nReport that the U.S. Supreme Court has overturned the Affordable Care Act when in fact it has upheld the Affordable Care Act (June 2012).\n\nReport on the day of the Boston Marathon bombings that a Saudi suspect is in custody when the two Chechen suspects were not identified until three days later (April 2013).\n\nMisidentify the gunman as the brother of the gunman in the Sandy Hook School massacre, nor incorrectly report that the gunman's mother worked at the school (December 2012).\n\nOf course there's nothing new about journalists letting the desire to get it first override the imperative to first get it right. Think \"Dewey Defeats Truman.\"\n\nLess catchy, but almost as egregious, was the New York Post's front page headline reporting that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry John KerryGOP senator calls for China to crack down on illegal opioid Obamas to live in home of former Clinton press secretary: report Even in defeat, Trump could harm the country irreparably MORE had chosen then-Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) as his running mate in 2004. (In hindsight, the Missouri congressman might have been a better choice than Kerry's actual pick, Sen. John Edwards [D-N.C.])\n\nOr how about the terrible moment in 1981 when ABC Newsmen Sam Donaldson and Frank Reynolds, reporting on the attempt on President Reagan's life, told viewers that Press Secretary James Brady had died of his wounds, only to report moments later Brady was still alive? As the normally laconic Reynolds said furiously, \"Let's get it nailed down!\"\n\nFor as long as human beings have gotten wind of some juicy tidbit of news, they have succumbed to the temptation to share it before verifying it. What's changed is the speed at which news spreads. And as the pace of news dissemination has increased, so, too, has the frequency with which inaccurate or wholly incorrect information gets passed along.\n\nOne might think that it wouldn't take that many embarrassments of the \"Dewey Defeats Truman\" variety to get news organizations to proceed with extreme caution, but you know the darned public: Folks want their information fix and they want it now.\n\nOr so say the journalists. \"If they see a headline on a Web site,\" New York Times standards editor Greg Brock told public editor Margaret Sullivan when she asked about Boston Marathon coverage errors, \"they start looking for a complete and fully reported story from us, and they protest if they don't find it.\"\n\nPerhaps. But I can remember polls taken after the Bush-Gore debacle in 2000 which found that a majority of viewers would have preferred to wait until the networks were sure about the outcome of the 2000 election rather than be told that Gore won, no Bush won, no, wait, it's too close to call.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that the so-called legacy media counted on their customers to understand that if they wanted reliable news, they needed to steer clear of upstart websites that flouted the lofty standards of verification held sacred by the mainstream. But when the big boys traffic in gossip as much as their scrappy new competitors do, they don't look like bastions of ethical journalism when they get scooped; they just look old and slow.\n\nHence the renewed emphasis on verification in the new code of ethics. Remember, journos, if your mother tweets she loves you, check it out.\n\nFrank teaches journalism ethics at Penn State University.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The journalism profession is trying to reduce speeding on the information superhighway.", "description": "The journalism profession is trying to reduce speeding on the information superhighway.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Contributors"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The journalism profession is trying to reduce speeding on the information superhighway.", "title": "Whoa, there!
