According to Jennifer Snyder, executive director of DVI, oftentimes these individuals are referred to DVI through other professionals and service providers in the community.\n\n\u201cKnowing that,\u201d explains Snyder, \u201cit is important that we empower other professionals with a skill set that helps them be effective in working with survivors.\u201d\n\nTo this end, DVI will facilitate two professional training programs in the coming weeks.\n\nThe first program focuses on developing the health care response to intimate partner violence. Three separate one-hour introductory sessions will be held on May 17 at HACC\u2019s Lebanon campus at 7:30 a.m., noon and 5 p.m. Registration is free and can be completed by contacting Mike Ritter at 717-273-7154 or dvipec@dviolc.org or online at www.SurveyMonkey.com/r/KXKS2BJ.\n\nSessions are open to health care providers in all areas and specialties, plus support staff. Attendees will be introduced to a four-way model of success for implementing system-wide measures to prevent and respond to intimate partner violence. Developed by Kaiser Permanente and Futures Without Violence, this model is consistent with National Consensus Guidelines and with mandates and recommendations under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cOur goal is a partner network where providers are assessing patients for abuse and making referrals, and we back them up with training, consultation, and support,\u201d says DVI public education coordinator Mike Ritter.\n\nThe second program is a three-day Trauma Awareness and Resiliency Institute for Youth Workers. The institute, created by the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center in partnership with the Defending Childhood Initiative, will run June 8, 15 and 22 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day at Elco High School. Registration is free. Interested persons should contact Ritter or dvipec@dviolc.org.\n\nThe institute is open to all professionals working with youth in Lebanon County. Over the three days, participants will learn about adolescent development, and trauma and its impacts. Participants will also begin developing a framework of trauma-informed care for their organization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited,\u201d says Ritter. \u201cThis is working really well up in Boston. So we think it makes sense as our next step in talking about trauma-informed care here in Lebanon.\u201d\n\nDVI will provide lunch each day. Registrants must attend all three days in order to receive a certificate of completion.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://ldne.ws/1TJWftD", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Every year, more than 1,000 individuals \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 reach out to Domestic Violence Intervention of Lebanon County seeking safety, shelter\u00a0and other services.", "og": {"site_name": "Lebanon Daily News", "description": "Every year, more than 1,000 individuals \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 reach out to Domestic Violence Intervention of Lebanon County seeking safety, shelter\u00a0and other services.", "title": "Domestic violence prevention training planned", "url": "http://www.ldnews.com/story/news/local/2016/05/03/domestic-violence-prevention-training-planned/83878700/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/ldnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Every year, more than 1,000 individuals \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 reach out to Domestic Violence Intervention of Lebanon County seeking safety, shelter\u00a0and other services.", "title": "Domestic violence prevention training planned", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e746f1c038576375df045dbc68229339a4c3b34/c=630-0-2889-2259&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/12/PAGroup/Lebanon/635829456205295548-STOCKIMAGE-localnews.jpg", "creator": "@ldnews", "site": "@ldnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1033666834", "fb": {"app_id": 610255079116433}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1495\"", "article_summary": "Attendees will be introduced to a four-way model of success for implementing system-wide measures to prevent and respond to intimate partner violence.\nThe first program focuses on developing the health care response to intimate partner violence.\nSessions are open to health care providers in all areas and specialties, plus support staff.\nFile Photo (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)Every year, more than 1,000 individuals \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 reach out to Domestic Violence Intervention of Lebanon County seeking safety, shelter and other services.\nThe institute is open to all professionals working with youth in Lebanon County."}
