If so, your iPad might be the problem.\n\nAn 11-year-old boy suffered from an itchy rash, and it turns out it may be from the nickel his first generation Apple iPad contains, according to a report released Monday in the journal Pediatrics.\n\nThe boy, whose name was not released, was treated at Rady Children\u2019s Hospital in San Diego for a rash that developed all over his body. While the boy has a history of skin issues, this particular rash wouldn\u2019t respond to typical treatment. His skin tested positive for nickel, which was traced back to his iPad he frequently used in the past six months.\n\nNickel is one of the most common allergy-inducing metals and has been traced to a variety of personal electronic devices, including laptops and cellphones. While nickel rashes aren\u2019t life-threatening, they can be very uncomfortable and require possible treatment with steroids and antibiotics if the skin eruptions become infected, said Dr. Sharon Jacob, a dermatologist at Rady Children\u2019s Hospital. Jacob also cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus 17 percent from a decade ago.\n\nAccording to the article in Pediatrics, the boy had to miss school because of his rash. He was advised to use the Smart Case, \u201cwhich provides overall coverage of the iPad, as opposed to the Smart Cover, which only provides coverage of the screen.\u201d After using the Smart Case, his rash significantly improved.\n\nIt is uncertain whether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel. Other common triggers for nickel allergies include jewelry, zippers, bra hooks, belt buckles, eye glass frames, metal tools, and keys.\n\nAccording to Mayo Clinic, there is no cure for nickel allergy and once you develop the allergy you will always be sensitive to the metal and should avoid contact.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ipad rash, nickel allergy", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An 11-year-old boy from San Diego developed a rash all over his body after frequently using his first generation Apple iPad.", "title": "You Might Be Allergic To Your iPad (And Other Devices, Too)", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/your-ipad-may-give-you-rash-boy-nickel-allergy-develops-itchy-rash-mobile-device-292850", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/14/apple-ipad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An 11-year-old boy from San Diego developed a rash all over his body after frequently using his first generation Apple iPad.", "title": "You Might Be Allergic To Your iPad (And Other Devices, Too)", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/your-ipad-may-give-you-rash-boy-nickel-allergy-develops-itchy-rash-mobile-device-292850", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/14/apple-ipad.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/14/apple-ipad.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-07-14T12:02:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T12:02:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An 11-year-old boy from San Diego developed a rash all over his body after frequently using his first generation Apple iPad."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdea5c\"", "article_summary": "Other common triggers for nickel allergies include jewelry, zippers, bra hooks, belt buckles, eye glass frames, metal tools, and keys.\nJacob also cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus 17 percent from a decade ago.\nNickel rashes can affect people of all ages and usually develop after repeated or prolonged exposure to items containing nickel.\nWhile the boy has a history of skin issues, this particular rash wouldn\u2019t respond to typical treatment.\nHis skin tested positive for nickel, which was traced back to his iPad he frequently used in the past six months."}
