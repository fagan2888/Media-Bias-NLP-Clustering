Where savvy lobbying and PR campaigns stampede political leaders into reducing the value of your property in a matter of months?\n\nUnfortunately, this increasingly describes the U.S. patent system. In 2011, Congress enacted the America Invents Act (the AIA), widely recognized as the largest change to the U.S. patent system since 1836. Two years later, the House has just passed HR 3309, yet another vast overhaul of the patent system, creating numerous new rules for how all patented innovation is used, licensed and litigated against infringers.\n\nMuch of the AIA is not yet fully tested and implemented. So, why the rush?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOver the past year, a well-funded, aggressive lobbying campaign backed by a few large tech companies has conjured an alleged state of emergency over the specter of so-called \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d a rhetorical term that has no settled, agreed-upon meaning. This epithet has been used to attack individual inventors, universities, and even startups, the very people who rely most on a stable patent system and strong patent rights.\n\nBut inflammatory rhetoric and skillful lobbying have won again in D.C. The House has rushed to judgment by passing H.R. 3309.\n\nThe law would vastly change the rules for how patented innovation is licensed in the marketplace and litigated against infringers. The changes are far too many to recount here, but, simply put, H.R. 3309 makes it harder and more expensive to license and enforce patent rights. Among other things, it creates a \u201closer pays\u201d system in patent law, requires patent owners to provide information they may not yet have at the start of their case, and makes it harder to get the information they need to prove their case.\n\nBoth the substance of these proposed changes and the process by which they have been reached should worry anyone who cares about economic growth and the innovation that makes it possible.\n\nThe rush to enact H.R. 3309 was caused in large part by allegations of a \u201cpatent litigation explosion\u201d in recent years caused by \u201cpatent trolls.\u201d or \u201cnonpracticing entities\u201d (NPE). Proponents repeatedly cited academic studies purporting to show this litigation explosion, but these studies are unreliable. This past August, Congress\u2019 very own Government Accountability Office (GAO) declined to rely on them in its much-anticipated report on patent litigation, describing them as \u201cnonrandom and nongeneralizable.\u201d\n\nThe GAO further recognized that the only significant, measurable increase in patent litigation occurred solely in 2012, and this was entirely the result of changes to patent litigation practices wrought by the AIA. A recently released study by three leading legal empirical scholars, Christopher Cotropia, Jay Kesan, and David Schwartz, also concluded that there was \u201cno explosion in NPE litigation between 2010 and 2012,\u201d and they also found that increases in litigation after 2011 are explained by changes to litigation rules instituted by the AIA. The irony is that these rule changes were advocated by the very parties who are now complaining about the increase in litigation!\n\nWe should not base public policy on dubious studies, and Congress should not ignore solid advice from its own experts at the GAO. Let\u2019s hope the Senate proceeds more cautiously.\n\nThe vote on H.R. 3309 is also a cause for worry because it has demonstrated that the U.S. patent system is open to constant political revision, given enough PR muscle and an extensive enough lobbying budget. First proposed this summer, H.R. 3309 was rushed out of committee and to the floor without hearings, against bipartisan objections from many members and affected parties.\n\nThat\u2019s no way to run a property rights system. Investment and economic growth suffer when property owners cannot rely on stable rules, and changes are driven by political haste rather than sound evidence. Such treatment of property is foolhardy even when it comes from local zoning boards and aldermen. With intellectual property-intensive industries adding over $5 trillion to U.S. GDP in 2010, it\u2019s positively reckless when applied to the patent system.\n\nAs former US Patent and Trademark Office Director David Kappos recently remarked in Capitol Hill testimony, Congress is \u201creworking the greatest innovation engine the world has ever known, almost instantly after it has just been significantly overhauled. If there were ever a case where caution is called for, this is it.\u201d\n\nThe Senate should stop this legislative stampede before real harm is done to the U.S. innovation economy.\n\nMossoff is professor of Law at George Mason University and Schultz is associate professor of Law at Southern Illinois University.
