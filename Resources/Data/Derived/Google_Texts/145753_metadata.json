Why the extreme and even irrational hostility?\n\nSome of the tweets included these gems:\n\n\"f--- you you disgusting saliva gerbil\" (to be honest, I\u2019ve never been called that before)\n\n\"you cranky scheming mustachio'd clown\" (this was also a new one)\n\n\u201cF--- YOU. I don\u2019t have the patience for this nonsense anymore. You are the epitome of everything that\u2019s wrong here.\u201d\n\nWhy such vitriol?\n\nLook again at what I posted.\n\nIt was grounded in love, and I simply expressed what I heard in Bruce Jenner\u2019s words, calling for prayer.\n\nSome of the tweets were so profane that to quote them here would be of no use, since almost every word would have to be censored. But there were plenty of others that, while using better language, were just as ugly:\n\n\u201cyou are a horrible human being\u201d\n\n\u201cyou\u2019re disgusting\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd all i hear is a bigoted old man who is scared to even think that a person may be different than him.\u201d\n\nLater in the evening, in response to some comments others had made (there were some who were not as nasty in their tweets), I asked why the trans advocates discredited those who regretted sex-change surgery or who now believed that you cannot change your gender, posting some relevant links as well.\n\nThen on Saturday, I made this comment: \u201cWho said that being a man or a woman is determined by how one feels? Since when are biology & genetics meaningless?\u201d\n\nIn response to this, one young man wrote, \u201cYOU\u2019RE LITERALLY SO IGNORANT? Why is your mentality stuck in the 60\u2019s, move forward with time to now this stuff happens.\u201d\n\nHow do we deal with such moral madness? How do we even begin to interact with this social insanity that exalts subjective feelings and denies verifiable reality?\n\nAs followers of Jesus, we must be gracious and loving towards those who identity as transgender. And as I\u2019ve said many times before, we need to have great compassion on the children who struggle with gender identity issues, continuing to do our best to get to the root causes of these issues with the goal of providing a way for them and their families to find wholeness without the need for lifelong hormones and sex-change surgery.\n\nBut the fact is that Bruce Jenner is not a woman, and it is not hateful to say so.\n\nIf he were a woman, he would not have been able to father all of his children, nor would he need female hormones to feminize his body.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s a woman. It simply means he\u2019s not a woman.\n\nYet today, even to utter those words is to put oneself in the crosshairs of ugly and vile attacks.\n\nOf course, trans people and their allies will remind us of the terrible struggles they endure, of their very high suicide rates, of their being rejected to the point of homelessness as a result of societal stigmas, at times violently assaulted.\n\nAnd so, the moment you take issue with transgender activism, you are accused of pouring salt in the wounds, of causing more suicides, of deeply hurting precious, sensitive people.\n\nI truly understand this, and I don\u2019t minimize the pain that many of these individuals have lived with.\n\nI\u2019m simply pointing out that the vicious responses to my tweet point to an irrational hatred and anger more than to a caring disagreement, making clear that this is part of a larger ideological struggle in which those of us who hold to biblical marriage and morality and who celebrate gender distinctions will be vilified by those who reject those values.\n\nIronically, LGBT advocates constantly criticize us for holding to clear gender distinctions, telling us that we are being bigoted and stereotyped.\n\n\u201cAfter all,\u201d they argue, \u201cwho says that boys should play with footballs and girls with princess dolls? That is so sexist and out of date.\u201d\n\nYet when a little boy chooses princess dolls over footballs, those same advocates say, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that he is really a she!\u201d\n\nIn the same way, when Bruce Jenner tells Diane Sawyer he thinks the way a woman would think, he\u2019s not accused of gender stereotyping. Instead, he\u2019s celebrated for recognizing his real gender. And on and on it goes.\n\nI truly believe that, in the coming years, our society will come back to its senses (but with greater sensitivity to the struggles endured by trans-identified people).\n\nBut for now, while walking in love towards all, we must stiffen our spines, stand up for what is right, be fervent in prayer, and continue to speak the truth, knowing that ultimately, truth will triumph.\n\nAnd let\u2019s remember to pray for God\u2019s very best for Bruce Jenner.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This past Friday night, I tweeted out, My heart goes out to Bruce Jenner, & when he says, I am a woman, I hear him saying, I am deeply confused & hurting.
