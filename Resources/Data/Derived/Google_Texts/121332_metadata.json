But we don\u2019t need to refer back to hypotheticals to expose the hollowness of precedential arguments like these. Three years ago, Mother Jones' Kevin Drum identified several real instances in which Republicans \u201dfigured out that old traditions are just that: traditions. There\u2019s no law that says you can\u2019t change them.\u201d\n\nMost of the examples are pretty arcane, and many evince a party committed to purpose, willing to use the rules to their advantage to win elections and shape policy, rather than a party contemptuous of democratic processes.\n\nBut the big glaring exception in all this, and the one that really underscores the argument that an abiding concern for traditions doesn\u2019t really drive conservative opposition to Obama\u2019s deportation relief, is the weaponization of the debt limit.\n\nThere, the precedent, and the danger to the constitutional order, was actually quite clear. Republicans in 2011 (and again, to less effect, in 2013) attempted to leverage their control over half of the legislature, to impose their substantive preferences on a Democratic president and the majority party in the Senate by using the threat economic calamity as a bargaining chip. To borrow from the right today, we had a situation in which the speaker of the House tried to usurp the Senate\u2019s agenda-setting power and the president\u2019s plenary power to determine which laws to sign and which to veto, by laying out an unprecedented choice between a right-wing vision without popular support, and default on the national debt.\n\nThe gambit paid off exquisitely in 2011 with the signing of the Budget Control Act, which brought us the indiscriminate spending controls of sequestration.\n\nI don't think there's any way you can argue that Obama would've signed the BCA if you take the debt limit hostage out of the equation. Boehner used the lawful powers at his disposal to settle a big fight over federal spending by fiat\u2014remember the Boehner Rule?\u2014except that since the legislature doesn\u2019t enforce laws, the only way he could accomplish this was to threaten immense damage to the national and global economies as the price of non-compliance.\n\nAnd it worked! It worked so well that he tried it again after Republicans lost the 2012 elections, by which point Obama had learned that Boehner\u2019s leverage was actually illusory.\n\nI think the Budget Control Act is a terrible law, and I think the precedent Boehner wanted to set would\u2019ve been disastrous if it had taken hold. Fortunately, our political system proved resilient enough to prevent Republicans from turning this kind of brinksmanship into a matter of routine, and for that reason we don\u2019t need to relitigate the normative questions Boehner raised over two-plus years of debt limit brinksmanship.\n\nBut if you dip into the archives at National Review\u2014where we can now read about Obama\u2019s similarity to Latin American military dictators\u2014or into Ross Douthat\u2019s old New York Times columns, which today center on the question of whether Obama is more like Caesar or a tin-pot caudillo\u2014you\u2019ll find that the right was much, much more concerned about whether Republicans were making wise tactical moves in debt limit negotiations, or whether conservatives would pocket satisfactory substantive concessions, in what was essentially a legislative mugging, than in questions of precedent.\n\nSeparation of powers concerns almost never creeped in.
