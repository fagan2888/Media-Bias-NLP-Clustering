Bloomberg Bobby Jindal

Will Gov. Bobby Jindal run for president in 2016? If you ask his fellow Louisiana Republican David Vitter, the writing’s on the wall.

Asked on C-Span’s “Newsmakers” if he believes Jindal would like to be commander-in-chief, Louisiana Sen. Vitter replied: “Oh yeah. I think that’s very obvious to everybody who’s paying attention.”

“I do think he’ll run. I think he’s been running. And I think he’ll be a meaningful and significant candidate,” Vitter said.

The 42-year-old Jindal has served as Louisiana governor since January 2008 and is now in his second term.

Here’s a clip of Vitter talking about Jindal on C-Span.
