However, that prognosis was unduly optimistic. As the tumor grew, it blocked the flow of Vaughan\u2019s spinal fluid, causing all of the glands located around it to become inflamed.\n\n\u201cMy head pounded with my heart. My ears were just ringing like crazy and then everything just sounded like I was under water,\u201d said Vaughan.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually causing compression onto my brain stem as well and too much compression onto the brain stem can actually kill you,\u201d said Vaughan.\n\nA Los Angeles surgeon who Vaughan consulted \u2014 one of only three in the U.S. who have extensive experience with these types of tumors \u2014 gave her 60 to 90 days to live if no surgery is performed.\n\nHowever, Vuaghan has been dropped by her parents\u2019 insurance and she is ineligible for Sooner Care, the state\u2019s Affordable Care Act (ACA)-mandated low cost provider. She has missed this year\u2019s open enrollment for private insurance, which resumes on January 1, days after the surgeon has said that Vaughan will die of her tumor if not treated.\n\n\u201cMy 90 day deadline is on December 23rd, day before Christmas Eve,\u201d she explained.\n\nVaughan\u2019s best friend has started a fund drive to raise the $125,000 she needs to pay for the life-saving surgery. So far, said Jessica Eubanks, they have raised $3,000.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about losing her. It\u2019s not a possibility for me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard at raising this money,\u201d Eubanks said. \u201cThe $3,000 is fantastic, but it\u2019s\u2026we\u2019ve got to push harder.\u201d\n\nVaughan says her faith is sustaining her through the fear.\n\n\u201cI know that God\u2019s on my side and so he\u2019s let me know that it\u2019s going to be ok and that he\u2019s got this,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch video about this story, embedded below:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Laci-Vaughan-via-screencap-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Oklahoma woman diagnosed with brain tumor the same day she loses her health coverage"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd133f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s actually causing compression onto my brain stem as well and too much compression onto the brain stem can actually kill you,\u201d said Vaughan.\nImage: Laci Vaughan of Midwest City, OK (Screen capture)A Midwest City, Oklahoma woman learned that she has a life-threatening brain tumor \u2014 on the same day she got dropped from her parents\u2019 health insurance because she turned 26.\nAccording to KFOR Channel 4, Laci Vaughan received her diagnosis in April on the day of her 26th birthday.\n\u201cMy 90 day deadline is on December 23rd, day before Christmas Eve,\u201d she explained.\nAs the tumor grew, it blocked the flow of Vaughan\u2019s spinal fluid, causing all of the glands located around it to become inflamed."}
