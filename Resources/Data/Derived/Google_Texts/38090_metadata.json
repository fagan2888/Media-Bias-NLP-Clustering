He based this partly on the cost of previous U.S. operations in the Middle East.\n\nRelated: The ISIS Dilemma Confronting Obama\n\nThose included U.S. participation in enforcing a no-fly rule over northern and southern Iraq after the 1990-91 Iraq war and U.S. support of NATO allies in their efforts to topple Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.\n\nAdams calls his cost estimate a \u201cback-of-the-envelop\u201d calculation and stressed, \u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who has a hard estimate\u201d on it.\n\nHe added, \u201cThere are no assumptions yet based on operations and anticipated losses and number of trainers. You would have to run all those numbers.\u201d\n\nRelated: The ISIS Massacre We\u2019re Not Preventing\n\nWhile many are demanding a strong response to ISIS\u2019s brutal beheading of American journalist James Foley, lawmakers returning from a five-week recess after Labor Day will have to grapple with just how much uthority to grant Obama and how to pay for the expanded operations.\n\nThe administration is preparing to request authorization from Congress for escalated military action against the Sunni Muslim terror group \u201cacross Iraq and Syria,\u201d under a revised counter-terrorism strategy the president unveiled last year, The Washington Post reported over the weekend.\n\nOptions range from beefing up the training and equipping of allied government forces and rebels, to extending a limited air campaign in northern Iraq to parts of Syria. The overall goal appears to be driving the ruthless ISIS out of Iraq and containing the group in its Syrian stronghold.\n\n\u201cRooting out a cancer like [ISIS] won\u2019t be easy and it won\u2019t be quick,\u201d President Obama told the American Legion National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday, as NBC News and others reported. \u201cBut tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Rand Paul Doctrine: Don\u2019t Get Involved\n\nPrecisely what a stepped-up military campaign against ISIS would actually cost the U.S. is still a guess, of course, largely because the White House and the Pentagon are still considering major options. Moreover, Congress is still on vacation, and there\u2019s no way of accurately gauging what support the president can expect from rank-and-file Republicans.\n\nThe $10 billion to $15 billion estimate from Adams of American University would come on top of the administration\u2019s defense budget request for fiscal 2015, which begins Oct. 1, including $496 billion for personnel and general DOD operating costs as well as $58 billion for \u201cOverseas Contingency Operations,\u201d which covers the actual cost of wars.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) have urged the president to prepare a tough, comprehensive plan to combat or defeat ISIS. Even before Foley\u2019s murder last week, 54 percent of Americans said they supported the current limited U.S. airstrikes against ISIS, while 39 percent opposed them, according to a poll by The Washington Post-ABC News.\n\nAdams warned that despite the gung-ho rhetoric of defense hawks like Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), rank-and-file lawmakers and members of appropriations committees may be more skittish about granting the president expanded war powers and additional funding.\n\nRelated: Why Military Personnel Costs Have Soared Since 9/11\n\n\u201cCongress would actually have to have a vote to authorize it and they would have to jack up the budget,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the politics on this are at all clear right now and won\u2019t be for another week or two.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe money issue has not been addressed in the Congress at all.\u201d\n\nIf the government finances this chapter of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East the same way it\u2019s financed the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, it will simply add the cost to the nation\u2019s credit card. George W. Bush was the first president since World War II to use deficit spending to cover the cost of decisions to invade Iraq and Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nThat added about $1.5 trillion in military costs to the federal debt over the subsequent 13 years \u2013 and prompted some liberal Democrats, including former House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey of Wisconsin, to call for a special \u201cwar surtax.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why The Pentagon\u2019s New Spending Plan Is a Myth\n\nThe surtax would be \u201ca percentage of your tax bill,\u201d Obey explained in 2007, according to CNN. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like the cost, then shut down the war.\u201d The measure would have required low-income and middle-income taxpayers to add 2 percent to their tax bill, while higher income taxpayers would pay an additional 12 to 15 percent.\n\nThe idea never gained traction \u2013 and won\u2019t this time either. Congress is in no mood to raise taxes before a crucial November election that will determine the political control of the House and Senate. What\u2019s more, the cost of expanding military action against ISIS is unlikely to be onerous compared to the overall $4 trillion federal budget \u2013 at least early on.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you put on a surtax every time there is a short-term bubble in policy change,\u201d Obey said in a phone interview Tuesday. \u201cBut if it were to go on for a significant amount of time, people ought to take a hard look at it.\u201d\n\nObey added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to pay a price for years because we didn\u2019t have a war surtax to pay for Iraq and Afghanistan. But I think there\u2019s probably a very large difference between the magnitude of the cost then and the cost now.\u201d\n\nThis article was updated on Thursday, August 28 to correct a reference to the first Gulf War.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Going after the Islamic State will likely cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars a year in stepped-up air power, surveillance and use of military \u201cadvisers.\u201d Lawmakers will have to grapple with how much authority to grant President Obama and how to pay for the operations.", "title": "U.S. Military Campaign Against ISIS May Cost $15 Billion a Year", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/27/US-Military-Campaign-Against-ISIS-May-Cost-15-Billion-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/27/US-Military-Campaign-Against-ISIS-May-Cost-15-Billion-Year", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Going after the Islamic State will likely cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars a year in stepped-up air power, surveillance and use of military \u201cadvisers.\u201d Lawmakers will have to grapple with how much authority to grant President Obama and how to pay for the operations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3db\"", "article_summary": "Gordon Adams, a professor of international relations at American University and an expert on defense spending, told The Fiscal Times Tuesday that a realistic guestimate of the cost of an aggressive campaign against ISIS ranges from $10 billion to $15 billion in fiscal 2015.\nHowever President Obama decides to go after the murderous Islamic State, the price of military action will be enormous: It will likely cost the U.S. $10 billion to $15 billion a year or more in stepped-up military air power and surveillance and expanded ground support.\nWhat\u2019s more, the cost of expanding military action against ISIS is unlikely to be onerous compared to the overall $4 trillion federal budget \u2013 at least early on.\nThe $10 billion to $15 billion estimate from Adams of American University would come on top of the administration\u2019s defense budget request for fiscal 2015, which begins Oct. 1, including $496 billion for personnel and general DOD operating costs as well as $58 billion for \u201cOverseas Contingency Operations,\u201d which covers the actual cost of wars.\nAdams calls his cost estimate a \u201cback-of-the-envelop\u201d calculation and stressed, \u201cI don\u2019t know of anybody who has a hard estimate\u201d on it."}
