When some people are so emotionally close, they are often dubbed as being, “attached at the hip.” Well, brothers Shivanath and Shivram Sahu, 12, are actually that close emotionally and physically, too. As conjoined twins, the boys, who live in a village near Raipur in India, have spent every moment of their lives together, and they plan on staying that way.

"We don't wish to get separated," Shivram told Barcroft TV. "We will stay like this even when we grow old. We want to live as we are.”

The boys were born joined at the waist, and they share two legs, but they have independent lungs, brains, and hearts. They have also learned to shower, eat, and go about their daily chores.

“We have taught ourselves everything. We ride to school on a bicycle and playing cricket is no problem,” Shivanath said.

Their father, Raj Kumar, 45, is very protective over his sons. “For everyone it is good fun to watch my children, but only I understand all the problems they have,” he said, the Daily Mail reported. “During rainy season it becomes difficult for them to walk and when one wants to sit the other has to lie down."

Despite their setbacks, Kumar says he wouldn’t change his sons for the world. "God has created them like this so they have to walk like they do. They will remain like this. I don't want anything else.”
