Well, this happened:\n\nso basically Obama & Huff were geared up to make fun of Matt Drudge & then they realized they were wrong halfway through their propaganda \u2014 Chuck Peters (@sayata) March 23, 2014\n\nBingo.\n\nAs Twitchy reported, Matt Drudge on Friday tweeted that he had just paid the Obamacare penalty, which he called a \u201cLiberty Tax.\u201d The White House, the Left and media lapdogs (concentric circles on a Venn diagram) swiftly began to mock and ridicule Matt Drudge, attempting to brand him a liar.\n\nNot understanding small biz pays taxes quarterly reflects poorly on White House and #ACA allies http://t.co/X06qU9miT3 via @BreitbartNews \u2014 Bruce Gilbert (@HIXworks) March 23, 2014\n\n3) Many Left wing hacks (disguised as Journalists) shamed themselves attacking @DRUDGE & entrepreneurs: http://t.co/gTONoDKStM \u2014 nextinstinct (@nextinstinct) March 23, 2014\n\nYep. More from The Washington Times:\n\nWhat each critical tweeter and pundit failed to realize was that Mr. Drudge, as the self-employed proprietor of The Drudge Report, files taxes as a small business on a quarterly basis. The IRS requires self-employed business owners to file annual returns and pay estimated quarterly taxes. When entrepreneurs like Mr. Drudge file their 2014 first quarter taxes, they have to pay the individual health care mandate if they are not getting Obamacare coverage.\n\nHuh. Fancy that.\n\n@Gre8Scott @instapundit @DRUDGE Did you expect them to have a better understanding about taxes than they do about everything else? \u2014 Kevin O'Connell (@tank_demon) March 23, 2014\n\nReality, like taxes, is hard!\n\nMatt Drudge followed up on Sunday.
