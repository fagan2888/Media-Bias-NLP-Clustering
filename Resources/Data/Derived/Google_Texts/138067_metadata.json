Other issues likely to command attention include Minnesota\u2019s public health programs, Medicaid and MinnesotaCare.\n\nA recent audit found those programs did a poor job making sure everyone enrolled in those programs was actually eligible to do so \u2014 and predicted the cost to taxpayers of this oversight exceeded $100 million per year.\n\nRelated Articles Mining the Minnesota Legislature\u2019s work, extracting morsels\n\nMark Dayton may need more time to veto/sign budget, tax bills\n\nCapitol intruder left threatening signs, stuck knife in podium, charges say\n\nThe 2016 legislative session: What got done, what didn\u2019t, what\u2019s next\n\nEditorial: Our checks and balances matter, even if they\u2019re not pretty DFLers say the audit may have overestimated the problem but add that the state should do more to ensure everyone receiving taxpayer-supported health care is eligible for the programs. Republicans, who called for a crackdown on waste and fraud in Medicaid last year, are expected to redouble their efforts.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle also plan on targeting Minnesota\u2019s practice of putting liens on the estates of Medicaid enrollees older than 55 to recover the cost of their care. Minnesota has done this for a long time for people receiving Medicaid for long-term care, but Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act means healthy, active middle-aged Minnesotans have started to get hit by liens, too.\n\nSen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, has promised to try to change the law so the Department of Human Services doesn\u2019t go after the estates of people receiving Medicaid for normal medical care. He also wants to make the change retroactive, so people who\u2019ve already racked up thousands of dollars in claims against their estates \u2014 sometimes without realizing it \u2014 can get off the hook.\n\nLourey\u2019s Republican counterpart, Rep. Matt Dean, of Dellwood, said he\u2019s open to such a change.\n\nHere are some other health and human services issues that could come up this year:\n\nDrug costs: Politicians and insurers alike want to try to target high prescription drug costs but aren\u2019t sure what can be done on the state level to tackle a national problem. One idea: require more price transparency from drug companies.\n\nProvider tax: Minnesota\u2019s 2 percent tax on medical services is scheduled to expire in 2019, and some groups want to make it permanent. With Republicans opposed, don\u2019t expect anything to happen this year.\n\nMental health: Lawmakers expanded support for mental health treatments last year, but lawmakers in both parties want to go further.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Minnesota Legislature", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Twin Cities", "description": "MNsure isn\u2019t the only health care topic up for debate this legislative session.
