â€” Cumberland County authorities charged a 27-year-old man Thursday night with breaking into more than a dozen vehicles along Chicken Foot Road southeast of Hope Mills.

Luis Alfonso Mercado, of 3581 Birchfield Court, is charged with eight counts each of felony breaking and entering, misdemeanor larceny and misdemeanor possession of stolen goods.

According to investigators, Mercado stole a gift card and other items from a car parked on Kalmia Lane. The gift card was later used to purchase gasoline at a Murphy USA on North Main Street in Hope Mills.

Mercado was in the Cumberland County jail Friday under a $15,000 secured bond.
