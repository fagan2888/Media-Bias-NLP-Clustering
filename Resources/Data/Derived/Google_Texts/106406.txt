Recent data shows that women outnumber men 2 to 1 in new Delaware Medicaid enrollees.

The News Journal reports that since Delaware expanded its Medicaid program through the Affordable Care Act in January 2014, women have been the majority of those enrolling for benefits. According to data from the Delaware Heal Commission, at the end of January women made up 63 percent of the 9,896 new enrollees.

Officials like Delaware Health Secretary Rita Landgraf say a lack of jobs and educational opportunities as well as wage equity are major drivers of the number. She says poverty is the number one social determinant in health.

Officials hope upcoming programs can help relieve this problem, like college and career prep program Successful Pathways and Roads to Careers.
