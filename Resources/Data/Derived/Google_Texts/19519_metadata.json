Not only is it a splendid showcase for one of our finest comedic actresses, but having her around has also helped us better understand where some of Danny\u2019s many hangups stem from, and even helped us get to know Mindy \u2014 whose interactions with Annette have been occasionally tense, sometimes outright unpleasant \u2014 a little better. As we saw last night, the integration of Annette has also been key to introducing new areas of friction within the Danny-Mindy relationship.\n\nBut now that Annette is a feature of the show, the absence of Mindy\u2019s parents is even more conspicuous. At this year\u2019s New Yorker Festival, Mindy Kaling explained why they haven\u2019t shown up yet, saying that while she plans to include them at some point, she has had difficulty casting someone to play her mother, who passed away before the show premiered in 2012. That is totally understandable, needless to say, but Mindy Kaling isn\u2019t Mindy Lahiri, and it\u2019s hard not to think that introducing Mindy\u2019s parents could provide a useful layer of character development for one of the most deliberately, charmingly superficial characters on TV.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason that \u201cmeeting the parents\u201d is such an often-used sitcom trope. Particularly in a show about the relationship between urban professionals, the eventual introduction of the parents can provide a deeper insight into adult characters who may have seemed thus far to be living in a vacuum. While we know a lot about Mindy\u2019s feelings on Michael Fassbender and sour straws, her inner life is something of a blank space (think of how few real insights were revealed when Danny read Mindy\u2019s diary). But intelligently deploying Mindy\u2019s parents could be a huge moment both for her character and for the show. The parents have already informed our understanding of Mindy in subtle ways: We know that they would only let her go to Jewish sleepaway camp (\u201cthey only trusted me in the gentle hands of the Jews of the Berkshires\u201d), that they send her an email every day called \u201cMindy\u2019s Compliment Corner.\u201d Let us see this beautiful lunacy in action.\n\nWhile Jack Donaghy on \u201c30 Rock\u201d read mostly as a caricature, his scenes with his mother, played to perfection by the late and wonderful Elaine Stritch, softened him and gave us context for his prickly exterior, showing the audience his rarely seen vulnerable side. While \u201cSex and the City\u201d was unusually devoid on parental plotlines, the episode where Miranda\u2019s mother passed away was one of the show\u2019s emotional high points. And what would George be without Frank and Estelle Costanza? His parents, like Jerry\u2019s, became an integral part of the character\u2019s mythology; plus, by letting us in on George\u2019s family traditions, the world gained a tradition of its own (a festivus for the rest of us).", "article_metadata": {"description": "There\u2019s a reason \"meeting the parents\" is a favorite sitcom trope -- it's a great shortcut to character development", "title": "Dear \u201cMindy Project\u201d: It\u2019s time to introduce Mindy Lahiri\u2019s parents", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There\u2019s a reason \"meeting the parents\" is a favorite sitcom trope -- it's a great shortcut to character development", "title": "Dear \u201cMindy Project\u201d: It\u2019s time to introduce Mindy Lahiri\u2019s parents", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/03/dear_mindy_project_its_time_to_introduce_mindy_lahiris_parents/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mindy_project.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There\u2019s a reason \"meeting the parents\" is a favorite sitcom trope -- it's a great shortcut to character development", "title": "Dear \u201cMindy Project\u201d: It\u2019s time to introduce Mindy Lahiri\u2019s parents", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/mindy_project.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Mindy Kaling, Mindy Lahiri, parents, Sitcoms, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7ee\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Mindy Kaling, Mindy Lahiri, parents, Sitcoms, TV, Entertainment NewsRhea Perlman\u2019s \u201cMindy Project\u201d guest spot as Danny\u2019s overbearing Staten Island ma, Annette Castellano, has been exactly what the show needed.\nBut intelligently deploying Mindy\u2019s parents could be a huge moment both for her character and for the show.\nBut now that Annette is a feature of the show, the absence of Mindy\u2019s parents is even more conspicuous.\nThat is totally understandable, needless to say, but Mindy Kaling isn\u2019t Mindy Lahiri, and it\u2019s hard not to think that introducing Mindy\u2019s parents could provide a useful layer of character development for one of the most deliberately, charmingly superficial characters on TV.\nAs we saw last night, the integration of Annette has also been key to introducing new areas of friction within the Danny-Mindy relationship."}
