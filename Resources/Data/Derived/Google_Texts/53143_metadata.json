That would hit growth and increase pressure on the RBI to do more, the officials said.\n\n\"If private investment doesn't pick up, the burden on monetary policy to boost growth will increase,\" one of them said.\n\nA finance ministry official said the impact of higher salaries on inflation will be marginal.\n\nOn Thursday, Junior Finance Minister Jayant Sinha acknowledged that a tight fiscal policy will help in further monetary policy easing.\n\n\"If we don't provide that (macroeconomic stability) space to monetary policy by generally running a relatively tighter fiscal policy, we cannot expect monetary policy to loosen up as a result of that,\" Sinha said at an event. \"This is the kind of environment we have tried to create on the macro side.\"\n\nThe RBI did not have an immediate comment.\n\nOn Tuesday, RBI Deputy Governor S.S. Mundra said he thought the budget was balanced, with long-term benefits.\n\nThe views of the three officials, who asked not to be named, only partially reflect RBI thinking, but do give fresh insight into the bank's post-budget thinking and highlight some issues the RBI is likely to focus on this year as it deliberates on future monetary policy.\n\nby 125 basis points to 6.75 percent in 2015. Analysts and traders expect another 25 basis point cut in response to the budget, followed by a similar cut later in the year, perhaps by June. CREDIBLE BUDGET RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has said that sticking to a fiscal consolidation roadmap, while taking steps to boost supply-side bottlenecks and control subsidy spending, will help create space for further rate cuts. He has also pledged to bring down India's notoriously high inflation to 5 percent by March 2017 and 4 percent in the medium term. The officials said the 2016-17 budget was more credible than last year's, with realistic estimates on tax revenues, capital expenditure and supply-side measures to control food prices - indicating room for one more rate cut. But the bank has told the government it expects a bigger jump in retail inflation due to salary and pension revisions than the government's calculations, one of the officials said. \"On the face of it, the quality of spending has worsened because revenue expenditure has gone up more than capital expenditure,\" said A. Prasanna, an economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. Prasanna expects the RBI to cut the repo rate by 25 basis points at most, with inflation unlikely to dip below 5 percent.
