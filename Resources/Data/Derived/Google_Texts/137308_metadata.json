If nothing else, this meeting figures to be an important test of their wills.\n\nBelichick is the NFL\u2019s version of a mad scientist, a strategist who\u2019s willing to overhaul his game plan from week to week, in part because he has quarterback Tom Brady to anchor the offense and enough mix-and-match defenders to play a variety of schemes.\n\nPHOTOS: Patriots vs. Packers could be Super Bowl preview\n\nMcCarthy, too, has proved plenty adaptable during his nine seasons in charge at Green Bay. But his coaching philosophy was formed early in his career, and with Aaron Rodgers, an equally smart, adaptable and accurate quarterback in his corner, he\u2019s more likely to take a nip-and-tuck approach to change rather than a face-lift.\n\nMcCarthy learned the virtue of patience nearly 30 years ago, as a skilled but undersized Pittsburgh prep star looking to play tight end in college. He wound up at tiny Baker University (enrollment: 3,200 students) outside of Kansas City, a football powerhouse in NAIA play. What McCarthy didn\u2019t know at the time was that the Wildcats\u2019 dominance was built on an option running game.\n\n\u201cIt could be third-and-15, third-and-16, third-and-whatever and we\u2019d almost always run. Poor Mike,\u201d said Scott Rampy, who played quarterback at Baker during McCarthy\u2019s time there and remains a good friend. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wound up blocking a lot more than he ever imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what they told me before I went there,\u201d McCarthy recalled with a chuckle Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s good recruiting.\u201d\n\nIt turned out to be, though, since in addition to patience, Baker is where McCarthy first became a student of the game.\n\nHe learned the value of preparation from the late Charlie Richard, a Hall of Fame coach. But his first real hands-on experience came when then-assistant Dan Harris turned over responsibility for the line calls to McCarthy in his senior year.\n\n\u201cThat was the first sign of his coaching potential,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe began to analyze the game in more detail.\u201d\n\nBoth Harris and Rampy said McCarthy was an instant hit at Baker, regaling the mostly small-town recruits with tales of the big city, showing the kind of leadership that got him elected captain his last two seasons. The Wildcats finished second and fourth in the NAIA playoffs, but those around him sensed McCarthy\u2019s football days were just beginning.\n\n\u201cAfter graduation, we worked to get Mike a graduate assistantship in college and the rest,\u201d Harris said, \u201cis history.\u201d\n\nNot quite. McCarthy went from Baker to Fort Hays State and coached linebackers there. After two years seeing the game from the other side of the ball, he went back on offense at Pitt under coach Mike Gottfried and quarterback guru Paul Hackett. Stints as an NFL assistant in Kansas City, Green Bay, New Orleans and San Francisco followed before McCarthy returned to Green Bay as the boss in 2006.\n\nGiven the chance to draw up his own game plans, McCarthy went back to his Baker roots.\n\n\u201cThe way Charlie Richard went about a football game \u2026 one thing you knew when you stepped on a field, you were extremely confident,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou felt like you were better prepared than your opponent. Charlie was an aggressive, offensive play-caller, because not only did we have our bread-and-butter option package, there were always deceptions and big-play opportunities that he would create.\u201d\n\nPreparing for a Belichick-coached team is particularly tricky, as New England\u2019s seven straight wins attest. The three-time Super Bowl winner found a way to disarm such luminaries as Denver\u2019s Peyton Manning and Indianapolis\u2019 Andrew Luck during the run, and would love to shut down Rodgers for the trifecta.\n\nBelichick won both previous meetings and while he and McCarthy approach the game differently, there are some important similarities.\n\nAsked to compare the two quarterbacks early in the week, Belichick replied tersely, \u201cThey both wear No. 12,\u201d before ending his session with the media.\n\nFaced with the same question, McCarthy replied \u201cThey\u2019re both from California,\u201d and he, too, called it a day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New England at Green Bay features the two best teams with the most potent offenses in the NFL at the moment.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "New England at Green Bay features the two best teams with the most potent offenses in the NFL at the moment.", "title": "Patriots vs. Packers could be Super Bowl preview", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/29/patriots-vs-packers-could-be-super-bowl-preview/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/ab2b7b1de78ccf2e660f6a706700913b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/29/ab2b7b1de78ccf2e660f6a706700913b.jpg", "description": "New England at Green Bay features the two best teams with the most potent offenses in the NFL at the moment.", "card": "summary", "title": "Patriots vs. Packers could be Super Bowl preview"}, "Author": "Jim Litke", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Bill Belichick, NFL, Football, Super Bowl"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Patriots vs. Packers could be Super Bowl previewMcCarthy, too, has proved plenty adaptable during his nine seasons in charge at Green Bay.\nIt\u2019s being billed in some quarters as a Super Bowl preview and, if so, watch how Pats coach Bill Belichick and Packers counterpart Mike McCarthy react to each other\u2019s moves.\nNew England at Green Bay features the two best teams with the most potent offenses in the NFL at the moment.\nStints as an NFL assistant in Kansas City, Green Bay, New Orleans and San Francisco followed before McCarthy returned to Green Bay as the boss in 2006.\nGiven the chance to draw up his own game plans, McCarthy went back to his Baker roots."}
