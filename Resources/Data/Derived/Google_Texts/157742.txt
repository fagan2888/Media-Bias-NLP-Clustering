Police are searching for three suspects after a woman was shot inside her Denver home early Saturday morning, officials said.

The woman, who was taken to a hospital, suffered non-life threatening injuries when three men entered her home in the 1900 block of West 38th Avenue before 5 a.m. and shot her, said Denver police spokesman Raquel Lopez.

As of 10 a.m., police have detained one man for questioning. No one has been arrested at this time, police said.

It is unclear if the suspects entered the home by force, Lopez said.

Neighbor Tommy Clenin was shocked when a police officer knocked on his door this morning and asked if he had heard anything.

Clenin, who hadn’t heard shots or commotion, stepped outside to see police tape stretched throughout his neighborhood and officers swarming the area.

“It’s usually quiet,” Clenin said. “We all know each other here. These are good people. I hope that woman is OK.”

The search for suspects and investigation into the shooting remains ongoing.

This is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.
