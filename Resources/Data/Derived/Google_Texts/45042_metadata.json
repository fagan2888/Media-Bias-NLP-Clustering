The company was originally paid $73 million to develop the failed website, meaning it will still walk away having pocketed $28 million, according to the Office of Maryland\u2019s Attorney General.\n\nSEE ALSO: Police close busy D.C. street over reports of a pressure cooker\n\nBut Attorney General Brian Frosh called the agreement a \u201cfair deal for taxpayers\u201d noting that the company\u2019s own financial constraints may have limited the state\u2019s ability to recoup all losses through litigation.\n\n\u201cThis company never delivered on what it promised, and, as a result, tens of millions of taxpayer dollars were wasted, and thousands of Marylanders suffered delays and frustration,\u201d Mr. Frosh said in a statement announcing the settlement.\n\nSpokesman David Nitkin said in the event a judgment in the state\u2019s favor would have required Noridian to pay back a higher amount, the company could have potentially gone bankrupt making it difficult to collect any payments.\n\nSEE ALSO: Questionable Obamacare claims cost taxpayers $2 billion\n\nMaryland was among 14 states that chose to build their own health-insurance marketplace. While its failed rollout was hardly the most disastrous, Maryland appears to be ahead of the curve in reaching a final agreement with the company that botched its exchange.\n\nInvestigations of other failed exchanges are still underway in Massachusetts and Nevada. The Associated Press previously reported that federal authorities have subpoenaed records related to the exchanges in both states.\n\nMeanwhile the state of Oregon and Oracle, the company that designed its failed exchange, are embroiled in dueling lawsuits accusing the other party of botching the exchange.\n\nGovernor Larry Hogan, who was critical of the handling of the Maryland exchange during his campaign, said the state would continue to seek to recover damages.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of Maryland\u2019s Health Exchange was a debacle that could have been avoided,\u201d Mr. Hogan said. \u201cThis settlement represents only the first step in the process and we\u2019ll continue to aggressively pursue other avenues to recover damages.\u201d\n\nThe stipulations of the settlement also free Maryland from contractual obligations with the company.\n\n\u201cStates across the country that implemented their own exchanges encountered significant challenges,\u201d said Noridian President Tom McGraw. \u201cThis settlement allows us to move forward and focus on our core business of processing health care claims and providing related administrative services.\u201d\n\nThe state originally signed a five year, $193 million contract with the Fargo, North Dakota-based company to build and maintain the online exchange. However the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange voted in 2014 to sever the contract following the botched rollout and hired Columbia-based Optum/QSSI to help run the flawed exchange. Deloitte Consulting was later brought on for $45 million to put in place the off-the-shelf technology that had already been used in Connecticut.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fallout, state Republicans in Minnesota and Vermont have called on their states to ditch their faulty websites and use the federal portal, citing a Supreme Court decision last month that said qualified customers can get income-based exchange subsidies no matter where they live.\n\nTheir calls to action reflect a broad shift toward use of HealthCare.gov, which stumbled out of the gate but recovered after a team of technical gurus salvaged the site in late 2013, setting up a relatively successful finish to Obamacare\u2019s first enrollment period and a calm second round.\n\nSome states weren\u2019t so lucky. Exchanges in Oregon and Nevada couldn\u2019t recover from early glitches, so they turned to the federal government for their web enrollment needs in the second year.\n\nEarlier this year, Hawaii announced that it will transfer its enrollment to HealthCare.gov before sign-ups begin anew this fall.\n\nMassachusetts and Maryland, meanwhile, fared better in Obamacare\u2019s second year after they ditched their vendors and used off-the-shelf technology that had worked in other states.\n\n\u2981 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The main contractor responsible for building Maryland's botched online health exchange has agreed to pay $45 million to avoid any legal action over its poor performance, state officials announced Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The main contractor responsible for building Maryland\u2019s botched online health exchange has agreed to pay $45 million to avoid any legal action over its poor performance, state officials announced Tuesday.", "title": "Contractor for Maryland health exchange website to pay $45M", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/21/contractor-md-health-exchange-website-pay-45m/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/15/4_152014_md-health8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/15/4_152014_md-health8201.jpg", "description": "The main contractor responsible for building Maryland's botched online health exchange has agreed to pay $45 million to avoid any legal action over its poor performance, state officials announced Tues", "card": "summary", "title": "Contractor for Maryland health exchange website to pay $45M"}, "Author": "Andrea Noble", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Noridian Healthcare Solutions Llc"}, "article_summary": "However the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange voted in 2014 to sever the contract following the botched rollout and hired Columbia-based Optum/QSSI to help run the flawed exchange.\n\u201cThe roll-out of Maryland\u2019s Health Exchange was a debacle that could have been avoided,\u201d Mr. Hogan said.\nThe main contractor responsible for building Maryland\u2019s flawed online health exchange has agreed to pay $45 million to avoid any legal action over poor performance, state officials announced Tuesday.\nGovernor Larry Hogan, who was critical of the handling of the Maryland exchange during his campaign, said the state would continue to seek to recover damages.\nInvestigations of other failed exchanges are still underway in Massachusetts and Nevada."}
