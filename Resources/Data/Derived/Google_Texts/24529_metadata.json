Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker attended the Basque Fry, an event Attorney General Adam Laxalt resurrected, similar to those hosted by Laxalt\u2019s grandfather, former Nevada governor and U.S. Sen. Paul Laxalt. Many of the other invited presidential candidates attended the Iowa State Fair this weekend.\n\nCruz said that in his home state of Texas, the federal government owns only 2 percent of the land.\n\nCruz said the federal government should transfer the land back to the state. During his stint in Congress, Cruz said he introduced an amendment to limit how much land the federal government may own in each state.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be the state of Nevada\u2019s people who own the land,\u201d Cruz said, adding once in private hands, the land can be developed for recreation or development.\n\nGardnerville residents Tony Pearl, a Cruz supporter, and Brooke Luckey, said they were interested in what each candidate had to say. Luckey also wanted more candidates to attend.\n\n\u201cWith everyone here, I would be happy with anyone,\u201d Luckey said. \u201cBut I would like to hear more from Bobby Jindal (Louisiana\u2019s governor).\u201d\n\nBoth Republican Assemblyman Jim Wheeler and state Sen. James Settelmeyer, who represent Douglas County, said they were pleased with the inaugural event and the candidates who made appearances.\n\n\u201cThis is a phenomenal event,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI credit Adam for reinvigorating this event. I would have liked to see more candidates.\u201d\n\nSettelmeyer said the guests appreciated the opportunity to see the candidates at the Basque fry.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve loved to see all the candidates here, but I\u2019m glad to see many of the top tier candidates,\u201d Settelmeyer added.\n\nWalker has made several trips to Nevada after announcing his candidacy for president. He listed his accomplishments occurring in a blue state dominated by Democratic legislators.\n\n\u201cI took Wisconsin to a right to work state, and I defunded Planned Parenthood four years ago before there was any video,\u201d he said.\n\nA common theme from every candidate was the Affordable Care Act. Walker was no different. The second-term governor said Obamacare must be repealed.\n\nWalker said he has traveled throughout the country, talking to voters.\n\n\u201cI can tell you a lot of people are fed up with Washington. It\u2019s 68-square miles surrounded by reality,\u201d Walker said, drawing loud applause and laughter.\n\nAll four candidates railed against Democrat Hillary Clinton, the current frontrunner in her party for the presidential nomination.\n\nCarson said the United States is a land where many people can realize their dreams. For him, it was becoming a successful neurosurgeon.\n\n\u201cI love anything to do with medicine,\u201d he said.\n\nCarson said Americans live in a \u201ccan-do\u201d nation, not what the country can do for them. He said his mother, for example, worked various jobs to ensure Carson and his younger brother succeeded. She required her sons to check out books weekly from the library and do reports on them.\n\n\u201cShe was softspoken but forceful,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen he mentioned his religious beliefs and his mother\u2019s faith, Carson was down to earth in seeking help.\n\n\u201cThe nice thing with God is you don\u2019t need a Ph.D. to talk to him,\u201d he said.\n\nFiorina, who appeared in the second-tier of debaters on the Fox News Channel 10 days ago, received favorable responses for her comments and presence on the stage. That winning formula for Fiorina was also apparent Saturday. Before the debate, she said about 40 percent of Republicans didn\u2019t know of her \u2026 now most of them do.\n\nAs she did in the Fox debate and at many of her campaign stops, Fiorina has taken Clinton to task, accusing her of lying about the Benghazi attack in 2012, her personal computer\u2019s server and State Department emails found on her personal computer.\n\nFiorina said her goal is to make people aware of conservatism and how it works in government. She decried how liberal-leaning lawmakers in California have bowed to environmental policies and regulations that have restricted the state\u2019s ability to store water, specifically an issue heightened during the drought.\n\nFiorina, who believes in a strong military and feels strongly for veterans\u2019 care, said if elected president, she would make two calls on her first day: The first would be to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu telling him the United States would \u201cstand by\u201d his country and the second, to the supreme leader of Iran, telling him no deal on a nuclear treaty until the Iranians allowed inspections at every military and nuclear facility.\n\nRural Caucus Chairman Wes Rice said the Basque fry was an outstanding event that attracted candidates willing to mingle with the crowds and guests from every county in Nevada.\n\n\u201cWe had friends from Elko here and Mineral and Esmeralda counties,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have a lot of volunteers from Carson City and Douglas County. I\u2019m impressed with the rural effort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four Republican presidential hopefuls offered both rhetoric and solutions on Saturday in Gardnerville to take back the White House from the Democrats in 2016.Candidates Dr. Ben Carson, former Hewlett", "og": {"url": "http://www.RecordCourier.com/news/17743483-113/ben-carson-ted-cruz-carly-fiorina-and-scott", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.RecordCourier.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=Sm1Hrkyl99Yvxz7ZgZvu$8$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYug_FWA7xVDfWX3AOEKUu9CWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "site_name": "The Record Courier", "description": "Four Republican presidential hopefuls offered both rhetoric and solutions on Saturday in Gardnerville to take back the White House from the Democrats in 2016.Candidates Dr. Ben Carson, former Hewlett", "title": "Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Scott Walker attend Basque fry in Northern Nevada | RecordCourier.com"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RecordCourierNV", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 149059075256920}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 17743483}}, "__sync_contentCategory": "Paid", "keywords": "FIORINA, CANDIDATES, SATURDAY, BASQUE, FRY, PRESIDENTIAL, STATE, CARSON, CRUZ, GARDNERVILLE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina speaks to a large crowd Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry Saturday in Gardnerville.\nNevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt hosts the Morning in America, Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch Saturday at Corley Ranch in Gardnerville.\nFormer Ambassador John Bolton greets a supporter Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch.\nNora Enos, 7, of Reno shows her American spirit Saturday at the Basque Fry in Gardnerville.\nRepublican presidential hopeful Dr. Ben Carson poses for a photo with Congressman Mark Amodei Saturday at the Inaugural Basque Fry at Corley Ranch in Gardnerville."}
