During the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, she lost her home and all that she owned.\n\nOnly a month later, Boothe was diagnosed with advancing head, throat, and neck cancer. She endured six months of demanding and grueling cancer treatments, including two surgeries and 30 cycles of radiation.\n\nThe treatments worked; Boothe was cured. But once treatment was finished, she found herself without a home or an income.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a post to go back to. I was basically homeless,\u201d Boothe told Northern Virginia magazine. \u201cThe hospital was where I lived.\u201d\n\nBoothe asked the military for help but was turned away due to her veteran status.\n\n\u201cI was asking for resources for female veterans and veterans with children, and [they] said, well \u2026 the military doesn\u2019t help you anymore, so you have to go to the [U.S. Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs].\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the VA was of little help to Boothe and her son.\n\n\u201cAll the programs were basically male-based. They sent me to social services, basically the welfare office,\u201d Boothe told NVA magazine writer Tim Regan.\n\nBoothe describes her subsequent visit to social services as \u201cthe most demeaning experience I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d She calls the limited limited options available to female veterans \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile VA is taking steps\u2014such as launching an outreach campaign\u2014to end homelessness among all veterans, it does not have sufficient data about the population and needs of women veterans to plan effectively for increases in their numbers as service members return from Iraq and Afghanistan,\u201d a report about homeless female veterans released by the GAO in 2011 reads.\n\n\u201cFurther, without improved services, women\u2014including those with children and those who have experienced military sexual trauma\u2014remain at risk of homelessness and experiencing further abuse.\u201d\n\nBoothe soon began searching for permanent employment and housing for her small family, and relocated to live with her aunt in Missouri for six months.\n\n\u201cI was homeless for about a six month period,\u201d Booth said in a taped interview on \u201cThe Oprah Show.\u201d \u201cI felt worthless. I felt thrown away. That was probably the hardest thing that I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Boothe heard another story of a homeless female veteran on television and came up with the idea to begin a non-profit organization focused on ending female veteran homelessness.\n\nThe organization offers three separate programs: H.O.M.E., S.A.F.E., and Stand-Up. These programs offer services in transitional housing, childcare, and financial education, and provide women seeking employment with professional business attire.\n\nShe acquired a grant and called the organization Final Salute, Inc. With the money acquired, she put a lease on Final Salute Inc.\u2019s first property.\n\nTo date, Boothe has helped over 900 female veterans and their children find homes.\n\n\u201cSeeing that these children are happy, they\u2019re laughing, they\u2019re running around playing \u2026 [t]he women are joking with each other and they\u2019re \u2026 home. That is probably the most rewarding part,\u201d Boothe said.\n\nAccording to the American Veterans Center, Boothe will share her story with Fox News Channel National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin on November 14 at 8 p.m. EST. The segment, \u201cThe Wounded Warrior Experience,\u201d will be broadcast by TheBlaze television network.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jaspen Boothe knows the plight of homeless female veterans firsthand.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Jaspen Boothe knows the plight of homeless female veterans firsthand.", "title": "55,000 Female Vets Are Homeless.
