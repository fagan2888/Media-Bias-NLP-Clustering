The baby boy miraculously managed to live and is currently at a hospital in critical condition.\n\nAfter Musa Dayib\u2019s fall, he was rushed to Hennepin County Medical Center, a pediatric level-one trauma center. He is currently heavily sedated and being supported by breathing machines, as his lungs were bruised, his arms broken, and back was fractured. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a miracle,\u201d Dr. Tina Slusher told KARE. \u201cKids don\u2019t fall this far and make it very often, and especially without a serious brain injury.\u201d It\u2019s still uncertain whether the child will have long-term complications as a result of the fall, but for now it appears he has only suffered a concussion and not a serious skull fracture or traumatic brain injury.\n\nHow did the baby survive such a nauseating fall? Not even adults could fare well after such a drop \u2014 but Slusher said it\u2019s because \u201clittle tykes are more flexible and don\u2019t break as easily as we do.\u201d In addition, he \u201cfell in a very, very small patch of mulch\u201d instead of concrete.\n\nRegardless, the terrifying fall has spurred residents of the building community to rally about improved safety precautions at the apartments. \u201cTwenty five percent of the units have requested a block to prevent the door from being opened by children,\u201d George Sherman, president of the community\u2019s management company, told USA Today. \u201cWe have had a request for a number in the last couple of days. (We are) looking at more permanent locks that the fire department approves.\u201d A child had previously fallen off a balcony in the past at this apartment complex, but it\u2019s the first time a child has slipped through the balcony rails, Sherman said. The boy\u2019s parents, meanwhile, are traumatized. \u201cI don\u2019t think my brother and his wife will recover from this,\u201d Abdirahim Ahmed, Dayib\u2019s uncle, told USA Today. \u201cThey really torture themselves.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, there are stories from around the world that involve infants surviving terrifying falls \u2014 such as children playing in windows who slipped out and were caught in the arms of passersby, or a toddler who somehow landed on his feet after somersaults in the air; or even the baby that fell 80 feet out of a building, bounced off a restaurant awning, and landed in the arms of a doctor.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "baby survives fall, musa dayib", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Doctors say it\u2019s a miracle that the 1-year-old survived the fall, though they\u2019re still uncertain whether he will have any long-term complications.", "title": "'Miracle Baby' Survives 11-Story Fall [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-baby-lives-after-falling-11-story-balcony-infants-are-more-flexible-and-dont-break-easily-we", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/15/building.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Doctors say it\u2019s a miracle that the 1-year-old survived the fall, though they\u2019re still uncertain whether he will have any long-term complications.", "title": "'Miracle Baby' Survives 11-Story Fall [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/miracle-baby-lives-after-falling-11-story-balcony-infants-are-more-flexible-and-dont-break-easily-we", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/15/building.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/15/building.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-05-15T11:33:08-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-15T11:33:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Doctors say it\u2019s a miracle that the 1-year-old survived the fall, though they\u2019re still uncertain whether he will have any long-term complications."}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t think my brother and his wife will recover from this,\u201d Abdirahim Ahmed, Dayib\u2019s uncle, told USA Today.\n\u201cTwenty five percent of the units have requested a block to prevent the door from being opened by children,\u201d George Sherman, president of the community\u2019s management company, told USA Today.\nA 15-month-old child survived a horrifying fall after slipping through balcony slits in a Minneapolis building, hurtling down 11 stories.\nThe baby boy miraculously managed to live and is currently at a hospital in critical condition.\nRegardless, the terrifying fall has spurred residents of the building community to rally about improved safety precautions at the apartments."}
