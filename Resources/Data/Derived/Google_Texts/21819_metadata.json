Almost immediately after that, recordings and other information from the phone could be monitored on the Internet.\n\n\u201cStealthGenie has little use beyond invading a victim\u2019s privacy\u201d Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAdvertising and selling spyware technology is a criminal offense, and such conduct will be aggressively pursued by this office and our law enforcement partners,\u201d she added.\n\nThe incident is the first ever criminal case against someone for advertising and tryng to sell a mobile spyware app.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The applicaton allowed people to secretly spy on others' cellphones.", "description": "The applicaton allowed people to secretly spy on others' cellphones.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The applicaton allowed people to secretly spy on others' cellphones.", "title": "Man arrested over spy app", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/219236-man-arrested-over-spy-app", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/219236-man-arrested-over-spy-app", "dcterms.date": "2014-09-29T18:04-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Spyware,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T18:04:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/219236-man-arrested-over-spy-app", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The applicaton allowed people to secretly spy on others' cellphones.", "card": "summary", "title": "Man arrested over spy app"}, "dcterms.title": "Man arrested over spy app"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab60\"", "article_summary": "The incident is the first ever criminal case against someone for advertising and tryng to sell a mobile spyware app.\nA Pakistani man was indicted in Virginia for trying to advertise and sell an application that allow people to secretly spy on others' cellphones.\nThe app was allegedly marketed to people suspicious that their spouses were cheating on them.\nAlmost immediately after that, recordings and other information from the phone could be monitored on the Internet.\n\u201cStealthGenie has little use beyond invading a victim\u2019s privacy\u201d Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said in a statement."}
