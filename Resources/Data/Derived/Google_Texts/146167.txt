Some people who signed up for healthcare through ObamaCare may not have been qualified for the benefits they received, according to a government audit released Monday.

For several months after the rollout of HealthCare.gov, the government’s website was unable to verify important parts of a customer’s application, such as household income, citizenship status and family size.

The audit, which was completed by the Department of Health and Human Services’s inspector general, tracked sample applicants to determine weaknesses with the system's internal controls.

Out of the 45 applications, investigators found “inconsistencies” with 20.

“The Federal marketplace did not always maintain applicant data that were complete, accurate, and up to date in the eligibility and enrollment system and did not always maintain documentation supporting resolution of inconsistencies,” the 50-page report said.

The data was collected from Jan. 1 to April 19 of 2014.

The audit also found that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) was not always tough enough on applicants.

In several cases, customers were allowed to provide the wrong form of documentation but described as making a “good-faith effort.”

Officials from the CMS acknowledged some of the weaknesses in the system, but said many of the problems had been resolved this past year.

The report comes less than one month after another government investigator found that HealthCare.gov had approved 11 fictitious applications in its first year. Despite several missing data points, the applicants were all allowed to keep their coverage this year.
