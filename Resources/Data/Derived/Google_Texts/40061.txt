Illinois enrollment on the Obamacare health exchanges is approaching 300,000 with about two weeks to go before the signup period ends.

Enrollment on the exchange, dubbed Get Covered Illinois, where consumers and small businesses can shop for health insurance, climbed to 296,293 from Nov. 15, when the exchange debuted for its second year, to Jan. 30, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services disclosed today.

That's 2 percent more than the last time enrollment figures were released, on Jan. 23.

The figures include consumers who selected a plan or were automatically enrolled in one.

For the first time, the federal government also broke out signups by metro areas. Of the Illinois enrollees, 241,590, or 82 percent of the state's total enrollment, came from an area that stretches from west suburban Naperville to northwest suburban Elgin to Chicago.

“There are just 11 days before the Feb. 15 deadline and the end of this year's open enrollment,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. “Time is running out.”



Among Illinois enrollees, 78 percent qualify for a financial subsidy from the government to help pay for their premiums.

The federal government hosts the online exchange in partnership with Illinois. During the first year of the exchange, in 2014, 217,492 consumers enrolled in Obamacare plans in Illinois. The signup period lasted six months, twice as long as the current enrollment period.
