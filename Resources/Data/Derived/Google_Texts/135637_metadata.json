But all that may change in the coming weeks with the recent rollout of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA fact (I researched for this article): 19 million young adults across the country lack health insurance.\n\nAnother fact (I made up): 3 million of those adults live in Beckett Hall.\n\nA second fact (50-50 true): Via the individual mandate (I MEAN TAX), the government says you have to get health insurance or else pay a penalty of $95. Which is a shame, because with that kind of money you could buy ten large pizzas from Dominos next TNC, and then you wouldn\u2019t need health insurance at all. Because you\u2019d be dead.\n\nA final fact (possibly true): Getting health insurance can be expensive but does good stuff too like helping you get spider powers or a giant robot like in Pacific Rim.\n\nFortunately my friends, there is nothing to fear. You have three, wonderful options to avoid that penalty and stay in the good graces of the world\u2019s Americaniest government.\n\n1. Stay on Mom and Dad\u2019s Plan\n\nPluses:\n\nNo job? No money? No problem!\n\nCons:\n\nSo you caught this weird Jumping Frenchman Disorder from a sexy croissant muncher while studying abroad in Paris and now you don\u2019t want the parents to ask why your Jump Aversion Therapy chewed up their deductible? Too bad\u2026\n\n2. Get Catastrophic Coverage Only\n\nPluses:\n\nYou\u2019re a stag. You lift. What\u2019s the worst that can happen?\n\nCons:\n\n\u2026but what if right at that moment when you\u2019re benching like, you know, like 250, no big deal, and you know you\u2019re about to hit your PB, but then that TIGHT Wayne song starts blasting and you just push through it and you\u2019re like: yeah, that\u2019s why I lift. #YOLO\n\n\u2026.AND THEN AN EARTHQUAKE HITS AND DUCEY COLLAPSES IN ON ITSELF AND PRESIDENT CHODOSH RUNS IN AND LIFTS YOU OUT OF THE WRECKAGE BUT HE\u2019S TOO LATE AND YOU LOSE YOUR ARM AND NOW YOU WANT A ROBOCOP ARM BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SICK\u2026 but your deductible is too high so you can\u2019t afford one!\n\nPlus, regular checkups and X-rays are good or whatever.\n\n3. Get Full Coverage\n\nPros\n\nXRays on XRays on Xrays. Get scanned, get checked, get co-pays like it\u2019s 1999! Ain\u2019t nothing cooler than rocking that healthy body and comprehensive medical coverage.\n\nCons:\n\n$$ \u2014 Monthly premiums for 20-somethings are often above $280, and if you have a job that pays more than $48,000 you don\u2019t qualify for most of the subsidies. That\u2019s a lot of money you could be spending to get Uranium Ore Amazon Prime\u2019d to Story House. (Note to NSA: that was a joke, please do not arrest me. I <3 you T-Ridge)\n\nIf none of those options seem appealing, don\u2019t worry: I have good news: the ACA provided for the creation of a comprehensive, easy-to-use website to aggregate different health insurance plans for the uninsured. And that website, www.Healthcare.gov, has debuted to universal acclaim.\n\nJust kidding. When I said I had good news, what I meant was more bad news: the website is broken and even this homeless man could have made a better one than the government. As Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius has described it, \u201cin retrospect, the decision to build a comprehensive healthcare exchange market using GeoCities, three paperclips and an old muffin was a poor one, but we\u2019ve got a crack team of hobos/programmers on the case.\u201d\n\nAlright, so maybe healthcare is expensive, and the website to purchase insurance is completely unusable. But here\u2019s the good news: you\u2019re young, you\u2019re swoll, and you can spare a dime to cover yourself. If not, just stay away from Thesis and Jumping Frechmen and you should be just fine.\n\nAuthor\u2019s Note: Professor Miller, if you are reading this right now, I promise I\u2019m on my way to your office right now to turn in that chapter on Justice Rose Bird\u2019s electoral rhetoric in the 1978 election\u2026just give me one moment to\u2026\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Following the completion of this article, the author fled Forum headquarters.
