Bush, hanging chad, Politics News\n\nBush v. Gore is the US Supreme Court decision that has been credited with\u2014or blamed for\u2014ending the 2000 presidential election with its interrupted recount still unfinished. Bush and Gore, of course, were the two candidates: George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and son of the forty-first president, challenging the incumbent vice president, Al Gore. Bush v. Gore, the court case, is often used interchangeably as shorthand for Bush-versus-Gore, the entirety of the dispute over the outcome of the election.\n\nBut that dispute encompassed much more than just the US Supreme Court\u2019s decision, which in truth did not even end the fight. Rather, the end came the next day, December 13, when Gore announced he would not attempt to renew the recount through additional proceedings in Florida\u2019s courts. Had he done so, he and Bush conceivably might have pursued their fight all the way to Congress, as Hayes and Tilden had over the 1876 election. If Bush-versus-Gore had reached Congress it would have been the first real test of the impenetrably ambiguous Electoral Count Act of 1887, with unpredictable consequences. Thus it was Gore\u2019s concession of December 13, and not the Court\u2019s ruling of the previous day, that truly ended the fight for the presidency as a practical matter.\n\nBush v. Gore, the court case, moreover, concerned only one aspect of the overall vote-counting dispute: the so-called dimpled or hanging chads produced by incomplete puncturing of punch-card ballots. Bush v. Gore did not concern issues that had arisen over absentee ballots, which the Gore campaign abandoned in the wake of public criticism. Much more significantly, Bush v. Gore did not address the problem of the so-called butterfly ballot, which apparently caused thousands of Gore supporters to mistakenly cast their ballots instead for Pat Buchanan, the conservative pundit running as a minor-party candidate. Even Buchanan acknowledged, both then and subsequently, that Gore would have been president but for the butterfly ballot.\n\nNor did Bush v. Gore, as presented to the US Supreme Court, involve all the issues concerning dimpled and hanging chads. The US Supreme Court was not in a posture to decide what would have been a fair process for the counting of these chads, from the standpoint of either Florida\u2019s legislature setting up that process in advance of the election or Florida\u2019s judiciary attempting to make the best of the situation once confronted with the challenge of how to handle these chads given the state\u2019s existing statutory framework. Instead, the US Supreme Court\u2019s role was limited to considering whether the Florida Supreme Court had acted improperly in its treatment of the chads, and, if so, what to do about the impropriety at that juncture and given the date by which Florida\u2019s recount procedures needed to end.\n\nWhen considering the entirety of Bush-versus-Gore, it is worth disentangling three distinct lines of inquiry. First, did Florida\u2019s electoral system accurately identify the aggregate preference of the eligible voters who attempted to record their preferences through that system, and, if not, why was Florida unable to remedy this inaccuracy? Second, what would have been a fair procedure for handling the chads that became the focus of the litigation, and insofar as the procedure used fell short, who is responsible for that failure and with what consequence? Third, insofar as the US Supreme Court did become involved in the dispute, did it act appropriately, and if not, what effect did its involvement ultimately have?\n\nA Fair Count Does Not Guarantee an Accurate Result\n\nRegarding the first line of inquiry, there can be little doubt that more Florida voters who cast ballots in the 2000 presidential election preferred Gore to Bush and that a well-functioning electoral system would have accurately captured this preference, thus making Gore the winner of the presidency. As already indicated, Palm Beach County\u2019s infamous \u201cbutterfly ballot\u201d alone sufficed to frustrate the aggregate preference of the participating and eligible electorate. Bush\u2019s certified margin of victory ended up only 537 votes. But in Palm Beach County, Pat Buchanan received some 3,400 votes, over two thousand more than anywhere else in the state. Statistical analysis confirmed the common sense conclusion that the faulty ballot design caused this discrepancy, as would-be Gore voters inadvertently miscast their ballots for Buchanan. Although Gore\u2019s name was the second listed on the left, the holes for voters to punch ran down the middle of the ballot, and the second hole was the one for Buchanan (whose name was the first on the right). As Buchanan himself explained, \u201cMy name right beside his on the butterfly ballot cost Al Gore thousands of votes\u2014and the presidency.\u201d\n\nGore\u2019s lawyers understandably concluded that Florida law provided no judicial remedy for a mistaken electoral outcome caused by the butterfly ballot. In a suit filed on behalf of affected voters, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously concluded the ballot\u2019s design, however problematic and consequential it was, did not violate state law. Even if it had, it is unclear what remedy the state court should have provided. There was insufficient time to hold a whole new election in Florida, since the state\u2019s presidential electors were constitutionally required to cast their official Electoral College votes on the same day as the electors in all other states, which Congress had specified as Monday, December 18. Limiting a revote to just Palm Beach County would have raised grave constitutional questions, especially if Palm Beach voters who had not participated in the initial election were permitted to participate in the revote, but Florida voters elsewhere were not similarly given a second chance to cast a ballot.\n\nAlthough statistics showed that the butterfly ballot deprived Gore of enough votes to cost him the election, it was difficult to see how a court could order a statistical adjustment to the actual count of the ballots as cast. Statistics, by nature, are probabilistic. Was a court to declare that but for the butterfly ballot, Gore maybe would have won by 1,500 votes, or maybe by only 1,000 votes, or maybe even by only 500, when the actual count of the votes recorded on the ballots themselves showed Bush, not Gore, winning by 537?\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court might have simply voided the election on account of the faulty butterfly ballot as well as myriad of other problems that undermined the outcome as an accurate reflection of the electorate\u2019s aggregate preference. But as the court itself observed, voiding the election without a revote \u201cwould result in the disfranchisement of [all the state\u2019s] voters.\u201d While Florida\u2019s legislature would be entitled to appoint the state\u2019s presidential electors directly (to fill the gap left by voiding all the votes of the citizenry), there was no guarantee that electors chosen by the legislature would match the aggregate preference of the voters who dutifully cast their own ballots to choose the state\u2019s presidential electors. Indeed, because Florida\u2019s legislature was in Republican hands, the Gore campaign fully understood that voiding the election was worse than useless from its perspective. That judicial remedy would guarantee Bush\u2019s receipt of Florida\u2019s electoral votes by legislative fiat\u2014and, with them, the presidency.\n\nWhatever one thinks of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision regarding the butterfly ballot, this much is clear: a correct count of the ballots as cast is not necessarily the same as an accurate recording of the preferences that the voters wished to make. Even assuming for the moment that a full and fair recount of the votes on the eligible ballots actually cast would confirm Bush\u2019s narrow margin over Gore, this assumption is not the same as saying that Bush would have won if Florida had employed a sound system for recording the preferences of the eligible voters who endeavored to participate in the presidential election. As was also true in 1876, an unbridgeable gap can sometimes exist between a fair counting and a fair casting of ballots. A fair recount of the votes on the ballots cannot undo the kind of casting problem caused by something like the butterfly ballot. That kind of problem can be cured\u2014if at all\u2014only by voiding the election altogether, and, in the case of a presidential election, leaving the void to be filled not by a revote of citizens, but by a political choice of the state\u2019s legislature. Ultimately, however, whether or not that option would have been desirable, it was unavailable under Florida\u2019s law according to the state\u2019s supreme court.\n\nTurning then to the second line of inquiry, and cognizant of the distinction between fair counting and fair casting, what would have been the procedures for a fair recount of Florida\u2019s ballots in 2000 and what result would those procedures have produced? Bush\u2019s position was that a fair recount, in fact, occurred pursuant to Florida law: it was the recounting of ballots by machine in the immediate aftermath of Election Day, and it confirmed Bush\u2019s victory (albeit by a reduced margin). Bush\u2019s team argued, not implausibly, that machines are inherently fairer than humans in counting ballots because machines, unlike humans, harbor no psychological preference for one candidate over the other. In any event, Bush\u2019s team further contended, Florida law at the time required a machine recount but contained no provisions designed for a manual recount, by humans, of all ballots in a statewide election. Whatever might be suitable provisions for a manual recount if adopted legislatively in advance of an election, once the ballots had been cast in this particular election the only fair recount was the machine recount provided for by law.\n\nPutting aside this powerful point, suppose for the moment that Florida\u2019s judiciary had been explicitly empowered in advance to order a complete manual recount of all ballots cast in the state\u2019s 2000 presidential election. A model for that kind of recount had occurred in Minnesota\u2019s 1962 gubernatorial election, and Minnesota would repeat a similar version for its 2008 US Senate election. Thus we can imagine Florida having conducted a Minnesota-style recount in 2000, but ultimately we can make no confident judgment on whether that kind of recount would have yielded a result with Bush or Gore ahead.\n\nThere never was a manual inspection of all Florida ballots cast in 2000. The closest approximation was an examination by a media consortium of just the ballots that the machines classified as either \u201covervotes\u201d (those improperly voted for two or more candidates in the same presidential race) or \u201cundervotes\u201d (those showing no choice of any presidential candidate). But this limited examination could not detect any ballots in which a voter wrote on a ballot in an effort to undo a mark for a candidate (where the machine picked up the mark, and recorded the ballot as cast for that candidate, while failing to detect the voter\u2019s intent to nullify that mark). Moreover, although the media consortium\u2019s review was an effort to encompass all overvotes and undervotes, localities were unable to deliver to the media consortium 1,345 ballots that the machines originally had classified as overvotes or undervotes and thus should have been part of the consortium\u2019s review. These ballots had simply disappeared\u2014but, had they still existed, might have made the difference.\n\nThe consortium\u2019s limited review produced a result with Gore ahead by a miniscule margin of 107, as long as both overvotes and undervotes were included in its analysis. But overvotes were never part of the recount actually requested by Gore or ordered by the Florida Supreme Court\u2014the problem of dimpled and hanging chads, the focus of the actual litigation in Florida, being a problem of undervotes and not overvotes. Conversely, the media consortium\u2019s review did not replicate the conditions of real-world recount procedures, with lawyers for both sides being able to observe and potentially challenge ballot-specific determinations made by the humans conducting the recount. Moreover, being human, the individuals employed by the media consortium were unable to set aside their own partisan affiliations when evaluating ballots. For example, Democratic reviewers \u201cwere 25 percent more likely to deny a mark was for Bush\u201d than Republican reviewers. In a real-world recount, these determinations would have been subject to judicial oversight and potentially reversed. The media consortium\u2019s review cannot be considered to replicate a fair recount, and its results cannot be taken as evidence that either Gore or Bush would have prevailed if a fair manual recount, like those in Minnesota, had occurred in Florida.\n\nTurning to the third line of inquiry, what should be said of the US Supreme Court\u2019s involvement in this disputed presidential election? To appraise the Court\u2019s role requires understanding the specific circumstances of the dispute in which it eventually occurred. For that understanding, one must consider how the dispute chaotically unfolded during the five weeks from Election Night, as the polls were closing, to the Court\u2019s decision in Bush v. Gore.\n\nElection Night\n\nThe evening got off to a bad start when the networks, based on faulty exit polling, prematurely declared that Gore was going to win Florida. NBC, CBS, and ABC all made this announcement about ten minutes before the polls had even closed in the western Panhandle\u2014an irresponsible mistake that made Republicans appropriately livid. Although it seems doubtful that Bush lost votes because of this snafu, CNN already had been announcing that the polls would close in Florida at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time, overlooking the fact that the Panhandle would continue voting until 8:00 p.m. Eastern, and in an election that ultimately came down to only a few hundred votes, it is not inconceivable that this earlier misreporting may have suppressed last-minute turnout in that part of the state. Of course, once the Bush campaign discovered CNN\u2019s errors, it activated an emergency get-out-the-vote phone operation, making \u201ctens of thousands of calls into Republican households in the Panhandle,\u201d and thus may have boosted Republican turnout there as a result.\n\nThe media\u2019s overall irresponsibility on Election Night 2000, however, ran much deeper than its initial miscall of Florida for Gore. The networks had accustomed themselves to being the pronouncers of presidential victory, as if they\u2014and not government authorities at a later date\u2014made the official declaration of which candidate won the White House. Even worse, in an era of enhanced competition between the traditional broadcast networks and the more recent cable news rivals, there had developed an intense frenzy to be the quickest to call a state for a candidate. Such was the environment when at 7:08 p.m. Eastern time, Dan Rather touted for CBS: \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight from the get go. . . . If we say somebody has carried a state, you can pretty much take it to the bank, book it, that that\u2019s true.\u201d With the networks conveying that kind of attitude, it is no wonder that the public was bewildered when later that same night the networks retracted their call of Florida for Gore, then gave the state\u2014and the presidency\u2014to Bush, and still later retracted that second call, leaving the impression that the election was somehow inappropriately up in the air.\n\nBut it was not only the networks that were caught by surprise on Election Night in 2000. The candidates, too, were unprepared for an election close enough to need a recount. They were unprepared both logistically and psychologically. Not only did they not have recount teams preassembled to fly to a state where they might be needed (as would occur in subsequent cycles); more significantly, they did not know how to handle themselves in the circumstance where there was no obvious winner on Election Night.\n\nGore never should have put himself in the situation where he needed to telephone Bush a second time to retract the concession that he had made to Bush in his first call. When the networks declared Florida for Bush (shortly after 2:15 a.m. Eastern), Gore told his advisers, \u201cI want to concede,\u201d and he proceeded to do so by phoning Bush. Gore\u2019s mistake was not merely failing to check in with his own campaign staffers, who had very different numbers from the networks at that moment. His more fundamental mistake was thinking there needed to be a concession speech, from one candidate or the other, on Election Night based on whatever inevitably incomplete and uncertain numbers were then available, from whatever source. Instead, Gore could have taken the position, as Charles Evans Hughes did in 1916, that there was an official canvassing process to occur before a winner of the state was certified; unless he could be reasonably certain that the canvassing process would not alter the outcome, there was no reason not to let the process unfold before any candidate conceded that the election was over.\n\nIn his memoirs, Bush acknowledges getting \u201chot\u201d as a result of Gore\u2019s retraction. He also reveals that he was tempted to \u201cgo out and declare victory\u201d anyway, until his brother Jeb persuaded him otherwise. The candor of Bush\u2019s memoirs in these respects is commendable, but his attitude at the time shows that he, too, was not emotionally prepared for a razor-thin (and thus indeterminate) result on Election Night. Like Gore, he believed that the election should be finished on Election Night, with winner and loser conclusively determined based on whichever way the networks added up the best numbers available at the end of the night. He was not oriented to the view, as any candidate should be, that the outcome of an especially competitive election may require waiting for the official result at the end of the canvass.\n\nBut for Bush this misimpression was not consequential, as it was for Gore. After all, Gore was the one who had conceded that he had lost the election. Even though that concession had no official status in Florida\u2019s canvassing procedure, it automatically put Gore on the defensive throughout the entire subsequent vote-counting process. In retracting the concession, Gore tried to claim that Florida was \u201ctoo close to call,\u201d but he himself already had made Bush the presumptive winner whose presumptive victory Gore was attempting to undo. It was an entirely self-inflicted wound.\n\nA Hand Recount or Not? That Was the Question\n\nOn Wednesday morning, November 8, the Florida secretary of state\u2019s numbers showed a gap of only 1,784 votes between the two candidates, with Bush in the lead. Almost 6 million ballots had been cast, making the lead about 0.03% of the total\u2014an order of magnitude far smaller than the 0.5% trigger of a mandatory machine recount as set forth in Florida\u2019s election code at the time. By the next day, as a result of that machine recount, Bush\u2019s lead had narrowed to only 327 ballots. It grew again to 930 votes once overseas and military absentee ballots were added eight days later (on Friday, November 17).\n\nThe competing strategic imperatives of the two campaigns were clear. For Bush, the objective was to stay ahead by avoiding any additional recounting of ballots. Gore, being behind, had exactly the opposite goal: to figure out a way to have another recount, a manual one to supplement the one that already had occurred by machine.\n\nThe relevant Florida statutes were maddeningly unclear on whether or not a manual recount should occur in a statewide election. The statutes provided two ways in which a candidate who was behind after the machine recount, like Gore, could challenge the result. The first, called a \u201cprotest,\u201d was an administrative procedure that occurred as part of the canvass before the outcome of the election was officially certified. The second, called a \u201ccontest,\u201d was a judicial lawsuit after certification to attack that official result as erroneous.\n\nCertification was a pivotal, and hugely important, point in the whole process. Unlike anything that occurred on Election Night, it was the official\u2014and legally authoritative\u2014declaration of the winner. After certification, the losing candidate truly would be attempting to take away a victory that the law had determined belonged to the opposing candidate. It is therefore understandable that Bush\u2019s team wanted to convert his lead, however small, into a certified victory as quickly as possible, whereas Gore\u2019s strategists wanted to prevent Bush from becoming the certified winner. In the first week of the vote-counting fight, Gore\u2019s advisers did not think that he could survive a certified Bush victory. Especially in the aftermath of Gore\u2019s retracted concession on Election Night, they thought that the public pressure for Gore to reinstate that concession after certification of a Bush victory would be too withering to withstand.\n\nThe protest statute provided that a candidate could request a manual recount, but said that those requests were to be directed to \u201cthe county canvassing board,\u201d as if it applied only to local and not statewide elections. Moreover, the statute said that the county canvassing board may choose to conduct a manual recount, but did not say that it must do so. The statute also seemed to suggest that a countywide manual recount might be appropriate only in the event of \u201can error in the vote tabulation,\u201d understood to mean a technological failure that prevented the voting machines from tabulating the ballots in the way that they were designed to do.\n\nInterpreted this way, the statute would not contemplate a countywide recount for the purpose of reviewing ballots for which the machines, operating as designed, failed to detect a vote. These were the undervotes, which were known and expected to occur in every election with machines operating exactly as designed. Undervotes regularly occurred using both optical scan or punch card ballots, although they were more prevalent with the latter, a more primitive form of voting technology. With an optical-scan ballot, on which voters filled in ovals (like standardized tests), sometimes the oval was not filled in well enough for the scanner to detect. With a punch-card ballot, voters were required to punch out small perforated pieces of their ballots\u2014these pieces were called chads\u2014so that the machine could detect the holes that the voters had created by dislodging the chads. With some frequency, however, voters would fail to dislodge their chads completely, causing the machines to miss votes that the voters had intended.\n\nThe question, then, was whether it was appropriate in a statewide election to use the protest procedure to conduct a manual recount, where the machines were working as designed, for the purpose of discovering undervotes on either optical-scan or punch-card ballots that the machines had failed to detect. In furtherance of its strategic objective, the Bush campaign took the position that, no, to do so would not be a proper use of the protest procedure. The Gore campaign, by contrast, needed there to be a manual recount in search of undervotes undetected by the machines; otherwise, it was all over, and Gore had lost. Accordingly, the Gore campaign pressed for an interpretation of the protest statute that, not limited to errors in the functioning of the vote-tabulation machinery, would permit the manual retrieval of undervotes.\n\nAnother problem for the Gore campaign was that Secretary of State Katherine Harris, in partisan alliance with the Bush campaign, adopted the more restrictive interpretation of the statute. Even if this interpretation was the more natural reading of the statute\u2019s text, and thus would have been adopted by a neutral arbiter, Harris was no neutral. In what appeared to be a flagrant breach of professional ethics, she was consulting with the Bush campaign in deciding how to exercise her supervisory authority over the canvassing process. When Gore asked four counties to look for undervotes, Harris told them that under the statute it was unlawful for them to do so.\n\nEven worse from Gore\u2019s perspective was the deadline that the state\u2019s statutes set for completion and certification of the canvass. In two separate places, the statutes stated that the secretary of state must receive the returns from each county \u201cby 5 p.m. on the seventh day following an election.\u201d This same deadline applied whether or not a county chose to conduct a manual recount as part of a protest. Even if a county was willing to go ahead and search for undervotes during the canvass (in contravention of the secretary of state\u2019s instructions), the county needed to complete this search by close of business on November 14, one week after Election Day. That tight schedule did not leave much chance for a large urban county, like Miami-Dade, to complete a countywide manual recount, further suggesting that the protest procedure was not suited to a search for undervotes.\n\nFurthermore, the statutes seemed to be quite strict about this deadline. One of the two relevant statutes said that the secretary of state \u201cshall\u201d ignore \u201call missing counties\u201d and proceed forthwith to a statewide certification of the election based only on the county returns in compliance with the deadline. The other statute was more lenient, saying that the secretary \u201cmay\u201d ignore a county\u2019s late returns and proceed immediately with the statewide certification, leaving that county out of the final results. Either way, the statutes did not require the secretary to wait past the deadline for a county to finish looking for undervotes in response to a protest.\n\nIn hindsight, Gore\u2019s strategic objective would have been better served by skipping the protest procedure and moving straight to a contest. Although that alternative approach would have required Gore to acquiesce in the certification of Bush\u2019s victory, it would have permitted more time for the contest to unfold. More significantly, it would have avoided Gore\u2019s having to ask the Florida Supreme Court to adopt a strained and dubious interpretation of the relevant state statutes\u2014an interpretation that cast the Florida Supreme Court in an extremely unfavorable light, especially in the eyes of the more powerful US Supreme Court. But Gore felt compelled to fight a certification of Bush\u2019s victory at all costs. To the extent that he did so because of his earlier retracted concession, then it was indeed that concession that put him in a posture from which he could not recover.\n\nGore\u2019s Self-Defeating Use of the Protest Procedure\n\nThe three counties that Gore most cared about were Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach. Located at the southeastern end of the state, these were the three most populous of Florida\u2019s 67 counties, with Democratic-leaning constituencies that provided Gore the greatest potential to cut Bush\u2019s lead by uncovering undervotes. Gore was heavily criticized for seeking manual recounts in only four counties. (Volusia was included because of oddities in its fluctuating Election Night returns.) His defense was that the protest statute required him to ask on a county-by-county basis.\n\nNone of Gore\u2019s three targeted counties came close to completing a manual recount by the statute\u2019s deadline of 5 p.m. on Tuesday, November 14. Miami-Dade and Broward had not even agreed to look for undervotes. Palm Beach, which had started, reversed course after learning of Secretary of State Harris\u2019s disapproval. When Secretary Harris announced the next day (Wednesday, November 15) that she would not accept any late-arriving amended returns based on manual recounts\u2014and would instead certify the election on Saturday, November 18, once all the overseas and military ballots were in\u2014Gore made the fateful decision to challenge her decision rather than proceeding directly to a judicial contest of that certification.\n\nTerry Lewis, the Tallahassee-based state judge to whom the case had been assigned, upheld Secretary Harris\u2019s decision to reject any late-arriving recounts. Earlier, he had required Harris to provide reasons for her decision, but since the relevant Florida statutes said that she either \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d ignore late returns, Judge Lewis accepted the reasons that she gave. Her primary point was that, as long as the voting machines had functioned as designed, a manual search for undervotes was not a valid excuse for late returns.\n\nGore\u2019s team appealed Judge Lewis\u2019s decision to the Florida Supreme Court, which extended the protest period by requiring Harris to accept any amended returns resulting from manual recounts as long as they were complete by Sunday, November 26. This new deadline left little time for conducting a subsequent judicial contest, given that the state\u2019s presidential electors were constitutionally required to cast their official Electoral College votes on Monday, December 18 (only three weeks later). Moreover, the Electoral Count Act of 1887 gave states a safe harbor deadline of six days earlier: if Florida could resolve all disputes over the appointment of its presidential electors before Tuesday, December 12 (using rules and procedures the state had promulgated in advance of Election Day), then Congress promised to abide by the state\u2019s resolution of those disputes. Everyone, including the Gore legal team, presumed that Florida would want to take advantage of this safe harbor deadline. Strategically, the Gore team stressed the safe harbor deadline\u2019s importance: they did not want the US House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, to be entitled to disavow a Florida-based recount favorable to Gore. But the new protest-phase deadline of Sunday, November 26, then left only sixteen days to hold an entire judicial contest of the election, including appeals, before the safe harbor window slammed shut.\n\nExtending the deadline turned out, for Gore, to be a waste of precious time. Broward County managed to finish a manual recount by then, but Palm Beach County did not (missing by a couple of hours). Most famously, Miami-Dade halted its manual recount after the so-called Brooks Brothers riot, in which Republican protesters\u2014fearful that fraud was occurring in a process largely shielded from public view on the nineteenth floor of Miami\u2019s Clark Center office tower\u2014vociferously demanded a stop to the recount. On November 26, with no new numbers from either Miami-Dade or Palm Beach, Katherine Harris certified Bush\u2019s presidential electors as victorious. The certification that Gore\u2019s legal team had fought so hard to avoid happened eight days after it would have without the deadline\u2019s extension.\n\nMoreover, the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s opinion setting the new deadline was an exercise of judicial gymnastics that made the US Supreme Court suspicious of the state court\u2019s motives. The Florida Supreme Court more than doubled the explicit statutory deadline of \u201c5 p.m. on the seventh day after the election\u201d to the nineteenth day after the election. Whereas the statutory language said that the secretary either \u201cshall\u201d or \u201cmay\u201d ignore local returns submitted more than a week after Election Day, the Florida Supreme Court now insisted the opposite: the secretary must not ignore local returns as long as they arrive within three weeks after Election Day.\n\nThe Florida Supreme Court claimed that it was eschewing a \u201chyper-technical\u201d reading of the statutes in order to protect the constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. But the court never explained how constitutional law required a manual search for undervotes as part of the protest phase of Florida\u2019s electoral process, to the point of necessitating such a drastic alteration of the statutory language. Was it unconstitutional, as distinct from bad policy, to confine the protest phase to a machine recount in those situations where the machines were working as designed? The Florida Supreme Court seemed to assume that the answer to this question was yes, although constitutional law had never been understood to require any recount at all.\n\nJames Baker, the chief of Bush\u2019s legal team, recommended that Bush take the case to the US Supreme Court. Other Bush lawyers were dubious about this move. \u201cWhat\u2019s the federal question?\u201d they essentially asked, knowing that the US Supreme Court is jurisdictionally limited to questions of federal rather than state law. The Florida Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, however aberrant it might be, was premised mostly on state rather than federal law. (The general references in its opinion to the constitutional right to vote could be construed to implicate federal as well as state constitutional principles, but otherwise it seemed to be an exegesis of state law.) Furthermore, even if there were a federal question for the US Supreme Court to consider, why would the Court take the case? The US Supreme Court has discretionary jurisdiction, meaning it is entirely free to accept or decline cases within its power to decide. Because the Court might wish not to ensnare itself in the process of picking the next president, most seasoned Court-watchers predicted the Court would decline to review the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s decision.

Gore, as presented to the US Supreme Court, involve all the issues concerning dimpled and hanging chads.\nThe US Supreme Court has discretionary jurisdiction, meaning it is entirely free to accept or decline cases within its power to decide.\nBush and Gore, of course, were the two candidates: George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and son of the forty-first president, challenging the incumbent vice president, Al Gore."}
