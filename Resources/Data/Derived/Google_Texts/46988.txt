U.S. stocks closed sharply lower on Friday as slowing growth in China and worries about a possible rate hike by the Fed took their toll. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the day down 531 points for a 3.12 percent loss. The S&P lost 65 points (-3.16 percent) — its worst day since Aug. 8, 2011 — and the Nasdaq lost 171 (-3.52 percent). For the first time since 2011, the Dow is now in a correction, meaning it has lost 10 percent from its peak. The S&P is nearing correction territory, too, having lost 7.5 percent since its May 21 closing high.

The selloff was widespread, with 491 of the S&P 500 stocks ending the day in the red and only 11 managing to advance (the S&P 500 actually includes 502 stocks). For the week, 487 of the S&P 500 stocks fell and only 15 gained. In total, the S&P 500 lost a collective $1.14 trillion in market value on the week. Yes, trillion with a "T."
