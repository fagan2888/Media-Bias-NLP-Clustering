A woman has been arrested after a two vehicle collision in Lexington on Sunday afternoon.

Lexington Police tell WKYT they were called out the intersection of Man O'War Boulevard and Rapid Run Drive around 1:15 p.m. for an injury accident. Officers say a woman in a grey Nissan was driving on the inner loop of Man O'War past Trent when she drove over the center median. The woman drove the wrong way on Man O'War up until the intersection with Rapid Run. That's when the woman came back over the median and rear-ended a red Ford Ranger.

The woman driver, who was identified as 26-year-old Carissa M. McGlothin, was taken to UK Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

When McGothlin was released from the hospital, she was taken into custody and charged with DUI, driving on suspended license and no insurance.
