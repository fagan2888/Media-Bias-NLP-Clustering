This was a prudent going-in position. In retrospect, we should have stayed out longer.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealth said on Nov. 19 that it may quit selling coverage in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual markets in 2017. The markets are a key element of the law\u2019s goal to cover about 10 million Americans next year, and UnitedHealth had expanded its offerings for 2016, after initially holding off when the markets started covering people in 2014.\n\nLosses from the plans this year and next will total more than half a billion dollars, the company has said, and UnitedHealth will scale back efforts to market coverage to millions of people shopping for 2016 insurance on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s new marketplaces.\n\nNot Alone\n\nUnitedHealth is not alone in its Obamacare struggles. Other insurers, including competitors Anthem Inc. and Aetna Inc., have also either suffered losses in the markets or said they haven\u2019t seen the margins they expected. Next year will be the law\u2019s third of providing coverage.\n\n\u201cIt will take more than a season or two for this market to develop,\u201d Hemsley said. \u201cWe did not believe it would form this slowly, be this porous, or become this severe.\u201d\n\nHemsley said today that the rest of UnitedHealth\u2019s businesses are faring better than its comparatively small exchange operation, which it has said covers about 540,000 people. The company said it expects operating earnings of $13.1 billion to $13.5 billion next year, on revenue of $180 billion to $181 billion.\n\nUnitedHealth advanced 1.7 percent to $114.59 at 10:01 a.m. in New York. The stock has gained 11 percent this year, as of Monday\u2019s close.\n\nOther Businesses\n\nEnrollment at the company\u2019s insurance businesses will climb to 47.4 million to 48.2 million people next year, from 46.2 million at the end of 2015. The company is projecting more enrollees in line of business including Medicare Advantage and Medicaid. Separately, UnitedHealth said its drug-coverage business for the elderly, Medicare Part D, may lose as many as 650,000 customers.\n\nAcross all of its insurance businesses, UnitedHealth said it expects to spend about 81.5 cents of every dollar it takes in from premiums on medical expenses.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer", "twitter": {"description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. should have stayed out of Obamacare\u2019s new individual markets longer, the chief executive officer of the biggest U.S. health insurer said Tuesday, after announcing last month that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to the business.", "title": "UnitedHealth Says It Should Have Avoided Obamacare Longer", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/unitedhealth-says-it-should-have-stayed-out-of-obamacare-longer", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iV.EEatF4TEI/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Zachary Tracer", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Stephen J Hemsley,Health,UnitedHealth Group Inc", "news_keywords": "Stephen J Hemsley,Health,UnitedHealth Group Inc", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/unitedhealth-says-it-should-have-stayed-out-of-obamacare-longer", "parsely-title": "UnitedHealth Says It Should Have Avoided Obamacare Longer", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-01T13:45:06.176Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. should have stayed out of Obamacare\u2019s new individual markets longer, the chief executive officer of the biggest U.S. health insurer said Tuesday, after announcing last month that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to the business.", "parsely-tags": "Stephen J Hemsley,Health,UnitedHealth Group Inc,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-12-01T13:45:06.176Z", "parsely-section": "personal-finance", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. should have stayed out of Obamacare\u2019s new individual markets longer, the chief executive officer of the biggest U.S. health insurer said Tuesday, after announcing last month that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to the business.", "title": "UnitedHealth Says It Should Have Avoided Obamacare Longer", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-01/unitedhealth-says-it-should-have-stayed-out-of-obamacare-longer", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iV.EEatF4TEI/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "UnitedHealth Group Inc. should have stayed out of Obamacare\u2019s new individual markets longer, the chief executive officer of the biggest U.S. health insurer said Tuesday, after announcing last month that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars in losses related to the business."}, "parsely-post-id": "NYOLPU6KLVRG01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iV.EEatF4TEI/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Across all of its insurance businesses, UnitedHealth said it expects to spend about 81.5 cents of every dollar it takes in from premiums on medical expenses.\nSeparately, UnitedHealth said its drug-coverage business for the elderly, Medicare Part D, may lose as many as 650,000 customers.\nOther BusinessesEnrollment at the company\u2019s insurance businesses will climb to 47.4 million to 48.2 million people next year, from 46.2 million at the end of 2015.\nWhile the company\u2019s other lines of business are growing, instead of expanding into Obamacare next year, the company should have kept waiting, UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said at an investor meeting in New York.\nThe company said it expects operating earnings of $13.1 billion to $13.5 billion next year, on revenue of $180 billion to $181 billion."}
