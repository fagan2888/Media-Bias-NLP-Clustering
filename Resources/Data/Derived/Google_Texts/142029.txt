Monday is the anniversary of Caitlin Murphy's death. Her close friends are choosing to raise awareness and pay it forward.

"I can always imagine her with a smile on her face or a corny joke," Jamie Leinart said. "She was excited. (Her and her husband had) just bought a home together. Her and her high school sweetheart had just married. She was great at what she did. She wanted to open her own salon."

Murphy collapsed weeks after her wedding. She didn't know she had an infection, which causes septic shock.

"As far as septic shock goes, most people just think of tampon," Leinart said.

Leinart believes a surgery several years ago caused Murphy's infection. Nevertheless, her friends are focusing on healing and health as they continue to strive for closure.





In honor of the esthetician who made others feel beautiful, Murphy's best friends spent the anniversary of her death handing out hygiene bags to women in need.

"Lots of women don't have accessibility to what we take for granted," Leinart said. "I want something positive to come of this.

Severe infections cause septic shock. In some cases, like Murphy's, the patients may not know they have an infection.
