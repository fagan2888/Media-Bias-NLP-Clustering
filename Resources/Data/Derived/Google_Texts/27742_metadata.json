Clean lab is designed to mimic industry standards for high end, high technical welding.\"\n\nTolar said he didn't plan on becoming a high-end welder, but he believed it was a great fall back career, and knowledge worth having.\n\nWard agreed adding, \"it's 1170 hours, which takes approximately one year, or two semesters to get through this program. It is an NCCER based certification program, which is an national industry standard.\n\nThe welding facility was still under construction, but Ward assured us it would be ready by the time classes began in January.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Chipola College officials said they were trying to answer the need for a specific trade by starting a state of the art welding program in January.
