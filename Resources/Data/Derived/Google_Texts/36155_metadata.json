Sure, you get a monthly reminder of those carefree college days, but it always comes in the form of a hefty bill. Ouch!\n\nAs a nation, we owe more than $1.2 trillion in student debt, and that number is only getting bigger.According to the Wall Street Journal, 71 percent of college graduates have student loans, and the average amount of loan debt carried by the class of 2015 is a whopping $35,000.\n\nBut before you let the stress of your loan payments drive you into insanity, take a deep breath. You're in good company, and there are many ways to ease the burden of that dreaded monthly bill.\n\nUnderstand the basics.\n\nThese tips apply to everyone with student loans. If you've been struggling with the high cost of your debt, make sure you've act on these solutions first, or you're throwing money away.\n\nRelated: Worried About Student Loans? A New Repayment Plan May Help\n\nPick the best repayment plan. Explore the different payment plans offered including Pay as You Earn or Income-Based Repayment (IBR), which are based off of your income and can drastically reduce your monthly payment. Call your lender and have them work with you to see which plan is best for your lifestyle. You might be surprised at how willing they are to help--I know I was!\n\nConsider refinancing your loan. Chances are, when you originally took out these loans, you had a limited credit history, no assets, and a small or nonexistent income. Assuming your credit has improved since then, you may be able to get your rate lowered since you are less of a risk, as far as a lender is concerned. Keep in mind that refinancing works differently for any federal loans. If you refinance a federal loan to a private loan, you lose the benefits that go along with it such as any loan forgiveness options and more flexible repayment plans.\n\nDeduct your student loan interest. Once tax season rolls around, don't forget to deduct any interest paid! You can deduct up to $2,500, so be on the lookout for a 1098-E document in the mail from your lender.\n\nSign up for auto enrollment. Some lenders will reduce a small percentage of your loan interest for enrolling in automatic monthly payments. This can add up over time, and it also eliminates the possibility of late fees--as long as you keep tabs on your account balance.\n\nUse your credit cards (wisely).\n\nUsed properly, credit cards are a great tool. Here are two ways to put them to work paying off your student loans faster without running up more debt.\n\nRelated: Guess Who in Congress Has $100,000 in Student Loans?\n\nMake your credit card pay for your student loans. Cash in on sign-up bonuses! The Chase Ink Plus card, for example, offers a signup bonus of 60,000 points when you spend $5,000 in three months. You can cash that out for $600, and you can apply it twice, which means an extra $1,200 in your pocket that can go right towards your loans.\n\nYou'll earn smaller rewards on an ongoing basis if you keep it up, which also can be applied to your debt. Meet minimum spending requirements with household expenses you'd normally pay for with cash, and make sure you pay off the card every month, because if you don't you'll end up paying interest and going even further into debt. No bueno.\n\nDrop your interest rate to zero. Transfer what you can to a zero percent interest credit card, like the US Bank Platinum Visa. Once the zero percent interest period is up, transfer it to another zero percent card, and keep it rolling. If you have $10,000 in debt at six percent interest, it costs a lot more over the life of the loan than if your interest rate is zero percent.\n\nAdditionally, having that debt on a credit card means that if something goes wrong in your life, you can discharge it in bankruptcy, which you can't do with a student loan. But you have to be on top of it to understand when that balance will start accruing interest. Keep in mind that a one-time balance transfer fee of three percent may apply, but it's still a lot less than monthly interest at six percent or more.\n\nRelated: 11 Wild Things Graduates Would Do to Erase Their Student Debt\n\nGo big and change your life!\n\nMake a difference in the world and shed some student loan debt all at the same time with a new career or volunteer opportunity.

Check with your employer to see if you qualify.\n\nYou can also have a portion of your loans forgiven with federal, state, and local government agency jobs, and even private companies are starting to offer student loan repayment help as part of their employment package.
