WASHINGTON, November 23, 2014 – In an astonishing turnabout for the notoriously leftist-friendly Saturday Night Live—the long-running comedy series brought to you by the most leftist-friendly network, NBC—the SNL crew trashed President Obama’s much-ballyhooed, unconstitutional “executive order” decreeing blanket amnesty for most of the illegal aliens undocumented immigrants streaming across America’s sudden borders without hindrance.

Last night’s opening skit featured a riff on “Schoolhouse Rock,” as described here on IJ Review, linked via PJTatler:

It starts out with the familiar boy climbing the steps of Capitol Hill and asking what kind of bill is on the Hill with him. The bill responds with a jingle that he is an “immigration bill” and that he hopes he can be passed into law someday. Cue the President shoving the bill down the stairs before inviting his buddy, the cigarette smoking “executive order,” into the picture. The boy exclaims in bewilderment that what the President is doing is unconstitutional, but the executive order just laughs at the boy’s belief that he still thinks that is how government works.

Let’s check that video out, via YouTube:

But wait! There’s more!

PJTatler tartly reports that, based on Univision and Telemundo surveys, our first American Emperor’s latest unconstitutional decree is actually opposed by a majority of Latino voters, many of whom have immigrated and/or become U.S. citizens via the standard process.

By a margin of 56 percent to 40 percent, Hispanic voters oppose allowing illegal immigrants to obtain federal benefits, including Obamacare benefits, “while they are going through the legalization process and before the 90% goal is reached.”

This Executive order is a winner, for sure.

Meanwhile, the nation continues to eagerly await the imminent, assured destruction of Ferguson, Missouri. Aren’t we glad we live in a nation of laws?
