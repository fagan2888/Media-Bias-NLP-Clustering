According to a 2014 survey of 510 human resources professionals, about a third of employers offer a program to help employees lose weight. About 7 percent more are planning to offer a weight loss program within the next year.\n\nAnd did you know that about 20 percent of employers now have on-site fitness centers, and 14 percent offer on-site fitness classes?\n\n\u201cA lot of research is coming out, and some of it shows a return on investment for having wellness programs,\u201d said Andrew Gavigan, founder of AG Fitness in West Hills, California, which provides wellness services to corporate clients such as Red Bull and Munchkin.\n\nDiscover the Best Obesity Blogs of 2014 \u00bb\n\nAG Fitness offers clients on-site fitness classes, fruit and other healthy snack delivery, on-site seminars about nutrition, and smoking cessation programs.\n\nRecent studies have shown that employee wellness programs can improve employees\u2019 self-reported health while also saving companies money in the long run.\n\nA Healthy Garden of Eden\n\nGarden of Life, a nutritional supplement company in West Palm Beach, Florida, has several healthy perks for its employees. Teresa Miller, Garden of Life\u2019s senior human resources director, told Healthline, \u201cWe want our employee programs and benefits to be in alignment with our philosophy \u2026 which is empowering extraordinary health.\u201d\n\nGarden of Life recently relocated to a new building. Its offices include a fitness center equipped with cardio machines, weights, kettle bells, and TRX fitness machines. Employees work from adjustable desks and with adjustable monitors, so they can stand for part of the day. They also have ergonomically correct chairs, stability ball chairs, and a \u201cquiet room\u201d with recliners.\n\nEmployees also receive free on-site biometric screenings to check their body fat and blood cholesterol levels, as well as a free pedometer, said Miller.\n\nEmployees who participate in quarterly team and individual walking challenges receive gift cards, cash prizes, or FitBits, which are rubber bracelets that track a person\u2019s activity level.\n\n\u201cWe like to make sure people are continually incentivized to get all their steps in,\u201d Miller said.\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, Garden of Life has a nutritionist on staff who conducts \u201clunch and learn\u201d seminars about health and wellness topics. Certified personal trainers are also available.\n\nRead More: \u201cObamacare\u201d Wellness Rules Say It\u2019s Time to Pay More for Your Bad Habits \u00bb\n\nEmployee Heart Attack Inspires a New Fitness Program\n\nesd and associates, a digital marketing firm in San Antonio, Texas, started its wellness program, \u201cesd fit,\u201d in 2011 after an employee had a heart attack in a company conference room.\n\n\u201cLuckily, a doctor in the business complex where we are located had a defibrillator and was able to revive the employee,\u201d Robert Crowe, director of communications at esd and associates, told Healthline.\n\nThe incident got the company thinking about what it could do to help its employees lead a healthier lifestyle.\n\n\u201cesd fit\u201d includes team fitness activities, incentives, and a fitness tracking app developed by the company. Employees earn points for participating in health activities each quarter, said Crowe.\n\nGroup activities, such as healthy cooking demonstrations by the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association, are also scheduled. Crowe said that by attending these sessions, employees earn points and get a Starbucks gift card.\n\nThe company also goes the extra mile by reimbursing employees for the entry fee for 5K runs, marathons, and triathlons, after employees complete the races. It also has Fitness Fridays. Company hours are 9 am to 6 pm, said Crowe. But on Fridays, employees can earn points for doing a fitness activity from 5 pm to 6 pm. \u201cSometimes we\u2019ll do a group walk,\u201d he said.\n\nRead More: Tech Investor Sponsors Wellness Challenge for 5 American Communities \u00bb\n\nEmployees also stand to benefit from esd and associates\u2019 partnerships with its clients, such as the YMCA of Greater San Antonio, where employees get discounted memberships and can do a Fitness Friday activity.\n\nGlobal Giant Takes a Multi-Dimensional Approach\n\nJohnson & Johnson, the worldwide health products giant, takes a \u201ccomprehensive approach to wellness that focuses on enabling a culture of health within the organization,\u201d Dr. Fikry Isaac, vice president of Johnson & Johnson Health and Wellness Solutions, told Healthline.\n\nOne thing that has helped J&J employees is the company\u2019s Energy for Performance and Life Program, said Isaac. This program, based on a program at J&J\u2019s Human Performance Institute, promotes the development of what it terms \u201ccorporate athletes.\u201d It looks at energy from four different dimensions: spiritual, physical, emotional, and mental.\n\nEmployees go through half-day to two-day training programs. Isaac said they examine questions such as, What is their purpose? Why would they want to live longer? What makes them happy? What matters to them the most over the long term?\n\nEmployees look at how their purpose is linked to good health, nutrition, and habits. Employees learn how they can use their physical energy to allow them to perform well at work and in family life.\n\nWill 2015 see more companies jumping on the fitness bandwagon? Gavigan said that convincing some companies to launch health programs \u201cis still like pulling teeth sometimes, especially if you have someone like a CFO who is not on board.\u201d\n\nStill, he believes that with greater awareness of the cost savings wellness programs can provide, more companies will offer these programs and more employees will choose to take part.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/employers-want-you-to-be-healthy-in-2015-122714", "news_keywords": "healthy, weight loss, new years resolutions, healthy living, employers", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Companies are offering employees a slew of perks, including on-site gyms, fitness memberships, healthy snacks, and personal trainers to encourage healthy living.", "title": "Employers to Employees: We Want You to Be Healthy in 2015", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/employers-want-you-to-be-healthy-in-2015-122714", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/weight-loss/122714_HealthyCompanies_THUMB.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/weight-loss/122714_HealthyCompanies_THUMB.jpg", "description": "Companies are offering employees a slew of perks, including on-site gyms, fitness memberships, healthy snacks, and personal trainers to encourage healthy living.", "card": "summary", "title": "Employers to Employees: We Want You to Be Healthy in 2015"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-23", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Companies are offering employees a slew of perks, including on-site gyms, fitness memberships, healthy snacks, and personal trainers to encourage healthy living."}, "article_summary": "And did you know that about 20 percent of employers now have on-site fitness centers, and 14 percent offer on-site fitness classes?\nA Healthy Garden of EdenGarden of Life, a nutritional supplement company in West Palm Beach, Florida, has several healthy perks for its employees.\nDiscover the Best Obesity Blogs of 2014 \u00bbAG Fitness offers clients on-site fitness classes, fruit and other healthy snack delivery, on-site seminars about nutrition, and smoking cessation programs.\nRecent studies have shown that employee wellness programs can improve employees\u2019 self-reported health while also saving companies money in the long run.\nIf your New Year\u2019s resolution is to get fit in 2015, your employer may be the key to your success."}
