It showed more people are finding coverage who didn\u2019t have it before, rather than people with private insurance switching to public insurance under Medicaid\u2019s eased eligibility requirements.\n\nThe average increase in Medicaid volume, 29 percent, in hospitals in expansion states, the study said, is demonstrably due to the Affordable Care Act. Among other requirements, the act expands Medicaid eligibility to include those adult Americans making up to 133 percent of the poverty level who aren\u2019t eligible for Medicare.\n\nAmong Colorado hospitals, the trend is even more pronounced than it is nationally. The increase in Medicaid volume in the first quarter of 2014 was 30.5 percent.\n\nMedicaid, which paid 15.4 percent of all Colorado hospital charges in the first quarter of 2013, paid 20.1 percent in 2014.\n\nThe net result of Medicaid expansion is a reduction in uncompensated care, which could help reduce health care costs, according to the association\u2019s Center for Health Information and Data Analytics.\n\nUncompensated care is the cost of hospital care for which providers receive no payment from either the patient or insurer. In Colorado, it totaled about $500 million in 2012, according the association.\n\nThose losses are absorbed by the hospitals, which decrease services or access to services, or shifted to private insurers. Health policy analysts say this \u201ccost shifting\u201d is one of the driving forces behind rising health care costs.\n\nThe CHA study found a 25 percent decrease in self-paying patients, which often results in bad debts. And it found a 30 percent drop in charity care for the uninsured.\n\nIn Colorado, hospitals experienced a 30.3 percent decrease in those patients paying out of pocket, and a 36.2 percent drop in average charity-care costs.\n\n\u201cThese findings not only affirm that more people are finding health care coverage who didn\u2019t have it before, but also that it is having a positive impact by reducing the levels of uncompensated care at hospitals, which could further efforts to reduce health care costs,\u201d said CHA chief executive Steven Summer.\n\nBeginning this year, Medicaid coverage for the newly eligible adults is fully funded by the federal government through 2016.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will cover nearly 93 percent of the costs of the Medicaid expansion through 2022.\n\nCritics of Medicaid expansion, such as conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, say the already overburdened program could draw some younger, presumably healthier people who otherwise would have to buy private insurance.\n\nTo read the full Colorado Hospital Association report, \u201cImpact of Medicaid Expansion on Hospital Volumes,\u201d see www.cha.com/Documents/Press-Releases/CHA-Medicaid-Expansion-Study-June-2014.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Medicaid expansion reducing hospital losses from uninsured, study says", "title": "Medicaid expansion reducing hospital losses from uninsured, study says", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/03/medicaid-expansion-reducing-hospital-losses-from-uninsured-study-says/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T16:37:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T16:37:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba38\"", "article_summary": "To read the full Colorado Hospital Association report, \u201cImpact of Medicaid Expansion on Hospital Volumes,\u201d see www.cha.com/Documents/Press-Releases/CHA-Medicaid-Expansion-Study-June-2014.\nUncompensated care is the cost of hospital care for which providers receive no payment from either the patient or insurer.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will cover nearly 93 percent of the costs of the Medicaid expansion through 2022.\nHealth policy analysts say this \u201ccost shifting\u201d is one of the driving forces behind rising health care costs.\nThe Colorado Hospital Association study, released Monday, gathered data from 465 hospitals in 30 states."}
