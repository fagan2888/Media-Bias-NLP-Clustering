(AP) - The annual air show at Offutt Air Force Base won\u2019t be held this year because of planned construction.\n\nThe Omaha World-Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1ugWIFx ) that air show fans in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa will have to drive several hours to find one in 2015.\n\nMaj. James Lee with the 55th Wing says the air show is being cancelled because Congress approved funding for a taxiway project at Offutt this year.\n\nThe Air Force plans to spend roughly $7 million to repave part of a taxiway that\u2019s normally used for static displays and spectators at the air show. The Air Force Thunderbirds were expected to headline this year\u2019s show.\n\nLee said he expects the air show to return in 2016.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The annual air show at Offutt Air Force Base won't be held this year because of planned construction.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/18/offutt-air-force-base-cancels-this-years-air-show/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "The annual air show at Offutt Air Force Base won\u2019t be held this year because of planned construction.", "title": "Offutt Air Force Base cancels this year\u2019s air show"}, "twitter": {"description": "The annual air show at Offutt Air Force Base won't be held this year because of planned construction.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Offutt Air Force Base cancels this year\u2019s air show"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3891\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - The annual air show at Offutt Air Force Base won\u2019t be held this year because of planned construction.\nThe Air Force Thunderbirds were expected to headline this year\u2019s show.\nThe Air Force plans to spend roughly $7 million to repave part of a taxiway that\u2019s normally used for static displays and spectators at the air show.\n___Information from: Omaha World-Herald, http://www.omaha.com\nThe Omaha World-Herald reports (http://bit.ly/1ugWIFx ) that air show fans in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa will have to drive several hours to find one in 2015."}
