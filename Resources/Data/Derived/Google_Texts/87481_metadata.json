Importantly, this pickup in healthcare spending was not driven by higher costs; real spending in this category accelerated from 1.9% in 2010-2013 to 3.9% thereafter.\"\n\nThis would indicate that Americans have been not only been spending more because of increased costs, but also intentionally allocating more of their wallet to the sector.\n\nTo match the increased spending, the healthcare sector's labor market has also been booming.\n\n\"Employment data also corroborates this: as shown in chart 3, the healthcare sector produced about 240,000 jobs per year between 2010 and mid-2014,\" said the note. \"Since then, it has averaged at 354,000/year and the sector is currently producing about 500,000 jobs annualized.\"\n\nNow there are a few reasons for the increase, the most notable of which is the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Markowska notes that the growth in real spending closely matches the 4% increase in the number of Americans with health insurance since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in 2012.\n\nPart of the increased spending no doubt has to do with the number of people spending more on insurance who did not have it before, but also higher spending on drug prescriptions.\n\nThis increased consumer spending and labor availability is a net positive for the economy, according to Markowska.\n\n\"So, although increased demand for healthcare may have squeezed other forms of spending, it did produce positive economic effects,\" said the note from Societe Generale.\n\nThis is just one piece of Obamacare's impact, there are many other factors going into it and nominal spending on healthcare premiums are certainly worth considering, but according to Markowska, there is reason to believe the bill has been helpful to the US economy.", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.businessinsider.in/", "cmsei": "cms.next", "description": "Getty ImagesUS President Barack Obama delivers the keynote address at the awards dinner for Syracuse University's Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting", "og": {"url": "http://www.businessinsider.in/Obamacare-has-been-good-for-the-economy/articleshow/52256621.cms", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.businessinsider.in/photo/52256621.cms", "site_name": "Business Insider", "title": "Obamacare has been good for the economy"}, "twitter": {"description": "Getty ImagesUS President Barack Obama delivers the keynote address at the awards dinner for Syracuse University's Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting", "title": "Obamacare has been good for the economy", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.in/Obamacare-has-been-good-for-the-economy/articleshow/52256621.cms", "image": "http://www.businessinsider.in/photo/52256621.cms", "site": "@bi_india", "card": "summary"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "msvalidate.01": "BAB71AAED7CCC01DB106A58E99625EB4", "fb": {"admins": 556964827, "app_id": 645465345465774}, "keywords": "Politics,moneygame,clusterstock", "google-site-verification": "NpZv5Qfl0TuFiebbwMualP_h2a3QtmQGFjE9hhw9um8", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=2.0; minimum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "moneygame,Politics,clusterstock"}, "article_summary": "Importantly, this pickup in healthcare spending was not driven by higher costs; real spending in this category accelerated from 1.9% in 2010-2013 to 3.9% thereafter.\"\nThis increased consumer spending and labor availability is a net positive for the economy, according to Markowska.\n\"In nominal terms, household spending on healthcare averaged 3.9% between 2010 and 2013,\" wrote Markowska in a note to clients Thursday.\nTo match the increased spending, the healthcare sector's labor market has also been booming.\nPart of the increased spending no doubt has to do with the number of people spending more on insurance who did not have it before, but also higher spending on drug prescriptions."}
