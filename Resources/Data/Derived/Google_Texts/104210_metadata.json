[He] has promised gun owners that he will repeal anti-gun Executive Orders that circumvent Congress and veto anti-gun legislation if it reaches his desk. [And] as a U.S. Senator, Ted Cruz has demonstrated a willingness to fight for our Second Amendment rights. He is working with GOA on legislation to repeal the Obama Administration\u2019s gun ban that is (and will) affect millions of military veterans and senior citizens.\n\nMacy also pointed to the fact that Cruz \u201chas cosponsored legislation to allow concealed carry reciprocity for law-abiding gun owners [throughout America].\u201d Such reciprocity is one of GOA\u2019s \u201cchief priorities in Congress.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that it was Cruz \u201cwho led the filibuster fight in 2013 against funding the anti-gun ObamaCare law, which will facilitate the disarmament of millions of gun owners once the law is fully implemented.\u201d Cruz has been clear in his determination \u201cto sign a bill to completely repeal ObamaCare as President\u201d and has already introduced legislation to repeal the massive government takeover of healthcare in America.\n\nMacy concluded:\n\nWe need a stalwart defender of the Second Amendment in the White House, and Ted Cruz will help shoulder the burden of fighting against the gun grabbers dedicated to eviscerating the Second Amendment.\n\nOn April 9 Breitbart News spoke with Ted Cruz about gun rights and he told us the Second Amendment \u201cis foundation to free men and free women being able to defend their homes, their families, their lives and liberty, and it also serves as a fundamental check on government tyranny.\u201d\n\nCruz added:\n\nFollowing the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook, President Obama could have sought bipartisan cooperation to target violent criminals and come down on them like a ton of bricks. Instead, unfortunately, he used that tragedy as an excuse to try to go after the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. I was glad to help lead the effort to stop President Obama\u2019s unconstitutional assault on the Second Amendment. As a result, millions of Americans spoke up to defend our constitutional liberties, and every single Obama proposal that would have undermined the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms was voted down on the Senate floor. In politics, lots of candidates talk a good game but voters are looking for a proven record. For two decades I have been proud to fight to defend the Second Amendment. Today is a time for truth, and we need leaders willing to stand and lead the fight to defend our constitutional liberties.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.
