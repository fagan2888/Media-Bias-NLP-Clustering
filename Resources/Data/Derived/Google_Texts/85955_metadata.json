As Paul Krugman recently noted , the \u201cDodd-Frank reform bill has, if anything, received even worse press than Obamacare, derided by the right as anti-business and by the left as hopelessly inadequate.\u201d That said, Krugman added that the law appears to be getting at least one big thing right.\n\nIf you go back to what happened in 2008, you had a situation in which the impending collapse of some key financial institutions threatened to bring down the whole world economy\u2026. This episode created a concern: now that everyone knew that big financial institutions would be bailed out if they went bad, wouldn\u2019t this (a) give such too-big-to-fail institutions a continuing advantage, because their government guaranteed safety would make them able to borrow cheaply, and (b) encourage irresponsible behavior? And there was a fair bit of evidence for (a): large financial institutions did indeed seem to have a funding advantage. To deal with this, Dodd-Frank created Ordinary Liquidation Authority, otherwise known as resolution authority \u2013 giving the government the legal authority to seize institutions the way it arguably should have in 2008-2009. [\u2026] GAO has the goods . There was indeed a large-bank funding advantage during and for some time after the crisis, but it has now been diminished or gone away \u2013 maybe even slightly reversed. That is, financial markets are now acting as if they believe that future bailouts won\u2019t be as favorable to fat cats as the bailouts of 2008.\n\nAll of this comes on top of the important and worthwhile work being done by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created when Wall Street reform was signed into law.\n\nKrugman, incidentally, isn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s noticed that Dodd-Frank is having a positive impact.\n\nMike Konczal made the case a few weeks ago that the reforms \u201care finally paying off.\u201d Matt Yglesias added , \u201cPerhaps America\u2019s largest financial institutions know a thing or two about financial regulation, and are fighting the law because it really is making a difference.\u201d\n\nReferencing the GAO report that Krugman cited, Matt added", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Slowly but surely, and four years after being signed into law, the Dodd-Frank reforms \"are finally paying off.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/wall-street-reforms-showing-signs-success", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Slowly but surely, and four years after being signed into law, the Dodd-Frank reforms \"are finally paying off.\"", "title": "Wall Street reforms showing signs of success", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/wall-street-reforms-showing-signs-success", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/06/wall-street.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Wall Street reforms showing signs of success", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/wall-street-reforms-showing-signs-success", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/06/wall-street.jpg?itok=Me_ASNUt", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Slowly but surely, and four years after being signed into law, the Dodd-Frank reforms \"are finally paying off.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-06T11:35:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Slowly but surely, and four years after being signed into law, the Dodd-Frank reforms \"are finally paying off.\"", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "Wall Street reforms showing signs of success", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/wall-street-reforms-showing-signs-success", "published": 1, "date": "08/06/2014 11:35:00 EDT", "tags": "economy,financial-industry,financial-reform,wall-street,rachel-maddow-show"}, "news_keywords": "Economy, Wall Street, Financial Industry, Financial Reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca01c\"", "article_summary": "But let\u2019s also not forget the Wall Street reforms signed into law in 2010.\nAnd there was a fair bit of evidence for (a): large financial institutions did indeed seem to have a funding advantage.\nIf you go back to what happened in 2008, you had a situation in which the impending collapse of some key financial institutions threatened to bring down the whole world economy\u2026.\nAll of this comes on top of the important and worthwhile work being done by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was created when Wall Street reform was signed into law.\nTo deal with this, Dodd-Frank created Ordinary Liquidation Authority, otherwise known as resolution authority \u2013 giving the government the legal authority to seize institutions the way it arguably should have in 2008-2009."}
