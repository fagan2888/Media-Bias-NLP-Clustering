HealthCure is making a big ask of investors this year, though the Detroit-based startup believes it has the stats to back up its request.The 5-year-old company's platform helps hospitals reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections. Its software team works with the staff of medical centers to find places where infections can be prevented and helps the institution meet Affordable Care Act benchmarks. HealthCure recently finished a pilot program with Oakwood Healthcare System and is publishing a paper with the results."We reduced infections by 20 percent in areas we worked," says Mark Arizmendi, CEO of HealthCure . "[Oakwood] saved more than $1 million."HealthCure plans to use that report as it works to raise a Series A round of seed capital. The firm is hoping to raise $3 million by this spring. Arizmendi believes that is possible as he continues to pitch investors from Chicago."We'd like to be in several healthcare systems in the Chicago and Michigan markets," Arizmendi says.HealthCure is also looking at expanding into other markets over the next year, including California. To accomplish that, the company has hired one person over the last year, expanding its staff to eight people. It is also looking to hire two more executive-level staffers.Source: Mark Arizmendi, CEO of HealthCureWriter: Jon ZemkeRead more about Metro Detroit's growing entrepreneurial ecosystem at SEMichiganStartup.com
