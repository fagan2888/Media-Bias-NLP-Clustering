Kay Hagan was the most expensive senatorial showdown in U.S. history, according to a study released by the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit public policy group.\n\nThe steep spending in the Tar Heel State helped boost 2014\u2019s election cycle to a projected $3.67 billion price tag, which would make it the most expensive midterm election run in U.S. history, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Spending in Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky and Georgia each eclipsed $70 million.\n\nThat figure would place this year's midterm elections past the $3.63 billion midterm watermark of 2010. And with a runoff still in play in Louisiana, the spending ceiling has nowhere to go but up.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "North Carolina: Priciest State in History's Most Expensive Midterm Elections", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The GOP got its money's worth in the 2014 midterm elections.", "title": "North Carolina: The Priciest State in History's Most Expensive Midterms", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/11/07/north-carolina-priciest-state-in-historys-most-expensive-midterm-elections", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/5a/17/461f5c494ac9adbdf7ff4f59a341/ap848409736690b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "North Carolina: Priciest State in History's Most Expensive Midterm Elections", "description": "The GOP got its money's worth in the 2014 midterm elections.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Andrew Soergel,Congress,politics,2014 Congressional elections,Pulse,picks,Data Mine [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The GOP got its money's worth in the 2014 midterm elections."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19bc\"", "article_summary": "That figure would place this year's midterm elections past the $3.63 billion midterm watermark of 2010.\nThe steep spending in the Tar Heel State helped boost 2014\u2019s election cycle to a projected $3.67 billion price tag, which would make it the most expensive midterm election run in U.S. history, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\nAnd with a runoff still in play in Louisiana, the spending ceiling has nowhere to go but up.\nNorth Carolina\u2019s $111 million contest between Republican Sen.-elect Thom Tillis and incumbent Democratic Sen.
