To simply quote David as saying,\u201d Tony Soprano is not dead,\u201d is inaccurate. There is a much larger context for that statement and as such, it is not true. As David Chase has said numerous times on the record, \u201cWhether Tony Soprano is alive or dead is not the point.\u201d To continue to search for this answer is fruitless. The final scene of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d raises a spiritual question that has no right or wrong answer.\n\nVox has responded to Chase\u2019s disavowal of the quote by noting that Chase\u2019s denial of the quote proves nothing and that the article, which considers Chase\u2019s work at great length, indeed helps to provide the larger context:\n\nThe entire point of Nochimson\u2019s essay is that even though Chase answered her query about Tony\u2019s death, it doesn\u2019t matter. If the fictional character of Tony Soprano lives or dies is not the point, because \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d itself is no more. Somewhere, the characters live on, even if Tony is not among their number.
