That myth exploded last month when Williams\u2019 successor, the sturdy, professional Lester Holt, lifted the \u201cNightly News\u201d to a 10 year high:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn his first sweeps month as Nightly News anchor Lester Holt gave the NBC broadcast its biggest July audience in 10 years, and its best in the A25-54 demo since 2013. Holt officially took over the show six weeks ago, but has been anchoring since February when Brian Williams stepped aside from the show.\n\nBecause almost all of the mainstream media is run by left-wing narcissists, they tend to forget that most of America is nothing like them. We\u2019re not looking for Personalities among our news men and women, what we want are either people who are open about their biases (Fox News) or those we can trust who don\u2019t make it all about them.\n\nMSNBC is a bubble-dumb echo chamber. CNN is a toxic mix of narcissists like Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon who are trying to hoodwink the public into believing they are not left-wing extremists. That\u2019s why both of those networks are failing.\n\nHolt is a pro, not a celebrity or brand. He delivers the news, stays out of the way, and wins.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Professionalism Wins: Lester Holt Lifts NBC News to 10 Year High", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Professionalism Wins: Lester Holt Lifts NBC News to 10 Year High", "title": "Professionalism Wins: Lester Holt Lifts NBC News to 10 Year High - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/lester-holt-AFP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-08-05T06:57:18-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/08/05/sweeps-month-lester-holt-lifts-nbc-news-to-10-year-high/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Professionalism Wins: Lester Holt Lifts NBC News to 10 Year High", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/03/lester-holt-AFP.jpg", "title": "Professionalism Wins: Lester Holt Lifts NBC News to 10 Year High - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Brian Williams, Lester Holt,Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-05T06:55:23-07:00", "section": "Big Journalism", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T06:57:18-07:00", "tag": "Lester Holt", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc842\"", "article_summary": "Holt officially took over the show six weeks ago, but has been anchoring since February when Brian Williams stepped aside from the show.\nBecause almost all of the mainstream media is run by left-wing narcissists, they tend to forget that most of America is nothing like them.\nThat myth exploded last month when Williams\u2019 successor, the sturdy, professional Lester Holt, lifted the \u201cNightly News\u201d to a 10 year high:SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn his first sweeps month as Nightly News anchor Lester Holt gave the NBC broadcast its biggest July audience in 10 years, and its best in the A25-54 demo since 2013.\nHe delivers the news, stays out of the way, and wins.\nHolt is a pro, not a celebrity or brand."}
