That has prompted lawmakers to consider a variety of options, including a new proposal by a rural health committee assembled by Gov. Nathan Deal to essentially remake that state's five dozen rural providers into a holistic system.\n\nDeal's committee has put forth a proposal that would in essence place all of the state's rural providers into a \"hub and spoke\" arrangement, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Larger regional hospitals would then direct patients to the facility that would provide the most appropriate care. The intent is to take the burden of having to provide specialized services that may be too costly to offer in the long-term off of smaller facilities.\n\nIn addition to those changes, a lot of patient care delivery would shift over to non-physician providers such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants.\n\nFour hospitals would be designated as hubs statewide in a pilot project: Union General, Appling Health System, Crisp Regional and Emanuel Regional Medical Center. The state would appropriate $3 million toward the project and for related infrastructure.\n\nGeorgia, like many other Southern states, has seen its rural healthcare system struggle, particularly as it did not expand Medicaid eligibility in conjunction with the Affordable Care Act. That, along with cuts in Disproportionate Share Hospital payments have proven disastrous to the smaller rural hospitals.\n\nNearly two-thirds of Georgia's rural hospitals are losing money, and about a third have experienced budget deficits for at least the past five years. Deal has made other proposals in the past, such as creating freestading emergency departments without a full hospital, but this proposal is far more comprehensive.\n\n\"Just as a medical emergency can't wait, neither can we wait to act upon these recommendations,\" Deal said in a statement, the Journal-Constitution reported. \"It is my hope that these efforts are not a temporary fix, but rather the beginning of a long-lasting road to recovery for our rural health systems.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Atlanta Journal-Constitution article\n\n- check out the rural hospital report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nGeorgia's rural hospitals continue to deteriorate\n\nGA to use standalone ERs\n\nGA governor proposes step-down licensure for struggling rural hospitals\n\nMore than a dozen GA hospitals may soon close doors", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rural hospitals\u00a0continue to struggle in Georgia, with some being forced to close their doors.
