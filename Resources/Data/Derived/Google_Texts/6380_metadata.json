It took all we had to finish undefeated in our conference. Now it\u2019s time to focus on our next opponent, Alabama.\n\n\u201cI tell my guys that the Crimson Tide is no better than our last match-up, Western Montana Institute of Technology. If we play our game, I think we\u2019ll give Nick Saban fits\u201d.\n\nLeading the Potent Potatoes is quarterback and Heisman dark horse Dennis Nguyen. Standing 5\u20196\u2033 and weighing 164 pounds, Nguyen was lightly recruited coming out of high school.\n\nNguyen recollects, \u201cI came here for our strong program in farm technology and had no intent of playing football. But when I was playing Frisbee one day, coach Stillsbury asked me to try out for the team, and the rest is history. I\u2019m really grateful for the opportunity and am hoping for a shot in the NFL.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard projections of me being a top 10 draft pick. This winter I will work out with Marcus [Mariota] and Jameis [Winston] to get ready for Northeastern Idaho State\u2019s pro day\u201d.\n\nLas Vegas has the Potent Potatoes as a six point favorite over the SEC champion Alabama.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dfb\"", "article_summary": "Northeastern Idaho State (formerly Northern Idaho Agricultural College) was selected by the playoff committee as the number four seed in the playoff.\nWhile most of the debate about the College Football Playoff has surrounded Ohio State, Baylor, and TCU, a surprise team sneaked into the playoff late on Monday night.\nLas Vegas has the Potent Potatoes as a six point favorite over the SEC champion Alabama.\nThis winter I will work out with Marcus [Mariota] and Jameis [Winston] to get ready for Northeastern Idaho State\u2019s pro day\u201d.\nLeading the Potent Potatoes is quarterback and Heisman dark horse Dennis Nguyen."}
