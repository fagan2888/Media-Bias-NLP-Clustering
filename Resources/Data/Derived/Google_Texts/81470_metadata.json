Orrin G. Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who led the group of 10 senators, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ohio country club bartender plotted to poison, shoot John Boehner\n\nAnother version of the bill introduced in the House already has drawn more than 250 sponsors, including 29 Democrats, so the measure\u2019s prospects of getting to President Obama\u2019s desk are rosier than the GOP\u2019s first salvo against Obamacare \u2014 a push to redefine full-time work under the overhaul. Mr. Obama has already vowed a veto of that change.\n\nIndustry studies say the medical device tax cost the sector more than 30,000 jobs in the first year alone.\n\nBut the Congressional Research Service, in a report last week, said the effect would be more muted \u2014 a drop of less than 1 percent in employment for the industry.\n\nSEE ALSO: House votes to exempt volunteer firefighters from Obamacare mandate\n\n\u201cA number of concerns have been raised about the effects of the tax on research and innovation in the medical device industry,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThe relatively small effects on the industry suggest that innovation and research would be minimally affected.\u201d\n\nThe Advanced Medical Technology Association, said the study was fundamentally flawed and tone-deaf to intense competition within its industry.\n\n\u201cPrices are actually declining in major sectors of the industry, but the CRS assumes the tax can be \u2018passed on\u2019 to purchasers,\u201d such as patients and hospitals, AdvaMed spokeswoman Wanda Moebius said. \u201cThat\u2019s simply not the case.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if Congress will be able to find money to offset the $29 billion in revenue the medical device tax is expected to bring in over the next decade, which would be lost in a repeal.\n\nDemocratic leaders have defended the tax, saying the manufacturers have more customers thanks to Obamacare, so they can afford to pay.\n\nYet Senate Republicans hold 54 votes, and five Democrats \u2014 Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken of Minnesota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire \u2014 have sponsored the bill, meaning the bill is close to being able to survive a filibuster.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s other swipe at Obamacare is facing steeper odds. House lawmakers easily passed a bill to change the law\u2019s definition of full-time work from 30 hours to 40, but many Senate Democrats have signaled they\u2019ll try to thwart the change.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bipartisan group of 10 senators introduced legislation to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices, a long-expected move from the Republican-controlled Congress because Democrats in certain states want to protect companies back home.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A bipartisan group of 10 senators introduced legislation to repeal Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical devices, a long-expected move from the Republican-controlled Congress because Democrats in certain states want to protect companies back home.", "title": "Bipartisan Senate group files bill to repeal Obamacare tax on medical devices", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/13/senators-bill-repeal-obamacare-tax-medical-devices/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/senate-new-chairmenjpeg-03254.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/03/senate-new-chairmenjpeg-03254.jpg", "description": "A bipartisan group of 10 senators introduced legislation to repeal Obamacare's tax on medical devices, a long-expected move from the Republican-controlled Congress because Democrats in certain states", "card": "summary", "title": "Bipartisan Senate group files bill to repeal Obamacare tax on medical"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "Industry studies say the medical device tax cost the sector more than 30,000 jobs in the first year alone.\nThe next attack on Obamacare is taking shape as a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill Tuesday to eliminate the medical device tax, despite new doubts about how harmful the tax really is.\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not the case.\u201dIt is unclear if Congress will be able to find money to offset the $29 billion in revenue the medical device tax is expected to bring in over the next decade, which would be lost in a repeal.\nDemocratic leaders have defended the tax, saying the manufacturers have more customers thanks to Obamacare, so they can afford to pay.\nSEE ALSO: House votes to exempt volunteer firefighters from Obamacare mandate\u201cA number of concerns have been raised about the effects of the tax on research and innovation in the medical device industry,\u201d the researchers wrote."}
