It\u2019s the near future, shortly after a new financial collapse, and Positron/Consilience \u2014 a gated community and a jail all in one \u2014 offers Charmaine and Stan the security of a comfortable middle-class existence, every other month; the inhabitants take turns being jailers living in houses and prisoners in cells.\n\nThis being a Margaret Atwood novel, things don\u2019t work out quite the way poor Stan and Charmaine hope, but the author of the dystopias \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and the Maddaddam trilogy (\u201cOryx and Crake,\u201d \u201cThe Year of the Flood\u201d and 2013\u2019s \u201cMaddaddam\u201d) insists she has just tweaked what\u2019s already happening in the world, including forced labor in prisons and the erosion of civil liberties \u2014 what she sees as the \u201ccreeping dictatorship\u201d at home in Canada under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who\u2019s up for election on Monday.\n\nOn the phone from a Brooklyn hotel, the ever-outspoken Atwood spoke with Salon about dystopias, robot sex and beer \u2014 in fiction and reality.\n\nYou\u2019re on the road at the moment \u2014 I guess there are limits to the use of the LongPen.\n\nI\u2019ve hardly touched ground in Toronto for a month. The LongPen [a remote autograph device which Atwood invented in 2004, in part to relieve authors from heavy touring] has gone over into business and banking \u2026 There was a period when people were saying everything was going to be digital, but apparently it isn\u2019t.\n\nAnother of your ventures, Noobroo, the fundraising beer inspired by the brewing in Maddaddam, is on shelves now in Ontario. Were you involved in the beer\u2019s creative process?\n\nYeah, [the brewers, Beau\u2019s] came over to our house with little bottles of powdered stuff, and then they had made a tea out of each of them, and then a blend. One of those ingredients tasted like old running shoes, but funnily enough, the blend that they made tasted better with the old running shoe thing than without it \u2014 it gave it a solidity.\n\nIn the \u201870s when we [Atwood and her partner, Graeme Gibson] lived on a farm, we made all different kinds of wine; we made beer. I think the biggest failure was the ginger beer. We let it go a little too long, and then we took the top off; the entire contents shot out like fireworks!\n\nHaving written dystopias before, it seems you\u2019ve outdone yourself with \u201cThe Heart Goes Last\u201d: It features a dystopia within a dystopia.\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 the outer dystopia is the thugs and living in your car; the inner dystopia is the Consilience/Positron project, so there are layers of utopianism and dystopianism, sort of like an Easter egg.\n\nDespite the darkness, there\u2019s a lot of humour in the book.\n\nIt is one of those kinds of literary constructions like \u201cA Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u201d in which it\u2019s funny for those watching but not for those to whom it\u2019s actually happening, and indeed when you come to think of comedy itself, that is very often true.\n\nWe laugh at others\u2019 misfortunes.\n\nWe do to a certain extent. If a person slips on a banana peel, it\u2019s funny. If they slip on the banana peel and break their neck, then it isn\u2019t.\n\nIn the Maddaddam books, a pandemic wipes out so much of humanity; you carefully set out the details, whereas in \u201cThe Heart Goes Last,\u201d the reason for society\u2019s collapse is rather vague.\n\nI think we pretty much do know what it was \u2014 it\u2019s the same thing that happened in 2008, so it\u2019s a financial collapse rather than a physical [one]. People did end up on their front lawns and living in their cars, and that is apparently ongoing.\n\nDo you see Positron/Consilience as a logical extension of current for-profit prisons?\n\nThe problem with for-profit prisons is that you need an endless supply of prisoners to make it profitable, so there\u2019s no incentive to make it such that criminality is actually reduced. Ultimately you want more criminality; at the very least, you want to be able to define criminality in such a way that enough people get put in prison so you can make a profit out of them. There\u2019s also a clause in the U.S. constitution that says you can\u2019t use slave labor \u2014 except when convicted criminals are involved. So all of that is going on right now; [the book offers] just a little twist on it.\n\nYou write about people who have the power to change others\u2019 lives by wiping out and changing data, which seems a relatively new development in literature \u2014\n\nForgery is very old. Think of it as a new form of forgery. What you\u2019re doing is altering perceived reality and substituting a false version of it, and that can have good uses. For instance, a lot of people wouldn\u2019t have escaped Nazi Germany if there hadn\u2019t been good forgers. So a world in which nothing like this could ever happen would be really claustrophobic. It\u2019s like any human tool: there\u2019s potential good uses and bad uses. It depends on who\u2019s got the power and what you think of those people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon spoke to the novelist about Stephen Harper, financial collapse, for-profit prisons and \"The Heart Goes Last\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood on our real-life dystopia: \u201cWhat really worries me is creeping dictatorship\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon spoke to the novelist about Stephen Harper, financial collapse, for-profit prisons and \"The Heart Goes Last\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood on our real-life dystopia: \u201cWhat really worries me is creeping dictatorship\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/margaret_atwood_on_our_real_life_dystopia_what_really_worries_me_is_creeping_dictatorship/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/margaret_atwood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon spoke to the novelist about Stephen Harper, financial collapse, for-profit prisons and \"The Heart Goes Last\"", "title": "Margaret Atwood on our real-life dystopia: \u201cWhat really worries me is creeping dictatorship\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/margaret_atwood.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mike Doherty", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Books, Canada, dystopian novels, Editor's Picks, Margaret Atwood, the heart goes last", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae8d\"", "article_summary": "Having written dystopias before, it seems you\u2019ve outdone yourself with \u201cThe Heart Goes Last\u201d: It features a dystopia within a dystopia.\nTopics: aol_on, Books, Canada, dystopian novels, Editor's Picks, Margaret Atwood, the heart goes last, Entertainment NewsThe down-on-their-luck protagonists of Margaret Atwood\u2019s new novel \u201cThe Heart Goes Last\u201d become fed up with living out of their car, so they move to a for-profit prison.\nOn the phone from a Brooklyn hotel, the ever-outspoken Atwood spoke with Salon about dystopias, robot sex and beer \u2014 in fiction and reality.\nAnother of your ventures, Noobroo, the fundraising beer inspired by the brewing in Maddaddam, is on shelves now in Ontario.\nIt\u2019s like any human tool: there\u2019s potential good uses and bad uses."}
