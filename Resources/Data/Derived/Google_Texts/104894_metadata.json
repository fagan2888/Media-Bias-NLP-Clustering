Also check out \"winners\" number 10 8 and 7\n\nErick Erickson has gravely betrayed conservatives everywhere.\n\nI wish I could say that I am surprised. I prayed I wouldn\u2019t have to write this, but here we are.\n\nHow can it be that Obamacare remains in effect despite Erickson\u2019s so-called opposition? Did he do anything to halt its advance beyond writing ineffectual blog posts \u201cdemanding\u201d that Republicans repeal the ACA? Did Erickson take advantage of the stunning political success that was the recent government shutdown to finally write the blog post that could have crippled the liberty-killing advance of Obamacare? No. He did not. This is, as I said, a grave betrayal, and a shocking dereliction of duty.\n\nIn fact, he and his entire band of cowards and sellouts remind me of, well, a gross word for a disgusting portion of the anatomy of ladies, who are gross. You know what I mean. A part that women have that I am deeply uncomfortable thinking about for some reason.\n\nThe establishment wants you to keep reading Erickson. They want you to close your eyes and ignore the truth and keep giving Erickson and RedState your email addresses.\n\nI\u2019m sick of excuses and I\u2019m sick of sniveling equivocations. This is it.\n\nErickson should know that conservatives like myself will now devote themselves to doing everything in their power to remove him from his blog, unless and until he starts showing some results, or my bosses tell me to lay off of him.\n\nThis might upset the hysterical abortion rights advocates, who rely on Erickson to regularly reveal the misogyny underlying the conservative movement\u2019s abortion position, but I don\u2019t care. The feminist Cult of Death will have to untwist their panties and find a new personification of toxic modern conservative masculinity.\n\nThey can definitely do better. With his soft physique and his inexplicable belief that \u201cblogger\u201d is an appropriate job for a man who has a family to feed and protect, Erickson represents the epitome of the modern beta male. Can you imagine an alpha male in the animal kingdom \u201cworking from home\u201d? Erickson is practically made of arugula.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our annual list is here!
