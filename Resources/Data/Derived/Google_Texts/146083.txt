A video featuring a 92-year-old man singing to his dying wife has recently gone viral after the couple’s granddaughter posted the footage online. The tear-jerking video is quickly warming hearts around the world, and in only a few days has already been viewed over a million times on YouTube.

Howard, 92, and his wife Laura, 93, have been married for 73 years, but it’s clear that their love has not faded over the years. The footage was captured by the couple’s granddaughter, Erin Solari, who explained that the song Howard sang, You’ll Never Know by Rosemary Clooney, is the couple’s “love song” and used to comfort Laura when Howard was away at war in WWII.

“At family gatherings, it was not uncommon for the two of them to sing this song together, each taking a verse and serenading the other,” Solari wrote on YouTube. “ In fact, after 50 years of marriage, they renewed their vows and performed this song as a duet for the entire family at the reception.”

Although Laura is now blinded by macular degeneration, she still gazes into her sweetheart’s eyes, and for a moment the couple seem lost in each other’s company. According to Solari, at the time the video was posted, her grandmother Laura was given only a week to live, but she has now been deemed well enough to return back home. She is still resting peacefully in her own bed, surrounded by her family’s love and is aware of the international fame her video has caused.
