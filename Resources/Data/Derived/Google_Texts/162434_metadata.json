I shared a desk with my boss, a voluptuous chatterbox who was bright, perky, and personable. She was the kind of woman whose cheeks you\u2019d always want to pinch.\n\nUnfortunately, our department director, a squirrelly little man with comically large glasses, often did just that. When she did something he liked, he would grab her face to show his approval, as if she were a child or a beloved pet.\n\nThe first time he did it, she was in front of students. The second time, she was in front of colleagues. When I recently asked her about it, she told me, \u201cI can remember who was there. I can remember exactly how uncomfortable it made me. It didn\u2019t actually hurt or anything. It was this moment where I simultaneously felt like an object and also like there was nothing I could do about it, so I should just let it happen.\u201d\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201cClassic cartoons are so much funnier with Ice T\u2019s voice\u201d\n\nOther friends recalled similar stories from work colleagues, acquaintances, family members, and strangers, in which men touched them without prior consent or approval. One example came from a former coworker who remembered \u201cwalking in a grocery store parking lot, wearing a skirt, and a man walked up to me, put his hand up my skirt, grabbed my ass, and then walked off.\u201d A writer I know reported a bizarre incident in which she was \u201cstanding at a bus stop [when] a guy rushed [her] and proceeded to kiss [her] foot before hopping on his bus and escaping.\u201d\n\nWhile these encounters happened between strangers, most women who told me they had experienced unwanted touching from a man said it had happened in a public place, such as a bar or the workplace. The perpetrator was usually someone they knew.\n\nIn an office environment, such unwanted touching constitutes sexual harassment (although a great number of women decline to report it, due to factors like social pressure or fear of workplace retaliation.) However, if you\u2019re a woman at a bus stop, or if you\u2019re picking up hummus at a grocery store, there aren\u2019t the same protections in place. If you\u2019re on stage presenting at the Oscars and a well-known celebrity starts petting your face, there\u2019s no obvious chain of command or boss to report it to.\n\nFor the audience, such moments could appear to be humorous. This man is harmless, they all laugh, and the Internet laughs right along with them. It\u2019s a shared inside joke that everyone is in on. He\u2019s just a \u201ccreepy uncle.\u201d He\u2019s not hurting anyone.\n\nOf course, the celebrity in question is John Travolta, who doubled down on becoming an Internet meme this week after he felt up Idina Menzel\u2019s face onstage at the Academy Awards. Menzel and Travolta appeared together to bury the hatchet over an incident last year, in which Travolta infamously flubbed the \u201cLet It Go\u201d singer\u2019s name, calling her \u201cAdele Dazeem.\u201d\n\nThe Internet immediately made a small moment into a viral sensation. Someone created a John Travolta Name Generator, in which the Saturday Night Fever star could mangle your name, too. Adele Dazeem even got her own Twitter account.\n\nSo when Travolta awkwardly touched Menzel\u2019s face at the Oscars this year, the Internet was bound to react as if the incident was intended to be comical. It was an indication that Travolta had become Hollywood\u2019s \u201ccreepy uncle.\u201d But no one saw the encounter for what it was: a moment of public sexual harassment.\n\nMore from The Daily Dot: \u201c\u201950 Fox News lies in 6 seconds\u2019 is the Daily Show\u2019s gift to the Internet\u201d\n\nIn fact, the face-touching wasn\u2019t even Travolta\u2019s only transgression that evening. On the red carpet, the star also kissed the side of Scarlett Johansson\u2019s face while he placed his hand around her waist. Photos show that Johansson was clearly uncomfortable with the gesture, her eyes glossing over as she stares into the distance. (Johansson, for her part, has been a good sport and defended him.) The moment should have been shocking and deeply troubling, but instead it got turned into a meme. You can find photos of John Travolta embracing Kanye West, the Statue of Liberty, and his own Hairspray character. How droll!\n\nThe lack of outcry beyond the requisite \u201cWow, what happened to John Travolta?\u201d shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone, especially in light of the recent coverage of Vice President Joe Biden embracing Stephanie Carter, the wife of the Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, during his swearing-in ceremony.\n\nAs the Daily Dot\u2019s own Miles Klee reported, \u201cBiden all but demanded that Carter\u2019s wife Stephanie stand near him so he could squeeze her shoulders, sniff her hair, and whisper in her ear.\u201d Klee further reminds us:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Viral videos of the vice president and \"Pulp Fiction\" star belie our troubling tolerance for sexual harrasment VIDEO", "title": "John Travolta, Joe Biden and why men touch women\u2019s bodies without asking", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Viral videos of the vice president and \"Pulp Fiction\" star belie our troubling tolerance for sexual harrasment VIDEO", "title": "John Travolta, Joe Biden and why men touch women\u2019s bodies without asking", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/john_travolta_joe_biden_and_why_men_touch_womens_bodies_without_asking_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-23-at-8.57.57-AM-1280x778.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Viral videos of the vice president and \"Pulp Fiction\" star belie our troubling tolerance for sexual harrasment VIDEO", "title": "John Travolta, Joe Biden and why men touch women\u2019s bodies without asking", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-02-23-at-8.57.57-AM-1280x778.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nico Lang", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Joe Biden, John Travolta, mantouching, Oscars, the daily dot, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "You can find photos of John Travolta embracing Kanye West, the Statue of Liberty, and his own Hairspray character.\nSomeone created a John Travolta Name Generator, in which the Saturday Night Fever star could mangle your name, too.\nTopics: Joe Biden, John Travolta, mantouching, Oscars, the daily dot, Video, Oscars News, News, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on The Daily DotWhen I started college, one of my first jobs was working the front desk at my university\u2019s admissions office.\nThe lack of outcry beyond the requisite \u201cWow, what happened to John Travolta?\u201d shouldn\u2019t be surprising to anyone, especially in light of the recent coverage of Vice President Joe Biden embracing Stephanie Carter, the wife of the Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, during his swearing-in ceremony.\nOf course, the celebrity in question is John Travolta, who doubled down on becoming an Internet meme this week after he felt up Idina Menzel\u2019s face onstage at the Academy Awards."}
