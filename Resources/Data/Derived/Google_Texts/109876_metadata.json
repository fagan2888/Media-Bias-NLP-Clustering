People don\u2019t automatically come beating to your door. We\u2019ve got to sell it, we\u2019ve got to reach out to the other side and where possible persuade. And I think there are times, there\u2019s no doubt about it where, you know, I think we have not been successful in going out there and letting people know what it is that we are trying to do and why this is the right direction. So there is a failure of politics there that we have got to improve on.\u201d\n\n3) On Obamacare difficulties, December 2013\n\n\u201cThe basic structure of that law is working despite all the problems \u2014 despite the website problems, despite the messaging problems. Despite all that, it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\n4) On the Affordable Care Act, November 2013\n\n\u201cI regret very much that what we intended to do \u2014 which is to make sure that everybody is moving into better plans because they want them, as opposed to because they\u2019re forced into it \u2014 that, you know, we weren\u2019t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place.\u201d\n\n5) On his Syria strategy, September 2013\n\n\u201cI think that folks here in Washington like to grade on style. And so had we rolled out something that was very smooth and disciplined and linear, they would have graded it well, even if it was a disastrous policy. We know that, because that\u2019s exactly how they graded the Iraq War until it ended up blowing up in our face.\u201d\n\n6) On first-term mistakes, July 2012\n\n\u201cThe mistake of my first term \u2013 couple of years \u2013 was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right. And that\u2019s important. But the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times \u2026 And in my first two years, I think the notion was, \u2018Well, he\u2019s been juggling and managing a lot of stuff, but where\u2019s the story that tells us where he\u2019s going?\u2019 And I think that was a legitimate criticism.\u201d\n\n7) On major regrets in his first term, July 2011\n\n\u201cOver the first two years, I was so focused on policy and, you know, getting the policy right, that sometimes I forgot part of my job is explaining to the American people why we\u2019re doing this policy and where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n8) On poor economic approval ratings, October 2010\n\n\u201cI think that one of the challenges we had two years ago was, we had to move so fast, we were in such emergency mode, that it was very difficult for us to spend a lot of time doing victory laps and advertising exactly what we were doing, because we had to move on to the next thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama frequently blames his policy problems on messaging rather than inherent flaws, a new SuperCut shows.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "President Obama frequently blames his policy problems on messaging rather than inherent flaws, a new SuperCut shows.
