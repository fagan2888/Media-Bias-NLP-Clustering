Former Republican Massachusetts Senator and presumed New Hampshire Senate candidate Scott Brown has hired several key campaign staffers ahead of his official campaign launch.

Brown announced Friday he had hired Colin Reed, formerly New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s spokesman, as his press secretary. Reed previously served as a spokesman for Brown during his Senate term and 2012 campaign.

“I’ve known Scott for more than four years. An opportunity to work with him again is something I couldn’t pass up. I am excited for the next seven months and a victory in November,” Reed said in a statement.

Last week, Brown also brought on Elizabeth Guyton as his communications director. Guyton was previously an aide to Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R., N.H.).

Brown has confirmed he is running and is expected to formally launch his campaign as early as this week.

He is holding his first major campaign fundraiser in Washington, D.C. on Monday.
