In Maine, that\u2019s the 13,704 residents who have chosen a health plan through either Anthem or nonprofit insurer Maine Community Health Options.\n\nBut another 3,236 Mainers who signed onto Healthcare.gov since October have learned they\u2019re possibly eligible for Medicaid, known as MaineCare here. Maine\u2019s not expanding the health insurance program for the poor under the ACA, so these are residents who theoretically qualify for the program now, but for whatever reason haven\u2019t already signed up. Healthcare.gov has categorized them as eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP, the Medicaid program for children.\n\nIn fact, many of those more than 3,000 Mainers likely are children, judging from a new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The report found that in states like Maine not expanding Medicaid, children account for the majority of uninsured people who are eligible for the program. Of the 11,000 uninsured Mainers who could sign up for MaineCare, 7,000, or nearly 63 percent, are children, the analysis found.\n\nThese aren\u2019t children who would qualify if Maine were to expand Medicaid, they\u2019re kids who lack health insurance and already qualify for MaineCare but aren\u2019t enrolled. Why is another question. Perhaps their parents aren\u2019t aware that their kids are eligible, or they have other reasons for not enrolling them.\n\nHealthcare.gov thinks this group of Mainers is eligible for MaineCare. The federal government sends their information \u2014 names, addresses, income levels, etc. \u2014 to the state, which would make the final determination and actually sign them up for MaineCare.\n\nBut according to Maine Department of Health and Human Services spokesman John Martins, the state isn\u2019t getting that information and can\u2019t sign people up.\n\n\u201cWe are still receiving files that are woefully inadequate in terms of making an eligibility determination,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nMaine DHHS hasn\u2019t received complete information for any enrollee, he said. With the exception of basic information such as names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, and addresses, the state has received few details about income levels or household makeup, Martins said. More than half of the individuals funneled through Healthcare.gov aren\u2019t even eligible for MaineCare, he said, based on their reported income, or they won\u2019t qualify in 2014 because the program is dropping coverage for childless adults.\n\n\u201cWe have also had data sent to us for consumers from other states, which clearly we should not have received,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMaine isn\u2019t the only state encountering this problem. Medicaid officials in other states say the files they\u2019re receiving \u201care riddled with errors and incomplete information,\u201d according to the Washington Post.\n\nI ran Martins\u2019 comments by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, but haven\u2019t received comment from them.\n\nMonday\u2019s enrollment report from U.S. HHS touches on the troubles in a footnote. \u201cQuality assurance continues on Medicaid assessments and determinations in advance of transfers to states and these figures might alter further based on that review,\u201d it reads.\n\nThe feds are sending the enrollment information to the states in something called a \u201cflat file,\u201d which lists people Healthcare.gov believes are eligible for Medicaid. As the Washington Post explains, the flat file was intended to give states a heads up on enrollment volumes, not to serve as a formal enrollment document.\n\n\u201cApplicants are notified that we are waiting for their application information to be sent to us from the feds in order to determine if they are eligible for MaineCare,\u201d Martins wrote. \u201cWe have written to people whose names and flat files we have received, explained that the letter they\u2019ve received from the feds could be confusing and have pointed them to our web site as a way for them to potentially apply for Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe feds will also call potential MaineCare enrollees and direct them to the web site, www.maine.gov/mymaineconnection, where people can be pre-screened for Medicaid, Martins said.\n\nOther health care advocates I\u2019ve spoken to also encourage potential MaineCare enrollees to contact the state directly, rather than through Healthcare.gov.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd691\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare.gov has categorized them as eligible for either Medicaid or CHIP, the Medicaid program for children.\nBut another 3,236 Mainers who signed onto Healthcare.gov since October have learned they\u2019re possibly eligible for Medicaid, known as MaineCare here.\n\u201cApplicants are notified that we are waiting for their application information to be sent to us from the feds in order to determine if they are eligible for MaineCare,\u201d Martins wrote.\nOther health care advocates I\u2019ve spoken to also encourage potential MaineCare enrollees to contact the state directly, rather than through Healthcare.gov.\nHealthcare.gov thinks this group of Mainers is eligible for MaineCare."}
