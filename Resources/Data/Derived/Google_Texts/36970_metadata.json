And some environmentalists say the administration has set its goals too low, not putting enough effort into passing significant climate legislation.\n\nObama has said he hopes to reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 17 percent by 2050. But experts say that's not enough to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming, nor does it address the problem posed by other greenhouse gases such as methane.\n\nAnd many of Obama's biggest climate successes have come from administrative executive action, not from the kind of substantive legislative efforts that were responsible for political wins like the Affordable Care Act, leaving them vulnerable to being rolled back.\n\nIf recent actions from the administration on methane leaks from fracking and on chemicals used in refrigeration are any clue, critics say they\u2019re worried that the last two years of the presidency may be filled with more lofty rhetoric without much legislative change.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s talked a lot about it, but his action on climate change has been just short of what really needs to happen,\u201d said Alison Auciello, an organizer with environmental group Food and Water Watch. \u201cHe certainly can do more than what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a call with reporters on Thursday, Obama\u2019s senior climate adviser, John Podesta, assured that Obama would go all in for action on climate change at the summit.\n\nNo treaties or other binding agreements are expected to be signed at this summit. It's being billed as a forum to talk about goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally ahead of a U.N. climate conference in Paris in 2015, where treaties and other agreements are more likely to be signed.\n\nStill, Podesta said, \u201cWe are taking this summit seriously.\u201d\n\nBut for environmentalists, the words offered little hope \u2014 particularly since Podesta also said that the president planned to use the summit as an opportunity to \u201cshowcase\u201d actions the U.S. has taken.\n\nObama, however, has had some noteworthy climate successes.\n\nIn 2011 his administration announced new fuel efficiency standards that would force car manufacturers to make cars that average over 50 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nThat was followed in 2013 by a directive from Obama to the Environmental Protection Agency to limit the amount of carbon dioxide new power plants may produce. The order will require all future power plants to get CO2 permits from the EPA and will effectively kill the building of any new coal-fired power plants. Added to those rule changes are a set of new regulations proposed by the EPA in June that seek to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by existing power plants by 30 percent.\n\nBut because the sweeping changes were made by executive action, before the rules become final, they\u2019ll go through public comment periods and will likely be challenged in several courts by the energy industry.\n\n\u201cThere are already lawsuits filed challenging it,\u201d said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \u201cIf any of them succeed, that\u2019s a major problem, because if the regulations are not yet finalized, the next president could readily halt them.\u201d\n\nAnd even if they finalized, executive actions are amendable or reversible by future administrations.\n\nBut, Gerrard said, a deadlocked Congress has meant the Obama administration has been relegated to using executive action as well as pursuing voluntary measures when it comes to environmental issues.\n\nThat tactic could be seen last week, when the administration announced that instead of attempting to pass a law to limit hydrofluorocarbons \u2014 highly polluting chemicals used in refrigeration and air conditioning \u2014 it instead convinced industry leaders to voluntarily phase out their use.\n\nIt\u2019s the same maneuver the EPA is now using to curb methane emissions at hydraulic fracturing sites and the strategy Obama has used in talking about climate change action on an international level \u2014 signaling that the U.S. may not be ready to sign a significant climate change treaty anytime soon and will instead push for nonbinding accords at the U.N.\n\n\u201cWhen the House flipped in 2010, that rendered all climate legislation impossible,\u201d said Gerrard. \u201cCongress hasn\u2019t even passed a major piece of environmental legislation since 1990. We\u2019re stuck with the legislation of a previous generation.\u201d\n\nStill, environmentalists say Obama has squandered the opportunity to use his bully pulpit to come out more forcefully against environmentally controversial projects. He\u2019s waffled on whether the Keystone XL pipeline will be approved and has allowed cheap coal leasing in Montana\u2019s Powder River Basin.\n\nPerhaps most galling to environmentalists, Obama has also offered a full-throated defense of the natural gas industry, saying that ramping up natural gas and oil production is necessary to support jobs in rural, struggling regions and helps make the U.S. less dependent on energy from abroad. His critics say that stance makes it hard for him to be a climate leader on the world stage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s recognized the imperative of addressing climate change but also presided over the biggest oil and gas boom in decades,\u201d said Abigail Dillen, vice president for litigation for climate and energy at San Francisco\u2013based advocacy group EarthJustice. \u201cIf he can come to grips with that disconnect, then that would strengthen his hand in these negotiations immeasurably.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama won't be signing any treaties at Tuesday's summit, environmentalists say it at least presents an opportunity for him to show the U.S. is willing to lead the rest of the world when it comes to climate. But some are worried this year will be a repeat of his 2009 Copenhagen climate conference performance. That year, several major carbon polluters like China and India indicated they were willing to reduce CO2 output if the U.S. led the way, but Obama opted for a nonbinding pact to address climate change without any clearly defined goals.\n\nTuesday will be a test of whether Obama has revamped his reserved climate strategy since then.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking Obama to reinvent the wheel,\u201d said Sandra Steingraber, an environmental science professor at Ithaca College and an anti-fracking activist. \u201cWe\u2019re just asking him to pay attention to people who\u2019ve already come up with the solutions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ahead of a speech at the UN, green groups say Obama needs to re-evaluate his environmental strategy", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/22/obama-climate-change.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/9/22/obama-climate-change/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Obama_climate_091914.1411406698353.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Ahead of a speech at the UN, green groups say Obama needs to re-evaluate his environmental strategy", "title": "Environmentalists hope Obama will take stronger stance at climate summit"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/9/22/obama-climate-change/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Obama_climate_091914.1411406698353.jpg", "description": "Ahead of a speech at the UN, green groups say Obama needs to re-evaluate his environmental strategy", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Environmentalists hope Obama will take stronger stance at climate summit"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Climate Change, Barack Obama, United Nations, Environment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe15f3\"", "article_summary": "The order will require all future power plants to get CO2 permits from the EPA and will effectively kill the building of any new coal-fired power plants.\nIn a call with reporters on Thursday, Obama\u2019s senior climate adviser, John Podesta, assured that Obama would go all in for action on climate change at the summit.\nAhead of a daylong climate summit scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, a portrait of a conflicted Obama administration has emerged.\n\u201cThere are already lawsuits filed challenging it,\u201d said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.\nWe\u2019re stuck with the legislation of a previous generation.\u201dStill, environmentalists say Obama has squandered the opportunity to use his bully pulpit to come out more forcefully against environmentally controversial projects."}
