The top 10 fears found by the poll are listed below:\n\nCorruption of government officials Cyber-terrorism Corporate tracking of personal information Terrorist attacks Government tracking of personal information Bio-warfare Identity theft Economic collapse Running out of money in the future Credit card fraud\n\nThe university reported, \u201cOn average, Americans\u2019 fears were the highest in the domains of man-made disasters, such as terrorist attacks, followed by technology and then the government\u2014such as corruption and Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople often fear what they cannot control,\u201d Dr. Christopher Bader, the survey lead, told the university, \u201cand technology and the future of our economy are two aspects of life that Americans find very unpredictable at the moment.\u201d\n\nChapman University surveyed respondents on a variety of topics, 88 in total, which ranged from the government to personal anxieties. The report states that the data was then compiled into five basic categories: personal fears, acting out of fear, natural disasters, paranormal fears, and domains of fear.\n\nThe \u201cActing out of Fear\u201d category was added as a new element for this year\u2019s survey. According to the survey, about one-fourth, 22.6 percent, of Americans voted for a specific candidate out of fear and 10.5 percent purchased a gun out of fear.\n\nThe strongest relationship in the new category was fear of the government in correlation with buying a gun. The researchers also found that activities such as sending children to private schools and investing in a home security system were based on fear.\n\nFifty-five percent of those surveyed fear they \u201cwill experience a natural or manmade disaster,\u201d and 86 percent believe a 72-hour emergency kit would help their chances of survival in the wake of an event. However, 72 percent of respondents have not tried to compile an emergency kit.\n\nSurvey researcher Dr. Ann Gordon told the university, \u201cThe number one excuse given by Americans for not owning an emergency kit is that they expect first responders to come to their aid immediately\u2014this is an unrealistic belief in the wake of a natural disaster.\u201d\n\nThe survey also revealed that a number of respondents believe in the paranormal world. In fact, 41.4 percent believe places can be haunted by spirits and 20.3 percent believe \u201caliens visited Earth in our ancient past.\u201d\n\nRespondents with the largest amount of belief in paranormal activity possessed these traits: low levels of church attendance, non-white, Catholic, no college degree, female, unmarried and living in the Northeast.\n\nThe survey used a random sample consisting of 1,541 English-speaking Americans over the age of 18.
