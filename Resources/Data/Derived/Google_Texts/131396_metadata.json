The FOP insists all the officers involved in Gray\u2019s death in custody discharged their duties to protect the public that day. \u201cNot one of the officers involved in this tragic situation left home in the morning with the anticipation that someone with whom they interacted would not go home that night,\u201d wrote Gene Ryan, the FOP president. \u201cNot one of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray.\u201d\n\nRyan brought up Mosby\u2019s husband, who represents the neighborhood where Gray was apprehended by police, saying his political future, \u201cfor better or worse,\u201d would be tied to her investigation of the officers involved in Gray\u2019s death. Probably not the conflict of interest Councilman Mosby expected when his wife won the election last year. Unmentioned by the union were Mosby\u2019s other family relations\u2014a mother, father, and grandfather who were cops. Maybe it\u2019s useful in cases where the state\u2019s attorney would settle for taxpayer money to the victims and the brutalizers return to the streets, as has seemed to be the standard process. The union also cited Mosby\u2019s relationship with Gray family William Murphy, a prominent trial lawyer who narrated the video \u201c10 Rules for Dealing With Police,\u201d as well as the lead prosecutor\u2019s \u201cconnections with members of the local media.\u201d\n\nBut in principle, Ryan\u2019s correct. An independent prosecutor should investigate all questionable police incidents, not just this one. Ryan refers to \u201clitigation\u201d related to this incident in which some reporters might have to testify. So appointing an independent prosecutor, should she, for example, produce even heftier charges, could lead to litigation too. But the important question is: where do police get the privileges masquerading as rights that offer all these avenues for litigation and appeal? Everyone deserves due process, even the cops in the middle of this. But what part of the Constitution ties a cop\u2019s privilege to carry a gun and enforce the law to the due process afforded him and the rest of us? The union has every right to write an open letter to the state\u2019s attorney. But cops shouldn\u2019t have an inherent right to their job.\n\nPlenty of reasons why, maybe, cops shouldn\u2019t have unions.\n\nFlashback: Before some Baltimore protests turned violent, the police union compared them to a \u201clynch mob.\u201d\n\nFull letter, below the jump.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Union wants independent prosecutor, cites relationships with lawyers associated with the defense, as well as  husband\u2019s seat on the city council", "title": "Baltimore Police Union Open Letter to State\u2019s Attorney: \u2018Not one of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray\u2019", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/01/baltimore-police-union-open-letter-to-st", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1430507929665.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Union wants independent prosecutor, cites relationships with lawyers associated with the defense, as well as  husband\u2019s seat on the city council", "title": "Baltimore Police Union Open Letter to State\u2019s Attorney: \u2018Not one of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray\u2019", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1430507929665.jpg", "creator": "@edkrayewski", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Police Abuse", "published_time": "2015-05-01T19:32:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ed-krayewski"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "The FOP insists all the officers involved in Gray\u2019s death in custody discharged their duties to protect the public that day.\n\u201cNot one of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray.\u201dRyan brought up Mosby\u2019s husband, who represents the neighborhood where Gray was apprehended by police, saying his political future, \u201cfor better or worse,\u201d would be tied to her investigation of the officers involved in Gray\u2019s death.\nThe union has every right to write an open letter to the state\u2019s attorney.\nFlashback: Before some Baltimore protests turned violent, the police union compared them to a \u201clynch mob.\u201dFull letter, below the jump.\n\u201cNot one of the officers involved in this tragic situation left home in the morning with the anticipation that someone with whom they interacted would not go home that night,\u201d wrote Gene Ryan, the FOP president."}
