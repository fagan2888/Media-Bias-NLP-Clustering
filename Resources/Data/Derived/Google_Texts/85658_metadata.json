I cut his hair. I kept a list of the medications he was taking.\u201d\n\nThe nurses at the hospitals took notice, nudging Alcantara to consider entering the field.\n\nBut it was his father\u2019s last wish before he died on Jan. 29, 2011, that convinced Alcantara to pursue the career.\n\n\u201cI promised him before he died that I would be a nurse,\u201d he said.\n\nAlcantara enrolled in the nursing program at Lake-Sumter State College and graduated last month with an associate degree in nursing. After taking the National Council Licensure Examination this month, Alcantara plans to take a position at The Villages Regional Hospital in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nHe said the profession keeps him humble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pride-swallowing endeavor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s being able to communicate with people. When you are taking care of people, they are at the most vulnerable moment in their life, and you are there to support them.\u201d\n\nBut locally and nationally, officials say not enough people like Carlos Alcantara are answering the call to become nurses as the demand continues to outpace the number of people venturing into the profession.\n\nHere, in the midst of National Nurses Week, health care officials reflect on the critical role nurses play in the health care field and worry about the erosion of quality care if the shortage continues.\n\nA shortage\n\nRichard Pearce, chief nursing officer and director of critical care and emergency services at Florida Hospital Waterman, said there has been a shortage of nurses throughout his 40-year career.\n\nBut in recent years, the shortage has grown more significant, he said.\n\n\u201cWe are adding new nurses to the population that we are seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe difficulty is the demand for us to provide those services is increasing even more rapidly.\u201d\n\nFive years ago, Waterman was serving 130-140 patients a day, and now, that number has increased to 180-200, Pearce said.\n\nHe said the health care field is looking for nurses with more skill sets, also adding to the shortage.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult for a new graduate to walk out of school and get a job in a specialty department,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to have experience before they get to the areas.\u201d\n\nThere are an estimated 450 nurses in patient care at the hospital, Pearce said. Of those, the hospital is limited in the number of graduates it can hire, averaging 10 twice a year.\n\n\u201cThe biggest focus is trying to recruit and retain experienced nurses,\u201d he said.\n\nUSA Today reported in 2014 that the \u201crecent recession made it more difficult for entry-level nurses to find work as more experienced nurses put off retirement and stayed in the job force.\u201d\n\nThere are 50 nursing vacancies at Waterman, but that number fluctuates week to week, Pearce said. The Florida Center for Nursing reported an estimated 9,111 vacant nursing positions nationwide in 2014.\n\nSouth Lake Hospital also faces a nursing shortage, according to Paul Johns, the hospital\u2019s chief operations officer.\n\n\u201cOur main concern is how to attract and retain nurses,\u201d Johns said. \u201cThere is only a certain number of nurses graduating. There is a demand, but there isn\u2019t the supply there.\u201d\n\nThe nursing shortage does impact patients at times, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen the ER is getting filled up and you need to start admitting patients to the floors and you don\u2019t have the necessary staffing, it is hard to admit faster, which means they stay in the ER longer,\u201d he said. \u201cOutside of physicians, nurses are the core of the hospital. They are the first and the last people that our patients see in terms of personnel.\u201d\n\nThe American Association of Colleges of Nursing reported the \u201cU.S. is projected to experience a shortage of registered nurses that is expected to intensify as Baby Boomers age and the need for health care grows. Compounding the problem is the fact that nursing schools across the country are struggling to expand capacity to meet the rising demand for care given the national move toward health care reform.\u201d\n\nCynthia Griffin, LSSC director of nursing, said that is an issue at the college.\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to grow the program,\u201d she said. \u201cOne factor of availability is qualified faculty. They must have a master\u2019s degree in nursing. There is a shortage of that availability.\u201d\n\nBut she said the majority of graduates do find positions in the field.\n\nChallenges\n\nHealth officials said the new Affordable Care Act does not have a direct impact on nurses, but the acuity level of patients does affect a nurse\u2019s profession.\n\n\u201cPatients are sicker than they were in the past,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cPatients 20 to 30 years ago that would not have survived are here today.\u201d\n\nGriffin added that today\u2019s patient is more savvy and knowledgeable.\n\n\u201cPatient satisfaction is a big concern,\u201d she said. \u201cThe hospitals have discharged patients complete satisfaction surveys. If they do not receive positive scores, it can affect the hospital\u2019s reimbursement rates for Medicare. The (nurses) are really providing patients that satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThe training at LSSC is designed to get students ready to deliver the care patients need and want.\n\nThe program required Alcantara to take part in clinical training at hospitals, where he spent 10 hours a week with patients.\n\nDuring his final semester, he completed his practicum, where he saw patients at the hospital under the supervision of a nurse for a month.\n\nAlcantara was assigned to The Villages Regional Hospital\u2019s ICU.\n\n\u201cMy first day in the ICU I witnessed three deaths,\u201d he said.\n\nBut as he learned the protocols and got to know the patients and the families, he grew to love working in the department.\n\nAlthough many of the patients are not conscious in the ICU, Alcantara said he believes they can hear him, and he always speaks to them. He remembers when nurses would not speak to his father when he couldn\u2019t speak, and he promised not to do the same.\n\n\u201cI always speak to the patient,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are the ones receiving care.\u201d\n\nThe job requires patience, and Alcantara said he takes it in stride when he gets the brunt of a patient\u2019s anger.\n\n\u201cI am a former bartender and bouncer,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not afraid of people getting mad at me. I laugh it off.\u201d\n\nHe said he also always seeks to inform the patient.\n\n\u201cFear is the biggest challenge when you come to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way to conquer fear is with knowledge.\u201d\n\nAlcantara said the hardest aspect of working in the ICU is not death but not always being able to help alleviate people\u2019s suffering.\n\n\u201cHe has a very sensitive side,\u201d said Nicole Tinny, an assistant professor of nursing at Lake-Sumter who taught Alcantara. \u201cHe is that big guy that wants to give everyone that security and comfort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Commercial", "description": "Carlos Alcantara never planned to become a nurse.", "title": "Hospital officials: Nursing shortages an acute problem", "url": "http://www.dailycommercial.com/news/article_2b8e3f1c-2c25-5ce3-83a1-1ad7faab7142.html", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/dailycommercial.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/71/7712cf46-8297-51cd-933e-8a7b0498a596/554d4969dcdc0.preview-620.jpg?resize=620%2C411", "height": 411}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailycommercial", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Carlos Alcantara never planned to become a nurse.", "fb": {"app_id": 108599415991304}, "keywords": "nurse,lake-sumter state college,florida hospital waterman,the villages regional hospital,lake_county,leesburg,news,editors_pick", "google-site-verification": "h_JIwo5TKFCMaJN3XKwQEjqiSRq1nDT50zFNlwpyIqo", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "nurse,lake-sumter state college,florida hospital waterman,the villages regional hospital,lake_county,leesburg,news,editors_pick"}, "article_summary": "South Lake Hospital also faces a nursing shortage, according to Paul Johns, the hospital\u2019s chief operations officer.\nThere is a demand, but there isn\u2019t the supply there.\u201dThe nursing shortage does impact patients at times, he said.\nAlcantara enrolled in the nursing program at Lake-Sumter State College and graduated last month with an associate degree in nursing.\n\u201cThey have to have experience before they get to the areas.\u201dThere are an estimated 450 nurses in patient care at the hospital, Pearce said.\nThe (nurses) are really providing patients that satisfaction.\u201dThe training at LSSC is designed to get students ready to deliver the care patients need and want."}
