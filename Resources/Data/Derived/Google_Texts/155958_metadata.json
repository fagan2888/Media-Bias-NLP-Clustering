She was taken to Penobscot County Jail and interviewed, Leonard said.\n\nVeazie police Officer Roger Hershey was sitting in his cruiser across from Veazie Congregational Church on Route 2 around 3:45 p.m. Wednesday when he saw a brown Saturn with an expired registration traveling toward Bangor, police said.\n\nHershey turned to follow and attempted to pull over the vehicle, but Spencer reportedly accelerated to more than 60 mph in a 35 mph zone. Hershey pursued the driver onto Mount Hope Avenue and then onto Hogan Road, where she narrowly missed striking another vehicle in the intersection, according to police.\n\nThe driver proceeded to weave in and out of traffic, making her way to I-95, where she turned left and began heading south.\n\nShe reportedly continued to dodge other vehicles, speeding up to 110 mph on the busy highway. At that point, around the time the pursuit reached the bridge that passes over the Kenduskeag Stream, Hershey decided to call off his pursuit to prevent a serious crash.\n\nState police also chased Spencer, but called off their I-95 pursuit, also fearing a crash and knowing that the driver was identified.\n\nAt some point after the chase, Spencer made her way back to Veazie, where she spent the night.\n\nLeonard credited Hershey for ending his pursuit when he did.\n\n\u201cHe made the right decision,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cHe was able to physically identify, and we knew at some point we\u2019d be able to arrest the suspect without jeopardizing anyone\u2019s safety.\u201d\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the day of Spencer\u2019s arrest. She was arrested Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "VEAZIE, Maine \u2014 Veazie police arrested a Hermon woman Thursday morning, the day after she allegedly led officers from Veazie and Maine State Police on a dangerous high-speed pursuit from Route 2 to Interstate 95 in Bangor.Katie Spencer, 30, faces a lengthy list of charges including two counts each of [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "VEAZIE, Maine \u2014 Veazie police arrested a Hermon woman Thursday morning, the day after she allegedly led officers from Veazie and Maine State Police on a dangerous high-speed pursuit from Route 2 to Interstate 95 in Bangor.
