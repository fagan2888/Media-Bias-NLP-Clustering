A 7-year-old girl who was reported missing Saturday in Ardmore was found Sunday, police said.

An Amber Alert was issued around 8:40 p.m. Saturday, but was canceled Sunday after the girl was found.

KAKE News is no longer identifying the Amber Alert victim because the suspect is expected to be charged with first-degree rape and kidnapping. Ardmore Police said Fount Duston was arrested in Marietta at 9:40 a.m. after the girl and the suspect were found at a home.

Police said a tip from the public led them to the Duston and girl.

The girl was in good condition, but was being checked out at a medical facility, according to police.

Duston was taken to the Carter County Jail.

More details are expected later this evening.
