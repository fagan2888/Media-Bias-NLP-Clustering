They garner the soft smiles of women of all ages, melting hearts with their seemingly out-of-place ability to nurture. The fact is, times are changing when it comes to family dynamics: more and more men choose to be stay-at-home dads, or working fathers who split home duties with their wives.\n\nMore women are in the workforce than ever before, all while balancing kids, cooking, cleaning, and everything else it takes to be a functional adult with offspring. And while it was often assumed that women were the ones who struggled to put their needs first when they were raising kids, a new study shows that fathers have the same exact problem.\n\nIt\u2019s not just women who are working the double shift \u2014 the full-time, high-powered job in addition to taking care of kids and home. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re male or female anymore: if you\u2019re in your 30s and 40s, your schedule is going to be jam-packed. If you want to stay fit, bring in the bacon, as well as spend quality time with your family, you\u2019re going to have a difficult time, whether you\u2019re the matriarch or the patriarch of the family.\n\nThe study, published in BioMed Central Public Health, focused on the responsibilities of fathers as gender roles continue to shift in society, as well as its link to the overall physical activity and fitness of dads. \u201cA decline or lack of exercise among working parents has mostly been recognized as a female issue,\u201d Emily Mailey, assistant professor of kinesiology at Kansas State University and lead researcher of the study, said in the press release. \u201cThe ethic of care theory \u2014 that females have been socialized to meet everyone else\u2019s needs before their own \u2014 explains why women feel guilty when they take time to exercise, though the same principle hasn\u2019t been studied for fathers.\u201d\n\nThe research team found that fathers reported feeling more guilty about exercise than women did, seeing it as a selfish act. In addition, fathers also felt guilty about not spending enough time with their spouses. \u201cThat really didn\u2019t come up for women,\u201d Mailey said. \u201cThe men felt guilty about exercising after the kids go to bed because that would be time they could spend with their wives.\u201d\n\nWhile both males and females reported feeling somewhat guilty when they took time to exercise \u2014 seeing it as a \u201cselfish\u201d time suck that took them away from their kids or other duties \u2014 Mailey says that active parents were more likely to reconcile the idea of exercise with their other duties: \u201cActive parents were able to see exercise as something that contributed to the good of the family and that was not at odds with being good parents,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a result, they felt less guilty about taking time to exercise and were more apt to prioritize physical activity because they valued the benefits.\u201d\n\nThat being said, whether you\u2019re a stay-at-home dad or a female housewife \u2014 or if you\u2019re both working parents with equal duties at home \u2014 don\u2019t neglect your own needs for exercise. They might just complement your ability to take care of your family.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stay at home dads, parents physical activity, exercise", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Both mothers and fathers feel guilty when they choose to exercise instead of spending time with their family.", "title": "Putting Work And Family First, Many Parents Skip Their Workouts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/finding-time-exercise-hard-both-moms-and-dads-work-and-family-usually-come-first-306824", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/11/dad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Both mothers and fathers feel guilty when they choose to exercise instead of spending time with their family.", "title": "Putting Work And Family First, Many Parents Skip Their Workouts", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/finding-time-exercise-hard-both-moms-and-dads-work-and-family-usually-come-first-306824", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/11/dad.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/11/dad.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-10-11T16:39:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-11T16:44:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Both mothers and fathers feel guilty when they choose to exercise instead of spending time with their family."}, "article_summary": "If you want to stay fit, bring in the bacon, as well as spend quality time with your family, you\u2019re going to have a difficult time, whether you\u2019re the matriarch or the patriarch of the family.\nThe fact is, times are changing when it comes to family dynamics: more and more men choose to be stay-at-home dads, or working fathers who split home duties with their wives.\nThey garner the soft smiles of women of all ages, melting hearts with their seemingly out-of-place ability to nurture.\nIt\u2019s not just women who are working the double shift \u2014 the full-time, high-powered job in addition to taking care of kids and home.\n\u201cA decline or lack of exercise among working parents has mostly been recognized as a female issue,\u201d Emily Mailey, assistant professor of kinesiology at Kansas State University and lead researcher of the study, said in the press release."}
