IT'S COMMON FOR TOBACCO USERS TO BE TAXED BY THEIR EMPLOYER. KOAT ANCHOR TODD KURTZ HAS MORE ON THE CHANGING WORLD FOR ANYONE WHO SMOKES. SMOKERS HAVE BEEN TAXED IN THE LAST DECADE. THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR A PACK OF SMOKES IN 2005 WAS $3.88 IN NEW MEXICO. GO TO THE STORE TODAY AND YOU'LL PAY $6.17 FOR THAT SAME PACK. THAT'S MINOR COMPARED TO WHAT ELSE IT COULD COST YOU -- LIKE A JOB. 21 STATES HAVE LAWS THAT ALLOW HEALTHCARE COMPANIES TO REJECT JOB APPLICANTS IF THEY USE TOBACCO. PRESBYTERIAN PUSHED FOR A SIMILAR LAW FOR OUR STATE -- IT WAS REJECTED AT THE ROUNDHOUSE, BUT THE HEALTH CARE COMPANY WILL TRY AGAIN NEXT YEAR. DR DENISE GONZALES -- MEDICAL DIRECTOR --it's very important, it ties with our mission and with our culture of health. PRESBYTERIAN IS ENFORCING A SURCHARGE. IF AN EMPLOYEE USES TOBACCO -- THE COMPANY TAKES 40 DOLLARS OUT OF EVERY ONE OF THEIR PAYCHECKS. DR DENISE GONZALES -- MEDICAL DIRECTOR --Presbyterian as a healthcare organization really needs to be a role model we need to be able to tell people that smoking and tobacco use are not consistent with our mission. WE ASKED SMOKERS IF COMPANIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE 40 DOLLARS OUT OF A PAYCHECK. not at all, but should they be able to tax 5 dollars a pack? they do it. i still think it's ridiculous to be taxed a little bit more now on your habit. SOT i don't think it's right because we all have the freedom to smoke or not smoke. IT'S NOT JUST PRESBYTERIAN . TOBACCO USERS AT LOVELACE AND UNM-HOSPITAL HAVE TO PAY MORE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE. IT'S NOT JUST HEALTHCARE COMPANIES -- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT ALLOWS ANY EMPLOYER TO \"TAX\" TOBACCO USERS -- AS LONG AS THEY ALSO OFFER THEM A FREE QUITTING PROGRAM. TODD KURTZ KOAT ACTION 7 NEWS. ACCORDING TO OUR PARTNERS AT THE JOURNAL -- PRESBYTERIAN HAD 860 EMPLOYEES WHO USE TOBACCO. 600 DECIDED TO KEEP USING AND ARE PAYING THE 40 DOLLARS PER PAY CHECK. THE OTHER 260 OPTED FOR THE FREE", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 22:38:39 MST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "og": {"site_name": "KOAT", "description": "Smoking can be dangerous, but also expensive.
