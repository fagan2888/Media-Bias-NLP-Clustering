Their efforts are drawing praise from the Obama administration.\n\n\"They're very excited about getting the work done and have great strategies in mind,\" said Kathleen Arculeta, director of the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nArchuleta was in San Antonio to take part in the kick-off campaign. Open enrollment begins this Saturday Nov. 15.\n\nCopyright 2014 by KSAT - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/11/12/enroll-sa-kicks-of-health-care-enrollment-campaign-1415817176596_24798_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Paul Venema", "description": "There are more than 150,000 people in the San Antonio area without health insurance, according to  Enroll S", "author": "Paul Venema", "og": {"site_name": "KSAT", "description": "There are more than 150,000 people in the San Antonio area without health insurance, according to  Enroll S", "title": "Enroll SA kicks off health care enrollment campaign", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/enroll-sa-kicks-off-health-care-enrollment-campaign", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/11/12/enroll-sa-kicks-of-health-care-enrollment-campaign-1415817176596_24798_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "<p>There are more than 150,000 people in the San Antonio area without health insurance, according to <a adhocenable=false href=http://www.enrollsa.com/ target=_blank>Enroll S", "title": "Enroll SA kicks off health care enrollment campaign", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/news/enroll-sa-kicks-off-health-care-enrollment-campaign", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/11/12/enroll-sa-kicks-of-health-care-enrollment-campaign-1415817176596_24798_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@ksatnews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-12T18:34:00+0000", "sailthru.title": "Enroll SA kicks off health care enrollment campaign", "sailthru.tags": "News,News,Health,Community,Local", "fb": {"app_id": 362904920453016}, "google-site-verification": "saKN_Rxj3pYzy5TY3_Llko_4hA3OUGCoya0vO4STuSc", "keywords": "News,News,Health,Community,Local", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2014-11-12T18:34:00+0000", "modified_time": "2014-11-13T00:50:58+0000", "author": "http://www.ksat.com/author/pvenema"}, "news_keywords": "Enroll SA kicks off health care enrollment campaign", "content_id": 73913233, "sailthru.description": "<p>There are more than 150,000 people in the San Antonio area without health insurance, according to <a adhocenable=false href=http://www.enrollsa.com/ target=_blank>Enroll S", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2014/11/12/enroll-sa-kicks-of-health-care-enrollment-campaign-1415817176596_24798_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "\"I know there's a lot of political controversy whether you're for Affordable Health Care or whether you're not,\" he said.\nSAN ANTONIO - There are more than 150,000 people in the San Antonio area without health insurance, according to Enroll SA, a coalition of health care professionals including hospitals, county and city officials, and grassroots and nonprofit organizations.\nDuring a rally on Main Plaza Wednesday morning, the group kicked off the second open enrollment period of the Affordable Care Act by announcing a goal of 47,000 enrollees.\nArchuleta was in San Antonio to take part in the kick-off campaign.\nOpen enrollment begins this Saturday Nov. 15."}
