Johnson finished 7-for-24 for 75 yards with two interceptions. He was sacked four times and rushed 11 times for minus-12 yards.\n\nJohnson entered the game with more than 2,700 total yards and 32 touchdowns.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re a great team. Great defense, great offense. They got the complete package.\u201d\n\nJohnson tweaked his ankle in the first quarter and was visibly injured but remained in the game. Johnson was replaced by freshman Darrian McNeal in the fourth quarter. McNeal finished with a team-best 94 rushing yards.\n\n\u201cIt bothered me all game and really threw our offense off,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be mobile. I had to sit in the pocket.\u201d\n\nCentral running back Dalvin Cook, meanwhile, scorched the Hawks\u2019 defense for 226 yards and four touchdowns on 19 carries, while receiver Da\u2019Vante Phillips caught four passes for 92 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the first 14, maybe even 21 points was on us, the defense,\u201d said Armwood senior safety Kyle Gibson, who had two interceptions. \u201cIt was blown plays and missed tackles. We would have them, and a lot of their touchdowns were after tackles. So if you want to blame, you can blame it on us. But overall, I felt we played good, fought hard and we didn\u2019t lay down.\u201d\n\nSatuday\u2019s loss marked the most points allowed by Armwood this season.\n\n\u201cNothing happened that we weren\u2019t expecting,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cWe knew we were going to get a big dose of Dalvin Cook and their offensive line. As good as we are against the run, the defensive line made so much space for Dalvin and Dalvin hit it hard.\u201d\n\nArmwood was playing for the program\u2019s third state championship. The Hawks have played in six state title games since 2003 and in 2011, they defeated Central in the 6A championship 40-31. That title game has since been vacated from the Florida High School Athletic Association record books after it was proven both teams used ineligible players who were found to have made invalid transfers into the schools.\n\n\u201cOur kids will learn from this,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cOur coaching staff will get it right, too.\u201d\n\nSaid Johnson: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to feel the same way next year. We\u2019re going to be back. We\u2019re going to be back next year.\u201d\n\nnwilliams@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7305\n\nTwitter: @NickWilliamsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 14 Dec 2013 15:52:08 -0400", "Description": "The Hawks were overmatched Saturday in a 52-7 defeat in the Class 6-A final at the Citrus Bowl.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "The Hawks were overmatched Saturday in a 52-7 defeat in the Class 6-A final at the Citrus Bowl.", "title": "Miami Central overwhelms Armwood in state title game", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/preps/miami-central-overwhelms-armwood-52-7-at-6a-title-game-20131214/", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131214/ARTICLE/131219560/EP/1/2/EP-131219560.jpg", "height": 928}, "updated_time": "2013-12-15T07:50:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "The Hawks were overmatched Saturday in a 52-7 defeat in the Class 6-A final at the Citrus Bowl.", "title": "Miami Central overwhelms Armwood in state title game", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20131214/ARTICLE/131219560/AR/0/AR-131219560.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-12-14T15:52:08Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-12-15T07:50:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s what it is.\u201dCentral (13-1), which won its second straight state title and whose only loss is to consensus No.\nThe Hawks have played in six state title games since 2003 and in 2011, they defeated Central in the 6A championship 40-31.\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great team.\nThat title game has since been vacated from the Florida High School Athletic Association record books after it was proven both teams used ineligible players who were found to have made invalid transfers into the schools.\n1 nationally ranked Miami Washington, led 14-0 before Armwood (14-1) collected a first down and at one point held a 157-9 advantage in yards."}
