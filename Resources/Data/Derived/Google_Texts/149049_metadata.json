Most people in this country live a lifetime and never have a case in a federal court. So I\u2019ve always treated every case, even the smallest dollar amount, even if it\u2019s a misdemeanor crime, as the most important case I am hearing that day.\u201d\n\nSome of Dubina\u2019s cases have received national and international attention.\n\nIn 2000, the winner of the presidential election was unclear after confusion arose concerning the Florida ballots.\n\n\u201cI knew we were in trouble when lawyers from all over the United States started heading into Florida,\u201d Dubina said. \u201cLiterally within two weeks after the election, which should have been decided, 55 lawsuits were filed in federal court in the state of Florida.\u201d\n\nDubina said it caused havoc on the court system as all resources were placed on Bush vs. Gore.\n\nResponsibility was eventually placed on the voter, and Bush was ruled the winner of the election about five weeks after the election.\n\nThe case of Elian Gonzalez, a little boy rescued off the coast of Florida in 2000, who through his uncle filed for asylum in the United States, Dubina said, by far, garnered the most media attention of all his cases.\n\n\u201cThis case was a very simple case, but I have never seen a media frenzy in this country like I saw with that case,\u201d he said.\n\nGonzalez was eventually returned into the custody of his father in Cuba, who was deemed a fit and loving parent.\n\n\u201cThe father had the law on his side. There was nothing to show that the father was not a loving father who wanted to be reunited with his son,\u201d Dubina said. \u201cThe nation is still somewhat divided on what we did in that case, but really not so much so. I think most people agree with what we did in that case.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Terri Schiavo, a woman who was severely brain damaged, whose husband said she requested if she ever were put on life-support to stop providing food and water to her.\n\nAfter food and water stopped being provided, her parents requested to care for their daughter instead.\n\nThe case was in and out of the court system on appeals, motions and petitions, but the Supreme Court would not hear the case, the federal court ruling was upheld and Schiavo later died days after her feeding tube was removed.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t learn anything else from that case, learn this...if you do not have a living will and durable power of attorney that sets out specifically what you want done to you if you get in that situation, there are a lot of good attorneys here in the Wiregrass and you need to go see one and get one done today,\u201d Dubina said. \u201cThe courts need to stay out of those decisions. That should be between a doctor and his or her patient.\u201d\n\nDubina was also involved in the case of notorious serial killer Ted Bundy, who was sentenced to death by electric chair in 1989 in Starke, Fla.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act case is the biggest case Dubina said he\u2019s ever been a member of a panel to hear.\n\nThe case was to determine the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTwo of the three-judge panel voted to strike down the Affordable Care Act, and it moved on to the Supreme Court, who ruled in its favor.\n\n\u201cI thought it was an unconstitutional law,\u201d Dubina said. \u201cI do not see how you can force people in the American public to go into a stream of commerce and then regulate it, force them in and then regulate it.\n\n\u201cIf you read the Supreme Court ruling on this, they affirmed us on whether or not it was constitutional under the commerce clause and they agreed with us that it was unconstitutional under the commerce clause, but they said it was a tax,\u201d he said, which Congress has the right to impose.\n\nDubina said it remains to be seen what\u2019s going to happen in the future with the law.\n\n\u201cI did my job. I called that case the way I saw it,\u201d he said. \u201cI got it half right and half wrong, and I can live with that. I never take any case personal.\u201d\n\nWhen he became a federal judge, Dubina said he \u201cswore to uphold and defend the constitution of the United States and the laws of the United States. Not just the laws that I agree with, but all the laws.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Southeast Sun", "description": "The Enterprise Rotary Club welcomed one of the most prominent lawmen in the nation, who\u2019s influenced some of the country\u2019s most high-profile cases during its Sept. 10 meeting.", "title": "Dubina gives insight to famous cases", "url": "http://www.southeastsun.com/news/article_1cf58c98-1bbe-11e3-9de5-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southeastsun.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/19/31993a68-1bbf-11e3-9cf8-001a4bcf6878/5231dd9203551.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C450", "height": 450}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@southeastsun", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Enterprise Rotary Club welcomed one of the most prominent lawmen in the nation, who\u2019s influenced some of the country\u2019s most high-profile cases during its Sept. 10 meeting.", "fb": {"app_id": 242143342587548}, "keywords": "enterprise rotary club,the honorable joel fredrick dubina,chief judge,martha roby,most notorious cases,federal court,news,features", "news_keywords": "enterprise rotary club,the honorable joel fredrick dubina,chief judge,martha roby,most notorious cases,federal court,news,features"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEvery case I have ever sat on, to me, is an important case,\u201d Dubina said.\n\u201cI knew we were in trouble when lawyers from all over the United States started heading into Florida,\u201d Dubina said.\nThe Affordable Care Act case is the biggest case Dubina said he\u2019s ever been a member of a panel to hear.\nThe Honorable Joel Fredrick Dubina is the Chief Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which covers Georgia, Florida and Alabama.\nMost people in this country live a lifetime and never have a case in a federal court."}
