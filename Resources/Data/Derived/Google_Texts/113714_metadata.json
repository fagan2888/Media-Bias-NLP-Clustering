But 7 million people age 50 and older are uninsured, while 5.9 million purchased coverage on individual market health plans, for a total of 12.9 million who could be eligible for Medicare under Ms. Clinton's proposal.\n\nThe report also points out that a significant share (47 percent) of Affordable Care Act beneficiaries are 45 and older, while 26 percent are 55 or older. As a result of these demographics, Ms. Clinton's plan could potentially create more sustainable risk pools in both Medicare and the ACA exchanges, meaning the overall risk pools for both Medicare and ACA plans could become younger and less expensive to cover.\n\nMore articles on finance:\n\n6 latest hospital bankruptcies, closures\n\n51 senators weigh in on site-neutral payment regulations\n\nCleveland Clinic commits $7.5M to fund green projects\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
