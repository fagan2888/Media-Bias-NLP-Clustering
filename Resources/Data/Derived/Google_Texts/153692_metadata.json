Obamacare\u2019s risk-corridor program \u2014 which President Obama has been using as a slush fund to placate his insurance allies and keep them quiet about his lawlessness \u2014 shifts financial risk from insurers to taxpayers. According to the House Oversight Committee, health insurers expect Obamacare\u2019s risk corridors to net them nearly $1 billion, at taxpayer expense, this year alone.\n\nObamacare\u2019s risk-corridor program is designed to redistribute money in the Obamacare exchanges, from health insurers who make money to those who lose money. But the Obama administration pressured insurers to set rates as low as possible despite Obamacare\u2019s myriad mandates that have driven actual insurance costs up dramatically. Knowing that the risk-corridor program was in place, insurers willingly played ball with the administration, figuring that even if they lost money, they\u2019d still find money \u2014 through this helpful program. It was a win-win that would boost Obamacare in its early days \u2014 to the benefit of those who\u2019ve gained extraordinary power at the expense of Americans\u2019 liberty, and of those whose product has become mandatory for Americans to purchase.\n\nThe Obama administration claims that the risk-corridor program will be budget-neutral \u2014 that is, that it won\u2019t cost taxpayers money \u2014 and the Congressional Budget Office (taking the administration at its word) has echoed that assessment. The House Oversight Committee, however, asked 15 insurance companies whether they expected to be paying money into the risk-corridor program this year or taking money out of it. One company said it expected to be paying money in, 12 said they expected to be taking money out, and two said they expected it to be a wash. The committee also asked 23 insurance co-ops the same question: two expected to be paying in, seven expected to be taking out, and 14 expected it to be a wash. Collectively, these insurers and co-ops expected to take out $725 million more than they expected to put in. Guess who\u2019ll get the tab?\n\nThe Oversight Committee estimates that these 15 insurers and 23 co-ops cover roughly 80 percent of those who bought insurance through the Obamacare exchanges. That still leaves another roughly 20 percent who are covered by other insurers or co-ops. If those insurers or co-ops are expecting taxpayer handouts at the same rate as the ones who have already shared their expectations with Congress, then that $725 million tab would rise to about $900 million \u2014 nearly a billion dollars that would be funneled from taxpayers, through Washington, to insurers.\n\nRecent polling by McLaughlin & Associates for the 2017 Project asked, \u201cIf private insurance companies lose money selling health insurance under Obamacare, should taxpayers help cover their losses?\u201d By a tally of 81 to 10 percent, respondents said no. Nor was this a Republican-heavy poll \u2014 it included 38 percent Democrats and just 31 percent Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bailout,insurance,Jeffrey H.
