WGNS spoke to a Murfreesboro man who just left his doctor's office after learning that he would soon lose his foot due to a lack of circulation. Evidently, the foot has a chance of being saved, but because of a lack of insurance surgery cannot be performed until it is needed in an emergency situation. At that point the foot will have to be amputated...\n\nArnold Coe lives in a small camper located in Rutherford County and makes less than $1,100 per month. Coe told News Radio WGNS that he cannot afford insurance once he factors in his cost of living. Right now his monthly expenses add up to over $600. That leaves him with $500 to buy food, clothing, medication and utilities.\n\nCoe suffers from a vascular disease that is causing the tissue in his foot to die due to a lack of circulation. He has pain nearly 24-hours a day in his foot. As the problem worsens, the foot will begin to change color which is a sign of more tissue dying. If his foot is not amputated in a proper amount of time, gangrene will set in which could lead to death in a short period of time if left untreated.\n\nBackground:\n\nMr. Coe started smoking at age 5. He told WGNS' Scott Walker, \"My grandfather use to call me out to the front porch and say 'Let's have a cigar.\" He said that he would get his own cigar. From that point on, smoking came natural. Today, Coe is 55-years old. A previous doctor told him that his vascular disease will eventually lead to a loss of limbs as it progresses throughout his life. Coe told us, \"The light at the end of the tunnel doesn't look very bright.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "WGNS spoke to a Murfreesboro man who just left his doctor's office after learning that he would soon lose his foot due to a lack of circulation.", "og": {"site_name": "Murfreesboro News and Radio", "description": "WGNS spoke to a Murfreesboro man who just left his doctor's office after learning that he would soon lose his foot due to a lack of circulation.", "title": "Affordable Care Act leaving Rutherford County Residents without insurance", "url": "http://wgnsradio.com/affordable-care-act-leaving-rutherford-county-residents-without-insurance-cms-27524", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/bw-2e2c4bf7ceaa4712a72dd5ee136dc9a8-bwcore/Coe.jpg", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"app_id": 541876619166504}, "keywords": "WGNS, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Rutherford County, high school sports, high school, MTSU, Braves, Smyrna, LaVergne, Middle Tennessee, TN, Riverdale, Siegel, Blackman, Oakland, OHS, RHS, BHS, SHS, LHS, Murfreesboro obituaries, obituary, obituaries, Murfreesboro news, Murfreesboro weather, Nashville, Woodbury, Cannon County, local events, local news, community events, Woodbury, good neighbor, good neighbor station, 1947, arrested, digital newspaper, Murfreesboro newspaper, Action Line, All Sports Talk, Talk radio, AM 1450, FM 100.5, FM 101.9, 102.5, The Game, Radio network, ABC News, ABC radio news, since 1947, Murfreesboro history, Rutherford County history, Murfreesboro pictures, WGNSradio, marijuana, dope, driving on suspended, DUI, DOS, driving on revoked, revoked license, suspended license, MPD, Murfreesboro Police, Smyrna Police, counterfeit, Murfreesboro arrest, Rutherford County arrest, teacher arrested, Murfreesboro Post, DNJ.com, DNJ, Daily News Journal, Gannett, Tennessean, Braves, Braves Baseball, Prep sports, Murfreesboro Prep Sports, Rutherford County Prep Sports, Rutherford County high school, Murfreesboro high school, Smyrna newspaper, Smyrna news, LaVergne newspaper, LaVergne news, Middle Tennessee newspaper, Middle Tennessee news, WGNS radio, WGNSradio, FM 100.5, FM 101.9, AM 1450, wgnsradio.com, Stewarts Creek, Rockvale, Christiana, Rockvale news, Christiana news, Barfield, Barfield news, Walterhill, Walterhill news, Walter Hill, Walter Hill news, Thompson Lane, M\u2019boro, Mboro, Nashville, MTSU Football, MTSU Basketball, Bart Walker, Scott Walker, Danny Page, Melissa McCullough, Bryan Barrett, Truman Jones, Sheriff Jones, Jon Dinkins, Donnie Johnson, Inside Sports, TRN, ABC, Tennessee Radio Network, headlines, stories, Murfreesboro headlines, George Plaster, willy daunic", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-07-16"}, "Googlebot": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa47\"", "article_summary": "Photo of Mr. Coe by Scott Walker (See more at SmallTownBigWorld.com)The Affordable Care Act does not seem to be properly working for everyone.\nHe told WGNS' Scott Walker, \"My grandfather use to call me out to the front porch and say 'Let's have a cigar.\"\nCoe told News Radio WGNS that he cannot afford insurance once he factors in his cost of living.\nCoe told us, \"The light at the end of the tunnel doesn't look very bright.\"\nAt that point the foot will have to be amputated...Arnold Coe lives in a small camper located in Rutherford County and makes less than $1,100 per month."}
