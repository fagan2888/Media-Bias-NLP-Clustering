The full site will launch later this month with a guide for women to use while searching for insurance coverage in the marketplace. Until then, check out the explainer we ran in August.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also has a \"Obamacare Works\" site with stories from ACA supporters; it's like PostSecret, but with anecdotes about pre-existing conditions instead of emo angst. Some examples:\n\nI work as a nurse practitioner with many low-income women through their pregnancies, and afterward as they try to plan their future pregnancies. The most amazing change I have seen since the ACA has begun to be implemented is the availability of contraceptive methods without copayment. This coverage is life-changing for so many families who couldn't begin to afford the deductible or other fees for the long-acting contraceptive methods.\n\nI am 28 years old. I have been uninsured for the past 5 years. I am a melanoma cancer survivor and I need to have a cancer screening every 6 months. Obamacare has allowed me to be part of Healthy Way LA, a free comprehensive health care program from the county of Los Angeles. I am now getting my bi-annual cancer screenings and the preventative women's health care that I need.\n\nMy child has a pre-existing condition. Our insurance carrier changes at least once a year and I haven't had to worry that they wouldn't offer her insurance since Obamacare was signed into law.\n\n[PPFA]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "obamacare, pill baby pill, roe v world, affordable care act, planned parenthood, Jezebel", "author": "Katie J.M.
