It's a good sport to play, and it's really fun to watch.\"\n\n\"It's just a unique community and the true American sport,\" LaxChix Founder Carlee Costello. \"It's a family business and we love it. We're just happy to get sticks in kids hands whenever we can.\"\n\nAbout a dozen girls came out to South Walton Sunday for a clinic co-hosted by Costello's and Hansen's lacrosse programs, where players of all ages learned everything about the sport\n\n\"It's starting younger and younger. Right now, they feel like if they start them younger, then the high schools will add them. But it's kind of a reverse trend with lacrosse,\" Costello said. \"If you put it in high school, then every 8-year-old kid wants to get a stick because their parent sees the varsity letter in front of them at the high school.\"\n\nFor both Costello and Hansen, they said they'll continue to spread the word about the sport to others in the area.\n\n\"Once kids come out here and get a stick in their hand and start to play, they begin to love the sport, and they keep coming back,\" Hansen said.\n\nAccording to Hansen, Seacoast Collegiate High School in South Walton will be starting both a boys and girls lacrosse team for this upcoming season.\n\nHansen says 30A Lacrosse's events and clinics are free to take part in.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A couple of programs helped promote the growth of lacrosse in the Panhandle while hosting the 30A Lacrosse LaxChix Clinic in South Walton Sunday.", "language": "english", "author": "Zak Dahlheimer", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Programs-Promoting-Growth-of-Lacrosse-in-Panhandle-333966871.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_0810.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "A couple of programs helped promote the growth of lacrosse in the Panhandle while hosting the 30A Lacrosse LaxChix Clinic in South Walton Sunday.", "title": "Lacrosse in the Panhandle: Programs Promote Growth of Sport"}, "twitter": {"description": "A couple of programs helped promote the growth of lacrosse in the Panhandle while hosting the 30A Lacrosse LaxChix Clinic in South Walton Sunday.", "title": "Lacrosse in the Panhandle: Programs Promote Growth of Sport", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Programs-Promoting-Growth-of-Lacrosse-in-Panhandle-333966871.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/IMG_0810.JPG", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Lacrosse in the Panhandle: Programs Promote Growth of Sport", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Lacrosse in the Panhandle Programs"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26a2\"", "article_summary": "But it's kind of a reverse trend with lacrosse,\" Costello said.\nFor both Costello and Hansen, they said they'll continue to spread the word about the sport to others in the area.\n\"It's just a unique community and the true American sport,\" LaxChix Founder Carlee Costello.\nAbout a dozen girls came out to South Walton Sunday for a clinic co-hosted by Costello's and Hansen's lacrosse programs, where players of all ages learned everything about the sport\"It's starting younger and younger.\nRight now, they feel like if they start them younger, then the high schools will add them."}
