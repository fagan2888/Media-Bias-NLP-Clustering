The Affordable Care Act is fueling growth across the temporary staffing industry, according to Rome employment executive Layton Roberts.

A news release from the American Staffing Association said the employment agencies employed an average of 3.32 million temporary and contract workers per week during the third quarter, up 1.8 percent from the same period a year ago.

Roberts, president of the Etowah Agency in Rome, said his staffing needs have mirrored the national increase.

“Businesses are now realizing that it (Obamacare) is going to impact their bottom line significantly,” Roberts said. “They have the option of providing health care, which continues to go up. Some companies also have an existing plan of insurance only to find that it does not fit into the guidelines of the ACA.”

Angie Douglass, district manager for Kelly Services, 3 E. Sixth Ave., said her office has been busy the entire year.

“We are actively recruiting and hiring as many as we can right now,” Douglass said. “We are hiring every single day Monday through Friday.” Substitute teachers and food service workers for the local school systems are in high demand along with office and clerical personnel with computer skills. Douglass also said a lot of light manufacturing positions are in demand right now.

“Our customers, I think their production needs for light industrial have increased,” Douglass said, deflecting some of the growth to actual manufacturing output.
