Here is the final installment of the season for my weekly “Five things to watch” — this time for Saturday’s 11 a.m. (Pac-12 Network) conference matchup between Utah and Colorado in Boulder.

1. Can Colorado’s defense keep Utah junior Devontae Booker from running wild? Booker has netted 1,255 yards through 11 games and trails UCLA’s Paul Perkins by only 10 yards in the race for the Pac-12 rushing title. Utah isn’t pass-happy like most Pac-12 teams. So if the Buffs can keep Booker somewhat under control, it would improve the odds greatly for Colorado.

2. Will CU junior receiver Nelson Spruce finish the season with a flurry? In recent weeks, opposing defenses have been determined to not let Spruce beat them. And they’ve done a good job of that. Spruce has averaged 7.5 catches for the past six games after averaging 11.2 receptions for the first five games. Spruce has been kept out of the end zone for the past four games. If he doesn’t score a TD against Utah, that may not bode well for the Buffs.

3. Will Utah kick returner Kaelin Clay become a one-man momentum changer? He is the nation’s only player with four returns for a touchdown in 2014: three on punt returns, one on a kickoff return.

4. Can Colorado walk-on safety Ryan Moeller replicate his breakout performance of last weekend at Oregon? Best known for being a standout running back at Rifle High School, Moeller was thrust into a starting role against the Ducks because of a rash of injuries at safety. The redshirt freshman responded with a game-best 14 tackles. Another comparable performance against Utah would cause some to wonder if stardom is in his future.

5. Each of the three previous meetings between Colorado and Utah has been decided by 7 points or less. Can the Buffs hang close again and finally, in the season finale, notch a Pac-12 victory?
