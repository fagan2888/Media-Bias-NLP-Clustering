From the irreverent Voltaire to the iconoclastic Nietzsche, the godless have always had a voice. But the New Atheists are different. Religion, they argue, isn\u2019t just wrong; it\u2019s positively corrosive. If you\u2019ve heard people like Bill Maher or Lawrence Krauss speak in recent years, you\u2019re familiar with this approach.\n\nNew Atheism emerged in 2004 as a kind of literary and social movement. Led by such luminaries as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, New Atheism became part of the zeitgeist, a well-timed reaction against religious fundamentalism. The New Atheists are notoriously pugilistic. In print or on stage, they never run from a fight. Whatever you think of their tactics, they\u2019ve succeeded at putting fanatics and moralizers on the defensive \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nBut there\u2019s something missing in their critiques, something fundamental. For all their eloquence, their arguments are often banal. Regrettably, they\u2019ve shown little interest in understanding the religious compulsion. They talk incessantly about the untruth of religion because they assume truth is what matters most to religious people. And perhaps it does for many, but certainly not all \u2013 at least not in the conventional sense of that term. Religious convictions, in many cases, are held not because they\u2019re true but because they\u2019re meaningful, because they\u2019re personally transformative. New Atheists are blind to this brand of belief.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly rational to reject faith as a matter of principle. Many people (myself included) find no practical advantage in believing things without evidence. But what about those who do? If a belief is held because of its effects, not its truth content, why should its falsity matter to the believer? Of course, most religious people consider their beliefs true in some sense, but that\u2019s to be expected: the consolation derived from a belief is greater if its illusory origins are concealed. The point is that such beliefs aren\u2019t held because they\u2019re true as such; they\u2019re accepted on faith because they\u2019re meaningful.\n\nThe problem is that the New Atheists think of God only in epistemological terms. Consequently, they have nothing to say to those who affirm God for existential reasons. New Atheist writers tend to approach religion from the perspective of science: They argue that a particular religion isn\u2019t true or that the empirical claims of religious texts are false. That\u2019s easy to do. The more interesting question is why religions endure in spite of being empirically untrue. There are, of course, millions of fundamentalists for whom God is a literal proposition. Their claims concerning God are empirical and should be treated as such. For many, though, God is an existential impulse, a transcendent idea with no referent in reality. This conception of God is untouched \u2013 and untouchable \u2013 by positivist science; asking if God is true in this sense is like asking how much the number 12 weighs \u2013 it\u2019s nonsensical.\n\nThese sorts of questions pervade literature and philosophy. The existentialist authors, most of whom were atheists, took seriously the problem of meaning and truth. Dostoevsky, for instance, although a Christian, refused to defend Christianity on positivist grounds. He considered God a motive force, not an empirical claim about reality or history. For his part, God was a bridge to self-transcendence, a way of linking the individual to a tradition and a community. The truth of Christ was therefore less important than the living faith made possible by belief in Christ.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all their eloquence, New Atheists show little interest in understanding how believers really think or feel", "title": "New Atheism\u2019s fatal arrogance: The glaring intellectual laziness of Bill Maher & Richard Dawkins", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For all their eloquence, New Atheists show little interest in understanding how believers really think or feel", "title": "New Atheism\u2019s fatal arrogance: The glaring intellectual laziness of Bill Maher & Richard Dawkins", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/09/new_atheisms_fatal_arrogance_the_glaring_intellectual_laziness_of_bill_maher_richard_dawkins/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/maher_dawkins2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For all their eloquence, New Atheists show little interest in understanding how believers really think or feel", "title": "New Atheism\u2019s fatal arrogance: The glaring intellectual laziness of Bill Maher & Richard Dawkins", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/maher_dawkins2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean Illing", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Bill Maher, Editor's Picks, New Atheism, Religion, Richard Dawkins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Atheism, Bill Maher, Editor's Picks, New Atheism, Religion, Richard Dawkins, Innovation News, News, Politics NewsAtheism has a storied history in the West.\nThe point is that such beliefs aren\u2019t held because they\u2019re true as such; they\u2019re accepted on faith because they\u2019re meaningful.\nReligious convictions, in many cases, are held not because they\u2019re true but because they\u2019re meaningful, because they\u2019re personally transformative.\nIf you\u2019ve heard people like Bill Maher or Lawrence Krauss speak in recent years, you\u2019re familiar with this approach.\nLed by such luminaries as Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens, New Atheism became part of the zeitgeist, a well-timed reaction against religious fundamentalism."}
