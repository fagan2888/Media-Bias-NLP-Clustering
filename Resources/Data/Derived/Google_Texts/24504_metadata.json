Scott Walker, former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.\n\nCruz held a rally in Rothschild nearly a week ago; he is leading in numerous polls in the state race, well ahead of challengers Donald Trump and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, although Trump is polling ahead of Cruz nationally.\n\nEven so, a bevy of Cruz backers turned out Sunday evening to wish him well.\n\nAmong them: Mike and Tessie Witt of Wisconsin Rapids, who traveled to Wausau specifically to see Cruz. He took a photo with the couple and signed a campaign flyer for them.\n\nMike Witt said he sees Cruz as an anti-establishment candidate who would curtail burdensome government regulations on individuals and businesses.\n\nBuy Photo Mike and Tessie Witt.

She said she believes Cruz is a reliable conservative, pointing to his opposition of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation to reform health care, and his 21-hour filibuster on the Senate floor several years ago that sought to defund the law.\n\nFlannery also took note of Cruz's experience as a litigator who argued cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very, very smart guy,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cI think he is the best candidate in the race to uphold the Constitution and our rights as Americans.\u201d\n\nCruz did not take questions from or make any statements to the media in Wausau. Rather, the event was an opportunity to connect with prospective voters. He shook hands, posed for photos and signed campaign materials.\n\nCruz also answered questions from restaurant patrons, not all of whom supported him. Samantha Wanner of Wausau told Cruz that she and her parents had attended a rally earlier in the day for Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. Cruz responded by saying he would seek to reduce the size of government, while Sanders would do the opposite, Wanner said\n\nThe number of supporters who attended Cruz\u2019s Wausau campaign stop was not clear, but 2510 Restaurant was brimming with people during the event, making it hard to move around.\n\nCruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, also made the trip, and Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wausau, was at the restaurant as Cruz visited.\n\nCruz\u2019s motorcade left 2510 Restaurant shortly after 7 p.m. He was scheduled to travel to Eau Claire Sunday night, and then had multiple stops between Madison and Milwaukee Monday, according to a campaign official.\n\nJonathan Anderson: 715-898-7010 or jonathan.anderson@gannettwisconsin.com; on Twitter @jonathanderson.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1MMLVRX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Ted Cruz returned to central Wisconsin Sunday in his bid for the White House.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Ted Cruz returned to central Wisconsin Sunday in his bid for the White House.", "title": "Cruz greets supporters in Wausau stop", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/04/03/cruz-greets-supporters-wausau-stop/82579880/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz returned to central Wisconsin Sunday in his bid for the White House.", "creator": "@wausauherald", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7dae9ce061097ede8a70b631c9f2c1435914aaaf/c=708-0-4548-3840&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/03/WIGroup/Wausau/635953114554378338--V1A0244.JPG", "title": "Cruz greets supporters in Wausau stop", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, primary, election, Wisconsin, White House, presidency, 2510 Restaurant"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz greets supporters during his Sunday campaign stop at the 2510 Restaurant in Wausau.\nAmong them: Mike and Tessie Witt of Wisconsin Rapids, who traveled to Wausau specifically to see Cruz.\nMike Witt said he sees Cruz as an anti-establishment candidate who would curtail burdensome government regulations on individuals and businesses.\nAlong with Cruz were his wife, Heidi; former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina; and Wisconsin Gov.\nThe Texas senator stopped by 2510 Restaurant for about two hours, and brought with him a who\u2019s who of Republican superstars: Wisconsin Gov."}
