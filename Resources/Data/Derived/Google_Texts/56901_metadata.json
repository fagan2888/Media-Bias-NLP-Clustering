Planned Parenthood seeks people who think their religion calls on them to pray for \u201creproductive health,\u201d which is a euphemism for abortion.\n\nFrom the announcement:\n\nOhio faith leaders will culminate a week of prayer on issues that affect all Ohioans on Thursday. Join Planned Parenthood supporters and faith leaders from across Ohio at a Statehouse prayer rally. August 28 from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.\n\nOhio Statehouse \u2014 3rd Street Steps Moral Mondays was started in North Carolina by Rev. William Barber, head of the state NAACP, to protest that state\u2019s failure to enact the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion and other policies that were \u201cmorally indefensible,\u201d including attacks on women\u2019s rights. Recently, Rev. Barber put out a call to spread the movement to other states with a week of actions at the end of August. This week of action provided an opportunity to focus on issues relating to civil rights and social and economic justice.\n\nKatie McCann, Director of Communications for Ohio Right to Life, talked with LifeNews about the event.\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\n\u201cWe are greatly concerned if anyone prays against protections for unborn children in our state.
