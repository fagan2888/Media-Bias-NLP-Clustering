The most recent case is of a girl originally from Houston, Texas, who was hospitalized in Mexico during a trip to Puerto Vallarta with lesions caused by the drug.\n\nShe was the girl who had injected Krokodil into her genitals and consequently had a \u201crotted\u201d vagina, according to Jos\u00e9 Sotero Ruiz Hern\u00e1ndez from Mexico's National Institute of Migration. \u201cThe young woman who used this drug had an infection that had rotted her genitals,\u201d he told El Periodico Correo. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t sexually transmitted. She said she\u2019d been using krokodil for the last two months.\u201d\n\nNow, the head of the Council on Addictions in Jalisco, Mexico, Dr. Enrico Sotelo, has told news sources that the 17-year-old girl is actually a resident of Houston, Texas \u2014 deeming her yet another American Krokodil case. She was visiting relatives on the Pacific coast of Mexico in November, and checked into a local clinic in December due to digestive problems. Doctors discovered the lesions and \u201crotted\u201d vagina there. Sotelo did not announce the girl\u2019s name, though he said she used the drug in Houston.\n\n\u201cShe acquired this problem with Krokodil in Houston, not here in Puerto Vallarta,\u201d Sotelo told The Associated Press. Sotelo said that Mexico has thus far only reported two cases, one in Puerto Vallarta and another in Baja California.\n\nKrokodil is a street drug that originally started out in poor areas of Russia, where heroin addicts were looking for a more potent and less expensive drug to keep their addictions going, after they ran out of money for costly drugs. Krokodil is a homemade drug, a mix of household chemicals, such as gasoline and crushed codeine pills. Because of the toxic ingredients, Krokodil slowly grates away at tissue and causes rotting flesh, gangrene, brain damage, and ultimately death. Most of the Krokodil drug users don\u2019t use proper sanitation and may share needles, increasing their risks for HIV and hepatitis C.\n\nSince September, the drug has cropped up twice in Arizona, though U.S. officials say they are the only cases yet reported. Another several cases were reported in Illinois later in the fall. As for the Houston girl, her current condition is uncertain, as she hasn't checked into the clinic since her original hospitalization.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "krokodil, flesh-eating drug, mexico, heroin, addiction, vagina, rotted", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Health officials have confirmed that the 17-year-old girl in Mexico who injected krokodil into her genitals was originally from the U.S.", "title": "Mexican Teen Who Injected Flesh-Eating Krokodil Into Genitals Was From US", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-mexico-who-injected-krokodil-flesh-eating-drug-genitals-was-reportedly-us-266317", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/injection-drug.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health officials have confirmed that the 17-year-old girl in Mexico who injected krokodil into her genitals was originally from the U.S.", "title": "Mexican Teen Who Injected Flesh-Eating Krokodil Into Genitals Was From US", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-mexico-who-injected-krokodil-flesh-eating-drug-genitals-was-reportedly-us-266317", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/injection-drug.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/04/injection-drug.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-04T12:11:12-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-04T12:11:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health officials have confirmed that the 17-year-old girl in Mexico who injected krokodil into her genitals was originally from the U.S."}, "article_summary": "Health officials have confirmed that the 17-year-old girl in Mexico who injected krokodil into her genitals was originally from the U.S.\nKnown as the \u201cpoor man\u2019s heroin\u201d because of its cheap and easily accessible ingredients, the flesh-eating drug Krokodil has surfaced in the United States in the past several months after originating in Russia.\nAs for the Houston girl, her current condition is uncertain, as she hasn't checked into the clinic since her original hospitalization.\n\u201cShe acquired this problem with Krokodil in Houston, not here in Puerto Vallarta,\u201d Sotelo told The Associated Press.\n\u201cThe young woman who used this drug had an infection that had rotted her genitals,\u201d he told El Periodico Correo."}
