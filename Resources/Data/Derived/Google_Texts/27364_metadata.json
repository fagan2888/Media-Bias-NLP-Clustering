The demonstration was held in response to the deaths of police officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, of the 84th Precinct, who were killed execution style on December 20 as they sat in their marked police car on a Brooklyn street corner. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThe only person with blood on his hands is the killer. So let\u2019s bag the hyperbole.\n\nThe tragic murder of two police officers is horrible enough without the rapid-fire finger-pointing.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help to paint all cops as racist monsters after the killing of several young unarmed Black men by police officers. It doesn\u2019t help now to paint protesters and their political supporters as complicit in the murder of two New York City cops.\n\nIsmaaiyl Brinsley, the gunman who killed himself after shooting the officers Dec. 20, was motivated by his own evil demons. His deranged \u201cjustification\u201d for the killings was the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two unarmed Black men killed by police.\n\nBut a killer\u2019s ranting on Instagram does not mean demonstrators or elected officials who criticized police have \u201cblood on the hands,\u201d as Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch suggested.\n\nIt does not mean protests created a toxic environment that bred a cop killer. Former New York Gov. George Pataki called the killings a \u201cpredictable outcome\u201d of \u201canti-cop rhetoric.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s as off-base as Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik blaming the 2011 shooting of former Rep. Gabby Giffords on the \u201cvitriol and rhetoric\u201d of right-wing talk shows. Jared Loughner, who killed six people and wounded 13, was insane.\n\nBrinsley had a long criminal record and a history of mental instability.\n\nIt is truly frightening that his posts promising to \u201cput wings on pigs\u201d garnered \u201clikes\u201d on Instagram, where the hashtag \u201cshootthepolice\u201d is no longer searchable. But on Twitter, that despicable hashtag and several similar ones draw comments from those who urge violence against the police.\n\nShall we blame the killings on social media?\n\nPoliticians, protesters and others with big microphones should work to pull the plug on the blame game.\n\nThat means acknowledging the reality expressed by Dante Fernal at a makeshift memorial to the murdered officers in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. He told USA TODAY that the police had cleaned up the projects where he lived. He gets along \u201cjust fine\u201d with the guys at the local precinct. A lot of people do.\n\nBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams called for a pause in protests over the deaths of Garner and Brown: \u201cIt\u2019s time for New Yorkers to come together.\u201d\n\nThe same is true for the rest of the nation. Americans need to work together, not scratch each other\u2019s eyes out.\n\nAn undertone of peace permeated a vigil for two slain NYPD police officers, as family and community leaders urged healing and togetherness in the wake of the crime.\n\nPolice face dangers every day. It\u2019s a part of the job that needs to be acknowledged by those who accuse cops of being trigger happy and those who want to blame the murder of two police officers on anti-cop rhetoric.\n\nFatal ambushes are among the leading causes of firearm-related police deaths, according to USA TODAY, citing an analysis by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. It\u2019s been that way for years, long before anyone heard of Brown or Garner.\n\nIt\u2019s also long been an ugly fact of American life that young black men feel singled out by police officers.\n\nThese issues are both about public safety. They are not mutually exclusive, and they should not be reduced to sound-bite sized rants.\n\nSo hold the grandstanding. It isn\u2019t doing anybody any good.\n\nAmericans need to meet on common ground, not trample each other in a self-righteous race to claim the higher ground.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1BiuCxr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The tragic murder of two police officers is horrible enough without the rapid-fire finger-pointing.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "The tragic murder of two police officers is horrible enough without the rapid-fire finger-pointing.", "title": "Hyperbole won\u2019t stop violence on the streets", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/editorials/2014/12/28/hyperbole-stop-violence-streets/20959741/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The tragic murder of two police officers is horrible enough without the rapid-fire finger-pointing.", "title": "Hyperbole won\u2019t stop violence on the streets", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0cf06c638f779acb924e6c52a47843e08caebc8d/c=584-0-2917-2333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/12/27/B9315649765Z.1_20141227231338_000_GOU9H3Q0G.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3f0\"", "article_summary": "His deranged \u201cjustification\u201d for the killings was the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, two unarmed Black men killed by police.\nBut on Twitter, that despicable hashtag and several similar ones draw comments from those who urge violence against the police.\nIt didn\u2019t help to paint all cops as racist monsters after the killing of several young unarmed Black men by police officers.\nIsmaaiyl Brinsley, the gunman who killed himself after shooting the officers Dec. 20, was motivated by his own evil demons.\nIt doesn\u2019t help now to paint protesters and their political supporters as complicit in the murder of two New York City cops."}
