Alas for Amazon Prime Air: The FAA’s newly-released draft rules for small commercial drones require drones to remain in view of their operator at all times, and fly less than 500 feet at a speed under 100 mph.

Operators will also have to pass an aeronautics certificate test and go through TSA vetting.

These are lighter regulations than some initially feared–at one point, the FAA was considering mandating full pilot’s licenses, including flight hours, to operate small drones. But they would kill Amazon’s vision for Prime Air: a drone delivery service that could whisk deliveries to your door in 30 minutes.

“We have tried to be flexible in writing these rules,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said. “We want to maintain today’s outstanding level of aviation safety without placing an undue regulatory burden on an emerging industry.”

The rules will now go through a period of public comment before being enacted. These regulations would apply only to commercial drone use, rather than private.

Meanwhile, the president has issued a set of privacy rules for government-operated drones. It requires agencies to disclose their privacy practices, and keep personally identifying information less than 180 days—with some “exceptions.”
