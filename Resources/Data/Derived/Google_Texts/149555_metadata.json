When it was announced he was leaving the department late last month, the only surprise was that his departure wasn\u2019t immediate and that it hadn\u2019t happened sooner.\n\nInstead, Sharfstein will hang on to the very end of the O\u2019Malley administration, before he moves on to The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He said he wanted to oversee the implementation of the revamped Maryland Health Care Exchange that was such a flop last year.\n\nSharfstein seemed a likely person to blame in that debacle \u2014 after the head of the exchange was fired. Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown was ostensibly in charge of the exchange, but internal documents revealed that he didn\u2019t know much about what was going on.\n\nSharfstein was the cabinet secretary actually in charge, and if he wasn\u2019t paying close enough attention as the contractors missed deadlines and squabbled, he was certainly paying attention after thousands of Marylanders couldn\u2019t sign up for health insurance.\n\nToo much Dysfunction\n\nSharfstein already had too much dysfunction begging for attention at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. The department with that rather antiquated name has the largest single budget in the state; this fiscal year, the department is due to spend $11.4 billion, nearly a third of the total state budget, with half of it in federal money tied mostly to Medicaid for the poor and disabled.\n\nSharfstein, a Harvard-trained physician, is bright and incredibly diligent, but that was not always good enough to steer an agency that has too much on its plate. It has a dozen major agencies under its umbrella, and several of those agencies have chronic serious problems that the legislature\u2019s auditors and budget analysts have pointed out time and again.\n\nThe well-documented problems with the Maryland Health Exchange were perhaps the most immediately visible and controversial. Not only didn\u2019t the website work, but the state may have failed to properly oversee the vendors. And the board overseeing it violated the Open Meetings Law when it was deciding what to do about it.\n\nAssisted living audits lacking\n\nIn June, an audit found that the department\u2019s Office of Health Care Quality has failed to fix many of the problems highlighted in at least three previous audits dating back at least to 2004. There are more than 1,300 licensed assisted living facilities in Maryland caring for thousands of residents who are not quite able to care for themselves; but year after year during the past decade, the state health department has failed to do required annual inspections for a majority of them.\n\nThe department said it was trying to fix the problems that also extend to thousands of other health care facilities, nursing homes and the like. One solution is to stop trying to do annual visits of every facility, but only focus on the ones with clear problems.\n\nIn July, the Baltimore Sun\u2019s investigative unit uncovered a case where a severely disabled child died in a group apartment in the Russett section of Laurel in Anne Arundel County.\n\nIt turned out that the nonprofit operator of the group home had been in bankruptcy. The state had not been told and the operator did not have enough money to cover the required staffing for these children and adults with multiple and severe disabilities. The operation was stopped, and the children were moved.\n\nUnspent money for disabilities\n\nThe Developmental Disabilities Administration is one of the larger units in the health department, assisting 27,000 patients. Its caregivers manage a wide range of disabilities, from mild to severe. The DDA has thousands of people waiting for services, but three years ago, it was discovered that the agency had left more than $35 million of an $830 million budget unspent, and had to return $25 million to the state treasury.\n\nPart of the problem was the department was still keeping its financial records on paper and had a hard time keeping tracking of its funds. Sharfstein got heavily involved, hired a new director, had large town hall meetings with clients and caregivers to explain the situation and ultimately replaced the new director with his own chief of staff.\n\nAt one large town hall meeting late last year in Columbia, Sharfstein showed up late to hear from the hundreds who came to listen and complain. His excuse: He was working on the Maryland Health Care Exchange.\n\nOne million on Medicaid\n\nThe problems with Medicaid, the Medical Care Programs Administration, are as large as its $8.1 billion dollar budget, complicated by a rapidly growing program that now covers more than a million Marylanders. One-sixth of all state residents now get their health insurance through Medicaid, due to expanded coverage under Obamacare.\n\nBut the legacy computer system that processes the millions of claims from health care providers is old and cranky, and the process to replace it, using a special federal grant, has been \u201clong and troubled,\u201d budget analysts said. It got so bad last year, that the department needed to come up with a new development strategy.\n\nThis clunky old claims processing makes it harder and slower to uncover fraud and overbilling that goes on in such a huge program, largely perpetrated by doctors, nursing homes, therapists and drug companies.\n\nAt a hearing last year, the department\u2019s inspector general estimated that 3% to 9% of claims are overpaid, sometimes because of honest mistakes, sometimes on purpose. That totals from $240 million to $720 million a year \u2014 but the fraud unit in the attorney general\u2019s office is catching only a fraction of that amount.\n\nSolutions not simple\n\nDiscussing these issues, Del. Guy Guzzone, D-Howard, co-chair of the Joint Audit Committee, said it\u2019s tempting to think that a structural solution, like splitting up some of the health department, might cure some of its administrative ills. But while appealing, that he said wouldn\u2019t necessarily cure the deeper management problems in some of these agencies.\n\nThose tasks will ultimately fall on Sharfstein\u2019s successor. In a few years, we might be feeling sorry for that successor if these chronic issues continue to persist, as they have through at least two governors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was easy to feel sorry for state Secretary of Health & Mental Hygiene Joshua Sharfstein during the last couple of years.
