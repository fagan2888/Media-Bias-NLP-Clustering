NEW YORK (GenomeWeb) â€“ The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's proposed rule to change aspects of the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act with regard to employer-backed wellness programs has some advocacy groups concerned that the move will weaken civil rights protections under the law.

Meanwhile, members of the business community would like to see the EEOC interpret a narrower definition of "genetic information" and expand the ability of wellness plans to request this information from all covered dependents of employees, including children.
