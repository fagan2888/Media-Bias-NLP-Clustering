Joining them will be 700 members represented by NUHW who don\u2019t work in mental health. Union representatives announced their plans in a letter to Kaiser on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n\u201cWe feel that we\u2019re overall helping patients and helping these issues by striking,\u201d Jim Clifford, a Kaiser therapist and NUHW member, told ModernHealthcare.com.\n\nThe impending strike comes months after Kaiser paid a $4 million fine after state regulators found that the health care provider violated the California Mental Health Parity Act by \u201cimposing lengthy and illegal appointment delays\u201d on mental health patients and falsifying patients\u2019 appointment records. Union representatives said that instead of becoming compliant, Kaiser shifted resources, giving care to more than 387,000 clients newly enrolled through the Affordable Care Act at the expense of others returning for follow-up care.\n\nIn recent months, patient wait time has increased three-fold, a reality that some people say has posed deadly consequences. Kaiser currently faces at least four class-action lawsuits filed by patients and families who say that its violations played a role in patient suicides.\n\n\u201cFor patients suffering from depression, anxiety, and other debilitating mental conditions, these delays can be insurmountable obstacles, sometimes leading to tragic outcomes,\u201d Clement Papazian, a clinical social worker at Kaiser in Oakland and president of NUHW\u2019s Northern California chapter of mental health clinicians, told Pharmabiz.com. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see patients being ignored. Kaiser\u2019s actions are doing real harm.\u201d\n\nThe gap in mental health care has long been an issue for many Californians, due in part to staff shortages that union representatives say Kaiser could have solved using a portion of the more than $14 billion profits that it has amassed since 2009. According to the data compiled by the California Health Foundation, the number of psychiatrists and nurses with prescribing privileges in the California mental health system falls well below the national average. To make matters worse, many mental health employees can\u2019t treat low-income patients because a state law that restricts participation as Medi-Cal and Medicare providers to county clinic staff.\n\nThat\u2019s why more than 60 percent of adults in California with mental illness \u2014 many of whom live in the rural regions of San Joaquin Valley and the Inland Empire \u2014 don\u2019t receive outpatient, inpatient, or prescription medication treatment. The lucky few who maintain contact with mental health professionals usually don\u2019t fare any better. In many clinics, patients often wait one to two months for non-urgent individual therapy appointments because of the lack of available professionals.\n\nAcross the United States, more than 91 million people with a mental disability often find it difficult to schedule an appointment with one of nearly 93,000 licensed psychiatrists. The poor and geographically isolated fare much worse in receiving essential mental health care treatment. Rural areas account for more than 85 percent of the locations that the federal government designated as \u201cmental health professional shortage areas,\u201d places described as having a dearth of practicing psychiatrists, psychologists, or social workers.\n\nLeaders of psychiatrist associations point to the shortage of mental health professionals and low reimbursement rates as contributing factors in decisions by the few available psychiatrists to only take on cases for more well-to-do patients, especially as they approach retirement age.\n\nNUHW representatives who plan to participate in the strike said they want to address the issue of mental health staff shortages as an issue of medical ethics, especially since a failure to act quickly has negatively impacted many lives.\n\nIn response to criticisms that the strike will further incapacitate California\u2019s mental health care system, NUHW President Sal Rosselli said that union representatives have tried their hardest to get Kaiser\u2019s attention through conventional means, even recommending that each facility in the state creates a clinician-management committee that would devise staffing and outsourcing solutions during a meeting in December.\n\n\u201cWith soaring profits and a $30 billion reserve, Kaiser needs to step up and lead the way in finally making mental health care a priority in this country,\u201d Rosselli told Pharmabiz.com. \u201cThe law requires it and Kaiser\u2019s ethical obligations as a health care provider demand it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"With soaring profits and a $30 billion reserve, Kaiser needs to step up and lead the way in finally making mental health care a priority in this country.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"With soaring profits and a $30 billion reserve, Kaiser needs to step up and lead the way in finally making mental health care a priority in this country.\"", "title": "2,600 Psychologists, Therapists, And Social Workers To Strike In California", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/06/3608567/mental-health-care-worker-strike/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kaiser-nurses-strike.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"With soaring profits and a $30 billion reserve, Kaiser needs to step up and lead the way in finally making mental health care a priority in this country.\"", "title": "2,600 Psychologists, Therapists, And Social Workers To Strike In California", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kaiser-nurses-strike-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kaiser-nurses-strike.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/kaiser-nurses-strike.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-06T13:33:15+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "According to the data compiled by the California Health Foundation, the number of psychiatrists and nurses with prescribing privileges in the California mental health system falls well below the national average.\nNearly 2,600 psychologists, therapists, and social workers represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers (NUHW) will picket at 35 locations across the Golden State.\nThe poor and geographically isolated fare much worse in receiving essential mental health care treatment.\nJoining them will be 700 members represented by NUHW who don\u2019t work in mental health.\n\u201cThe law requires it and Kaiser\u2019s ethical obligations as a health care provider demand it.\u201d"}
