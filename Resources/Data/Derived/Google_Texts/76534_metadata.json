And frankly, I am very alarmed by the implications of that aggregation of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat also alarms me, however, is that the two other branches appear not just simply passive, but inert in the face of this concentration of authority,\u201d Turley said.\n\nWhile Turley agrees with many of Obama\u2019s policy positions, he steadfastly opposes the method he goes about enforcing them.\n\n\u201cThe fact that I happen to think the president is right on many of these policies does not alter the fact that I believe the means he is doing [it] is wrong, and that this can be a dangerous change in our system,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd our system is changing in a very fundamental way. And it\u2019s changing without a whimper of regret or opposition.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Price Foley, a law professor at Florida International University College of Law, agreed, warning that Congress is in danger of becoming \u201csuperfluous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSituations like this, these benevolent suspensions as they get more and more frequent and more and more aggressive, they\u2019re eroding our citizens\u2019 respect for the rule of law,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are a country of law and not men. It\u2019s going to render Congress superfluous.\u201d\n\nFoley said Congress is not able to tackle meaningful legislation out of fear that Obama would \u201csimply benevolently suspend portions of the law he doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you want to stay relevant as an institution, I would suggest that you not stand idly by and let the president take your power away,\u201d she said.\n\nPanelists and members of Congress dismissed the idea of impeachment, and instead focused on lawsuits to challenge the constitutionality of the president\u2019s unilateral moves.\n\nFour House members testified on the first panel during the hearing to highlight legislation they have sponsored to thwart the administration\u2019s executive overreach.\n\nImpeachment would \u201csurely be extremely divisive within the Congress and the nation generally, and would divert the attention of Congress from other important issues of the day,\u201d said Rep. Jim Gerlach (R., Pa.).\n\nGerlach, who testified before the committee, introduced H.R. 3857, the \u201cEnforce the Take Care Clause Act,\u201d which would expedite the review and injunction process for federal courts to challenge executive actions. Such a challenge would have to pass a supermajority in both chambers in order to be fast-tracked.\n\n\u201cGiven the growing number of examples where this President has clearly failed to faithfully execute all laws, I believe it is time for Congress to put in place a procedure for a fast-track, independent review of those executive actions,\u201d he said.\n\nGerlach said he proposed the bill due to Obama\u2019s repeated alterations to his signature law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has been revised, altered and effectively rewritten by the president and his administration 23 times since July,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we have these constant changes at the president\u2019s whim think about what that does to businesses\u2019 planning capabilities and hiring capabilities and their expansion capabilities,\u201d Rep. Tom Rice (R., S.C.) said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t wonder why our economy is struggling.\u201d\n\nRice has proposed the \u201cStop This Overreaching Presidency (STOP) Resolution\u201d as a remedy. The resolution, which has 114 cosponsors, would direct the House to file lawsuits against four of the president\u2019s unilateral actions, including the employer mandate delay in Obamacare and deferred action program for illegal immigrants.\n\nTurley said Congress must take action to regain their power as the \u201cthumping heart of our system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact is, we\u2019re stuck with each other,\u201d Turley said. \u201cWhether we like it or not in a system of shared powers. For better or worse we may deadlock, we maybe despise each other.
