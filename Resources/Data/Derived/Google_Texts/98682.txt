There is no Kevin Durant in this year’s FIBA Basketball World Cup. There is no LeBron, no Carmelo, no Kobe, no Chris Paul, no Kevin Love and, of course, no Paul George.

Most of the NBA’s biggest names will stay home for this year’s tournament, which begins Saturday in Spain. But there are more NBA players in this year’s cup than any other.

A record 45 current NBA players are set to compete in the tournament, up from 44 in 2010, the league announced Friday. This year’s World Cup also features 75 players who have at one point played in the NBA, as well as 17 former draftees whose rights are held by NBA teams, bringing the total number of past and present NBA players to 92.

Of the 24 teams competing in the World Cup, 21 have at least one NBA player, ex-NBA player or draftee. And 22 of the 30 NBA teams have at least one of their players on a national roster. The Cavs and Rockets have the most, with four current players in the World Cup. Forward Kenneth Faried is the lone representative for the Nuggets this year, but he is the fifth Denver player to compete for Team USA since 1992, when it started using NBA players in international play.

Team USA aside, Spain has the most current NBA players with six, while France and Australia have four. Below is the complete breakdown of the past and present NBA players competing in Spain.
