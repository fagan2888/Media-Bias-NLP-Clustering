Residents near the sounds are dealing with high tides as the wind pushes the water in, which is leaving backyards and streets flooded.

National Avenue in New Bern was closed Saturday because of flooding. People in other flood-prone areas in Pamlico County saw roads close there, too.

Parts of Hobucken in Pamlico County looked more like a river as the tide came in after lunchtime. Although there is no current threat from Hurricane Joaquin, there is still strong easterly winds battering the coast and bringing in high waters off the sound.

Jane Whitely at Re Mayo Seafood neighboring the Intracoastal Waterway is watching the water closely. "We've seen storms come and the water has probably been about this high, so hopefully it won't be that this time," Whitely said.

Meanwhile, Craven County Emergency Manager Stanley Kite said Swift Creek at Streets Ferry is just one of several areas in the county to rise possibly Saturday night and Sunday.
