The jury, which deliberated for a total of just under 2.5 hours, is scheduled to reveal its decision in the penalty portion, or Phase 2, of the Holmes trial at 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nIf jurors unanimously concluded that beyond a reasonable doubt the mitigating factors the defense presented do not outweigh the aggravating factors proven by the prosecution in Phase 1 of the trial, the sentencing phase moves on to the phase when Holmes will either be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison. In the state of Colorado, if jurors did not unanimously agree that the aforementioned mitigation outweighed aggravation, Holmes will automatically be sentenced to life in prison for murdering 12 people and wounding 70 others in 2012.\n\nWorth noting, Jurors have already rejected Holmes\u2019 claim of insanity during the trial, but defense lawyers have urged the jury of three men and nine women deciding Holmes\u2019 fate to consider mental illness as a factor when levying a sentence. Whether they did or not within such a short time period, is yet to be seen. The prosecution rejected the defense attorneys\u2019 attempts to paint Holmes as a troubled man who was not in control of his actions.\n\n\u201cHe made a decision to massacre, and he did; 12 dead from the community. Can anything outweigh that? No,\u201d District Attorney George Brauchler said on Thursday.\n\nIn Part 1 of the penalty phase, the jury decided that Holmes\u2019 crime justified death penalty consideration. The jury began deliberating for a short time Thursday before breaking for a long weekend.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado shooter, James Holmes, Aurora Colorado, movie theater shooter, movie theater shooting, verdict, James Holmes guilty, James Holmes sentence", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "In a few hours, James Holmes, who was convicted in the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting will learn if he will spend life in prison or sent to death.", "title": "In Under 2.5 Hours, Colorado Jury Decides Fate of James Holmes", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 740, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/James-Holmes-Verdict.jpg", "height": 400}, "updated_time": "2015-08-03T19:04:58-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/us/2015/08/03/in-under-2-5-hours-colorado-jury-decides-fate-of-james-holmes/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a few hours, James Holmes, who was convicted in the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting will learn if he will spend life in prison or sent to death.", "creator": "@PPDNews", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/James-Holmes-Verdict.jpg", "title": "In Under 2.5 Hours, Colorado Jury Decides Fate of James Holmes | People's Pundit Daily", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/us/2015/08/03/in-under-2-5-hours-colorado-jury-decides-fate-of-james-holmes/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/28752", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/28752", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "keywords": "Colorado shooter, James Holmes, Aurora Colorado, movie theater shooter, movie theater shooting, verdict, James Holmes guilty, James Holmes sentence", "article": {"section": "US", "tag": "headlines", "published_time": "2015-08-03T13:42:35-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T19:04:58-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "In a few hours, James Holmes, who was convicted in the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting will learn if he will spend life in prison or sent to death."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f2d\"", "article_summary": "In Part 1 of the penalty phase, the jury decided that Holmes\u2019 crime justified death penalty consideration.\nUPDATE: A Colorado jury ruled that James Holmes qualifies for the death penalty for the Aurora movie theater massacre, and now must decide whether to sentence Holmes to death or life in prison without parole.\nThe jury, which deliberated for a total of just under 2.5 hours, is scheduled to reveal its decision in the penalty portion, or Phase 2, of the Holmes trial at 2:30 p.m.\nEARLIER: In a few hours, James Holmes, who was convicted in the Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooting will learn whether he will spend life in prison or be sentenced to death.\nThe prosecution rejected the defense attorneys\u2019 attempts to paint Holmes as a troubled man who was not in control of his actions."}
