A suspect arrested Thursday night in connection with his wife’s slaying in Denver last month made his first court appearance Friday.

Robert Perez, 40, was being held on suspicion of first-degree murder after deliberation, according to the Denver Police Department.

The case involves the death of Perez’s 35-year-old wife, Dennielle, whose body was found Aug. 20 in the couple’s home in the 19000 block of East 45th Avenue in Green Valley Ranch.

Perez, wearing a yellow jumpsuit and no handcuffs, did not speak during the brief appearance in Denver County Court.

Several family members blew kisses and waved at Perez, who thumped his chest with a closed fist in return.
