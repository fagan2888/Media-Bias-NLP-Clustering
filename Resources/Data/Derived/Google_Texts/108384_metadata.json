Rosenberger, Jacksonville\n\nOBAMA\u2019S RECORD\n\nIt\u2019s hardly radical\n\nI am replying to a recent letter by a Fleming Island writer criticizing President Barack Obama\u2019s record in office.\n\nIt is so irresponsible and unintelligent to continue to use selective amnesia regarding Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nFrom the moment of Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009 to the present day, it has been evident \u2014 as confirmed by the words of current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2014 that the Republicans in Congress were not going to carry out their constitutional duties at any point during his administration (though they failed to keep their vow to make Obama a \u201cone-term president\u201d).\n\nThe Constitution has been trampled on by the elected body in Congress, not by Obama, our elected commander\u2013in-chief.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was passed by lawmakers who saw the need for such legislation, and it has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAnd, up to this point, all of Obama\u2019s executive orders have been found to be constitutional. The reason they have become necessary is because of Congress\u2019 inability to act.\n\nThe Supreme Court has followed the law except when it has been politically useful to carefully skirt issues to achieve the political goals of some of the justices.\n\nSadly, Congress is still doing harm to the country by refusing to acknowledge Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.\n\nThe world is watching our country, one that is supposed to be the template for democracy. Right now, however, we appear to be a laughingstock.\n\nOh, but no problem.\n\nJust blame Obama.\n\nJohn Gay, Lake City\n\nTRAUMA AWARENESS MONTH\n\nA worthy cause\n\nMay is Trauma Awareness Month, but what many are unaware of is that UF Health TraumaOne \u2014 an adult and pediatric Level One trauma center \u2014 was the first trauma center in the state, beginning its work in 1983.\n\nSince then, there have been everyday heroes in the form of:\n\n\u25a0 Police.\n\n\u25a0 First responders.\n\n\u25a0 Helicopter pilots.\n\n\u25a0 Nurses.\n\n\u25a0 Specialised surgeons.\n\n\u25a0 Numerous other medical experts.\n\nAnd all of them have been providing life saving care to more than 4,000 trauma victims each year.\n\nServing 30 counties in Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia, TraumaOne\u2019s tagline is \u201cEvery Second Counts.\u201d\n\nAnd that tagline accurately describes the difference each second makes during a traumatic injury or accident.\n\nBased on the goals of raising awareness, showing appreciation and raising funds, the 2nd annual Run for Heroes 5K will be held Saturday, May 28, in Unity Plaza at 220 Riverside Avenue.\n\nThe 5K run will begin at 8 a.m., and a one-mile Fun Run will be held at 9 a.m. There will be medals for every registered child and cold treats available at the finish line.\n\nJoin us as we:\n\n\u25a0 Support TraumaOne.\n\n\u25a0 Honor our local heroes.\n\n\u25a0 Raise awareness during Trauma Awareness Month.\n\nYou can register for our event at this website: www.prsractiming.com.\n\nAly Leeper, race coordinator,\n\nJacksonville\n\nDUVAL SCHOOLS\n\nA lack of moral courage\n\nThe current members of the Duval County School Board should resign.\n\nBut their last act before resigning should be to fire School Superintendent Nikolai Vitti.\n\nTo even consider allowing boys into a restroom for girls is obvious evidence that someone is either too stupid to be in charge or so overeducated that they can no longer see the obvious.\n\nIf a male wants to get hormones injected and surgery performed to have a female\u2019s anatomy, it doesn\u2019t mean that person becomes a woman. We still have a male, just one who is mixed up.\n\nIf the School Board wants to hire a counselor to help these confused students, I would applaud it.\n\nFor the School Board members to be so timid, cowardly and unbelievably politically correct that they have not rescinded or overruled Vitti\u2019s transgender bathroom decision is such an obvious affront to good sense, normal convention and generations of Judeo-Christian values that it defies belief by any rational person.\n\nSuch a lack of action and moral courage should cause any person with decency to resign in shame at being so demonstrably unable to lead.\n\nAlec Lawson, Southside", "article_metadata": {"description": "TRANSGENDER DEBATEDriven by zealotsThe current transgender \u201cproblem\u201d has presented itself for the benefit of political opportunists who wish to garner the votes of biblical purists in Bible Belt states like North Carolina.What toilet facilities were transgender people using before the subject was politicized?
