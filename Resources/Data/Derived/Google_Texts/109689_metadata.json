OSU reached a settlement with the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights\u2014an agency currently probing 78 other colleges over the same allegations\u2014and agreed to improve upon its shortcomings related to how the university reports sexual assault. From Inside Higher Ed:\n\nDuring the investigation, Ohio State established a \"one-stop\" Title IX webpage and office, formed a sexual violence consultation team that meets bi-weekly, and developed online training modules about bystander intervention. The university also made \"substantial improvements\" in how it documents sexual assault investigations, the department said. \"The university will maintain comprehensive documentation of its receipt, investigation, and resolution of all oral and written complaints, reports or other notice of sexual harassment,\" according to the resolution agreement. Previously, the department had found that Ohio State had failed to keep clear and consistent records of cases of sexual violence, and the office had trouble even telling if some cases had been addressed or not.\n\nDOE praised OSU for how it handled the big complaint, which was sexual harassment within the marching band. According to the details of a complaint against the college, Marching Band Director Jonathan Waters presided over a culture of gratuitous sexual harassment and sex-based hazing. OSU fired Waters in July. Read the full complaint here\u2014there is some truly gross conduct, and ample evidence that Waters knew what was going on.\n\nA separate aspect of the settlement is drawing the ire of some civil libertarians, however. OSU agreed in the resolution to establish clear definitions of what constitutes consensual sex. It's not entirely obvious whether the definitions listed here are in line with the resolution yet, but they already seem troubling. According to OSU, participants in sexual activities must agree \"why\" they are having sex:\n\nEffective consent can be given by words or actions so long as the words or actions create a mutual understanding between both parties regarding the conditions of the sexual activity--ask, \"do both of us understand and agree regarding the who, what, where, when, why, and how this sexual activity will take place?\"\n\nThat's absurd, as Hans Bader, a senior attorney at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and a former OCR lawyer, writes:\n\nAt Ohio State University, to avoid being guilty of \u201csexual assault\u201d or \u201csexual violence,\u201d you and your partner now apparently have to agree on the reason WHY you are making out or having sex. It\u2019s not enough to agree to DO it, you have to agree on WHY: there has to be agreement \u201cregarding the who, what, where, when, why, and how this sexual activity will take place.\u201d There used to be a joke that women need a reason to have sex, while men only need a place. Does this policy reflect that juvenile mindset? Such a requirement baffles some women in the real world: a female member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights told me, \u201cI am still trying to wrap my mind around the idea of any two intimates in the world agreeing as to \u2018why.\u2019\u201d\n\nBader also notes that OSU misinforms students about alcohol levels and consent. Its website cryptically describes consent as invalid when the person \"is so intoxicated or unconscious due to alcohol or drugs.\" Well, how intoxicated is so intoxicated? An intoxicated person can absolutely consent to sex; only an incapacitated person cannot, by definition, give consent.\n\nOnly 78 more universities to go.
