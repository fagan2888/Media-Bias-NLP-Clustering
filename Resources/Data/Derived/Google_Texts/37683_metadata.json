The average rebate for a California family is $39, federal data show.\n\nNot all of an insurer's policyholders will get money back, and the amounts will vary. For instance, Anthem Blue Cross said only 15% of its customers in California would receive a refund.\n\nThe rebates are required under the Affordable Care Act when insurers fail to spend a minimum of 80% of premiums on medical care for individual and small-business customers.\n\nFor larger employers, insurers must spend at least 85% of premiums on medical expenses. Employers that self-insure are not subject to these rules.\n\nIn California, more than 70% of the $11.9 million in refunds is owed to employers. In those cases, the companies are expected to share the money with employees based on the percentage workers contribute to their annual premiums.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross, the state's largest for-profit health insurer, said it was mailing out $3.8 million in rebates to small-business customers. The average amount per person is less than $10, Anthem said.\n\nUnitedHealth Group Inc. will refund $1.5 million to small businesses in California while HMO giant Kaiser Permanente owes $1.4 million to individual policyholders in the state, according to federal data.\n\nThe California Assn. of Health Plans said insurers are doing a better job of estimating medical costs and the amount of rebates has continued to fall each year.\n\nNationally, the rebate figure fell from $500 million a year ago to $332 million this summer.\n\n\"The trend serves as evidence of health plans\u2019 efforts to hold down costs and meet and exceed stringent federal and state requirements,\" said Charles Bacchi, executive vice president of the industry trade group.\n\nAmong states, Florida had the highest amount of 2013 rebates with $41.7 million going back to consumers.\n\nLawmakers and consumer groups pushed for the rebates as part of the health law to discourage insurers from raising rates to pay more for executive salaries, shareholder dividends and other expenses unrelated to patient care.\n\nThey also hoped these rules would hold down future rate increases and force insurers to eliminate unnecessary costs.\n\nThe Obama administration estimates that consumers and employers saved $3.8 billion on their 2013 premiums because health insurers faced these spending requirements.\n\n\"Standards like these created under the healthcare law are providing Californians with immediate savings and are helping to keep costs down over the long term,\" U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Obamacare rebates headed to thousands of consumers, employers", "date": "2014-07-24", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California health insurers owe $11.9 million in refunds to thousands of consumers and businesses under requirements of the federal healthcare law .", "title": "Obamacare rebates headed to thousands of consumers, employers", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-rebates-california-20140723-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53d054d2/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-rebates-california-20140723", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80884054", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "California health insurers owe $11.9 million in refunds to thousands of consumers and businesses under requirements of the federal healthcare law.
