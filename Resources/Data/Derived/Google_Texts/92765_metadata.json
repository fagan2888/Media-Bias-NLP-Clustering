Chairman Jonathan Robinson cast the opposing vote to the motion.\n\nMr. Atkinson was appointed interim head in the subsequent months, with Paula Stanley serving as interim public health director.\n\nAfter more than seven years as DSS director, Mr. Atkinson said he wasn\u2019t ready to relinquish the reins to another and competed against 68 other applicants to secure the position.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard and accomplished some phenomenal goals,\u201d he told the News-Times. \u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to turn that over to someone else just yet.\u201d\n\nSuccesses include increasing demands on child protective services, growing numbers of children in foster care, eligibility changes following the Affordable Care Act and navigating the office through implementation of NCFAST.\n\nThe database, North Carolina Families Accessing Services through Technology, launched broken and buggy last year, impeding the ability of caseworkers to process and review benefits applications and delaying food assistance to thousands of families statewide following system-crippling problems.\n\nCarteret was a pilot county in launching both the food services and Medicaid components of NCFAST, and while improving, Mr. Atkinson said the system continues to experience glitches.\n\nCounty health and DSS will remain at their separate locations in Morehead City and Beaufort despite the combined management, but Mr. Atkinson said he looks forward to some cross provision of services in the coming months. While DSS is on Craven Street, the health center is on Bridges Street Extension in Morehead City.\n\n\u201cConsolidating offers some opportunities we\u2019ll take advantage of,\u201d he said. \u201c(DSS) will outsource some eligibility workers for foodstamps and Medicaid over to the health department.\u201d\n\nThose caseworkers will allow accessibility \u201cacross the river,\u201d and should be operating out of the health department in the next two to three months.\n\nMr. Atkinson said he has a few tricks up his sleeve for making the consolidation smooth, despite commissioners stating they would not look to build a facility for the large department in the near future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hesitant. I\u2019ve worked intimately with the senior management (at the health department) for years and I couldn\u2019t be happier with the staff I\u2019ve got,\u201d he said.\n\nWith consolidation, Mr. Atkinson will oversee nearly 180 county employees.\n\nA graduate of Furman University, Mr. Atkinson holds a Master of Divinity from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary as well as a master\u2019s in social work from Eastern Carolina University.\n\nWith the step to Human Services Director, Mr. Atkinson will see a salary and benefits jump to $115,000 a year.\n\nDSS will come under the direct supervision of current Deputy Director Clint Lewis, while Ms. Stanley will continue serving as interim public health director. Their salaries will not be affected by the appointment, said Assistant County Manager and Human Resources Director Chris Turner.\n\nMr. Atkinson said the new position will allow him more time to devote to the consolidation and remove him somewhat from the day to day of social services.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking to working very closely to make sure services are as seamless as they can be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll identify low-hanging fruit and make sure services are efficient and accessible.\u201d\n\nContact Jackie Starkey at 726-7081, ext. 232; email jackie@thenewstimes.com; or follow on Twitter @jackieccnt.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Carolina Coast Online", "description": "BEAUFORT \u00a0\u2014 The newly consolidated Carteret County Human Services Department has a new director and those using services already know him.", "title": "Atkinson tapped as new board\u2019s director", "url": "http://www.carolinacoastonline.com/article_73ce814c-2dfa-11e4-9657-0019bb2963f4.html", "image": {"width": 432, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/carolinacoastonline.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/7d/a7d682e6-2dfa-11e4-9d2c-0019bb2963f4/53fdf2576b7c0.image.jpg?resize=432%2C287", "height": 287}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "BEAUFORT \u00a0\u2014 The newly consolidated Carteret County Human Services Department has a new director and those using services already know him.", "keywords": "human services department,human services agency,consolidated board,dss,health department,atkinson", "news_keywords": "human services department,human services agency,consolidated board,dss,health department,atkinson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0bd3\"", "article_summary": "With the step to Human Services Director, Mr. Atkinson will see a salary and benefits jump to $115,000 a year.\nMr. Atkinson was appointed interim head in the subsequent months, with Paula Stanley serving as interim public health director.\nAfter more than seven years as DSS director, Mr. Atkinson said he wasn\u2019t ready to relinquish the reins to another and competed against 68 other applicants to secure the position.\nFormer Department of Social Services Director David Atkinson accepted the newly created position Aug. 11 and will now oversee both DSS and the County Health Department.\nBEAUFORT \u2014 The newly consolidated Carteret County Human Services Department has a new director and those using services already know him."}
