The job of President of the United States of America comes with a lot of responsibilities. You have to sign laws, give speeches, run the executive branch, make high-level appointments, make big decisions about economic policy and regulation, attend to complex diplomatic relations, delegate like crazy, and serve as Commander in Chief.

Also, you apparently have to do double duty as an airplane salesman. As President Obama says in this short clip from a local news interview, he's always closing for Boeing.

"Other than — maybe — the CEO of Boeing, I don't know anyone who's done more to sell Boeing planes around the world than me."

Watch it:

Boeing is, by far, the biggest long-term beneficiary of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a government-authorized financial entity that subsidizes corporations through below-market loans.

It's been this way for years. At this point, 40 percent of Ex-Im activity benefits the airplane maker. Ex-Im Bank employees under President Obama have switched sides to take cushier jobs at Boeing, and in March, The Wall Street Journal reported on the intense collaboration and coordination between the two organizations to help write the regulations governing airplane loans through the bank.

It's no revelation at this point that the Export-Import Bank has been captured by Boeing, its biggest corporate beneficiary. What this clip tells us, though, is that it's not just Ex-Im; the President of the United States has been captured too.
