He also said Washington believed that Russia, which supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad, remained committed to a political solution to the Syrian war.\n\n\"Nobody ever thought this week in Geneva would be the end-all and be-all of the political process or the talks themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not like we're looking at this through rose-colored glasses, it's not like we don't see what's going on in Geneva for exactly what it is.\"\n\n(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed and Lesley Wroughton, editing by G Crosse and Tom Brown)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "\"It is our understanding that it was most likely regime forces, but information is sti", "title": "Syria market attack likely by Syrian government forces: U.S.", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Syria-market-attack-most-likely-Syrian-government-forces-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/yahoo-results_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/19/Syria-market-attack-most-likely-Syrian-government-forces-US", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/yahoo-results_4.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "\"It is our understanding that it was most likely regime forces, but information is sti", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Still, the main Syrian opposition HNC described the market attack as a \"dangerous escalation\" which reinforced its decision day earlier to suspend U.N.-led peace talks in Geneva.\n\"It is our understanding that it was most likely regime forces, but information is still coming in,\" State Department spokesman John Kirby told a news briefing.\nHe also said Washington believed that Russia, which supports the government of President Bashar al-Assad, remained committed to a political solution to the Syrian war.\nWhile acknowledging that the sides were still a long way from an agreement, Kirby played down concerns the talks were near collapse.\n\"Nobody ever thought this week in Geneva would be the end-all and be-all of the political process or the talks themselves,\" he said."}
