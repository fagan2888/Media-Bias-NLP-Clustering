Much of that thanks to unprecedented access to information over the Internet. Availability of data, combined with the convenience afforded by smartphones and tablets, are creating knowledgeable consumers who typically conduct research both before and after visiting the doctor.\n\nEnter app developers \u2013 specifically those dedicated to customized applications and devices focused on health care. BI said there are about 100,000 health applications now available. That translates to almost four million free and 300,000 paid daily downloads.\n\nThis statistic was echoed by mobile operator, Greatcall, which uses the Verizon (NYSE: VZ) owned Verizon Wireless network. In a recent infographic Greatcall asked: Is Mobile Health Care the Future? The answer, according to Greatcall, seemed to be \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nNumbers reflected in Greatcall\u2019s collected data are expected to grow as wearable computing, including fitness and activity trackers, become part of the landscape.\n\nIn addition, more and more enterprise organizations are doing all they can to encourage employee health and fitness through company-sponsored wellness programs.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, \u201ccreates new incentives and builds on existing wellness program policies to promote employer wellness programs and encourage opportunities to support healthier workplaces.\u201d\n\nMobile health apps aren\u2019t just for patients. Health care professionals are increasingly turning to smartphone apps to download and process patient records. News that IBM's (NYSE: IBM) famous Watson super computer will soon be available on smartphones, opens an entire world of diagnostic possibilities for patients and doctors alike.\n\nRelated: IBM's Watson Coming to Smartphones Soon\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take a super computer to check your blood pressure, heart rate or glucose levels. All it takes is a wearable device connected to a smartphone that can transmit that information to medical professionals so they can determine if you need to come in.\n\nDiagnosis isn\u2019t the only area in which mobile apps could prove useful. Managing health care accounts, including payments and filling out paperwork, is already being handled by apps like Simplee and CakeHealth.\n\nOther companies expected to have an impact as the mobile health care app space grows include some well-known names such as Athenahealth (NASDAQ: ATHN), Cerner (NASDAQ: CERN), WebMD (NASDAQ: WBMD) and Walgreen (NYSE: WAG).\n\nAt the time of this writing, Jim Probasco had no position in any mentioned securities.\n\nPosted-In: Affordable Care Act athenahealth CakeHealth cernerNews Events Tech Media Best of Benzinga\n\n\u00a9 2016 Benzinga.com.
