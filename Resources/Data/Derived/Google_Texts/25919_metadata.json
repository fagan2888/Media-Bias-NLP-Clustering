Boxtel, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a skiing accident in 1992, currently serves as the innovation\u2019s first test pilot. \u201cAfter years of dreaming about it, I am deeply grateful and thrilled to be making history by walking tall in the first ever 3D-printed Ekso-Suit, made specifically for me,\u201d she said in a press release. \u201cThis project represents the triumph of human creativity and technology that converged to restore my authentic functionality in a stunningly beautiful, fashionable, and organic design.\u201d\n\nJudging by the unit\u2019s technical standards, Boxtel\u2019s praise seems warranted: The Ekso-suit is modeled on precise measurements obtained via meticulous 3D scanning. Her thighs, shins, and spine have all been digitized to achieve a perfect fit. For the first time in more than 10 years, she is able to get around without her wheelchair.\n\nAvi Reichental of 3D Systems told reporters that, with 3D printing, assistive technology can move toward a more natural design. \u201cI believe that the most beautiful and functional designs have already been patented by nature, and inspired by Amanda\u2019s incredible spirit, we were able to harness nature\u2019s beauty with 3D-printed functionality and freedom of creation to allow her body and spirit to soar,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nThe announcement comes less than a month after EPFL\u2019s bionic hand \u2014 a breakthrough prosthesis that restores tactile sensation to lower limb amputees. By interpreting and encoding nerve signals in the upper arm, the unit allows a user to feel objects in real-time. \u201cThe sensory feedback was incredible,\u201d said pilot user Dennis Aabo S\u00f8rensen.\n\nCheck out the video below to see the Ekso-suit in action:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ekso-suit, 3d systems, exoskeleton, paralyzed, amanda boxtel, bionic hand", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Thanks to a 3D-printed exoskeleton, Amanda Boxtel is walking for the first time in over a decade.", "title": "Paralyzed Woman Trades Wheelchair For Exoskeleton [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/paralyzed-woman-walks-again-thanks-ekso-suit-3d-printed-exoskeleton-video-269957", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/exoskeleton.PNG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to a 3D-printed exoskeleton, Amanda Boxtel is walking for the first time in over a decade.", "title": "Paralyzed Woman Trades Wheelchair For Exoskeleton [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/paralyzed-woman-walks-again-thanks-ekso-suit-3d-printed-exoskeleton-video-269957", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/exoskeleton.PNG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/23/exoskeleton.PNG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-02-23T15:47:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-25T14:14:23-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Thanks to a 3D-printed exoskeleton, Amanda Boxtel is walking for the first time in over a decade."}, "article_summary": "Thanks to a 3D printed exoskeleton, Amanda Boxtel is walking for the first time in over a decade.\nAvi Reichental of 3D Systems told reporters that, with 3D printing, assistive technology can move toward a more natural design.\nDevelopers 3D Systems and EksoBionics first announced the so-called Ekso-suit exoskeleton at the Singularity University Summit Europe in Budapest last November.\n3D Systems / YouTubeMore than a decade after doctors said she would never walk again, Amanda Boxtel is walking again, thanks to a robotic suit 3D printed from customized scans.\nBoxtel, who was paralyzed from the waist down after a skiing accident in 1992, currently serves as the innovation\u2019s first test pilot."}
