You grab your cellphone, type in \u201c23000,\u201d \u201cER,\u201d your ZIP code, and in a couple of minutes a list of estimated wait times for three of the nearest hospital emergency rooms pops up on your screen.\n\nThen, another text comes with a link to a medical application called iTriage. You log on and look up the symptoms for your injury, preregister with the nearest hospital and, with the tap of a finger, even signal that you\u2019re on the way.\n\nThis scenario may seem far-fetched \u2014 not the injury, not the technology, but the idea that people can use their smartphones to get emergency-room wait times as if they were pulling up local movie listings. These are hospitals, after all, where lives are saved and medical miracles made.\n\nYet, the public now demands easily accessible information about nearly everything and this, of course, includes health care. Perhaps it was only a matter of time before emergency departments joined in.\n\nLocally, the Sunrise Health System, which includes Sunrise, Sunrise Children\u2019s, Southern Hills and MountainView hospitals, was the first to supply emergency-department wait times. The hospital group started posting and texting wait times in 2010, and soon followed with billboards that can be seen valleywide displaying estimated wait times for their closest emergency rooms.\n\nSunrise Health also gives patients the option of downloading iTriage \u2014 a mobile app providing information on everything from the nearest hospital\u2019s location to details on specific diseases and medications \u2014 through its text messages. The app includes an iNotify prompt that lets patients check in with an emergency room and send notification that they are on their way.\n\nDuring the past year, there have been about 2,000 check-ins within the hospital system via iNotify, said Brendan Bussmann, vice president of strategic development and marketing for Sunrise Hospital and Sunrise Children\u2019s Hospital. The technology seems to be benefiting both locals and visitors, he added.\n\n\u201cI know that there are several people that will use it,\u201d Bussmann said. \u201cI know concierges within the hotels will use it, they\u2019ll tell visitors that are coming in, part of our 40 million visitors that visit the Strip every year, that they can use that to figure out current wait times and check in through the iNotify process.\u201d\n\nThe other major hospital groups now publish wait times online, too, but also allow patients without life-threatening conditions to make appointments for treatment times with the click of a mouse or the tap of a finger. This is primarily about providing a better experience for patients, hospital officials say.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, patients aren\u2019t happy when they\u2019re not feeling well and have to sit in an ER for an extended period of time,\u201d Dr. Maggie Rafferty, chief experience officer for Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican, said in an email. \u201cWith this program we are able to keep those with nonemergent issues at home, where they\u2019re comfortable.\u201d\n\nOn a recent Thursday at about 4:30 p.m., InQuicker, the online reservation system for the three St. Rose Dominican hospitals, listed 5:30 p.m. as the next available treatment time for the San Martin and Rose de Lima campuses, with Siena following at 5:45 p.m.\n\nA click on the preferred hospital brought up a short registration form requiring basic information such as name and email address and the reason for the visit. Rafferty said although InQuicker is meant to be used by those with minor conditions, the system backs this up by doing its own triage.\n\n\u201cAll registrations are reviewed by a Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican charge nurse upon initial notification,\u201d Rafferty said. \u201cIf the patient\u2019s condition warrants, the ER charge nurse calls/emails the patient to come to the ER immediately or dial 911. InQuicker does triage for emergent conditions and blocks the registration, keeping it blocked from registration attempts for 24 hours.\u201d\n\nWhile InQuicker was launched this past summer, Valley Health System started taking appointments online a little more than a year ago as part of its \u201cER Just Got Easier\u201d initiative.\n\nThe reservation system, called ER Reserve, is accessible through the home page of each of the five hospitals\u2019 websites \u2014 Desert Springs, Valley, Centennial Hills, Spring Valley and Summerlin hospitals. The sites explain that appointments can be made 12 hours in advance and are only for those with \u201cnon-life-threatening minor illnesses and injuries, such as: sore throat, earache, cough or cold, muscle strains and sprains.\u201d\n\nAn appointment is made by providing basic information such as name and address, but a reason for the visit is not requested. Once the online form has been submitted, the information goes into the hospital\u2019s computer system and the ER staff is alerted via smartphone, said Lori Harris, Valley Health System\u2019s advertising director.\n\nER Reserve averages about 80 to 100 reservations every month between all five hospitals, Harris said. Valley Health also has a texting function so patients can get the latest wait times from their phones.\n\n\u201cSo if you have a smartphone \u2026 you just text EZ to 379248 and instantly you have access to all five of the Valley Health System hospital wait times in the palm of your hand, or on your iPad or tablet or whatever mechanism you happen to be using,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBoth hospital groups note on their websites that priority treatment always goes to those with the most urgent medical issues with or without an appointment. Also, as Rafferty points out, \u201cpatients (with appointments) don\u2019t skip in front of other patients \u2014 they simply wait at home.\u201d\n\nLocal hospital officials said wait times are approximate and, given the fluctuating nature of emergency rooms, can quickly change.\n\nThe idea that hospitals want to streamline care and improve patients\u2019 experiences through slick mobile applications and scheduling systems doesn\u2019t seem so outlandish.\n\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians reports that there are more emergency-room patients yet fewer emergency departments to take care of them given a shortage of inpatient beds and medical staff. During the 1990s, U.S. hospitals lost 103,000 staffed inpatient beds and 7,800 intensive-care beds. There is also expected to be a shortage of more than 24,000 physicians by 2020.\n\nEmergency visit rates increased at twice the rate of growth of the U.S. population from 1997 to 2007, the ACEP stated. And, by law, emergency departments must treat all patients regardless of whether they\u2019re insured or can pay out-of-pocket.\n\n\u201cForever, the emergency department has been the safety net for everybody in this country,\u201d said Alfred Sacchetti, an ACEP spokesman and an emergency physician at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden, N.J. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t have insurance we took care of you. If you can\u2019t get ahold of your doctor, we take care of you. If you don\u2019t know whether you need a doctor or not, we take care of you. \u2026 Emergency physicians and emergency medicine in general is very proud of the fact that we\u2019ve held that position.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is another question mark. Hospital officials don\u2019t know yet whether more insured patients will mean more emergency room visits or more use of primary-care physicians.\n\nBut as hospitals proceed with this technology aimed at providing a closer link between patient and emergency room, there are issues to consider.\n\nIn 2012, the ACEP released a statement on the publishing of wait times, pointing out that it can serve as an effective marketing tool, \u201cmore evenly distribute\u201d patients among a system\u2019s hospitals, and push hospitals to improve their performance metrics based on patient wait times.\n\nHowever, there is no national standard for estimated wait times. As the report states, \u201cIf we as providers are perplexed, what is the patients\u2019 perception?\u201d\n\nIn Las Vegas, for example, Valley Health defines wait time as the approximate average time it takes to be seen by a triage nurse, whose job it is to assess patients and prioritize based on who needs more immediate treatment.\n\nSt. Rose Domincan states on its website that it is how long it takes a patient to see a physician after arriving. Sunrise Health defines it as \u201cthe time from once they arrive to when greeted by a medical professional,\u201d such as a physician, nurse practitioner or physician\u2019s assistant, Bussmann said.\n\nOther concerns noted in the report are that patients with serious conditions may delay getting care when they see extended wait times, or may choose hospitals that are farther away because of shorter posted wait times.\n\n\u201cWait times are good if you truly do have a legitimate minor emergency. \u2026 The difficulty is, you\u2019re asking, now, patients to make a decision: Do I have an emergency that I can go a great distance to get to a shorter wait, or do I have an emergency that I better get to the closest place even though I don\u2019t know what their wait time is because I just need to get there?\u201d Sacchetti said.\n\nSacchetti, whose hospital does not publish wait times or offer online appointments, said he is more concerned about appointment scheduling and the possibility it could put hospitals on shaky ground because of federal regulations such as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which governs equal access to emergency care.\n\nBut whatever the concerns, this is new territory and there will be kinks to work out. Sacchetti noted that the more educated patients become about their own health and how these online services work, the better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s a beautiful Saturday afternoon, you\u2019re at the park and decide to jump into a pickup basketball game with a group of guys about half your age.", "parsely-tags": "Health,Life", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/smartphone-apps-let-patients-gauge-entry-times-emergency-rooms", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-835286"}, "author": "JOAN PATTERSON SPECIAL TO THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Smartphone apps let patients gauge entry times for emergency rooms", "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s a beautiful Saturday afternoon, you\u2019re at the park and decide to jump into a pickup basketball game with a group of guys about half your age.", "title": "Smartphone apps let patients gauge entry times for emergency rooms", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/smartphone-apps-let-patients-gauge-entry-times-emergency-rooms", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB-ER-WAITING-JAN13-14_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_er_0.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=484302", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=484302", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "JOAN PATTERSON SPECIAL TO THE LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Health,Life,", "parsely-section": "Health", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-12T16:54:25-08:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "It\u2019s a beautiful Saturday afternoon, you\u2019re at the park and decide to jump into a pickup basketball game with a group of guys about half your age.", "title": "Smartphone apps let patients gauge entry times for emergency rooms", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/health/smartphone-apps-let-patients-gauge-entry-times-emergency-rooms", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB-ER-WAITING-JAN13-14_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB-ER-WAITING-JAN13-14_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-13T00:54:25Z"}, "article_summary": "The hospital group started posting and texting wait times in 2010, and soon followed with billboards that can be seen valleywide displaying estimated wait times for their closest emergency rooms.\nYet, the public now demands easily accessible information about nearly everything and this, of course, includes health care.\nValley Health also has a texting function so patients can get the latest wait times from their phones.\nLocally, the Sunrise Health System, which includes Sunrise, Sunrise Children\u2019s, Southern Hills and MountainView hospitals, was the first to supply emergency-department wait times.\nThis is primarily about providing a better experience for patients, hospital officials say."}
