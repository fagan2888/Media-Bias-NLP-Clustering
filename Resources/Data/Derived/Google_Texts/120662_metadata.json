It\u2019s seeing some of the lowest hospital admission rate for asthma in the region.\n\nAllergist and Asthma Specialist at Woodland Care Center Dr. Rajan Merchant has seen an increase in the number of children being diagnosed with asthma in the last few years but no change in the number of children being diagnosed with acute issues.\n\nThe number of pediatric asthma cases is 3,969 and the number of adult cases is 13,760, among the county\u2019s population of 204,590.\n\nDr. Merchant said the increase could be due to an increase in families with healthcare.\n\nSeasonal allergies make this a busy time at Woodland Healthcare, he said, but the facility still has some of the lowest rates of admission for asthma in the county.\n\n\u201cEven though the region for Sacramento matches the state average, (Yolo County is) definitely at a lower rate countywide compared to the other areas,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are a number of recognizable symptoms and triggers for asthma, such as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.\n\nWhile seasonal allergies remain the No. 1 trigger, air pollution and exercise can also increase symptoms.\n\nTo control symptoms, Dr. Merchant recommends limiting exposure to those elements which cause problems, hand washing to help prevent transmission of respiratory diseases and using an inhaler to open airways in the lungs.\n\nWhen it comes to medication, doctors focus on the severity of the illness to make decisions on treatment.\n\nAccording to Dr. Merchant, inhalers and Singulair allergy pills are the most common ways of controlling symptoms.\n\nWoodland Care Center has also partnered with Propeller Health to implement a new technology available for those working to manage asthma that involves attaching a sensor attached to the inhaler which measures date, time and the location to provide information on what might be causing asthmatic problems.\n\n\u201cThat helps us to look at overall adherence with medication treatments,\u201d Dr. Merchant said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt also helps them monitor changes in symptom status.\n\nSensors can be paired to mobile technology and web-based data to monitor community patterns and air quality and patients and their doctors can access the data online confidentially.\n\nThe system is also smart enough to send out messages to alert problems so doctors can try to make them feel better before they reach the point of hospitalization or ER visits.\n\nAnd while local asthma problems may be relatively few, statewide the rates of ER visits for asthma symptoms rose by about 18 percent for California children ages 5 to 17 and by 6 percent for children under 5 between 2005 and 2012, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of the latest available rates by county.\n\nAt the national level, asthma-related emergency room visit rates have declined in recent years, according to federal health data through 2010, the latest available.\n\nLoretta Worthington, coordinator of the Asthma Coalition of Los Angeles County and a staff analyst at the county\u2019s department of public health, said she\u2019s been surprised at some doctors\u2019 lack of knowledge about controlling the disease.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of training that still needs to be done,\u201d Worthington said.\n\nThe good news is fewer kids in California are actually being admitted into hospitals. Overnight-or-longer stays are declining statewide and nationally. That\u2019s due largely to better medicines and more aggressive treatment in the ER, asthma specialists say.\n\nThe rising rates don\u2019t seem to reflect an actual increase in the respiratory disease \u2014 about 15 percent of California children have been diagnosed with asthma, a number that has remained fairly steady since 2001.\n\nYounger children visit the ER at higher rates because they are more likely to have undiagnosed asthma and because their lung function is more difficult to measure, complicating the task of finding the right combination of medicines, Kelsey Lamb said.\n\nAcross California, local and regional asthma programs aim to educate families and doctors to help keep kids out of the hospital.\n\nThough often effective, these programs are expensive and can\u2019t serve enough children to make a real difference statewide, said John Capitman, a Cal State Fresno public health professor and executive director of the Central Valley Health Policy Institute. And health outreach workers have found it difficult to get reimbursed by insurers, including Medi-Cal, for proven strategies including home visits to minimize risks, Capitman said.\n\nBecause the emergency visit data don\u2019t extend beyond 2012, it remains unclear how expanded coverage offered since last year under the Affordable Care Act and California\u2019s Medicaid program will affect emergency room visits.\n\nLos Angeles Daily News also contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Children in California increasingly are flocking to emergency rooms for treatment of asthma, despite millions of dollars spent on programs to control the disease.However, Yolo County may be one of the few exceptions.
