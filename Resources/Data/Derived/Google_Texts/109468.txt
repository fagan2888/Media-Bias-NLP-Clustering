This is the largest coffee acquisition by JAB, which is controlled by Germany's billionaire Reimann family. It bought Mondelez International's Europe-focused coffee business in July for around $4 billion, combining it with DE Master Blenders, which it had bought for about $10 billion, to create the world's largest pure-play coffee company.

With Keurig, JAB would expand its U.S. market presence substantially after its Peet's Coffee & Tea unit bought specialty roasters Stumptown and Intelligentsia in October.

The Keurig purchase would help JAB inch closer to market leader Nestle SA. Nestle's global coffee market share was 22.3 percent in 2014, while Mondelez, DE Master Blenders, Keurig and Peet's held a combined 21 percent, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor.

JAB also has holdings in consumer brands like luxury shoe company Jimmy Choo and beauty products company Coty.

Here are what JAB's coffee assets would be after the Keurig deal closes:
