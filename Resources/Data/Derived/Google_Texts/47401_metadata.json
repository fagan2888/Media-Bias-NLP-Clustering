But the federal appeals court said Obamacare's purpose is not to raise revenue, so it did not have to originate in the House.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nA federal appeals court on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit that sought to invalidate the president\u2019s health-care reform law on grounds that the massive piece of legislation did not originate in the House of Representatives as required by the Constitution.\n\nA three-judge panel of the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected the lawsuit filed on behalf of an Iowa artist and part-time National Guardsman.\n\nThe artist, Matt Sissel, pays for medical expenses out of pocket and does not want to be forced to purchase a required level of health insurance or pay a tax to the government.\n\nRecommended: How much do you know about health-care reform? Take our quiz!\n\nHe challenged the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, charging, in part, that Congress followed improper procedure by initiating the health-care law in the Senate rather than the House.\n\nThe Constitution\u2019s Origination Clause says: \u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.\u201d\n\nThe provision is intended to ensure that any effort by Congress to raise money from the American people must first receive the approval of those lawmakers closest to the people \u2013 and presumably more receptive to the wishes and concerns of voters.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s journey from debate to bill to law was somewhat unusual. What would become the ACA was actually drafted in the Senate. Senate Democrats then gutted a bill that passed the House \u2013 offering tax credits to military veterans buying a first home \u2013 jettisoning every provision of that measure. All that remained was the designation \u2013 HR 3590.\n\nInto that empty shell the Senate poured the full contents of what became the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The approved Senate version was then sent to the House for approval.\n\nSissel\u2019s lawyers noted that in 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts upheld the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate on the grounds that it was enacted under Congress\u2019s taxing authority.\n\nThey argued that if the ACA is a tax, it had to have been passed by Congress in compliance with the Origination Clause.\n\nIn rejecting that argument, the appeals court panel said the ACA is not subject to the terms of the Origination Clause because the ACA is not a \u201cbill for raising revenue.\u201d\n\nAs such, the court said it had no reason to conduct a detailed examination of how the ACA was passed in Congress.\n\nIn dismissing the lawsuit, the appeals court said the purpose of the underlying bill was critical to determine whether the Origination Clause would apply.\n\n\u201cAfter the Supreme Court decision [upholding the ACA], it is beyond dispute that the paramount aim of the Affordable Care Act is to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance and decrease the cost of health care, not to raise revenue by means of the shared responsibility payment,\u201d Judge Judith Rogers wrote for the court.\n\nJudge Rogers acknowledged that although the ACA\u2019s individual mandate might raise up to $4 billion a year by 2017, \u201cit is plainly designed to expand health insurance coverage,\u201d rather than to raise revenue.\n\nThe upshot of the appeals court\u2019s ruling is that the ACA\u2019s required payment for failing to purchase health insurance is a \u201ctax\u201d significant enough to support Congress\u2019s authority to pass such a measure, according to the US Supreme Court. But the required payment does not qualify as \u201ctax\u201d for constitutional provisions dictating how Congress passes such legislation, according to the DC Circuit court.\n\nTwo of the judges on the appeals court panel were appointed by President Obama. Rogers was appointed by President Clinton.\n\n\u201cThe mere fact that [the individual insurance mandate] may have been enacted solely pursuant to Congress\u2019s taxing power does not compel the conclusion that the entire Affordable Care Act is a bill for raising revenue subject to the Origination Clause,\u201d Rogers wrote.\n\n\u201cWhere, as here, the Supreme Court has concluded that a provision\u2019s revenue-raising function is incidental to its primary purpose, the Origination Clause does not apply,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of Sissel\u2019s lawyers, Timothy Sandefur of the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, said the court\u2019s decision was \u201cdisappointing.\u201d He suggested they were considering filing an appeal to the US Supreme Court.\n\nMr. Sandefur said the appeals court relied on \u201ca new and unprecedented distinction to exempt the Obamacare tax from the Constitution\u2019s rules for enacting taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution makes no such distinction, and neither does Supreme Court precedent,\u201d Sandefur said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe precedents say that the only kinds of taxes that don\u2019t have to originate in the House are penalties and fines,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Supreme Court itself ruled in 2012 that Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate is not a penalty or a fine. So the Origination Clause should therefore apply.\u201d\n\nSandefur added: \u201cThe DC Circuit for the first time holds that judges can decide for themselves what the \u2018main object or aim\u2019 of a tax is, and then pick and choose whether the constitutional rules on the enactment of new taxation should apply. We think that\u2019s wrong, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be taking to the Supreme Court if necessary.\u201d\n\nThe case is Sissel v.
