According to a Nov. 2013 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study, most Americans are not at college-level proficiency in literacy, math, or technology skills--not even the average US college graduate.



In 2011 and 2012, the OECD administered a standardized test, the Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), to 166,000 adults aged 16-65 in the 24 OECD countries to compare the literacy, math, and technology skills of adults.



The OECD found that 41.77% of Americans hold a bachelor's degree, lower than the OECD average of 42.01%. The United States ranked 14th out of 23 (the UK and Northern Ireland were tested together) in percentage of 25-34 year olds with "tertiary education." Korea was first with 61.63%, followed by Canada (57.26%), and Japan (55.84%). Austria ranked last with 20.34%.



On the literacy proficiency portion of the test, the United States ranked 16th of 23 with 11.51% of adults having an "A" level proficiency, or a college graduate level of reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. The average for all 24 countries was 11.79%. Japan ranked first with 22.56% of adults at an "A" level. Italy ranked the lowest with 3.32%.



On the "numeracy proficiency" (math) portion of the test, the United States ranked 21st of 23 with 8.48% of adults showing an "A" level proficiency. 12.42% was the average for OECD countries. Japan (18.85%) ranked first. Spain (4.06%) ranked last.



The third portion of the test was "proficiency in problem solving in technology-rich environments" and measured how adults used technology to get and use information, communicate with others, and perform tasks, or basic computer literacy skills. The United States ranked 14th of 19 with 5.1% displaying "A" level proficiency. Sweden ranked first with 8.8%. Poland ranked last with 3.8%. Cyprus, Spain, Italy, and France did not participate in this portion of the test.



The OECD compared the scores of high school graduates with those of college graduates. Alex Usher, President of Higher Education Strategy Associates, reports "Japanese high school graduates... have higher literacy levels than university graduates... in England, Denmark, Poland, Italy, and Spain. Think about that. If you were a university rector in one of those countries, what do you think you'd be saying to your higher education minister right about now?" US college graduates scored an average of 8 points higher (297 out of 400 points) than Japanese high school graduates (289 out of 400 points) on the literacy portion.



The OECD noted that in all countries except Japan at least 10% of adults aged 16-65 fell below basic literacy skills, meaning they can only complete "simple tasks" such as finding information in a paragraph or completing one-step math problems but cannot perform more advanced literacy and math skills.



Kevin Carey, Director of the Education Policy Program at the New America Foundation, stated that the report shows that while "American college graduates are far more knowledgeable than American nongraduates, creating a substantial 'wage premium' for diploma holders, they look mediocre or worse compared to their college-educated peers in other nations."



Education Secretary Arne Duncan stated that without better literacy, math, and technology skills, "no matter how hard they work, these adults will be stuck, unable to support their families and contribute fully to our country."
