As Ted Cruz “filibusters” over Obamacare, Twitter has split down party lines between those cheering on the political theater, and those mocking the latest GOP attempt to take down the health care law.

Over on Twitter, Ted Cruz supporters are tweeting under the hashtags #KeepCruzin and #StandWithCruz to show solidarity — and jokesters are also taking the terms and using them to have a little bit of fun during the umpteenth Obamacare debate.

Among Cruz’s detractors are the following Twitter users, who are lampooning his argument and decision to filibuster over Obamacare:

Supporters were also sarcastic:

Wow, President Obama could have played 6 rounds of golf in the amount of time that Ted Cruz has been speaking. #MakeDCListen #StandWithCruz — Ross . (@indyrallen) September 25, 2013

“Atlas Shrugged” by Ayn Rand should be read by every American especially now! #MakeDCListen #StandWithCruz — Janine Turner (@JanineTurner) September 25, 2013

“Different rules should not apply to washington than apply to the American people.” If only that were true.#StandWithCruz — Chuck Woolery (@chuckwoolery) September 25, 2013
