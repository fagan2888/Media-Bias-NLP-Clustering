Not only did the GOP deliver a shellacking to Democrats in Congress, but it also won a number of key governors\u2019 races, including those in Florida, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Kansas, Illinois and Maine.\n\nSo why the wave? Taegen Goddard says the GOP takeover is a direct result of low Democratic turnout; the voting coalition that supported President Barack Obama just didn\u2019t show up to the polls like it did in 2008 and 2012. Goddard points to low turnout among key groups like single women, blacks, Latinos and young voters \u2013 groups that previously drove Obama to victory (and also posted not-so-hot turnout numbers during the 2010 midterms). \u201cIf Democrats were going to hold off a Republican tsunami, they needed their base voters to come out to the polls and pull the lever for the president\u2019s party,\u201d wrote Goddard. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen where Democrats needed it to.\u201d\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on 2014 Congressional Elections]\n\nBut others say the Democrats\u2019 defeat was less on voters than on the party itself. Political infighting between Democratic leadership and the president, say Philip Rucker and Robert Costa at the Washington Post, sowed the seeds for a GOP takeover. \u201cAll year on the trail, Democratic incumbents would be pounded for administration blunders beyond their control,\u201d wrote Rucker and Costa. Repeated attacks on Democratic candidates for the Affordable Care Act\u2019s flawed rollout, for instance, and the backlog at veteran hospitals left Senate leaders with a bitter taste in their mouths.\n\nAnd when Senate leadership pleaded with Obama for funds, they were met with opposition, until just two months out from Election Day. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the political team at the White House truly was up to speed and up to par doing what needed to get done,\u201d said David Krone, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cNo member of the Democratic caucus screwed up the rollout of that health-care Web site,\u201d Krone told the two reporters, \u201cyet they paid the price \u2013 every one of them.\u201d\n\nDespite stumping for a number of races, it seemed Obama had long prepared for the worst, said the New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker. \u201cIn those red states, Mr. Obama was politically toxic and deferred to candidates who asked him to stay away,\u201d said Baker, visiting only five states in the last days before the election. But the president seemed hardly comfortable omitting himself \u2013 or his policies \u2013 from the race. \u201cI am not on the ballot this fall,\u201d Obama said in an Oct. 2 speech in Chicago. \u201cBut make no mistake: these policies are on the ballot. Every single one of them.\" Those words flew directly in the face of what every Democratic candidate was campaigning on: a political future divorced from Obama and his administration.\n\n[READ: Time for a Shake-Up]\n\nPolitico\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere, Manu Raju and John Bresnahan agree. Ultimately, the race came down to one thing: a \"simple message\" from Republicans. \u201cA vote for us is a vote against Obama,\" they wrote. \"And Democrats were never able to escape it.\u201d\n\nBut a Republican sweep may not doom the Democrats for long, says Andrew Kohut at the Pew Research Center. \u201cIf the [Republicans] don\u2019t meet or exceed expectations, given views of Obama and public discontent, it will raise real questions about their long term political viability,\u201d Kohut told the New York Times.\n\nIt would be a mistake, though, to underestimate Republican gains in the lead-up to the 2016 elections, says Times contributor Thomas Edsall. For one, the GOP wrangled its tea party faction, making it tougher for Democrats to paint a picture of the GOP as run by conservative fanatics. Republicans also shrugged off the accusation that they are waging a \u201cwar on women\u201d; Republican Joni Ernst won a Senate seat in Iowa, becoming the first woman elected to Congress in that state, and Mia Love, the GOP\u2019s first black woman in Congress, defeated her Democratic opponent Doug Owens in Utah.\n\n[READ: Both Parties Are in Deep Trouble]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Op-Ed [Opinion]", "title": "Republicans Swept Congress in 2014, Pundits Weigh In", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "What's behind the Republican wave?", "title": "Views You Can Use: A GOP Tsunami", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2014/11/05/republicans-swept-congress-in-2014-pundits-weigh-in", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/ee/22d0864393432eea41ab21b54d1b32/media:c9295c39b31b4d54ad4133da342d418aAPTOPIXSenateKentuckyMcConnell.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What's behind the Republican wave?", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Republicans Swept Congress in 2014, Pundits Weigh In"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Nov. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Rachel Brody,2014 Congressional elections,Obama, Barack,Republican Party,Democratic Party,Congress,Op-Ed [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "What's behind the Republican wave?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1ed\"", "article_summary": "Republicans won big on Tuesday, securing seven seats to seize Senate control (with races in Alaska and Louisiana still up for grabs) and gaining 13 seats in the House.\n\u201cAll year on the trail, Democratic incumbents would be pounded for administration blunders beyond their control,\u201d wrote Rucker and Costa.\nAnd when Senate leadership pleaded with Obama for funds, they were met with opposition, until just two months out from Election Day.\nPolitical infighting between Democratic leadership and the president, say Philip Rucker and Robert Costa at the Washington Post, sowed the seeds for a GOP takeover.\nUltimately, the race came down to one thing: a \"simple message\" from Republicans."}
