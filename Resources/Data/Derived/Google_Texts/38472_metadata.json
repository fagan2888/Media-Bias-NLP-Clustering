(JEREMY PAPASSO)\n\nA man fitting the description of suspects in two recent armed robberies at Subway and Quiznos sandwich shops in Boulder is believed to have been involved in a robbery at Lolita's Market on Christmas Day, police said.\n\nAt 3:50 p.m., an armed suspect took an undetermined amount of cash from the west Pearl Street grocery store and left the building on foot, heading east down Pearl, said Sgt. Jim MacPherson, of the Boulder Police Department.\n\nNo one was injured.\n\nThe suspect was described as a Hispanic male, 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 10 inches in height, who wore a white wrap around his head, a red-and-black striped shirt and blue jeans, MacPherson said.\n\nThe suspect had a gun in his waistband.\n\nIn initial police scanner reports, the suspect was described as a white male wearing a white bandana and sunglasses.\n\nPolice officers and K-9 dogs searched for the suspect. A dog tracked the suspect east to 11th Street, but lost the trail, MacPherson said.\n\n\"It's the same description of the man who had robbed Quiznos and Subway,\" MacPherson said.\n\nOn Dec. 18, a man approached the counter at Quiznos, 1606 Conestoga St., and demanded cash from the lone clerk. The suspect told the employee he had a gun and would shoot her if she did not comply, the clerk told police.\n\nTwo days later, on Friday afternoon, a man walked up to the counter of the Subway at 2539 Arapahoe Ave., demanded cash and lifted his shirt to show what the clerk described as a \"bulge.\" The suspect left with an undisclosed amount of cash.\n\nIn both cases, the suspect was wearing a white cloth or white towel to cover his face.\n\nThe suspect in the Subway robbery was described as a white male, 5-foot-6-inches tall to 5-foot-7-inches tall and between 20 and 30 years old. He was wearing blue jeans and a white-and-blue striped, hooded sweatshirt and a cap with ear flaps. His eyes were possibly blue or green.\n\nThe suspect in the Quiznos robbery was described as Hispanic or Indian, between 5-foot-9-inches and 6 feet tall, and skinny. He was wearing tan or khaki shorts, a grey hooded sweatshirt, brown flat shoes with no socks, a dark blue or black jacket and a dark blue or black knit hat.\n\nHe also was wearing black gloves with three white circle or diamond-shaped patterns on the knuckle area.\n\nThe reported Christmas Day robbery would be the second to occur at Lolita's in two weeks.\n\n\n\nAt 10:48 p.m. on Dec. 9, two suspects wearing black hooded sweatshirts demanded cash from the clerk at the small grocery off Eighth and Pearl streets.\n\n\n\nThe two men stole cash and cigarettes before leaving on foot and heading south along Eighth Street.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2013-12-25T16:27:33-0700", "sailthru.author": "By Alicia Wallace,  Camera Business Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24791131:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "A man fitting the description of suspects in two recent armed robberies at Subway and Quiznos sandwich shops in Boulder is believed to have been involved in a robbery at Lolita's Market on Christmas Day, police said.", "title": "Boulder police seek suspect in Christmas Day robbery of Lolita's Market", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1225/20131225_052616_Robbery001.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2013-12-25T19:52:00-0700", "endDate": "2023-12-25T16:27:33-0700", "news_keywords": "Camera: Top Stories, Camera: Top Stories news, Boulder Colorado Camera: Top Stories news, Boulder Colorado news, Camera: Top Stories Boulder news, Camera: Top Stories Colorado news, US Camera: Top Stories news, world Camera: Top Stories news.", "byline": "By Alicia Wallace,", "pubDate": "2013-12-25T16:32:30-0700", "sailthru.date": "2013-12-25T16:27:33-0700", "sailthru.title": "Boulder police seek suspect in Christmas Day robbery of Lolita's Market", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1225/20131225_052616_Robbery001_300.jpg", "description": "A man fitting the description of suspects in two recent armed robberies at Subway and Quiznos sandwich shops in Boulder is believed to have been involved in a robbery at Lolita's Market on Christmas Day, police said.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "A man fitting the description of suspects in two recent armed robberies at Subway and Quiznos sandwich shops in Boulder is believed to have been involved in a robbery at Lolita's Market on Christmas Day, police said.", "title": "Boulder police seek suspect in Christmas Day robbery of Lolita's Market"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1225/20131225_052616_Robbery001.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc463\"", "article_summary": "The suspect in the Quiznos robbery was described as Hispanic or Indian, between 5-foot-9-inches and 6 feet tall, and skinny.\nHe was wearing blue jeans and a white-and-blue striped, hooded sweatshirt and a cap with ear flaps.\nThe suspect in the Subway robbery was described as a white male, 5-foot-6-inches tall to 5-foot-7-inches tall and between 20 and 30 years old.\nIn initial police scanner reports, the suspect was described as a white male wearing a white bandana and sunglasses.\nThe reported Christmas Day robbery would be the second to occur at Lolita's in two weeks."}
