Ready to talk about my opinions and the way we deal with Gaza. Please, ama.\u201d In it, u/Eylo answers both serious and basic questions alike, admitting that he could face serious consequences for his internet candor \u2014 but that he feels openly discussing his IDF duties is worth the risk.\n\nOne user asks about the common claim that Hamas uses human shields to evade Israeli defense, to which he replies:\n\n\u201cAs far as I know it is. They form bases under schools and hospitals. They put launchers in families homes. This is way Israel can\u2019t complete the operation with air strikes alone, and says it need to physicly march in to Gaza.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the legality of the IDF soldier AMA, he replies:\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t get caught. But it could cost me some jail time. But I think that having an intelligent conversation does us more good.\u201d\n\nAnother user asks about land entitlement, and Israel\u2019s justification for use of force. The soldier replies:\n\n\u201cA tough one\u2026 I don\u2019t believe the Jewish narrative (or any other nation\u2019s narrative) for birth right. Which raises the question of why did I sign in. Well, I want to protect my loved ones.\u201d\n\n\u201cReddit Gold,\u201d an on-site currency awarded from user to user for exceptionally useful comments, was given to u/Eylo for that comment, and below it, a Palestinian redditor also received Reddit Gold for his reply:\n\n\u201cI am a Palestinian supporter and you have my respect. I believe Israel should be safe and sovereign and Palestine along side it as well.\u201d\n\nAnother user piped in:\n\n\u201cOk awesome, let\u2019s just put you two in charge and we can get this thing sorted before dinner.\u201d\n\nu/Eylo added:\n\n\u201cWe will still need our people\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nWhen one heavily downvoted user asked why the IDF doesn\u2019t use more lethal force indiscriminately against Palestinians, he quipped:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t play this way. I don\u2019t kill for the sake of killing. They are people. Plus, more virgins for me.\u201d\n\nHe adds of a separate story alleging Palestinian kids were fired upon:\n\n\u201cIf this story is true, the soldiers should be [locked] in prison and publicly exposed.\u201d\n\nFinally, and somewhat movingly as a front-lines soldier, his response to a question on whether he sees all Palestinians as he sees Hamas was answered thusly:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe they feel the same. Not all of them. I believe people are born good. You can\u2019t corrupt a whole nation.\u201d\n\nYou can read the IDF soldier\u2019s entire AMA here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reddit's \"AMA\" threads (Ask Me Anything) range from the mundane to the fascinating -- and a current Reddit AMA from an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier is", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Reddit\u2019s \u201cAMA\u201d threads (Ask Me Anything) range from the mundane to the fascinating \u2014 and a current Reddit AMA from an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier is", "title": "IDF Soldier Does Illegal Reddit AMA", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1357831/idf-soldier-does-illegal-reddit-ama/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reddit-IDF-AMA.png", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-17T12:39:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-17T13:03:57+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reddit-IDF-AMA.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-07-17T12:39:11+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "idf reddit ama,israeli defense forces,reddit,reddit ama,news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/reddit-IDF-AMA.png", "width": 670, "height": 409}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Reddit\u2019s \u201cAMA\u201d threads (Ask Me Anything) range from the mundane to the fascinating \u2014 and a current Reddit AMA from an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier is"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40fb\"", "article_summary": "Reddit\u2019s \u201cAMA\u201d threads (Ask Me Anything) range from the mundane to the fascinating \u2014 and a current Reddit AMA from an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier is technically illegal but very interesting.\nThe soldier replies:\u201cA tough one\u2026 I don\u2019t believe the Jewish narrative (or any other nation\u2019s narrative) for birth right.\nThe thread is titled \u201cIama IDF (Israeli) solider.\nThis is way Israel can\u2019t complete the operation with air strikes alone, and says it need to physicly march in to Gaza.\u201dWhen asked about the legality of the IDF soldier AMA, he replies:\u201cI won\u2019t get caught.\nYou can\u2019t corrupt a whole nation.\u201dYou can read the IDF soldier\u2019s entire AMA here."}
