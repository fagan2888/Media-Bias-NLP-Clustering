But she said Congress would continue to fight the administration's unilateral efforts to delay parts of the law without input from Congress.\"That's why we took the actions we did last week with the Enforce Act and a couple of other pieces of legislation\u2026 to let us go after the administration when they overstep their bounds,\" she said.Last week, House Republicans passed legislation to delay the individual mandate for five years, a step that the Obama administration said would further undermine the law by letting people escape the requirement to participate by purchasing a health plan.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
