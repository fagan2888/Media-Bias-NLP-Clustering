(We called it the Tidewater Paradox, after a Supreme Court case from the 1940s that illustrated the paradox in a particularly clear way.)\n\nThe Tidewater Paradox, in its most basic form, looks like this. Suppose a three-judge appellate panel hears an appeal of some garden variety tort or contract action raising two issues: e.g., whether plaintiff had standing to sue and whether plaintiff proved the required elements of the cause of action. Each of the three judges \u2014 let\u2019s call them Jefferson, Hamilton, and Madison \u2014 having read the briefs and listened to oral argument, independently reaches the following conclusions about the case:\n\nDoes P have standing? Did P prove the required elements? Outcome: Who wins?\n\nJefferson YES NO DEFENDANT\n\nHamilton NO YES DEFENDANT\n\nMadison YES YES PLAINTIFF\n\nWho wins this case? The court believes (2 to 1) that plaintiff has standing, and (2 to 1) that she has proved the required claim elements. So plaintiff should win, right? But two of three judges think the defendant should prevail \u2014 should that carry the day?\n\nWhat do courts actually do \u2014 and what should they do \u2014 when they\u2019re faced with a situation like this? When our three judges meet in conference to decide the case after argument, does Jefferson, the senior judge, say \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go around the table. I think P has standing here, because blah blah \u2026 What does each of you think? \u2026\u201d And then, after doing the same thing for issue 2, the court issues its judgment for the plaintiff.\n\nOr does Jefferson give his view of the preferred outcome (\u201cI\u2019m for D. P never proved element 2 of the cause of action.\u201d) and then poll the other two judges for each of their preferred outcomes, after which the court issues its judgment for the defendant?\n\nIt must happen a lot. And it is, one would think, quite fundamental to how appellate courts go about their business.\n\n[The first of the Obamacare decisions provided an important recent example of the paradox in action; as I blogged about at the time (here and here ), the question of whether the court issued a precedential \u201cholding\" on the question of whether the Obamacare statute was invalid under the commerce clause depended on whether one views the court\u2019s decision-making process as involving outcome-voting or issue-voting.]\n\nYou would think that the hundreds of appellate courts in this country would \u2014 long ago \u2014 have addressed this matter, and come up with a procedure or protocol that they would follow when performing this most basic of their functions. Indeed, one might even say that a multi-member court can\u2019t really go about its business of deciding cases until it first decides how it is going to decide \u2014 by outcome-voting or by issue-voting.\n\nBut in fact, there are only a handful of examples where courts publicly address their choice of voting procedure or their views on the proper means to resolve the Paradox.\n\nSalop and I argued that while outcome-voting appears to be the (unspoken) norm for appellate courts, outcome-voting \u201ccannot guide lower courts, leads to an incoherent body of precedent, and sacrifices the benefits of collegial decision-making,\u201d and that the issue-voting protocol is \u2014 at least in most cases \u2014 a \u201csuperior decision-making procedure.\u201d\n\nWhich brings me to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit decision handed down last week (Hanover 321 Realty v. Village Supermarkets, available here), where the panel members forthrightly engage with the question of developing what one of them refers to as a proper \u201cvoting protocol protocol.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the case, in a nutshell. Hanover Realty, the plaintiff, signed a contract with Wegmans to build a Wegmans supermarket on Hanover\u2019s property. Hanover was required to secure all necessary governmental permits and approvals prior to breaking ground. The defendant, Village Supermarkets, owns the local ShopRite supermarket, and, not particularly thrilled that Wegmans would be entering the market, filed \u201cnumerous administrative and court challenges to Hanover Realty\u2019s permit applications.\u201d Hanover, \u201cbelieving these filings were baseless and intended only to frustrate the entry of a competitor,\u201d sued defendants for antitrust violations.\n\nThe court addressed two issues on appeal. First, did plaintiff Hanover have standing to bring an antitrust claim (given that it was neither a competitor nor a customer of the defendant\u2019s)? And second, was defendant immune from the antitrust claims under what is known as the Noerr-Pennington Doctrine \u2014 a rather abstruse bit of antitrust law that \u201cprovides broad immunity from antitrust liability to those who petition the government, including administrative agencies and courts, for redress of their grievances.\u201d\n\nThe three judges on the panel split as follows:\n\nDoes P have standing? Is D immune under Noerr? Outcome: Who wins?\n\nFuentes YES NO PLAINTIFF\n\nAmbro NO NO DEFENDANT\n\nGreenberg YES YES DEFENDANT\n\nThe court \u2013 \u2013 much to the evident dismay of Judge Greenberg \u2014 issues a judgment for the plaintiff .\n\nJudge Ambro, though he would have ruled for the defendant were he deciding the case on his own, sides with Fuentes in ruling for the plaintiff:\n\nI respectfully disagree with my colleagues\u2019 view that Hanover 3201 Realty has suffered antitrust injury, a necessary component of antitrust standing\u2026. However, I recognize that my colleagues\u2019 view of antitrust standing is, by virtue of their ruling, the holding of our Court and now the law of this Circuit. In this context, I believe I am obliged to consider the merits of Hanover\u2019s suit\u2026. I agree with Judge Fuentes that Village\u2019s Noerr\u2013Pennington immunity defense is a sham and hence unavailing at this stage. Thus I vote [in Plaintiff\u2019s favor] to vacate the judgment of the District Court [which had dismissed Plaintiff\u2019s claim.] (emphasis added)\n\nAmbro expressly adopts an issue-voting protocol for the case, and provides a lengthy rationale for doing so.\n\nThis case presents what academic literature terms a \u201cvoting paradox.\u201d On the one hand, two judges (Judge Greenberg and I) believe that the outcome should be that Hanover\u2019s suit not proceed, though we do so for different reasons. However, one majority of this Court (Judges Fuentes and Greenberg) believes that Hanover has antitrust standing (I do not because I do not discern antitrust injury), while another majority (Judge Fuentes and I) believes that Hanover should survive Village\u2019s motion to dismiss (assuming it has antitrust standing). The paradox is that, if I vote on the judgment of this case (affirm or reverse) based on my individual views, a majority of the Court will have ruled against the prevailing party on each relevant issue, meaning that our Court\u2019s reasoning would not support its judgment. However, if I follow, despite my dissent, Judge Fuentes and Greenberg on the antitrust standing issue, my individual vote would be inconsistent with my view of who should win were I alone ruling. But to me it is significant that we are not acting alone. Because we need to act as a Court, I think it is more appropriate for me to be bound by the majority\u2019s opinion on antitrust standing despite my disagreement with it.\n\nHe also points to the \u201cproblem of incoherent precedent\u201d if the court adopts outcome-voting \u2014 ruling for the defendant even though a majority of the court believes that Hanover has standing and a majority believes that the defendant is not immune. Why not, he asks, \u201cjust issue judgment orders without reasoning in every case and save everyone a lot of time and paper\u201d?\n\nIn my view, we issue judgments accompanied by reasoned opinions because the rule of law ought neither to be nor appear to be arbitrary. It follows that judgments should be supported by reasoning, that the reasoning should actually support the outcome in a particular case, and that in this case I should yield to my colleagues on antitrust standing and vote on the Noerr-Pennington issue that follows.\n\nHe suggests the following meta-principle \u2014 the voting protocol protocol \u2014 to guide the court in the future:\n\nAs we have seen, appellate judges have little to guide their discretion in choosing a voting protocol. This case prompts me to argue for one guidepost: when an appellant raises \u201carguments that would constitute independent appeals were interlocutory appeals permissible,\u201d issue voting is preferable.\n\nJudge Greenberg, dissenting, disagrees:\n\nAlthough it is not my place to tell Judge Ambro how and on what issues to vote, I write here to express my view that a multimember panel should reach the result that follows from the independent views of its members. Judge Ambro\u2019s willingness to be bound by the Fuentes-Greenberg majority\u2019s position on antitrust standing trumps his own conclusion on the standing issue and runs counter to the longstanding and widespread practice of the federal courts of appeals of counting judges\u2019 views as to outcome and not as to individual issues. Although some scholars have criticized this prevailing practice, critics and proponents alike acknowledge its acceptance among the courts\u2026. In my view, this case can be resolved by making simple mathematical calculations that do not require that we use a super computer: (1) one and one make two, and (2) two out of three is a majority.\n\nSo the issue is \u2014 finally! \u2014 joined; I\u2019m not aware of another case that engages the issue as forthrightly, nor one that lays out the opposing positions as clearly.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve followed this far, and haven\u2019t had enough of this headache-inducing complexity, consider this: Notice that Judge Fuentes drops a footnote does not expressly address the paradox, he must be implicitly (footnote 1) expressly siding with Ambro in applying the issue-voting rule. Thus, one might even say that this panel has adopted issue-voting as its voting protocol protocol, by a 2-to-1 majority, with Fuentes and Ambro in the majority, and that this is a precedential holding (at least for the 3rd Circuit)! Great stuff, this.\n\n[Thanks to the Third Circuit Blog for the pointer]\n\n[UPDATE: Thanks to reader Bill Burgess for pointing out that Judge Fuentes did indeed address the issue-voting vs outcome-voting question in his footnote 1, which I had inadvertently missed on first reading]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jurisprudence nerd alert: A Third Circuit panel confronts (and resolves) the Tidewater Voting Paradox: that there are many occasions in which multi-member courts cannot issue judgments that simultaneously (a) reflect the preferences of a majority of the judges and (b) give valid precedents for future cases.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Jurisprudence nerd alert: A Third Circuit panel confronts (and resolves) the Tidewater Voting Paradox: that there are many occasions in which multi-member courts cannot issue judgments that simultaneously (a) reflect the preferences of a majority of the judges and (b) give valid precedents for future cases.", "title": "Wild voting paradox case in the 3rd Circuit", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/11/16/wild-voting-paradox-case-in-the-3rd-circuit/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/11/16/wild-voting-paradox-case-in-the-3rd-circuit/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "(We called it the Tidewater Paradox, after a Supreme Court case from the 1940s that illustrated the paradox in a particularly clear way.)\nThus, one might even say that this panel has adopted issue-voting as its voting protocol protocol, by a 2-to-1 majority, with Fuentes and Ambro in the majority, and that this is a precedential holding (at least for the 3rd Circuit)!\nHe suggests the following meta-principle \u2014 the voting protocol protocol \u2014 to guide the court in the future:As we have seen, appellate judges have little to guide their discretion in choosing a voting protocol.\nHowever, I recognize that my colleagues\u2019 view of antitrust standing is, by virtue of their ruling, the holding of our Court and now the law of this Circuit.\nThis case presents what academic literature terms a \u201cvoting paradox.\u201d On the one hand, two judges (Judge Greenberg and I) believe that the outcome should be that Hanover\u2019s suit not proceed, though we do so for different reasons."}
