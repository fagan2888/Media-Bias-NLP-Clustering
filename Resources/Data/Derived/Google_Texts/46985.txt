Trump concluded, “We’re going to have people, where there’s going to be a certain segment of our society that doesn’t have anything. And we’re going to have to take care of it, and we’re going to — maybe through Medicare. We’re going to send them to hospitals and to doctors. we’re going to take care of them. … And some people call that a mandate. It’s not a mandate.”
