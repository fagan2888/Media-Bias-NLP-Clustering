LOS ANGELES — Boulder’s Kara Goucher was devastated Saturday after failing to make the Olympic team in the marathon, crying through much of her finish-area interviews, sometimes sobbing.

But she was defiant on the subject of her former coach, Alberto Salazar of the Nike Oregon Project, who is being investigated by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. Goucher was disturbed by some of Salazar’s methods, and she took her concerns to USADA chief Travis Tygart. She also furnished information in a BBC documentary.

“Do you think everything I know came out in the BBC documentary? No. There’s an investigation going on,” Goucher said. “There will be a day. … I’ve done all I can do at this point. I believe in Travis. The first time I (talked) to USADA, I said, ‘All I want them to do is stop doing what they’re doing.’ “

Goucher, 37, left Salazar in 2011. She spent three more years in Oregon but returned returned to Boulder in 2014, making a comeback with coaches Mark Wetmore and Heather Burroughs. The men’s race Saturday was won by Galen Rupp, a debut marathoner who is coached by Salazar. Rupp won a silver medal in the 10,000 meters at the 2012 Olympics.

“They don’t have any impact on my life anymore,” Goucher said. “They can do nothing to me anymore and justice is coming. People asked, how did you come back? Letting go of that (stuff) is how I came back. I lost 200 pounds of baggage I’ve been carrying around and they can’t touch me anymore.”

Rupp didn’t have much to say about the USADA investigation.

“All I can say is that I’ve always been an advocate for clean sport, and I’ve worked really hard over the years to get where I’m at today,” Rupp said. “I’m cooperating with whatever officials I need to cooperate with.”
