Gates: U.S. still No. 1 in innovation\n\nGates also said the U.S. needs to have education standards \u201cthat are high enough that we are competitive with other countries.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith tax reform also waiting in the wings on Capitol Hill, Gates believes medical costs present the biggest challenge for the U.S. budget.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid that we\u2019ve been distracted from the issue of why we spend so much more than others,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis should be a technocratic thing, not a partisan thing, why this system is not working as efficiently as it could.\u201d\n\nGates and his wife, Melinda, released their annual letter this week. In it, they project the mortality rate of children worldwide will be cut in half by 2030, and mobile banking will help 2.5 billion people who currently don\u2019t have access to inexpensive financial services.\n\nThe Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation remains focused on fighting polio as well. Gates predicated that in a couple years, polio will become the second disease to be eradicated.\n\nGates also remarked on the future of Microsoft (MSFT), where he now serves as a technology advisor. Earlier this week, the software giant unveiled its next operating system, Windows 10, along with new innovations in virtual reality.\n\nAccording to Gates, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella is driving the company to lead in areas \u201cwhere we hadn\u2019t been the leader before,\u201d such as mobile and cloud computing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very competitive business,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain energy about the company. [Nadella] gets advice from me on some particular areas. I\u2019m glad to help.\u201d\n\n2015 Gates Annual Letter", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/TECHNOLOGY/Cloud Computing,/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care,/FOX BUSINESS/BUSINESS
