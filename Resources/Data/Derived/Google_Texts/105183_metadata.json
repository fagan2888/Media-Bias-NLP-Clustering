Galloway, the auditor, said the city deserved the worst rating possible of \u201cpoor\u201d for how it managed recovery spending. She has referred some of the problems to prosecutors for potential charges.\n\nIn one egregious case the auditor hinted at corruption, saying the process to select the master developer for recovery may have been rigged, and appeared to be written for one company to win. That company had been paid about $1.5 million as of January, or nearly four years after the tornado, yet \u201cno redevelopment had occurred.\u201d\n\nMore than 160 people were killed and more than 1,000 injured by the May 22, 2011, tornado that tore through the town, leveling thousands of homes and destroying schools and a hospital.
