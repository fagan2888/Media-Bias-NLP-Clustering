His scrapbook is half as thick as the others, and by the time he\u2019s old enough to care, the family has already done all the cool vacations and sightseeing trips.\n\nOh, all right, so the middle child probably gets ripped off, too. Or, at least, that\u2019s the way it might appear, because you middles never really speak up about it. You guys are quiet like that.\n\nMy middle son, Owen, rarely complains, even though he could often make a good case. He\u2019s shared a room with a brother since \u2014 literally \u2014 the day we brought him home for the hospital. I didn\u2019t feel sorry for him because many siblings share a room. I had planned for it to be that way until the kids went to college.\n\nOwen\u2019s first bed \u2014 his crib \u2014 was next to big-brother Ford\u2019s toddler bed. Ford was two at the time. He had just been evicted from the crib when I went into labor early with Owen, and we were worried that he might try to crawl back in, or, worse, put blankets and pillows in there with Owen. So Owen\u2019s crib had a mesh, pop-up tent around it. He looked like he was sleeping on a safari. In the morning, we had to unzip the tent and get him out. The whole thing was rather ridiculous, but the setup kept curious brothers safely out of the area. And if we had had a cat, it would have kept it out of the crib, too.\n\nEventually Owen moved into a toddler bed \u2014 right next to Ford\u2019s. In all of our first four homes (thanks to all those Navy moves), Ford and Owen were always roommates. Late at night, while I was rocking baby Lindell in the other room, I could hear Ford reading books aloud to Owen. Sometimes, I would yell for them to \u201cturn off the lights and go to bed already!\u201d Until that time Owen yelled back, \u201cBut he\u2019s almost done reading me the Bible, Mommy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well \u2026 carry on, then.\u201d\n\nWhen Ford started third grade, he got a hankering to have his own room. This seemed to bother Owen at first. And, honestly, I wasn\u2019t going to allow Ford to move because I had always said that brothers sharing a room isn\u2019t such a bad thing. I mean, there are worse things in life, certainly. Except, by then, Lindell wasn\u2019t a baby anymore, and I worried that he felt left out. While Ford and Owen giggled in their room, Lindell was alone in his.\n\nSo I let Ford move into a different room, and for about 12 (daytime) hours, Owen had a room to himself.\n\nI wish I could say the process was as easy as it seems, but the whole thing was a lot like a divorce. Emotions ran high, and there were plenty of belongings to divvy up. Ford started to lock up high-value items in his new room because he knew Owen might try to retrieve them. Owen stared gloomily at the blank walls where Ford\u2019s pictures used to hang. He made an argument that at least half of those pictures were his. Right?\n\nBut by bedtime, we had already moved Lindell into Ford\u2019s old spot. Now half of Owen\u2019s room was filled with Scooby Doo, toy trains, stuffed animals and picture books.\n\nStill, he didn\u2019t complain.\n\nThrough the ensuing years, Owen would periodically point out that Lindell snores and talks in his sleep. Owen had trouble falling asleep because of this. Also, as he matured, he was tired of having half the room belong to someone still in kindergarten.\n\nThis fall, Owen finally complained. \u201cI want my own room,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything to myself since the day I was born.\u201d\n\nI was rather unsympathetic. Remember, there are worse things than sharing a room with a younger brother.\n\nThe pleading continued.\n\nAnd then one day, Lindell said, \u201cI\u2019ll move out, Owen, and you can have your own room.\u201d\n\nI was so surprised and touched by Lindell\u2019s selflessness, I allowed the move to happen. We converted an unused room upstairs into Lindell\u2019s new bedroom. Everyone had their own space, and Owen nearly burst with the possibilities of what to do with \u201chis very own room.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, as I lay in my bed across the hall from Lindell, I heard what sounded like a chain saw cutting wood. It was Lindell snoring. Then I heard talking. And more snoring. He snored (very loudly) all night.\n\nI thought, \u201cIs this what Owen was talking about all those years? Is this what he slept through? And he never complained?\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I knew: Someday, when Owen is in college, his experiences sharing a room with Ford and Lindell are going to make him the most tolerant roommate ever. That, and also because he\u2019s a middle child.\n\nMaine author and columnist Sarah Smiley\u2019s writing is syndicated weekly to publications across the country.
