But final decisions about rules are made by that agency\u2019s governing commission, of which he is not a member. His comments came as top U.S. regulators are debating how to regulate non-bank firms after years of adopting new restrictions on banks.\n\nOn Monday, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer floated several ideas for regulating shadow banks, some of which might take SEC action to implement. On Tuesday, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart noted so-called shadow banks\u2019 \u201clarge, growing presence\u201d and pointed out that sector is \u201cmuch less regulated than banks.\u201d\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Tuesday regulators should be focused on regulatory gaps, noting that there are no longer \u201cbright lines\u201d between banks and non-banks, but instead \u201c50 Shades of Grey. \u201d \u201cAnd as you know with 50 Shades of Grey, it can be painful,\u201d she quipped, in reference to the popular novel.\n\nManagers of non-bank firms, such as bond mutual funds, have questioned whether there are significant threats to the financial system in the so-called shadow banking sector. Barbara Novick, Vice Chairman at BlackRock, the largest asset manager, told the crowd of economists, regulatory officials and Wall Street executives here that her firm is concerned regulators haven\u2019t clearly identified and documented risks in the sector. BlackRock is in favor of \u201ccleaner, safer neighborhood\u201d in which the industry as a whole improves risk management, but \u201cwe\u2019re not necessarily in favor of all the regulation that we hear about,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The SEC\u2019s chief economist questioned whether U.S. regulators have taken the right approach in bulletproofing large banks as they seek to make the financial system safer.", "title": "SEC Official: \u2018Not Clear\u2019 Bank Regulation Has Made Economy Safer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/01/sec-official-not-clear-bank-regulation-has-made-economy-safer/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AI549_08TW2_G_20141107175547.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "SEC Official: \u2018Not Clear\u2019 Bank Regulation Has Made Economy Safer", "description": "The SEC\u2019s chief economist questioned whether U.S. regulators have taken the right approach in bulletproofing large banks as they seek to make the financial system safer.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Ryan Tracy", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "The SEC\u2019s chief economist questioned whether U.S. regulators have taken the right approach in bulletproofing large banks as they seek to make the financial system safer.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-04-01T12:29:03-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/01/sec-official-not-clear-bank-regulation-has-made-economy-safer/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-35114", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The SEC\u2019s chief economist questioned whether U.S. regulators have taken the right approach in bulletproofing large banks as they seek to make the financial system safer.", "title": "SEC Official: \u2018Not Clear\u2019 Bank Regulation Has Made Economy Safer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/01/sec-official-not-clear-bank-regulation-has-made-economy-safer/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AI549_08TW2_G_20141107175547.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-35114", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-04-01T14:19:36-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdceb3\"", "article_summary": "On Monday, Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer floated several ideas for regulating shadow banks, some of which might take SEC action to implement.\nHis comments came as top U.S. regulators are debating how to regulate non-bank firms after years of adopting new restrictions on banks.\nManagers of non-bank firms, such as bond mutual funds, have questioned whether there are significant threats to the financial system in the so-called shadow banking sector.\nBut final decisions about rules are made by that agency\u2019s governing commission, of which he is not a member.\n\u201d \u201cAnd as you know with 50 Shades of Grey, it can be painful,\u201d she quipped, in reference to the popular novel."}
