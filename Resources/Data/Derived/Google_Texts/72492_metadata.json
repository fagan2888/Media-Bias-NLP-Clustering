Hardly any medium is spared: the toolkit has tutorials teaching parents how to effectively nag their children via Snapchat, Vine, Twitter and OkCupid, in addition to Tinder.\n\n\u201cYour kids don\u2019t want to get health insurance. They also don\u2019t want to get nagged,\u201d a message on the toolkit\u2019s website reads. \u201cLet\u2019s find out which one they want less. Help us get your kids insured by nagging them about health insurance where they least expect it.\u201d\n\nNightmare.\n\nSome examples of the stalking methods the site recommends to parents are to create a Tinder profile through Facebook and add a profile picture holding a sign that says \u201cGet Health Insurance,\u201d and then \u201cLike\u201d the same things as their children on Facebook to increase their Tinder compatibility. For OkCupid, the NAG toolkit recommends that parents create a provocative username for their profile, find his or her children, and send them messages saying \u201cGet Health Insurance.\u201d\n\nFor the technologically challenged parent, the site leaves a final option to enter their child\u2019s email address.\n\n\u201cIf this all seems too confusing, give us your kid\u2019s email address and we\u2019ll do the nagging,\u201d the site reads.\n\nThe Rhode Island example is yet another direct appeal to parents \u2014 in particular, moms \u2014 to get their kids to enroll through an Affordable Care Act exchange. Obamacare\u2019s financial health depends on attracting a large number of youth to help offset the costs of older, sicker patients. However, only a quarter of signups thus far have come from those between the ages of 18 and 35, far below the 38 percent target the administration had initially set.\n\n(h/t Campus Reform)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Imagine swiping through singles on Tinder and then seeing your mom or dad\u2019s face with a sign that says \"Get Health Insurance.\" Because, you know, that\u2019s not creepy at all.", "title": "Obamacare exchange encourages parents to nag their children on...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/03/nag-toolkit-600x349.jpg", "height": 349}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/17/obamacare-exchange-encourages-parents-to-nag-their-children-on-tinder/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "vine", "published_time": "2014-03-17T17:19:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T17:19:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Rhode Island Obamacare exchange HealthSource RI has provided a \u201cNAG toolkit\u201d encouraging parents to get on popular social media utilities and \u201cnag\u201d their kids about signing up for health insurance.\nHardly any medium is spared: the toolkit has tutorials teaching parents how to effectively nag their children via Snapchat, Vine, Twitter and OkCupid, in addition to Tinder.\nHelp us get your kids insured by nagging them about health insurance where they least expect it.\u201dNightmare.\nImagine swiping through singles on Tinder and then seeing your mom or dad\u2019s face with a sign that says \u201cGet Health Insurance.\u201d Because, you know, that\u2019s not creepy at all.\n\u201cYour kids don\u2019t want to get health insurance."}
