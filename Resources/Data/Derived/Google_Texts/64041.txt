Americans love to brag about their work ethic. Today, Americans report working an average of 44 hours per week, the highest average in the 35 years Gallup has been tracking the statistic. More than 40 percent of workers report putting in more than 45 hours a week at their job.

All that work seems to be taking its toll. More than half of American office workers say that they feel burnt out, and about half feel like they can’t get up for a break at all during the day, according to a recent report from Staples Advantage, the business-to-business arm of the Staples office supply store. About half of employees polled said that they feel they can’t get up for a break at all, and just under half eat lunch at their desk.

The culture of working around the clock, however, varies depending on where you live. WalletHub recently crunched the numbers to find America’s hardest-working cities. The site considered several metrics for the rankings, including the local labor force participation rate, average weekly work and commuting hours, the number of workers with multiple jobs, and average daily leisure time.

Anchorage, Alaska, took the top spot as the hardest working city in the country, followed by Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Plano, Texas.

At the other end of the spectrum, the survey found that the least-hardest working cities were Burlington, Vermont, Detroit, Michigan, and Providence, Rhode Island.
