Terrazas says this is her first time learning about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThough her daughters have healthcare coverage through the state, Terrazas says that neither she nor her husband have had insurance in seven years because it has never been offered by their employers. When asked what she hopes to get out of the new coverage, she says, \u201cTo be able to go to the doctor and pay less. My husband got sick yesterday and had to pay $100 for his medication.\u201d\n\nThough she is interested in the new exchanges, Terrazas says she doesn\u2019t have enough information to make any decisions and would like to know about the documentation she needs in order to apply.\n\nDaniel Olvera, an In Person Counselor (IPC) at Healthcare Alternative Systems in Humboldt Park, provided Terrazas with more information and invited her to fill out a pre-enrollment form, make an appointment, and attend a workshop.\n\nRELATED: Over half of Latinos don\u2019t know key aspects of new health care law, says survey\n\nOlvera says that the goal was to begin enrolling people by October 1st, but that was then pushed back to November 2nd because of problems with the website. Though these issues have received negative press, Olvera believes that this setbacks have had positive consequences.\n\n\u201cThe system is still down, unfortunately, so what we\u2019re doing is informing people of their options, let them know the different kinds of plans there are and explain all the terms we were not taught in school,\u201d says Olvera. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. The more informed people are, the better choices they can make. If we were enrolling, they would feel pressured to make a decision quicker.\u201d\n\nIn Person Counselor Sam Flores says that although people have been persuaded by the negative press, he believes they simply need to be given the right information. \u201cBasically, what I see are families and individuals that have a need for this program, they come to this program with open arms and a strong desire to, obviously, seek healthcare for themselves and their families,\u201d says Flores.\n\nCurrently, 10.2 million Latinos are uninsured. According to Olvera, one of the main challenges in working in the Latino community is easing their suspicions. His organization primarily works with Latino families who have small children. Many of them are mixed-status families in which the parents are undocumented and the children are citizens.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping them navigate that system. Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act does not apply to undocumented people,\u201d says Olvera. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of suspicion. After all, we\u2019re asking for a lot of information. We\u2019re going to be asking about their income, their date of birth, and so it makes them very uneasy when a government agency is asking them for all of this information. Our job has been to calm them down and let them know that their information is completely private and is only for the purposes of enrolling them into health care.\u201d\n\nOlvera says he and his fellow In Person Counselors stress that they will not have any physical copies of the families\u2019 applications, and they make sure to show the applicants that their information is deleted from the iPad as soon as it\u2019s submitted.\n\nNot only do the IPCs have to gain the applicant\u2019s trust, they must also navigate language and cultural barriers. Olvera says that although many counselors speak Spanish, many of them are not necessarily familiar with the Spanish terminology, which can lead to communication issues.\n\nOlvera has also noticed that many Latinos, both in his family and in the community, feel like they don\u2019t have control over their health and believe that it\u2019s \u201cIn God\u2019s hands.\u201d Because of this, many of them don\u2019t actively seek the care they need. \u201cTo let them know the immediacy of healthcare is a road block,\u201d Olvera says. He hopes that because the ACA is focused on preventative care, people start going to their primary care physicians instead of emergency rooms.\n\nApplicants are also worried about the costs, Olvera says. \u201cPeople are also worried about their premiums going up, without taking into account that a lot of them are going to qualify for premium tax credits or cost sharing options.\u201d\n\nMarcos Miegha, 52, who is currently disabled and unable to work, says although he has health insurance through his wife, it\u2019s much too expensive. He\u2019s hoping that the new exchanges will offer a better alternative for his family. \u201cI need to know my options\u2013 surgeries, doctor\u2019s appointments, copays,\u201d says Miegha, who needs frequent doctor visits. \u201cMy main concern is the out-of-pocket costs.\u201d\n\nBecause the families they work with are primarily very low-income, Olvera says that many of them actually qualify for Medicaid or CountyCare if they live in Cook County. Governor Pat Quinn recently expanded Medicaid coverage in Illinois, which will go into effect January of 2014.\n\nAlthough organizations are hoping to sign up as many people as possible, Olvera says there is definitely a push to get healthy people to enroll.\n\n\u201cIn order for healthcare to work, you have to have a large pool of otherwise healthy adults in the system paying their premiums so people that are sick can have their healthcare covered,\u201d he says.\n\nBut he believes that many young and people will begin to enroll when they are threatened with fines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s required by law to be enrolled. That\u2019s one of the things a lot of people aren\u2019t emphasizing,\u201d Olvera says.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "NBC Latino", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Latino", "description": "MELROSE PARK, IL - Last Saturday afternoon, dozens of families interested in healthcare browsed the informational booths at the Kathleen\u2026", "title": "In a Chicago suburb, helping Latino families navigate new healthcare\u00a0options", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://nbclatino.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/chicagohealth4colorcorrect1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://nbclatino.com/2013/11/06/in-a-chicago-suburb-helping-latino-families-navigate-new-healthcare-options/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCLatino.com", "description": "MELROSE PARK, IL \u2013 Last Saturday afternoon, dozens of families interested in healthcare browsed the informational booths at the Kathleen \u2026 Read More", "creator": "@nbclatino", "url": "http://nbclatino.com/2013/11/06/in-a-chicago-suburb-helping-latino-families-navigate-new-healthcare-options/", "image": {"src": "https://nbclatino.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/chicagohealth4colorcorrect.jpg"}, "title": "In a Chicago suburb, helping Latino families navigate new healthcare options", "site": "@nbclatino", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "The Voice of American Hispanics", "fb": {"app_id": 330581213700140}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "google-site-verification": "IqILHHObWa8hawB1yh-cpqDPoygQ3Fb6IhXiQP7RZPM", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Navigators", "published_time": "2013-11-06T10:24:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-09T12:21:25+00:00", "author": "Erika L.
