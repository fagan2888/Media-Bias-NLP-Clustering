But why? Is it true, as Cruz would have it, that the dreaded GOP establishment pays lip service to shrinking the federal government and repealing Obamacare, but actually would prefer to preserve the status quo? Is it simply personal animosity? Or do Cruz\u2019s Beltway critics have a point? Cruz hasn\u2019t hesitated to take polarizing stances, even when doing so means taking on his Republican colleagues. Last October, for example, a criminal-justice reform bill came before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill, which would give judges more flexibility in sentencing and add rehabilitative services to prisons, is a product of the increasing bipartisan movement to reform the criminal-justice system, which is supported by such disparate actors as the Koch brothers and the ACLU. And it\u2019s the baby of Senator Mike Lee, the Tea Party-supported Utahn, who\u2019s emerged as one of the most passionate conservative advocates for reform. Related Story Ted Cruz's Revolution Lee is also Cruz\u2019s best friend\u2014maybe his only friend\u2014in the Senate. In his memoir, Cruz writes that no one stood by him \u201cmore courageously or indispensably\u201d than Lee during his 21-hour anti-Obamacare speech that preceded the 2013 government shutdown. The pair have a joint fundraising committee and have posed together with a tiger-skin rug. When Lee brought up his bill in the committee hearing, he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d have Cruz\u2019s support. But he certainly didn\u2019t anticipate what came next.\n\nCruz attacked the bill as dangerous and politically poisonous. He said it would lead to more than 7,000 federal prisoners let out on the street. \u201cI for one, at a time when police officers across this country are under assault right now, being vilified right now, when we\u2019re seeing violent crime spiking in our cities across the country, I think it would be a serious mistake for the Senate to pass legislation providing for 7,082 criminals to be released early,\u201d he said. The bill, he claimed, \u201ccould result in more violent criminals being let out on the streets, and potentially more lives being lost.\u201d Cruz went on to warn his fellow senators that if they voted for the bill, they would imperil their careers. \u201cWe know to an absolute certainty that an unfortunately high percentage of those offenders will go and commit subsequent crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd every one of us who votes to release violent criminals from prison prior to the expiration of their sentence can fully expect to be held accountable by our constituents.\u201d Essentially, Cruz was saying that the legislation would let dangerous people out of prison, they would commit more crimes, and the senators would be subject to Willie Horton-style attack ads. Lee, who was sitting right next to Cruz, could not believe what he was hearing. The bill, he responded, wouldn\u2019t actually release any violent criminals from prison, and its sentence reduction for gun crimes was to reduce the minimum for felons caught with guns or ammunition from 15 years to 10 years\u2014a provision that had once sent a man to prison for 15 years when he picked up a stray bullet in order to clean a carpet. \u201cIt is simply incorrect to say that this suddenly releases a bunch of violent criminals. It is tougher on violent offenders,\u201d Lee sputtered. \u201cThat statement is inaccurate\u2026. We\u2019re not letting out violent offenders. That is false.\u201d Lee\u2019s communications director, Conn Carroll, confirmed to me that Lee and his staff had no advance warning that Cruz was planning to brutally attack\u2014and, in Lee\u2019s view, misrepresent\u2014his friend\u2019s bill. \u201cGoing into that hearing, we definitely thought it was in the realm of possibility he would come out against it, just not with that kind of colorful language,\u201d Carroll told me. The bill made it out of committee that day, but now it appears to be in trouble, with several other Republican senators taking Cruz\u2019s line against it at a Senate lunch last week.\n\nToday, Lee has conspicuously joined every other sitting senator in declining to endorse Cruz\u2019s presidential run. And while Lee and Cruz are still friends, the episode vividly illustrates Cruz\u2019s talent for irritating other senators. Another telling episode came during the 2013 government shutdown, which Cruz spearheaded, insisting that if Congress defunded Obamacare, the president might go along. As McKay Coppins reports in his new book, The Wilderness, Cruz\u2019s own staff never actually expected the gambit to work. To Cruz\u2019s colleagues, it was a pointless and damaging exercise, but grassroots conservative groups cheered the effort. One such group, the Senate Conservatives Fund, sent a mailing attacking 25 Republican senators. Cruz is close to the Fund and has appeared in its ads. At a private lunch of Republican senators, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte waved the document in Cruz\u2019s face and demanded that he disavow it. When he declined, several other senators, including then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, took Ayotte\u2019s side and denounced Cruz. In my conversations with Republican policy types and Senate aides about Cruz, this lack of regard for his colleagues, and for the niceties that have traditionally governed the upper chamber, was a common theme. As Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader, told me last week, referring to the time Cruz called McConnell a liar on the Senate floor: \u201cYou just don\u2019t do that. Are we not still gentlemen, and respectful of each other?\u201d Another criticism of Cruz is that his antics are disruptive and damaging to the Republican Party. The shutdown nearly led to a national default, terrifying the business community. It led to the lowest approval ratings for the GOP in decades. Even the Kochs came out against such tactics. Groups like the Chamber of Commerce generally support a conservative platform, but not at the price of government ceasing to function. \u201cIt\u2019s not what he\u2019s trying to accomplish or what he says he\u2019s trying to accomplish that bothers people,\u201d former McConnell chief of staff Josh Holmes told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s that he\u2019s consistently sacrificed the mutual goals of many for his personal enhancement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cruz\u2019s fans say it\u2019s because he stands on principle.
