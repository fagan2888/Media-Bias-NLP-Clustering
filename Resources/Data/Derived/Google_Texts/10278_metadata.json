But in a moment flagged by The Daily Caller\u2019s Alex Griswold, Schultz said that Beck\u2019s story should get his fans to maybe reconsider their position on Obamacare.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Schultz had only positive things to say about Beck himself in the segment and took absolutely zero cheap shots at his expense. He praised Beck\u2019s candor, media success, and his contribution to the national debate on health care treatment.\n\nSchultz did, though, note how Beck had \u201caccess and opportunity\u201d to get the best treatment possible, and brought the discussion back around to the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\u201cHow do you say \u2018no\u2019 to your next-door neighbor because they have a pre-existing condition, maybe like the one Glenn Beck has?\u2026 I\u2019m curious about his motivation for sharing this illness with his viewers and people that basically are followers and worshippers of what the guy says and does. I hope that his story motivates those who think that Obamacare is bad, that maybe they will rethink the situation, that seeing a doctor and having it covered is paramount to a good life, to a chance at a good life.\u201d\n\nSchultz\u2019s frustration did take over a bit, and he went on a bit of a rant against the GOP for politicizing health care.\n\nYou can watch the full segment below, via MSNBC:\n\n[h/t Daily Caller]\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "MSNBC's Ed Schultz talked about Glenn Beck today and how he opened up about his personal health issues.
