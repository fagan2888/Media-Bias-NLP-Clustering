Think interoperability, RCM and workflow solutions.\n\nShiv Gopalkrishnan, vice president and general manager of health system solutions at GE Healthcare said this year, with its nearly 5,000 square feet of exhibitor space they\u2019ll be focusing on three big areas: payment reform, productivity solutions and better collections.\n\nWith the Affordable Care Act in full swing, not to mention the shift toward value-based care, payment reform is \u201ctop of mind for CFOs,\u201d Gopalkrishnan said, thus a leading priority for GE Healthcare. Some of the company\u2019s emphasis in this arena has been around financial risk management and getting clinical data from provider groups for help with Medicare payments and bonuses.\n\nThe productivity bucket, as Gopalkrishnan explained, is really a \u201cbig deal\u201d for GE Healthcare as healthcare organizations are facing cost pressures when it comes to reimbursement.\n\n\u201cThey need to find a way to manage cost,\u201d Gopalkrishnan said. And there\u2019s a way to do it right by combining the clinical with the procedural. What they\u2019re unveiling: a platform Gopalkrishnan described as being for a \u201cnewer generation of users.\u201d\n\nAnd lastly for those HIMSS15 attendees looking for software around improving collections, GE Healthcare is unveiling new tools for improving collections \u2013 essentially targeting payments that are traditionally missed, Gopalkrishnan explained.\n\nGE will be at Booth 939 on the show floor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The company's focus at HIMSS15 will be on financial risk management and getting clinical data from provider groups for help with Medicare payments.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "The company's focus at HIMSS15 will be on financial risk management and getting clinical data from provider groups for help with Medicare payments.", "title": "GE ups ante on risk management, payments and collections", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ge-ups-ante-risk-management-payments-collections", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/ge.png", "updated_time": "2015-04-06T08:33:37-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/ge-ups-ante-risk-management-payments-collections", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/ge.png"}, "description": "The company's focus at HIMSS15 will be on financial risk management and getting clinical data from provider groups for help with Medicare payments.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "GE ups ante on risk management, payments and collections"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-06T07:53:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-06T08:33:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5079\"", "article_summary": "GE Healthcare is planning to bring a few big product unveilings to HIMSS15.\nThe productivity bucket, as Gopalkrishnan explained, is really a \u201cbig deal\u201d for GE Healthcare as healthcare organizations are facing cost pressures when it comes to reimbursement.\nSome of the company\u2019s emphasis in this arena has been around financial risk management and getting clinical data from provider groups for help with Medicare payments and bonuses.\nShiv Gopalkrishnan, vice president and general manager of health system solutions at GE Healthcare said this year, with its nearly 5,000 square feet of exhibitor space they\u2019ll be focusing on three big areas: payment reform, productivity solutions and better collections.\nWhat they\u2019re unveiling: a platform Gopalkrishnan described as being for a \u201cnewer generation of users.\u201dAnd lastly for those HIMSS15 attendees looking for software around improving collections, GE Healthcare is unveiling new tools for improving collections \u2013 essentially targeting payments that are traditionally missed, Gopalkrishnan explained."}
