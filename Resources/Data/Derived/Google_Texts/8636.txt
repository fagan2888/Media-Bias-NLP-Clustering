PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, the crack-pot team behind “Frances Ha,” have proven their delightful screwball talents once more with “Mistress America,” which premiered Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival. The film is a dreamy and idiosyncratic comedy about two enigmatic soon-to-be stepsisters who are just trying to figure out how they fit in the world,

One, Tracy (Lola Kirke, who audiences might remember from a bit part in “Gone Girl”) is an introspective Barnard freshman and aspiring writer who can’t seem to find any friends. The other, Brooke (Gerwig), is a 30-year-old romantic and striver who lives in her own alluring, albeit delusional, reality.

Everything changes for Tracy when she enters Brooke’s intoxicating world. She even begins to use Brooke as an inspiration for a short story about a tragic aging dreamer, “Mistress America.”

But plot is almost beside the point. The inspired situational and physical comedy, sharp, witty dialogue and synthy music propel the story forward as the characters get into stranger and stranger situations.
