Chris Smith\u2019s Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which would mandate transparency about abortion coverage in health plans in the ACA exchanges.\n\nCurrently, the ACA mandates that insurance companies that are part of the law's state exchanges not disclose whether they pay for elective abortions until enrollment.\n\nDuring testimony last week, Rep. John Shimkus (R-IL) had asked Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about whether \u201cthe federal exchanges that offer [abortion have]\u2026clearly identified which\u201d plans do and do not cover abortion. Shimkus noted \u201cright now you cannot make that determination.\u201d\n\n\n\nSebelius responded she did not know the answer, but would \u201ccheck and make sure that is clearly identifiable.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley expressed concern that under the ACA \u201cnot only may pro-life people have a very limited choice of health plans that do not violate their consciences \u2013 but the law makes it all but impossible for them to find out which plans\u201d don\u2019t violate consciences.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nHe also criticized the fact that under the ACA insurers can include abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state health exchanges, while still receiving federal tax subsidies \u2013 something that he said violates longstanding policies against federal funding for abortion.\n\nThe Obama administration has side-stepped such policies by requiring abortion-providing plans in the exchanges to collect a $1 abortion surcharge from every enrollee, without opt out, to be put into a separate abortion fund.\n\n\u201cThis substantive problem on abortion is compounded by the ACA\u2019s unique secrecy provisions,\u201d complained O\u2019Malley. \u201cThis injustice of this is clear when we realize most Americans do not want to have to purchase abortion coverage.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley said that being transparent about which plans cover abortion \u201cshould be a point of agreement between lawmakers,\u201d whether pro-life or pro-choice. \"Choice\" means nothing, he said, \u201cif the law conceals the facts needed to make that choice.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the ACA was passed with an Executive Order ostensibly preventing the funding of elective abortions. However, funding efforts for elective abortion coverage in MD, PA, and NM that summer, as well as the HHS birth control mandate issued in 2012, have left many pro-life advocates concerned about whether the Executive Order has any impact on the ACA as it continues to be implemented.\n\nThe Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act was introduced on October 9 by Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ). It has 109 cosponsors, and would provide the American people with what Smith called the \u201cright to know upfront and with full transparency when they are purchasing a plan that subsidizes the killing of unborn children.\u201d\n\nSmith has also introduced the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which would prevent abortion funding under the ACA except in cases of life of the mother, rape, and incest. In his letter, Cardinal O\u2019Malley reiterated the bishops\u2019 support for that bill as well.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "O'Malley urged the House and Senate to pass Rep.
