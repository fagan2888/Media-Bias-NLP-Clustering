Well.....\n\n\"Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it,\" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning in the opening salvo of a series of tweets eviscerating Cruz.\n\nTed Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nThe impetus for Trump's fraud accusation appeared to be an erroneous claim from Cruz's campaign Monday night during the caucuses that Ben Carson was poised to drop out of the race. Cruz later apologized for spreading the incorrect information.\n\nDuring primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nBut Trump didn't stop there as he leveled other claims against Cruz, including that the Texas senator falsely suggested he supported Obamacare.\n\nAnd finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and \"choice\" - a total lie! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nHe concluded by calling for a redo of the caucuses or for Cruz's win to be ruled invalid.\n\nBased on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016\n\nNeedless to say, holding the Iowa caucuses for a second time seems rather unlikely, but these latest broadsides should only intensify the increasingly contentious battle between Trump and Cruz.\n\nCopyright 2016 WFAA", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Donald Trump&#39;s speech Monday night in Iowa after his surprising loss in the caucuses was perhaps most noteworthy for its graciousness.", "author": "TEGNA", "og": {"site_name": "WFAA", "description": "Donald Trump's speech Monday night in Iowa after his surprising loss in the caucuses was perhaps most noteworthy for its graciousness.", "title": "Donald Trump says Ted Cruz 'stole' Iowa", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2016/02/03/635900408041090489-AP-GOP-2016-Trump_162591_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "url": "http://www.wfaa.com/news/politics/elections/donald-trump-says-ted-cruz-stole-iowa/31473775", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.wfaa.com", "description": "Donald Trump's speech Monday night in Iowa after his surprising loss in the caucuses was perhaps most noteworthy for its graciousness.", "title": "Donald Trump says Ted Cruz 'stole' Iowa", "image": {"src": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2016/02/03/635900408041090489-AP-GOP-2016-Trump_162591_ver1.0_640_360.jpg"}, "site": "WFAA", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212557628824992}, "keywords": "News", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1280"}, "article_summary": "Well.....\"Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it,\" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning in the opening salvo of a series of tweets eviscerating Cruz.\nTed Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.\nDuring primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.\n\u2014 Donald J.
