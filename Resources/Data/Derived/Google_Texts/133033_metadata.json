These songs help to give emotion or set the mood of the campaign. Some people like it, and some people are just pissed about it. Some of the artists who wrote and sang these hit songs do not appreciate that politicians use their songs in their campaign.\n\nDonald Trump just scored a major hit in his campaign. As reported by Rolling Stone, Twisted Sister's 1984 hit song \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" was permitted by the band's lead singer and songwriter, Dee Snider.\n\nAccording to Snider, Trump asked him personally if he could use his song in his campaign. \u201cHe called and he asked, which I appreciated. I said, \u2018Look, we don\u2019t see eye to eye on everything -- there are definitely issues that we\u2019re far apart on.\u2019 But thinking back to when I wrote the song and what the song is about, it\u2019s about rebellion, speaking your mind and fighting the system. If anybody\u2019s doing that, he sure is,\u201d shared Snider.\n\nTrump and Snider had a history together when Snider joined the Celebrity Apprentice but was fired by Trump by the seventh episode.\n\nSnider also added that he and Trump were friends. \u201cI have spent time with Donald and his family. I don\u2019t think either of us expected that we would like each other, but you know, Donald Trump is a pretty chill guy. He\u2019s a frontman. When that camera goes on, he furls his brow, he does his thing. Off-camera he\u2019s very self-deprecating. He makes jokes about being too orange and about his hair,\u201d revealed Snider.\n\nSome of the big names in the music industry expressed their disapproval on some of the politicians that were using their songs in their campaigns. R.E.M.'s front man, Michael Stripe, tweeted, \"Go f**k yourselves, the lot of you \u2014 you sad, attention-grabbing, power-hungry little men. Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.\"\n\nLike Us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Twisted Sister's Dee Snider gave Donald Trump his approval to use the band's song entitled \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" for Trump's presidential campaign.", "Copyright": "2016 Realty Today", "Author": "Realty Today", "og": {"site_name": "Realty Today", "description": "Twisted Sister's Dee Snider gave Donald Trump his approval to use the band's song entitled \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" for Trump's presidential campaign.", "title": "Donald Trump Gets the Approval to Use a Twisted Sister Song in His Presidential Campaign", "url": "http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/57047/20151130/donald-trump-gets-the-approval-of-twisted-sisters-song-to-use-in-his-campaign.htm", "image": "http://images.realtytoday.com/data/images/full/55563/donald-trump-holds-campaign-rally-in-columbus-ohio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "realtytoday.com", "description": "Twisted Sister's Dee Snider gave Donald Trump his approval to use the band's song entitled \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" for Trump's presidential campaign.", "title": "Donald Trump Gets the Approval to Use a Twisted Sister Song in His Presidential Campaign", "url": "http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/57047/20151130/donald-trump-gets-the-approval-of-twisted-sisters-song-to-use-in-his-campaign.htm", "image": "http://images.realtytoday.com/data/images/full/55563/donald-trump-holds-campaign-rally-in-columbus-ohio.jpg", "creator": "@Realty_Today", "site": "@Realty_Today", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/57047/20151130/donald-trump-gets-the-approval-of-twisted-sisters-song-to-use-in-his-campaign.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Daily Real Estate, Mortgage, Loans", "Title": "RealtyToday.com: Your one stop for all things Real Estate.", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "2A66A550C428B9E3C2386C384F90B249", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-30"}, "news_keywords": "donald, trump, gets, the, approval, of, twisted, sisters, song, to, use, in, his, campaign", "Subject": "RealtyToday.com"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump Gets the Approval to Use a Twisted Sister Song in His Presidential CampaignPosted by Staff Reporter media@realtytoday.com ) on Nov 30, 2015 07:58 AM ESTmore bigPolitical campaigns and hit songs go hand in hand.\nI don\u2019t think either of us expected that we would like each other, but you know, Donald Trump is a pretty chill guy.\nAccording to Snider, Trump asked him personally if he could use his song in his campaign.\nDonald Trump just scored a major hit in his campaign.\nSome of the artists who wrote and sang these hit songs do not appreciate that politicians use their songs in their campaign."}
