Jon Stewart blasted both Democrats and Republicans running in the midterm elections on “The Daily Show” Wednesday night in a segment titled “Just Try Not to Say Something Stupid for 90 Minutes.”

The liberal comedian hit members of both parties for attempting to distance themselves from President Obama and his low approval rating during debates and speeches.

“All this country really needed to come together is a common enemy,” joked Stewart, “whether it be the Germans or the Soviets or the man we overwhelmingly reelected to lead us 23 months ago.”

Stewart also alleged that “both parties are so unpopular that their candidates are running on how much they hate themselves.”

In particular, Stewart took aim at both candidates for Senate in Kentucky. While he made fun of Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes for her pathetic attempt to distance herself from Obama, he also skewered Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell for his conflicting opinions on Obamacare and Kentucky’s health care exchange website.

At the end of the segment, Stewart spotlighted the issues that candidates from both parties are focusing on, which include the Ebola crisis, the ISIS threat and the insecure southern border, among other fear-inducing topics.

“Midterms 2014,” concluded Stewart. “We have nothing to fear but fear itself, so we’re going to go with fear.”
