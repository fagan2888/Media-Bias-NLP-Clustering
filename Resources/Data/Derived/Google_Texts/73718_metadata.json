Democrats need someone who can take the focus off President Obama and smooth over their growing intraparty split and Hillary is their one candidate who potentially could do both. However, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s penchant for unforced errors leaves Democrats wondering if the reward she could bring, is worth the risk she will bring.\n\nHillary\u2019s current problem of having used a personal email account for official business at the State Department is just her latest self-inflicted wound. Before this, it was the question of foreign donors to the huge Clinton Foundation. Prior to that, it was her book tour \u2014 its many public miscues producing more unintentional questions than intended answers.\n\nMrs. Clinton has had such fumbles throughout her career \u2014 as witnessed by her pre-existing baggage. Seemingly, the only person who can impede Hillary\u2019s progress is Hillary, but she has shown a persistent knack for doing so.\n\nThe problem for Democrats is not this current mistake \u2014 or her past predilection toward making them \u2014 it is that they need her so badly in 2016. If they did not, the answer would be simple. Because Democrats do, it is anything but easy.\n\nUnder the best of circumstances, for a party to hold the presidency for three consecutive elections is tough. Only twice in over a century has it happened \u2014 FDR and Harry Truman did it for five, and Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush for three.\n\nCurrent circumstances are hardly the best for Democrats. Mr. Obama is consistently and broadly unpopular with voters, unless they are Democrats and liberals. His signature policy, Obamacare, is even more unpopular than he is.\n\nIn 2016, Democrats will be in the electoral place that has proved their weakest since Mr. Obama won the presidency \u2014 with him present in the public\u2019s mind but absent on the election\u2019s ballot. This is just the scenario that cost them the House in 2010 and the Senate in 2014. However in 2016, the presidency will be on the line too, offering Democrats a trifecta of trouble \u2014 losing the White House, along with both houses of Congress.\n\nDemocrats also have a growing split within their party. Less focused on by the media, Democrats\u2019 left wing has been a mirror image of Republicans\u2019 right wing. Flapping to its own cadence, Democrats\u2019 left wing is ascendant in Congress and controls where the party goes. While the country has been moving more toward conservatives \u2014 as witnessed by Republicans\u2019 control of Congress \u2014 Democrats are moving left.\n\nShould this split manifest itself in 2016\u2019s presidential primaries, it could inflict enormous damage on Democrats\u2019 White House chances \u2014 ranging from outright nomination of an unabashed liberal, to forcing a more moderate nominee to tack left to win the nomination.\n\nMr. Obama, who will not run again, can afford to cater to the Democrats\u2019 left, as he repeatedly has this year. However Democrats as a whole, who seek to retain the White House and regain Congress, cannot afford this luxury.\n\nFor both these reasons, Democrats need a candidate big enough to take America\u2019s mind off Mr. Obama and not let him define the party in 2016, and simultaneously take the party\u2019s mind off its left wing and not let it define the party, either. Hillary Clinton is the one candidate who could possibly do both.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 problem is that Hillary on paper is not the same as Hillary in person. In reality, she is still a candidate who has not won a race since 2006, and only two in her life \u2014 both in deep blue New York.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 dilemma now is whether they pursue their hopes or listen to their fears.\n\nOn what is already a thin Democratic bench, no one could do what Mrs. Clinton promises. In theory, she solves everything for Democrats and is their best case scenario.\n\nHowever, in practice she is reproving an ability to create more problems than she solves. In that role, she is Democrats\u2019 worst case scenario.\n\nThe longer Democrats stick with Mrs. Clinton, the less likely someone else is to emerge and develop as a candidate for them. That could leave them at the mercy of their liberal wing in a crunch later, or invite a liberal challenge sooner. Neither thought is comforting, but right now, both are possible with Hillary\u2019s unsteady performance.\n\n\u2022 J.T.
