So we'll be up essentially to $21 trillion, and at a certain point it's really the point of no return. And you really have to have somebody that knows what he or she is doing,\" he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobertson also asked Trump what his basis would be in nominating people to the Supreme Court. Trump emphatically answered that he would choose somebody who is \"pro-life,\" someone who is \"very conservative\" and \"very smart\" like Justice Antonin Scalia who recently passed away.\n\nWhile Trump is all praise for Scalia, he said he can't say the same thing to Chief Justice John Roberts who \"could have killed Obamacare twice\" but did not. \"He approved Obamacare when everybody said 'We're going to terminate it,'\" Trump said.\n\nAs president, Trump said he would get rid of Obamacare, which he described as a \"total disaster.\"\n\nAnother thing that Trump does not like about the current administration is the deal it made with Iran. \"I didn't want to go into Iraq; it was one of the worst decisions ever made,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We lost $2 trillion, thousands and thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors who I love all over the place, and what happens? Iran is now taking over Iraq,\" he said.\n\n\"When you think of how Iran is doing lately, right? Between the Iran deal, we give them $150 billion\u2014we got nothing for it,\" he added. \"We should have gotten our prisoners back long before we started negotiating...[Secretary John] Kerry\u2014[he] is the worst negotiator I think I've ever seen.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate and business magnate Donald Trump had a question-and-answer session with &quot;The 700 Club&quot; minister Pat Robertson at Regent University in Virginia recently, and the latter was so impressed with Trump's answers that he gave him his seal of approval.", "title": "Pat Robertson wowed by Donald Trump, tells him: 'You inspire us all'", "og": {"image": "http://d2.christiantoday.com/en/full/43608/donald-trump-with-pat-robertson.jpg", "description": "Republican presidential candidate and business magnate Donald Trump had a question-and-answer session with &quot;The 700 Club&quot; minister Pat Robertson at Regent University in Virginia recently, and the latter was so impressed with Trump's answers that he gave him his seal of approval.", "title": "Pat Robertson wowed by Donald Trump, tells him: 'You inspire us all'"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "p": {"domain_verify": "035da258d4370c219fc1e27db5605a75"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "Keywords": "christian news,christianity,evangelical,Pat Robertson,Donald Trump,The 700 club,Jerry Falwell Jr,Liberty University", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe60\"", "article_summary": "\"We owe $19 trillion\u2014most people don't even know what a trillion dollars is, how many hundreds of millions is in a trillion,\" Trump said.\n\"We lost $2 trillion, thousands and thousands of lives.\nAnother thing that Trump does not like about the current administration is the deal it made with Iran.\n\"I didn't want to go into Iraq; it was one of the worst decisions ever made,\" Trump said.\nAs president, Trump said he would get rid of Obamacare, which he described as a \"total disaster.\""}
