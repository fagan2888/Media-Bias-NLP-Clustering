Emcee Brooks Reitz of Leon\u2019s confirmed he had pickles for dinner.\n\nLater, filmmaker Thibaut Fagonde projected a slide of his refrigerator, empty save for a jar of Dijon mustard. (The conceit of Pecha Kucha is a speaker is allowed to show 20 slides, and talk about each of them for 20 seconds.) Unlike his restaurant-bound peers, though, he explained away the situation by saying his family relied on fresh groceries for supper, rather than stockpiling them in advance.\n\nBeyond the home kitchen discussions, Pecha Kucha gave participants a platform to talk about their interests, passions and hopes for the local food-and-beverage industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary, but it\u2019s fun,\u201d baker Amy Robinette said, urging listeners to chase their creative ambitions in the culinary field. \u201cGo out and pursue it boldly,\u201d Shemtov advised at the close of his talk, compellingly illustrated by GoPro footage of baking, delivery rounds and meetings.\n\nArchitect David Thompson screened before-and-after photos of his various restaurant projects, including Indaco. \u201cSometimes you see daylight when there are no windows,\u201d he said. He also touched on The Ordinary, which was a carpeted bank with a drop ceiling and vinyl tile when he started renovation work. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame you don\u2019t go to The Ordinary during the daytime,\u201d he said, alluding to the light pathways he uncovered.\n\nFestival director Gillian Zettler took the stage, candidly addressing her 2014 miscarriage for the first time in a public forum. Zettler said the episode left her without an appetite, which was slowly reawakened by the Charleston culinary community, starting with Charleston Grill\u2019s Mickey Bakst, who took her out for cupcakes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just an act of kindness, it was an act of hospitality, she said, concluding, \u201cBe kind to strangers, because you never know when they\u2019ll need it most.\u201d\n\nChef Frank Lee echoed Zettler\u2019s praise for the city\u2019s food-and-beverage professionals.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Pecha Kucha a show-and-tell for Charleston\u2019s culinary community, Blogs, \r\nBlogsWine + Food Festival, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFood, \r\nRaskin Around, \r\nRaskin Around, Butcher and Bee,Charleston Creative Parliament,Charleston Wine + Food Festival,Frank Lee,Gillian Zettler,Michael Shemtov,Mickey Bakst,Pecha Kucha,Thibaut Fagonde,Wine + Food Festival", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "If there was an overriding theme to tonight\u2019s culinary Pecha Kucha, it centered on seeing potential where nothing seems to exist \u2013 a description that apparently also describes the average chef refrigerator.", "title": "Pecha Kucha a show-and-tell for Charleston\u2019s culinary community", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150307/150309430/pecha-kucha-a-show-and-tell-for-charleston-x2019-s-culinary-community", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150307/PC0301/150309430/AR/0/AR-150309430.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150307/PC0301/150309430/AR/0/AR-150309430.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If there was an overriding theme to tonight\u2019s culinary Pecha Kucha, it centered on seeing potential where nothing seems to exist \u2013 a description that apparently also describes the average chef refrigerator.", "title": "Pecha Kucha a show-and-tell for Charleston\u2019s culinary community", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150307/PC0301/150309430/AR/0/AR-150309430.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150309430}}, "keywords": "Pecha Kucha a show-and-tell for Charleston\u2019s culinary community , Blogs, \r\nBlogsWine + Food Festival, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFood, \r\nRaskin Around, \r\nRaskin Around, Butcher and Bee,Charleston Creative Parliament,Charleston Wine + Food Festival,Frank Lee,Gillian Zettler,Michael Shemtov,Mickey Bakst,Pecha Kucha,Thibaut Fagonde,Wine + Food Festival", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-07T00:17:28Z", "modified_time": "2015-03-07T00:17:00Z", "author": "Hanna Raskin"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "If there was an overriding theme to tonight\u2019s culinary Pecha Kucha, it centered on seeing potential where nothing seems to exist \u2013 a description that apparently also describes the average chef refrigerator."}, "article_summary": "If there was an overriding theme to tonight\u2019s culinary Pecha Kucha, it centered on seeing potential where nothing seems to exist \u2013 a description that apparently also describes the average chef refrigerator.\nBeyond the home kitchen discussions, Pecha Kucha gave participants a platform to talk about their interests, passions and hopes for the local food-and-beverage industry.\n(The conceit of Pecha Kucha is a speaker is allowed to show 20 slides, and talk about each of them for 20 seconds.)\nFestival director Gillian Zettler took the stage, candidly addressing her 2014 miscarriage for the first time in a public forum.\nZettler said the episode left her without an appetite, which was slowly reawakened by the Charleston culinary community, starting with Charleston Grill\u2019s Mickey Bakst, who took her out for cupcakes."}
