Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) predicted on Monday that Judith Sheindlin — known as Judge Judy to millions of TV viewers who like their small claims justice doled out in 15-minute increments — would rule against a pending lawsuit that the House is expected to bring against President Barack Obama’s implementation of Obamacare.

“This is a phony trial that will come up. It’s a show trial,” Reid said on the Senate floor Monday.

“If that’s really what they want, they should go talk to Judge Judy. I think she would throw this case out in half a second.

“The United States Congress is no place for inane, politically motivated litigation. I think Judge Judy would agree.”

However Judge Judy would rule, it seems clear she would take at least 15 minutes to decide the case, including at least one commercial break. Judge Judy of course is highly unlikely to hear the case at all — the GOP case against the implementation of Obamacare will be held in a federal court.

Many have speculated about whether Judge Judy is a Republican or Democrat, but her tough brand of justice indicates she could be a conservative who would support the GOP argument that Obama has taken liberties with the law that Congress never authorized.

For example, Judge Judy has taken a hard line on criminal misconduct, and has indicated she supports tough sentencing and no coddling.

“Who cares if prison is a miserable existence?” she wrote in her book. “Hopefully, if we make it so unpalatable, criminals will think twice about returning.”

The name of her book is “Don’t Pee on My Leg and Tell Me It’s Raining.” Other advice she has dispensed on her show includes, “Beauty fades, but dumb is forever,” “I’m like a truth machine,” and “I’m the boss, applesauce.”
