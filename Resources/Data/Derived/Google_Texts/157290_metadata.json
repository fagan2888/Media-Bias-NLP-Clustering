It's called Handmade at Amazon.\n\nThe new service seems a whole lot like Etsy, but Amazon could actually end up being way more succesful.\n\nEtsy had its initial public offering in April, and on the first day, things were looking great. The site's share price more than doubled the same day of the IPO, earning some investors near a 90 percent gain on their investment.\n\nFast-forward to this week: The price has dropped from that record high of $30 to closer to $13 a share.\n\nAnd now, this news that Amazon, the king of selling goods online, will be in direct competition with Etsy probably isn't helping to restore investor confidence.\n\nBecause Amazon, though it won't disclose the actual number, could have as many as 60 million to 80 million global subscribers. That's according to a survey released last month by RBC Capital Markets.\n\nWhat's more impressive is those subscribers could actually be outspending non-Prime members by more than 2-to-1. Reports indicate about 70 percent of members who've been in the program for four years spend more than $800 annually.

But Etsy still has one thing Amazon doesn't:\n\n\"We've built a place that's about connection as much as it's about transaction,\" said the narrator in an Etsy promotional video.\n\nAnd you can't put a price on a connection \u2014 right?\n\nThis video includes image from Getty Images.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Handmade at Amazon launched Thursday, and the new marketplace could replace Etsy, which has already had a rough year.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Handmade at Amazon launched Thursday, and the new marketplace could replace Etsy, which has already had a rough year.", "title": "Handmade At Amazon Might Unravel Etsy", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/handmade-at-amazon-might-unravel-etsy/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1444332397.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Handmade at Amazon launched Thursday, and the new marketplace could replace Etsy, which has already had a rough year.", "title": "Handmade At Amazon Might Unravel Etsy", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/handmade-at-amazon-might-unravel-etsy/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1444332397.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=NndnUzeDpCpfHN0lxQBlNOi4TpHSNV0m&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://51864", "iphone": "newsy://51864", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://51864", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "Handmade at Amazon,Amazon marketplace,Etsy,IPO,stock prices,places to buy handmade goods,online sellers,online marketplaces,business,technology,tech", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1444332397.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Amazon will now be selling handmade goods by artisans from more than 60 countries around the world.\nHandmade at Amazon launched Thursday, and the new marketplace could replace Etsy, which has already had a rough year.\nEtsy might be a little on edge Thursday after Amazon announced it's encroaching on the handmade marketplace's space.\nBut Etsy still has one thing Amazon doesn't:\"We've built a place that's about connection as much as it's about transaction,\" said the narrator in an Etsy promotional video.\n(Video via Amazon)So, that's potentially a whole lot of buyers loyal to Amazon \u2014 not Etsy."}
