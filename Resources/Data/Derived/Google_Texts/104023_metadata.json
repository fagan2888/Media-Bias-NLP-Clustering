Washington tradition of black self-help amid the permanence of white racism. BuzzFeed this week flagged an excerpt from his 1999 book The Big Picture in which he wrote that white Americans have \u201cno grasp on the history of racial violence in this country.\u201d But now that he\u2019s a politician, he hasn\u2019t sold out so much as he\u2019s bought in, serving up inappropriate and ahistorical slavery and Holocaust metaphors and ludicrous policies to cater to Republican voters. The saddest part is that he\u2019s trashing his legacy, most likely, only to win Iowa and get a brief, almost certainly unsustainable ride atop the polls. Carson, once an iconoclast, is now a parrot for the hard right.\n\nThe guy who seems to be misunderstanding Carson\u2019s appeal the most, frankly, is Trump himself. He out-and-out said it during a rally last Saturday in Jacksonville: \u201cI don't know what the hell is going on there. I don't get it!\" The real-estate magnate also made light of the doctor\u2019s perceived lack of energy and verbally sub-tweeted Carson\u2019s Seventh Day Adventist faith, a denomination that religious scholar Anthea Butler told CNN doesn\u2019t typically get involved with politics and \u201cveer[s] off of traditional mainline Christianity.\u201d That was probably a clapback at Carson for paraphrasing Proverbs 22:4 in an earlier attack against Trump\u2019s faith. At an Anaheim rally in September, Carson had called his faith the \"big differentiator\" between him and Trump. \u201cProbably the biggest thing\u2014I've realized where my success has come from and I don't in any way deny my faith in God,\u201d he said. \u201cBy humility and the fear of the Lord are riches and honor and life and that's a very big part of who I am. I don't get that impression with him. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't get that.\"\n\nWhile Muslims are still waiting for their mea culpa from Carson for his insistence that none of them should be president of the United States, Trump got an apology\u2014but isn\u2019t giving one in return. That\u2019s probably OK, though, since Carson\u2019s true doctrine isn\u2019t so much Christianity as it is conservative fundamentalism.\n\nThat creed also, it seems, holds that women who seek abortions are equivalent to slave masters. That\u2019s the analogy Carson drew on Sunday\u2019s episode of \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Before he told Chuck Todd that he\u2019d like to see Roe v. Wade overturned, he said, \u201cDuring slavery\u2014and I know that's one of those words you're not supposed to say, but I'm saying it\u2014during slavery, a lot of the slave owners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionist had said, you know, 'I don't believe in slavery. I think it's wrong. But you guys do whatever you want to do'? Where would we be?\u201d\n\nThe comparison is insulting and historically incongruous, but that\u2019s been Carson\u2019s lane throughout this campaign. He went to the slavery-metaphor well once before, declaring that the Affordable Care Act was the worst thing since\u2014and just as notably, said after the recent mass shooting at an Oregon community college that the Holocaust would have been less likely had Jewish people been fighting back with firearms. Yes, all of that is ridiculous, but not to like Iowa Republican caucus-goers, who give him an 84 percent approval rating. Carson, as USA Today reported, had only two negatives with these voters, including the use of fetal tissue during his medical career. Not even Ben Carson can be a perfect modern-day conservative.\n\nHe is trying, though. Last Thursday, Politico reported that the doctor wants to eliminate Medicare and Medicaid, offering in their place \u201ccradle-to-grave savings accounts\u201d that would be funded by the government to the tune of a measly $2,000 per year and making every family \u201ctheir own insurance company,\u201d in his words. This is something Carson brought up two years ago at the National Prayer Breakfast, when he made a splash by criticizing President Obama from a few feet away. Carson buttered folks up for the Medicare and Medicaid proposals with a National Review op-ed in July, in which he claimed that \u201cthe majority of Americans are unhappy with Obamacare and would prefer something that is simple, effective, and under their own control.\u201d It\u2019s one of the strongest anti-government ideas yet put forth by a Republican in this campaign cycle. Nationwide, it is typically bad politics, even for Republicans, to propose that 49 million people be tossed off of their health insurance and given national savings accounts. But thus far, Carson has been the Teflon Doc, with no consequences. The stuff that has torpedoed Santorum and Huckabee in the past and present has not hurt him.\n\nPart of it is simply because people like the dude. \u201cDr. Carson's personality and likeability causes people to cut him some slack,\u201d former McCain campaign manager Charlie Black told NBC News last week. \u201cHe comes from outside the political world, where what you say and your observations are more like someone in the public sphere.\u201d Other voters told reporter Alexandra Jaffe that they respect that Carson \"loves the Lord,\u201d and said they find him \u201cvery refreshing, very inspiring\u2014even his stances on race in this country, that we need to be getting people to work together and love their neighbors.\u201d A lifelong Democrat told Jaffe that Carson was someone she could see herself voting for, because he \u201csounds very smart and has helped children.\u201d\n\nWe cannot discount the degree to which respectability politics plays into this. As I\u2019ve written before, Carson is a Horatio Alger myth come to life, and the willfully incomplete Republican framing of racial strife in America only serves to buttress his legend as a Black Man Who Did It On His Own And Didn\u2019t Make Excuses. But one thing I didn\u2019t mention is what sociology professor Tressie McMillan Cottom aptly noted in The Atlantic, which crosses racial lines: the public\u2019s assumption that being smart in one capacity is an indication of overall (specifically political) intelligence. I suspect that Carson's ridiculous platform and lack of foreign-policy specifics will catch up to him\u2014perhaps as soon as Wednesday\u2019s debate, given that he\u2019s now more of a target for Trump and the other candidates. But Carson will likely still sound like the reasonable one, even as insanity drips from his lips. Even when impassioned, he rarely sounds excited. He spouted about abortion and slavery with the cadence one might use to read a grocery list.\n\nWe associate Trump's hyperbolic manner with performance, but Carson is also performing something: earnestness. Perhaps he actually believes all the stuff he says, but Carson is proving that even the most politically extreme African American can sound reasonable to some folks when he speaks so well, and so articulately.\n\nThe column originally stated that Rick Santorum and Mike Huckabee won the Iowa caucuses in the wrong years.
