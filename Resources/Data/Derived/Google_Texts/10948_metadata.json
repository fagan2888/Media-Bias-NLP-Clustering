She knew the daycare had been struggling with its finances, but she never expected that it would happen so soon.\n\nDavis then had the unfortunate task of sharing the news with her staff and the 35 to 40 families who drop their kids off at Heart and Hand every morning. The parents were told on Monday, with four days to try and find someone new to look after their kids.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a very, very hard week,\u201d said Davis, whose swollen eyes affirmed the fact. \u201cMy heart\u2019s broken. My babies and my staff ...\u201d she trailed off, in tears.\n\nFor Heart and Hand, the closure came down to finances. The day care had been running at a deficit for some time, and it simply couldn\u2019t afford to remain open anymore.\n\n\u201cWe were having to borrow money from people in the church to meet the payroll,\u201d said William Becher, a board member of the daycare.\n\nHeart and Hand was operating at a near $10,000 deficit. Parents were two to three months late on payments, and, starting Jan. 1, center officials said they were looking at a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage that would only push them further into debt.\n\nThey\u2019re not the only child care workers struggling.\n\n\u201cThis is a hugely difficult time for child care facilities,\u201d said Debby Weinstein, executive director of the YWCA Charleston.\n\nThe YWCA is looking at having to pay around $40,000 more in salary expenses when the minimum wage rises again in January and $70,000 in health care expenses when the Affordable Care Act provision that any employee who works more than 30 hours a week should be offered health insurance begins this summer.\n\n\u201cIt is so painfully expensive,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cThese two things kicking in simultaneously have sent many nonprofit organizations to the edge.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, state subsidies for child care organizations haven\u2019t been raised since 2009, despite the rise in child care costs. Those subsidies hurt the agencies that provide support for low income families, like Heart and Hand.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go for years without an increase, and then we\u2019ll get an increase that\u2019s not significant,\u201d said Weinstein. The YWCA also has many kids who are supported by subsidies.\n\nChild care agencies have been hit hard by the minimum wage increase partly because of their high number of staff members. In order to be certified by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources, there must be one staff member for every four children under 2 years old for a group larger than six children.\n\nThat makes caring for the youngest children in child care unprofitable for many child care facilities.\n\nThat made the financial cost hurt more when the state law requiring schools to offer pre-K to 4-year-olds kicked into full effect in 2013, since 4-year-olds were one of the age groups that allowed daycares to turn a profit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the unintended consequences of what I think are well intended and very important policy changes,\u201d said Weinstein.\n\nWhile these new policies affected Heart and Hand\u2019s budget, the missed payments from parents coupled with the fact that around 50 percent of their children were on subsidies, were what killed them.\n\nThe church\u2019s need to be paid was part of the reason they gave the parents such short notice about the closure.\n\n\u201cIf you give them longer notice, there\u2019s a chance you wouldn\u2019t get a collection back for the fees,\u201d said Mary Lane, a board member of Heart and Hand.\n\nIt has been cloudy every day since the employees at Heart and Hand found out they were closing, matching their mood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve cried every single day,\u201d said Debra Cook, the van driver for the daycare.\n\nCook and the staffers have only had a week to line up new jobs. There\u2019s no severance pay from the church.\n\nInside the building constructed in 1975, the decoration on the walls look down on the children with happy faces. Even the staff manages an occasional smile through their otherwise long faces. But the cribs and small chairs will soon be empty, the colorful artwork removed from the walls and repinned on fridges at home, and a building once awake and vibrant will be put down for a long nap.\n\nReach Daniel Desrochers at\n\ndan.desrochers@wvgazettemail.com,\n\n304-348-4886 or follow\n\n@drdesrochers on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Mike Casazza: Competitive eater visits to conquer pepperoni rolls", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160525/GZ02/160529670/AR/0/AR-160529670.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/sports/20160525/mike-casazza-competitive-eater-visits-to-conquer-pepperoni-rolls", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "title": "Mike Casazza: Competitive eater visits to conquer pepperoni rolls", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160525/GZ02/160529670/AR/0/AR-160529670.jpg"}, "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Mike Casazza: Competitive eater visits to conquer pepperoni rolls"}, "article_summary": "That makes caring for the youngest children in child care unprofitable for many child care facilities.\n\u201cThese two things kicking in simultaneously have sent many nonprofit organizations to the edge.\u201dAt the same time, state subsidies for child care organizations haven\u2019t been raised since 2009, despite the rise in child care costs.\nThe day care had been running at a deficit for some time, and it simply couldn\u2019t afford to remain open anymore.\n\u201cThis is a hugely difficult time for child care facilities,\u201d said Debby Weinstein, executive director of the YWCA Charleston.\nThey\u2019re not the only child care workers struggling."}
