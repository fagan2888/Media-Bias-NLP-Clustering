Shallote, NC

One of the three tickets that matched all six numbers in Wednesday's $564 million dollar Powerball jackpot was purchased at a Shallote convenience store in Brunswick County, North Carolina.



That ticket may belong to 26-year-old Marie Holmes. Holmes' showed a ticket to reporters, but lottery officials say they have not seen her ticket so cannot verify the winning. If she's a winner, she'll take home $127-million before taxes.



If Holmes did win, she's certainly in for a change in lifestyle. Holmes is the mother of four children. She recently quit her jobs at McDonalds and Wal Mart to take care of her kids full-time.



Two other winning tickets purchased in Puerto Rico and Texas also matched all of the numbers in the massive drawing. Those winners have not yet come forward.
