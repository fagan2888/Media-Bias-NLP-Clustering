This is a symptom of the post-truth era of GOP politics in which candidates\u2019 positions are untethered to observable reality, and they feel confident that debate moderators won\u2019t challenge them. If they do get challenged, they\u2019ll just restate their position over and over until people just give up and stop bothering to correct them.\n\nThis week\u2019s Fox Business debate fit neatly within that framework. Just pick a subject area and you\u2019ll discover that pretty much every candidate said something either wildly misleading or inarguably false. On financial regulation, Jeb Bush was completely backwards on what Dodd-Frank does and Carly Fiorina wrongly blamed the subprime mortgage crisis on the federal government. On climate change, Rand Paul tried to pin the decades-long decline of Kentucky coal on Barack Obama\u2019s environmental regulations. Donald Trump warned about China taking advantage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (China is not part of the TPP). Ben Carson said that every time the minimum wage goes up, people lose jobs (nowhere close to being true). They should know better \u2013 and most of them likely do \u2013 but they don\u2019t care.\n\nWhat struck me, however, was how the candidates spoke about the Affordable Care Act. Put simply, nearly everything they said about it was completely wrong.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Carly Fiorina, who\u2019s proven herself a devoted practitioner of post-truth politics over the last few months. Asked what she would do to \u201calleviate pressure on small business,\u201d Fiorina said her first priority would be eliminating the ACA. \u201cObamacare has to be repealed because it\u2019s failing,\u201d she said to enthusiastic applause from the audience. \u201cIt is failing the very people it was intended to help but also it is crony capitalism at its worse.\u201d That\u2019s demonstrably untrue \u2013 since the ACA was implemented the uninsured rate has plummeted and people who\u2019ve gained coverage are better able to cover the costs of medical care. But, in spite of the reams of data showing that Obamacare is actually helping lots and lots of people, Fiorina declared \u201cObamacare is not helping anyone.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Donald Trump, who roped Obamacare into his tirade against the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cIt\u2019s 5,600 pages long. So complex that nobody\u2019s read it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLike Obamacare. Nobody ever read it. They passed it, nobody read it. And look at mess we have right now, and it will be repealed.\u201d This is an expression of the longstanding conservative freak-out over a snipped-from-context Nancy Pelosi comment from 2010. The idea Trump\u2019s trying to get across is that the people who wrote and passed the Affordable Care Act don\u2019t understand how it works, which is nonsense, but very satisfying to conservative voters who live and breathe Obamacare hatred.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly every word the candidates at this week's GOP debate said about the Affordable Care Act was a lie", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare lie-fest: \u201cPost-truth\u201d politics dominated the Republican debate", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Nearly every word the candidates at this week's GOP debate said about the Affordable Care Act was a lie", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare lie-fest: \u201cPost-truth\u201d politics dominated the Republican debate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/12/gops_obamacare_lie_fest_post_truth_politics_dominated_the_republican_debate/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/trump_fiorina.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nearly every word the candidates at this week's GOP debate said about the Affordable Care Act was a lie", "title": "GOP\u2019s Obamacare lie-fest: \u201cPost-truth\u201d politics dominated the Republican debate", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/trump_fiorina.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Affordabl Care Act, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, republican debates, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Let\u2019s start with Carly Fiorina, who\u2019s proven herself a devoted practitioner of post-truth politics over the last few months.\nDonald Trump warned about China taking advantage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (China is not part of the TPP).\nOn financial regulation, Jeb Bush was completely backwards on what Dodd-Frank does and Carly Fiorina wrongly blamed the subprime mortgage crisis on the federal government.\nThis is a symptom of the post-truth era of GOP politics in which candidates\u2019 positions are untethered to observable reality, and they feel confident that debate moderators won\u2019t challenge them.\nBut, in spite of the reams of data showing that Obamacare is actually helping lots and lots of people, Fiorina declared \u201cObamacare is not helping anyone.\u201dThen there\u2019s Donald Trump, who roped Obamacare into his tirade against the Trans-Pacific Partnership."}
