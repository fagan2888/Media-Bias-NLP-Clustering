Photo: Reuters\n\nBrendon McCullum's days as an international wicketkeeper for New Zealand are over.\n\nBlack Caps coach Mike Hesson says his captain's ongoing back injury means they can no longer risk calling on McCullum to wear the gloves in any form of the game.\n\nThe 32-year-old has been a wicketkeeper through most of his 12-year international career but has been eased out of the role in recent seasons - most notably at Test level where BJ Watling has proved a capable gloveman.\n\n''He's too valuable a player for us to consider using him as a keeper,'' Hesson said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcCullum kept wicket for 52 of his 81 Tests, 185 of 220 one-day internationals and 42 of 62 Twenty20 internationals. He played down speculation before the home series against the West Indies that he was considering retirement.\n\nBut he has clearly been in discomfort while batting in the first two Tests, constantly stretching his back between deliveries.\n\nHesson says McCullum's fitness is otherwise excellent and he can extend his career with careful ''maintenance'' work.\n\nResting the veteran from ODI or Twenty20 games is a possibility during the home summer against the West Indies and India.\n\n''We'd only rest him if his back was at a point where he couldn't play. That could occur,'' Hesson said. ''But he still throws himself around the field and puts himself in compromising positions.''\n\nAAP", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cricket", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "New Zealand captain's days as an international wicketkeeper for New Zealand are over.", "title": "Brendon McCullum gives up NZ wicketkeeper role", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/brendon-mccullum-gives-up-nz-wicketkeeper-role-20131214-2ze41.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/z/e/q/d/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.2ze41.png/1387036800000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/z/e/q/d/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.2ze41.png/1387036800000.jpg"}, "description": "New Zealand captain's days as an international wicketkeeper for New Zealand are over.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brendon McCullum gives up NZ wicketkeeper role"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "New Zealand captain's days as an international wicketkeeper for New Zealand are over."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c61\"", "article_summary": "Photo: ReutersBrendon McCullum's days as an international wicketkeeper for New Zealand are over.\nHe played down speculation before the home series against the West Indies that he was considering retirement.\nAdvertisementMcCullum kept wicket for 52 of his 81 Tests, 185 of 220 one-day internationals and 42 of 62 Twenty20 internationals.\nResting the veteran from ODI or Twenty20 games is a possibility during the home summer against the West Indies and India.\nBrendon McCullum."}
