Investors are increasingly turning to socially responsible investment options because good corporate practices are often an indicator of good management, financial success and long-term stability.\u201d\n\nThe notion of having investment options such as this within the TSP is not new. We have reported in the past on discussions from within Congress to push for \u201csocially responsible\u201d funds. See for example Socially Responsible Investing Through the TSP and Your Retirement Security and The TSP Pot is Growing Fast: Will Congress Resist the Political Opportunities?.\n\nA survey we ran around that time indicated that many of our users didn\u2019t like the idea of Congress dictating the types of investments within the TSP.\n\nLangevin\u2019s bill, however, would do just that. It would set up a Corporate Responsibility Index that would include \u201ca broad index of stocks of companies that maintain strong corporate governance, sustainable environmental policies and practices, solid workplace relations, positive community involvement, safe products and respect for human rights around the world.\u201d\n\nAs Senator Whitehouse put it, \u201cThis legislation will allow millions of federal government employees and retirees to use the power of their individual purse to tell big polluters they can\u2019t keep poisoning our air and water without consequences.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2016 FedSmith Inc.
