Tammy Baldwin would ensure that states that opt to expand eligibility for Medicaid can access the same federal funds as states that expanded the health care program before 2014, under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI support this legislation because it is my hope it will point our state in the right direction,\u201d Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said in a news release.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has provided federal financial support for states to expand Medicaid programs to provide health care coverage to individuals up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe federal government, under the ACA, pays the cost of expansion for the first three years for the states that enrolled in 2014 and phases down to a 90 percent match rate for the sixth and subsequent years.\n\nIn a lawsuit over the expansion program, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states could opt-in or opt-in and 19 states \u2014 mostly those with Republican governors \u2014 opted out.\n\nRepublican Gov. Scott Walker has refused to expand Medicaid eligibility in Wisconsin and instead he shrunk the BadgerCare program.\n\nBaldwin said the governor has put \u201cpolitics ahead of progress and taken our state in the wrong direction,\u201d kicked Wisconsinites off their coverage and created a coverage gap.\n\nShe said she hoped the States Achieve Medicaid Expansion Act of 2016 would provide the incentive for states to opt-in and expand Medicaid programs, as well as assist the seven states that expanded after 2014.\n\n\u201cIn the states that haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid, many adults living near the poverty level are now unable to afford health care,\u201d said Jon Peacock, research director of the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families.\n\nHe said existing law makes expanding Medicaid a good deal but the SAME Act would create an even better deal. \u201cIt would be fairer to give all the states the same incentive to close a gap in affordable coverage for adults near the poverty level,\u201d Peacock said.\n\nStudies show states that expanded Medicaid eligibility saw direct and indirect benefits in job growth, earnings growth, increased gross state product, increased state and local revenues and reduced uncompensated care and hospital costs.\n\nIn an analysis released last year, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated the economic impact of expanding eligibility in Wisconsin would be $1.3 billion and the creation of 10,500 jobs.\n\n\u201cCongress should pass this bill. The president should sign. And Gov. Walker and the Legislature should \u2026 expand BadgerCare to cover 83,000 more people and save state taxpayers more than a billion dollars over the next 10 years,\u201d said Mike Bare of Community Advocates Public Policy Institute.\n\nBaldwin introduced the bill along with Democrats Mark Warner of Virginia, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters of Michigan, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Jon Tester of Montana, Tim Kaine of Virginia and independent Angus King of Maine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bill introduced by Tammy Baldwin would ensure that states that opt to expand eligibility for Medicaid can access the same funds as states that expanded before 2014.", "og": {"site_name": "Wisconsin Gazette", "description": "A bill introduced by Tammy Baldwin would ensure that states that opt to expand eligibility for Medicaid can access the same funds as states that expanded before 2014.", "title": "Baldwin pushes for Medicaid expansions with new bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wisconsingazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-news-medicaid-050516-copy-600x315.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-27T15:54:16-05:00", "url": "http://wisconsingazette.com/2016/04/28/baldwin-pushes-for-medicaid-expansions-with-new-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A bill introduced by Tammy Baldwin would ensure that states that opt to expand eligibility for Medicaid can access the same funds as states that expanded before 2014.", "title": "Baldwin pushes for Medicaid expansions with new bill", "image": "http://wisconsingazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/image-news-medicaid-050516-copy.jpg", "creator": "@lisaneff", "site": "@wigazette", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 656359844}, "google-site-verification": "seM7rhmcUuSzBWv6kkeJ_YZI5fL-A0v6VtNwwuSnfkc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wigazette/", "published_time": "2016-04-28T07:52:46-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/lmneff", "section": "Featured News", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:54:16-05:00", "tag": "Tammy Baldwin"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Scott Walker has refused to expand Medicaid eligibility in Wisconsin and instead he shrunk the BadgerCare program.\nThe Affordable Care Act has provided federal financial support for states to expand Medicaid programs to provide health care coverage to individuals up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\nShe said she hoped the States Achieve Medicaid Expansion Act of 2016 would provide the incentive for states to opt-in and expand Medicaid programs, as well as assist the seven states that expanded after 2014.\nHe said existing law makes expanding Medicaid a good deal but the SAME Act would create an even better deal.\nStudies show states that expanded Medicaid eligibility saw direct and indirect benefits in job growth, earnings growth, increased gross state product, increased state and local revenues and reduced uncompensated care and hospital costs."}
