Before Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker became an official candidate for president, he told reporters that he would give detailed plans on entitlement reform once he started his official run. While we wait for that speech, Walker did provide a solid hint during an interview with The Daily Signal conducted in Iowa back in April.

“I was born on November 2, 1967 and so the reason I say that is that anyone older than me should be protected,” Walker says. “The cinch should be, ‘hey you made plans for your retirement no matter who you are, no matter what your background, no matter what your income, you made decisions about your retirement based upon a commitment that the government had made, a commitment to people to say you worked this many years under the system and that ultimately this is where Social Security and Medicare are going to be at.’ I think those individuals should be protected going forward.”

But what about Americans who are older than Walker? “For people my age and younger, we live in a whole different world,” Walker continues. “We live in a 401K society, we’re ready for reform. I think we think it’s realistic not just for ourselves but our children and someday our grandchildren that we put in place reforms.”
