A 2-year-old girl died Saturday night after being pulled out of a backyard pool in Buckner Terrace, police said.

Authorities believe she drowned, but the medical examiner’s office hadn’t released an official cause of death Sunday afternoon.

Dallas police said Ann Collazo had been swimming with other children at a large family gathering shortly before 10:55 p.m. in the 7100 block of Larkin Road.

The relatives took the kids out of the pool. But while drying off the kids, the adults realized Collazo was missing, police said.

The family called 911 and reported the girl missing. The relatives searched the pool, found the girl and pulled her out, police said.

Officers arrived and performed CPR on the girl until paramedics got there.

Collazo was taken to Children’s Medical Center where a doctor pronounced her dead, police said.

Police didn’t release any more information Sunday and said the investigation continues.
