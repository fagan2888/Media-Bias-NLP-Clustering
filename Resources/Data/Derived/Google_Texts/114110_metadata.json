Obama gave a speech at the iconic Edmund Pettus Bridge, where the first attempt to march into Selma in 1965 was met with police brutality and violence that shocked the entire world.\n\nWhere previously an Obama speech left us inspired and lifted the spirits, now it falls flat, filled with mawkish sentimentalism and clich\u00e9s that leave us squirming with the knowledge that as a leader the man is an empty coat. In the context of the Selma commemoration, this is further confirmed by a shocking Federal Department of Justice report into policing in Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 the town where unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed in 2014 by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, who was later exonerated by a grand jury.\n\nThe report reveals the extent of racism not only within the police department of Ferguson but also within its court system. That such institutionalized racism remains a fact of life in the US five decades on from the struggle for black civil rights that President Obama is so keen to embrace in speech after speech is an unalloyed indictment of a country that purports to lecture the world on human rights.\n\nFurther, when someone like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is able to breeze into the US Congress without going through the White House beforehand, and there give a speech that could only be considered a studied insult to the President \u2013 picking apart Obama\u2019s attempt to reach a deal with Iran over its nuclear program in advance of talks in Geneva \u2013 you know you have a president who might be in office but is certainly not in power.\n\nMake no mistake, the election of Barack Obama as the nation\u2019s first black president was hugely significant in itself. But that significance has been diminished by his inability and refusal to take on the forces of reaction in Washington \u2013 the Republican right, the vested interests, and Wall Street \u2013 even though he had the mandate and support within the country to do so.\n\nMillions of Americans \u2013 especially those who been alienated and locked out of the nation\u2019s political process on the margins of society \u2013 placed their hopes in Obama when he was first elected in 2008. They listened to speech after speech in which words such as \u2018hope\u2019 and \u2018change\u2019 were prominent, and they allowed themselves to believe in him and the pledges and promises of a new and a just America.\n\nSeven years later and the only thing that\u2019s changed has been the wallpaper in the Oval Office. The reforms he\u2019s delivered domestically \u2013 on healthcare, the economy, and social justice \u2013 have been weak. Take his much vaunted healthcare reform. Known pejoratively as \u2018Obamacare\u2019, it remains a prisoner of the healthcare insurance industry and does not offer the kind of healthcare to all US citizens regardless of income that is compatible with a civilized society. On the economy, Obama caved in to Wall Street instead in response to its role in causing the worst economic crisis in the US, and by extension throughout the world, since the 1930s.\n\nUnder Obama a plutocracy on Wall Street has become ever more entrenched, a ravenous monster served by the federal government rather than constraining it, as Franklin D Roosevelt did in the 1930s when he entered the White House under similar conditions of economic depression.\n\nThe plight of black people, particularly young black men, in the US has never been worse. Racism within policing and law enforcement continues to be reinforced by social indicators that reveal obscene inequality, poverty, and alienation in the land of the free.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy under Obama, we are still talking about an empire whose economic, geopolitical, and military might has been central to the gross injustice, unending conflict, instability, and human despair that is crying out for redress. When US drones are not killing children and innocent civilians in the US \u2018war on terror\u2019, Obama is playing a central part in the rise and spread of terrorism across the Middle East and the rise in tensions with Russia over attempts by the West to expand NATO up to Russia\u2019s border.\n\nNow, as the last year of his presidency limps towards its end, Barack Obama\u2019s legacy will be forever prefixed by the word \u2018disappointment\u2019. The most grievous aspect is the way it has breathed life into a resurgent Republican Party and its supporters, while demobilizing and demoralizing progressive forces in the country.\n\nPerhaps more than any other, this will go down as his abiding legacy of disappointment and failure.\n\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.", "article_metadata": {"description": "History will judge the Obama presidency to be one that consisted of empty symbolic gestures and vacuous rhetoric, and failed to deliver anything meaningful over its two terms.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "History will judge the Obama presidency to be one that consisted of empty symbolic gestures and vacuous rhetoric, and failed to deliver anything meaningful over its two terms.", "title": "The Obama presidency: Hope turns to disappointment", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/opinionpost/3a/da/50/00/obama-presidency-racism-hopes-promises.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/op-edge/241061-obama-presidency-racism-hopes-promises/", "type": "website"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "History will judge the Obama presidency to be one that consisted of empty symbolic gestures and vacuous rhetoric, and failed to deliver anything meaningful over its two terms.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/opinionpost/3a/da/50/00/obama-presidency-racism-hopes-promises.si.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f6a\"", "article_summary": "Make no mistake, the election of Barack Obama as the nation\u2019s first black president was hugely significant in itself.\nNow, as the last year of his presidency limps towards its end, Barack Obama\u2019s legacy will be forever prefixed by the word \u2018disappointment\u2019.\nWhere previously an Obama speech left us inspired and lifted the spirits, now it falls flat, filled with mawkish sentimentalism and clich\u00e9s that leave us squirming with the knowledge that as a leader the man is an empty coat.\nThe statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.\nPerhaps more than any other, this will go down as his abiding legacy of disappointment and failure."}
