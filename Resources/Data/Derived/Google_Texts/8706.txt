SIMI VALLEY, CALIF. — Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson can’t match Donald Trump when it comes to offensive and scurrilous statements, at least when it comes to volume. But a dubious quote trail does indeed follow Carson at all stops along the campaign trail. This Business Insider headline nods at the dynamic: “Donald Trump’s new top rival also has a history of saying provocative things.” “Provocative,” as in suggesting that people can choose to be gay; saying that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery; and several others.

The lowlight reel for Carson, though, hasn’t acquired a whole lot of fresh material, suggesting that the candidate has tightened up his media act. This afternoon, Carson made a quick stop at the media filing center at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and took several questions from reporters. The Erik Wemple Blog asked him whether he had made a deliberate change in how he responds to questions.

Yes. “My new approach is to assume that people have an agenda and to be very careful with their questions,” he said.

Consistent with Carson’s background as a distinguished neurosurgeon, that qualifies as a cerebral way to slam the media.
