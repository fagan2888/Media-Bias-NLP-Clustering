Aldinger III and a family trust on his way out the door. Mr. Aldinger, who is also a former chairman and chief executive officer of HSBC Finance Corp., left Capmark in December 2008. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2009, joining a long list of real-estate lenders toppled by the global financial crisis.\n\nHowever, the deal aims to keep secret the amount of money Mr. Aldinger will return to Capmark to settle the litigation. To explain why it\u2019s necessary to hide the amount, Capmark noted that Mr. Aldinger is retired and doesn\u2019t need the publicity that will certainly attend the news of the settlement.\n\n\u201cHe is no longer in the public spotlight, yet the significant amount of this settlement is almost certain to return him there,\u201d court papers say.\n\nMr. Aldinger is described in court documents as \u201ca well-known figure in the financial industry and\u2026the subject of much press, including, unfortunately, derogatory press.\u201d It\u2019s not immediately clear, however, to which type of \u201cderogatory\u201d press Capmark\u2019s attorneys are referring. He did gain some notice in the British financial press more than a decade ago for the generous pay package he received at HSBC, but he doesn\u2019t seem to have faced the level of vitriol directed toward other corporate executives, especially during the financial crisis.\n\nA lawyer for Capmark deferred to lawyers for Mr. Aldinger, who didn\u2019t respond Wednesday to inquiries concerning the need for secrecy about the amount of a proposed settlement with a key insider.\n\nWhile the request to seal the amount of the settlement refers to the need to avoid \u201cthe promotion of public scandal,\u201d Capmark\u2019s case against Mr. Aldinger was a plain-vanilla preference action that didn\u2019t raise any allegations of wrongdoing or mismanagement on his part. Company insiders, as well as trade creditors, are routinely targeted in so-called \u201cpreference\u201d lawsuits, which are premised on technical provisions of the Bankruptcy Code aimed at making sure creditors share equally in the pain of financial failure.\n\nFor a certain period prior to the bankruptcy, the law presumes a company is insolvent, and thus has no business handing out excessive pay, or, in the case of trade creditors, paying bills on a stepped-up schedule, unless there was extra value received. Capmark alleged Mr. Aldinger\u2019s severance package was such an improper payment. Mr. Aldinger defended himself on a number of grounds, including that most of the money was transferred as a result of stock dealings and was therefore exempt.\n\nA judge has already granted Capmark permission to keep the amount of its settlement confidential, and will evaluate the settlement itself Sept. 19.\n\nThe deal is the latest example of companies seeking special treatment for top executives, in spite of the principle that transparency is the price companies must pay for the protections of Chapter 11. Early in its bankruptcy, Capmark disguised the identities of top-ranking insiders who took more than $50 million in pay, bonuses and other compensation in the year before the bankruptcy, despite the fact that official judicial forms require the names of insiders be filed with the court.\n\nWrite to Peg Brickley at peg.brickley@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Capmark Financial Group reached a settlement with its former head honcho over the nearly $17 million he received when he left the commercial real estate lender the year before its bankruptcy, but one key detail is under wraps---how much the individual will pay.", "title": "Capmark Strikes Secret Settlement With Former CEO", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/08/21/capmark-strikes-secret-settlement-with-former-ceo/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Capmark Strikes Secret Settlement With Former CEO", "description": "Capmark Financial Group reached a settlement with its former head honcho over the nearly $17 million he received when he left the commercial real estate lender the year before its bankruptcy, but one key detail is under wraps---how much the individual will pay.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Peg Brickley", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Bankruptcy Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.summary": "Capmark Financial Group reached a settlement with its former head honcho over the nearly $17 million he received when he left the commercial real estate lender the year before its bankruptcy, but one key detail is under wraps---how much the individual will pay.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-08-21T17:54:53-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/08/21/capmark-strikes-secret-settlement-with-former-ceo/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-BANKB-20062", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Capmark Financial Group reached a settlement with its former head honcho over the nearly $17 million he received when he left the commercial real estate lender the year before its bankruptcy, but one key detail is under wraps---how much the individual will pay.", "title": "Capmark Strikes Secret Settlement With Former CEO", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/bankruptcy/2014/08/21/capmark-strikes-secret-settlement-with-former-ceo/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Bankruptcy Beat", "article.id": "BL-BANKB-20062", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-21T17:55:27-04:00"}, "article_summary": "However, the deal aims to keep secret the amount of money Mr. Aldinger will return to Capmark to settle the litigation.\nMr. Aldinger, who is also a former chairman and chief executive officer of HSBC Finance Corp., left Capmark in December 2008.\nA judge has already granted Capmark permission to keep the amount of its settlement confidential, and will evaluate the settlement itself Sept. 19.\nTo explain why it\u2019s necessary to hide the amount, Capmark noted that Mr. Aldinger is retired and doesn\u2019t need the publicity that will certainly attend the news of the settlement.\nMr. Aldinger defended himself on a number of grounds, including that most of the money was transferred as a result of stock dealings and was therefore exempt."}
