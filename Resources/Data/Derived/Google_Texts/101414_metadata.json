The joint committee appointed by the Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture initially planned to recommend plant-based diets due to concerns about the environment. After pushback from Congress, the government decided it would not include environmental issues in the final version.\n\nThe final version, which will be used by policymakers and bureaucrats that oversee federal food programs, was released Thursday. Though the guidelines do not include recommendations to drop meat because of climate change they do endorse eating less meat.\n\nThe guidelines advise teenage boys to eat less meat and eggs and suggest that diets with less consumption of meat reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\u201cSome individuals, especially teen boys and adult men, also need to reduce overall intake of protein foods by decreasing intakes of meats, poultry, and eggs and increasing amounts of vegetables or other underconsumed food groups,\u201d the guidelines state.\n\nThe guidelines place calorie limits of 2,400 and 3,000 per day for women and men respectively, and a diet with a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, seafood, lean meats, poultry, eggs, and oils. Three diets are recommended: the Healthy U.S.-Style diet, a Mediterranean-style diet, and a vegetarian diet.\n\nThe guidelines also advise to limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats, reduce sodium intake, and to avoid whole milk despite recent studies that found benefits to drinking whole milk.\n\nThe theme of the 2015 version of the guidelines was \u201cAll food and beverage choices matter,\u201d and the committee took a collective approach to food and health.\n\nIn the third chapter of the guidelines, \u201cEveryone Has a Role in Supporting Healthy Eating Patterns,\u201d the committee offers changes workplaces and schools can make to promote the government\u2019s eating advice.\n\n\u201cIn practice, aligning with the Dietary Guidelines at the population level requires broad, multisectoral coordination and collaboration,\u201d the guidelines state. \u201cThis collective action is needed to create a new paradigm in which healthy lifestyle choices at home, school, work, and in the community are easy, accessible, affordable, and normative. Everyone has a role in helping individuals shift their everyday food, beverage, and physical activity choices to align with the Dietary Guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe committee added that \u201call segments of society\u201d are required to promote healthy eating and physical activity and develop \u201ceducational resources that deliver information in a way that is compelling, inspiring, empowering, and actionable for individuals.\u201d\n\nThe guidelines describe certain \u201cshifts\u201d individuals and businesses can make. Businesses are encouraged to \u201cadopt organizational changes and practices.\u201d\n\n\u201cEncourage opportunities in the workplace for regular physical activity through active commuting, activity breaks, and walking meetings,\u201d according to one example the committee offered.\n\nA \u201cwalking meeting\u201d is a business meeting where individuals continuously walk around, rather than sitting around a table.\n\nThe committee said communities should promote farmers\u2019 markets, community gardens, and \u201cwalkable communities.\u201d\n\nExamples of \u201cshifts\u201d individuals are instructed to make are from white bread to whole, a Fig Newton to an apple, plain popcorn instead of buttered, bread instead of croissants, and English muffins instead of biscuits.\n\nThe committee also encouraged Americans to eat a piece of fruit instead of a doughnut, cake, pie, cookie, ice cream, or candy.\n\nThe committee based some of its recommendations on the \u201cSocial-Ecological Model,\u201d which argues that an individual decides what they eat based on social and cultural norms and a \u201cmultitude of choices, messages, individual resources, and other factors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese decisions are rarely made in isolation,\u201d the guidelines said.\n\nThe final guidelines also encourage restaurants to change their menus and shrink portion sizes. Restaurants should add offer more vegetables, low-fat dairy options, and whole grain items, the guidelines said, similar to the requirements already in place in the school lunch program.\n\n\u201cStrategies could include supporting policy and/or program changes, fostering coalitions and networks, developing or modifying products and menus, and/or creating opportunities to be physically active,\u201d the guidelines said.\n\n\u201cTo ensure widespread adoption of these sectoral efforts, complementary efforts can include training, education, and/or motivational strategies,\u201d the guidelines added.\n\nThe committee also wants childcare centers to \u201cinitiate active outreach to parents about making positive changes at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans make food and beverage choices in a variety of settings at home, at work, and at play. Aligning these settings with the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines will not only influence individual choices\u2014it can also have broader population level impact when multiple sectors commit to make changes together,\u201d the guidelines said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government issued its final version of the 2015 dietary guidelines, which tells businesses to lead walking meetings.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal government issued its final version of the 2015 dietary guidelines, which stresses a \u201ccollective\u201d approach to eating and lectures businesses to add physical activity into their employe", "title": "Feds to Businesses:Change to \u2018Walking Meetings\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-businesses-walking-meetings/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AP_152272690853-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government issued its final version of the 2015 dietary guidelines, which stresses a \u201c", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/AP_152272690853-150x150.jpg", "title": "Feds to Businesses:<br/>Change to \u2018Walking Meetings\u2019", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1940\"", "article_summary": "Businesses are encouraged to \u201cadopt organizational changes and practices.\u201d\u201cEncourage opportunities in the workplace for regular physical activity through active commuting, activity breaks, and walking meetings,\u201d according to one example the committee offered.\nThough the guidelines do not include recommendations to drop meat because of climate change they do endorse eating less meat.\nA \u201cwalking meeting\u201d is a business meeting where individuals continuously walk around, rather than sitting around a table.\nThe final guidelines also encourage restaurants to change their menus and shrink portion sizes.\nThe final version, which will be used by policymakers and bureaucrats that oversee federal food programs, was released Thursday."}
