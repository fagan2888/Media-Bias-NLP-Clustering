Consequently, most journalists, print and broadcast on the right and on the left, have neglected to cover this topic objectively. This topic, in my opinion, is highly essential to the preservation of the individual liberties Americans have enjoyed since the founding of our beloved country more than two centuries ago. Instead of reporting the truth as it really is, most journalists have been engaging in a conspiracy of silence to suppress the truth and vilify anyone who dares report the facts about the president\u2019s probable ineligibility, not to mention his destructive agenda for the United States of America.\n\nMore importantly, the media have been ignoring other news essential to the preservation, if not the very survival, of our Constitutional Republic itself. For instance, the president has signed more than 1,200 Executive Orders since he took office. While the alternate media have forewarned their respective constituencies of a future totalitarian system based on these orders, the mainstream press has been shockingly silent. However, such a dictatorial system may be more of a reality than most of us realize. The repressive government that the Founding Fathers had tried to prevent by formulating the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and its 26 addenda may be just a few years away. And the conspiracy theory so labeled by some journalists and the powers that be may no longer be a conspiracy theory after all. It may be a practical reality that most of us are still too reluctant to admit.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWhether we like it or not, and unless the Supreme Court itself strikes down some of these orders (a feat highly unlikely given the court\u2019s ruling on Obamacare), these presidential orders may have laid the groundwork for the implementation of what has been known to be the conspiracy theory so called. Actually, Obama\u2019s orders are laws that have been passed unilaterally, without congressional approval and without national debate\u2013much less the consent of the U.S. citizenry. Barring any unforeseen change in the status quo, these fiat laws may haunt us for a long time to come. And, more egregiously, they may eventually pave the way for the totalitarian form of government that most of us fear.\n\nCombined with a series of unconstitutional bills, enacted by Congress and signed by former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, these unconstitutional laws constitute the most dangerous erosion of personal liberties in the history of this nation. And in their entirety, they are the greatest threat to the preservation of our Constitutional Republic.\n\nObviously, this nation has been blindsided and even hoodwinked by this administration. Since the George W. Bush Administration, the American populace has been brainwashed into sacrificing our liberties for so-called security against terrorism in the wake of 9/11. For example, the institution of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to combat international terrorism now appears to be tantamount to a national surveillance agency similar to the Russian KGB; the Patriot Act (PA) that allows the government to spy on U.S. citizens without a court order may be the greatest invasion of privacy ever; the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that legitimizes the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens accused of terrorism without a trial is the greatest affront to due process; the killing of US citizens without a trial, even on US soil, is now constitutional; and the Obama Executive Order that turns over the control of all national resources to the Executive Branch in case of war or an emergency may be a socialist ploy to nationalize all private industries. These unconstitutional developments and laws may have laid the groundwork for a form of governance more sinister than one can ever imagine: a fascist dictatorship.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nTaken individually, the above laws seem to be rather innocuous by many; when taken in their entirety, however, they raise serious concern and due suspicion about the president\u2019s ulterior motive, his ultimate goal, and his objective for our country. For all practical purposes, these unconstitutional laws, along with the inception of the DHS and other Presidential Directives already on record, have in effect nullified the check-and-balance feature of the US Constitution. They, in effect, have turned our Constitutional Republic into a totalitarian system, with the president as dictator-in-chief.\n\nOf utmost importance to Constitutional scholars and concerned citizens of this country is the story of the president\u2019s birth certificate. While the conservative and alternative media have been reporting the probable forgery of his birth certificate, the once-revered press corps has been almost silent on this issue. While emerging facts have raised the possibility that Obama may not even be a legal resident of the United States, much less a \u201cnatural born\u201d citizen eligible to be the Chief Executive of this nation, the mainstream media themselves have been derelict in their responsibility even to report these pertinent facts about this mystery man in the White House. And if they perfunctorily report such news, they never do so in a fair and objective manner. Given the fact that Obama has hired a plethora of attorneys and has spent a huge amount of money (three million dollars by some estimates) to conceal his records from the American people, the nettlesome question as to what he is hiding continues to beg an answer.\n\nA more appropriate question is: Who really is this man?\n\nWe may know who his mother is. But who is his real father? Why has he released a fraudulent birth certificate as per Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s posse investigation? Where is his real birth certificate? Where was he born? Was he born in the U.S.? Or in Africa? In Kenya, to be exact? Does he have a valid U.S. Social Security Number? Why is the SSN he has been using registered to someone who lived in Connecticut about 150 years ago? Is he even in this country legally?\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nFurthermore, where are Obama\u2019s grammar-school records? Where are his high-school transcripts? Where are his college transcripts from Occidental, Columbia, and Harvard? How about his Selective Service Card?\n\nEven more importantly, is he a capitalist? Or a socialist? Is he a Christian? Or a Muslim? Was he ever a member of the Communist Party? Last but not least, is he a legitimate occupant of the Oval Office?\n\nAlthough speculation abounds as to the answer to these legitimate questions, nobody really knows the answer to some of them. And additional questions abound about the political ideology of a man who is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the United States of America. A man who at any time may command our military to start a war, even a nuclear war, without congressional approval. A man who may dispatch some of our most advanced warships to the Persian Gulf (or other parts of the world) and order our armed forces to look the other way while the Iranians use their inferior missiles to attack them and eventually destroy our 35 military bases in that part of the world. Even more critically, Obama holds the key to the US nuclear arsenal. A man whose past association with Communist agitators in America has been raised if not thoroughly documented. A man whose past is highly suspect and remains shielded from the 300 million people whom he purportedly represents in this country.\n\nBecause everything about this mystery man is shrouded in a thick veil of secrecy, guarded by a legion of highly-paid attorneys, for all that we know, Barack Hussein Obama may not even be Barack Hussein Obama!\n\nBut who is he?\n\nWell, considering the fact that he might have been born in a Muslim country, attended a Muslim School during his youth in Indonesia, changed his name from Barry Soetoro to Barack Hussein Obama per Muslim tradition in Canada, and admitted to being of the Muslim Faith in the United States, he may even be an ayatollah: Ayatollah Barack Hussein Obama to be exact. Perhaps, even the long-expected Imam Mahdi himself.\n\nThe Imam Mahdi is the Twelfth Imam, the Muslim Messiah, whose reappearance has long been anticipated by Iranians and other Shiite Muslims around the world. That possibility may well explain the Arab Spring movement, the ongoing quest to install heads of states of the Muslim Brotherhood persuasion in countries like Egypt, Libya, and possibly Syria and other African countries. Not to mention Obama\u2019s reluctance to declare ISIS an extremist group or a terrorist organization.\n\nMay the reader remember that Iran\u2019s religious eschatology that the Imam Mahdi will eventually appear, conquer the world, and raise the Islamic flag in every corner of the globe, long considered to be a politico-religious heresy, may not, after all, be a far-fetched anticipation.\n\nIf this scenario is indeed the case, members of the so called free press and Obama\u2019s supporters in America will have been guilty of the worst case of political deception and treason in world history. And Obama himself may be on a deliberate quest not just to revoke our individual liberties, but also to do something even more sinister. Eventually, he may even want to decimate, if not altogether discard, our Constitution. Worse yet, he may destroy Western Civilization, including the United States, Israel, and Christianity\u2013and turn the world into an Islamic Caliphate under Sharia Law.\n\nI opine that, even if he leaves the US peacefully at the end of his tenure as president, the danger the above scenario poses to western civilization will persist. For instance, what if he still retains control of our nuclear arsenal? What if he blows up New York City\u2013as he has expressed this possibility as one of his deep-seated fears as president? Or, worse yet, what if he turns over our nuclear arsenal to a rogue Muslim country like Iran, for example?\n\nAnd such a frightening scenario, which should send shivers down America\u2019s collective spine and strike fear in the heart of every patriotic U.S. citizen, may end up being the biggest conspiracy ever concocted. It may be the worst coup d\u2019etat ever fomented in the history of world politics!\n\nMay all patriotic citizens of this nation, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, set aside their partisan bickering. Rather, let them take heed of this impostor, the most polarizing and divisive president in our US history: the purported US president who has switched allegiance from the US itself to ISIS. And may YAH/God inspire what remains of our military officers, who have taken the oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, to rise up in protest and save our Constitutional Republic from the worst tyranny of all times!\n\nCopyright (c) 2012.
