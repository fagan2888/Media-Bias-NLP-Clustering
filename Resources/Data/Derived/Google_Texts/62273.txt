The World’s Largest Rattlesnake Roundup may have gotten too big for the market to bear — bad news for snake hunters and livestock across Texas.

According to the Abilene Reporter-News, this year’s annual roundup, held last weekend in the West Texas town of Sweetwater, set a record with about 100,000 pounds of rattlesnakes up for grabs.

“No one ever dreamed we would see numbers like that,” said longtime snake hunter and Merkel City Manager Steve Campbell. “No one ever speculated on having 12 tons of snakes.”

Trouble is, only about 25,000 pounds were actually bought (for their meat or skins or heads); the rest went unsold and unwanted.

There are simply too many sellers and not nearly enough buyers, Pat McLaughlin, president of the Brownwood Jaycees, told the newspaper. That dropped the price per pound at the roundup from $10 to a buck or even 50 cents.

“So hunters keep searching for a buyer, kill the snakes or release them back into the wild, which will be a bigger problem next year,” McLaughlin said.

Don’t be surprised if more snakes in the wild become a problem for ranchers.

“You’re going to see a lot more livestock getting bit by rattlesnakes just because there’s too many snakes out there,” McLaughlin said.
