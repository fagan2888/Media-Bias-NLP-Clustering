That put him in fifth place in an event that has become the annual high water mark for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, whose strong libertarian views play well at the event. But Bush was never expected to do particularly well at CPAC, so a top-five showing wasn\u2019t a major setback.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Talks Up National Defense, Sidesteps ISIS\n\nThe former Florida governor was not exactly on friendly ground when he appeared at the annual gathering of conservatives held at National Harbor, on the banks of the Potomac outside Washington. For a day-and-a-half before his speech, for example, conservative radio host Laura Ingraham used her appearances to bash his immigration policy. Playing to the crowd, she even suggested that he run on a joint ticket with Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nBefore his appearance, the Washington Times published a story about the plans of an untold number of attendees to walk out on Bush. By Friday morning, the influential Drudge Report\u2019s splash page had a photo of Bush with a single word: \u201cWalkout?\u201d\n\nSure enough, there were boos and shouts of \u201cCommon Core\u201d when Bush took the stage accompanied by Fox News host Sean Hannity, but they were quickly drowned out by his supporters. (The shouts of \u201cCommon Core\u201d were a reference to Bush\u2019s support for the controversial multi-state public school curriculum.)\n\nThe former Florida governor hadn\u2019t been on stage long when a large Gadsden flag, the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d emblem of the Tea Party, appeared above the crowd to Bush\u2019s left, and began moving slowly across the ballroom. Carried by Georgia resident William Temple, a regular at Tea Party events in Revolutionary War garb, the flag attracted dozens of followers, who streamed out of the auditorium as Hannity began talking with Bush\n\nRelated: Scott Walker Nails His Stump Speech \u2013 And It\u2019s Working\n\nTwo things were telling. First, while the participants were noisy \u2013 they began chanting \u201cNo more Bushes!\u201d outside the ballroom \u2013 there weren\u2019t really very many of them. Second, a large percentage of those who left wore bright red shirts with the \u201cStand with Rand\u201d message of those who back Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, also a GOP presidential contender.\n\nPaul, who has won the previous two CPAC straw polls, is a favorite at CPAC. His libertarian views are attractive to a crowd that skews much younger than the general electorate.\n\nIn the hallway outside the ballroom, the marchers were feeling triumphant. Temple held court, surrounded by a gaggle of cameras, while young Rand Paul supporters were eager to share their views.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a little sick of people trying to pander to us,\u201d said Armand Cortellesso, a 20-something graduate of Johnson & Wales University. He had traveled to CPAC from Rhode Island.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to use government to expand their interests, which usually involve expanding military operations around the world, with contracts for developers, contractors, and security firms and of course, with oil companies.\u201d\n\nRelated: At CPAC, Softball Questions for GOP Frontrunners\n\nAnother Paul supporter, college student Christopher Nosko of Charlotte, N.C., said, \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more Bushes in the White House. We don\u2019t need any more establishment Republicans in the White House.\u201d\n\nBack in the ballroom, Bush was articulating his positions on a number of controversial issues, among them immigration reform. Loud boos were quickly drowned out by the cheering of Bush supporters after Hannity mentioned he supported the plan to give drivers licenses to illegal immigrants and to allow children of illegals to get in-state tuition at Florida\u2019s state-run universities.\n\nBush stood by both positions. He also drew applause for a strong call to defend the border and reduce the number of people eligible to come to the U.S. because they have a relative here already.\n\nRelated: CPAC Alert \u2013 Conservative Predict SCOTUS Will Rule Against Obamacare\n\nHe reiterated a call for some current undocumented immigrants to be offered a path to legal permanent residence. \u201cI know there is some disagreement here. But the simple fact is there is no plan to deport 11 million people. We should give them a path to legal status, where they work, where they don\u2019t receive government benefits, they don\u2019t break the law, they learn English, and they make a contribution to our society.\u201d\n\nBush addressed the potential of a partial shutdown of Homeland Security because of a fight over defunding President Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration. He said, \u201cIt makes no sense to me that we\u2019re not funding control of our border, which is the whole argument. I\u2019m missing something.\u201d\n\nRelated: Walker Continues to Take on Labor as his GOP Stock Soars\n\nBy the time Hannity steered Bush to his record as governor of Florida, which included tax cuts, education reforms, spending cuts and more, it felt as though Bush had mostly won the conservative audience over.\n\nBush\u2019s record as governor was likely news to many attendees who were barely out of kindergarten when Bush was first elected in 1998. They\u2019d only barely finished middle school when he finished his second and final term in 2007.\n\nIt may be ironic that a man aiming to be the third consecutive member of his family to occupy the White House should need to introduce himself to voters. But Jeb Bush hasn\u2019t held elective office in eight years, and is more associated with the presidencies of his father, George H.W. Bush, and crucially his brother, George W. Bush, than with his own record.\n\nHe took steps to change that on Friday \u2013 and judging by the cheers, made a great deal of progress. Outside, in the hallway, Temple, his Gadsden flag, and the gaggle of Rand Paul supporters were all long gone.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If Friday was the best a coalition of Libertarians and the GOP\u2019s hard right can do to make Jeb Bush feel unwelcome in the GOP primaries, the former Florida governor doesn\u2019t have much to worry about from that corner.", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s Success at CPAC: More Than Convincing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/01/Jeb-Bush-s-Success-CPAC-More-Convincing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03152013_Jeb_Bush_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/01/Jeb-Bush-s-Success-CPAC-More-Convincing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03152013_Jeb_Bush_article.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If Friday was the best a coalition of Libertarians and the GOP\u2019s hard right can do to make Jeb Bush feel unwelcome in the GOP primaries, the former Florida governor doesn\u2019t have much to worry about from that corner.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Temple held court, surrounded by a gaggle of cameras, while young Rand Paul supporters were eager to share their views.\nOutside, in the hallway, Temple, his Gadsden flag, and the gaggle of Rand Paul supporters were all long gone.\nPaul, who has won the previous two CPAC straw polls, is a favorite at CPAC.\nBut Bush was never expected to do particularly well at CPAC, so a top-five showing wasn\u2019t a major setback.\nThat put him in fifth place in an event that has become the annual high water mark for Kentucky Sen.
