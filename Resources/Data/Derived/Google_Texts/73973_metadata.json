RBA is a volunteer alliance of medical professionals, organizations and community members dedicated to providing free primary, quality healthcare services to uninsured families and individuals with limited ability to pay for medical care. RBA continues to serve the healthcare needs of many the Affordable Care Act cannot not support. RotaCare Bay Area is \u201cthe Safety net for the Safety Net!\u201d\n\nThe organization was formed in 1989 when a local Rotarian, Dr. Mark Campbell and his Campbell Rotary Club identified the need of many local residents who had limited access to primary healthcare services. They resolved to meet the need with a clinic in Santa Clara. That first clinic, located in the former Agnews State Hospital site has since closed, but in its place RBA now has 12 clinics located in Concord, Daly City, Gilroy, Half Moon Bay, Monterey, Mountain View, Pittsburg, San Jose, San Leandro, San Rafael and Santa Cruz. The organization is driven by volunteers and supported solely through locally based philanthropy. RBA\u2019s network consists of 12 free medical clinics located throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nRBA harnesses the skills and hearts of local physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, bi-lingual interpreters, social workers, and many others who volunteer their time to provide basic primary health services free of charge to our patients. Our clinics are open one to three nights a week, often sharing a clinic location with a school health center or hospital clinic, but also located in community centers. Only the number of volunteers that can be recruited binds us along with the funds we can raise, because the need is always there. Without RotaCare, patients would have no choice but to use hospital emergency rooms as their source of primary care. Using hospital emergency rooms for non-emergency problems drives healthcare costs up because the care for uninsured patients is passed on in higher healthcare premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. The 12 RotaCare Free Medical Clinics experienced over 18,400 patient visits last year. The clinics receive no government funding or insurance reimbursement.\n\nCONTACT: Steve Polcyn RotaCare Bay Area Board Vice President C: 925-548-3516 E: stevep@rotacarebayarea.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "She Brings Strong Leadership Skills and a Wealth of Non-Profit, Public Health, Education and Humanitarian Health Experience", "original-source": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/03/08/817987/0/en/RotaCare-Bay-Area-Names-Elisabeth-Whitney-as-Chief-Executive-Officer.html", "title": "RotaCare Bay Area Names Elisabeth Whitney as Chief Executive Officer", "og": {"site_name": "GlobeNewswire News Room", "description": "She Brings Strong Leadership Skills and a Wealth of Non-Profit, Public Health, Education and Humanitarian Health Experience", "title": "RotaCare Bay Area Names Elisabeth Whitney as Chief Executive Officer", "url": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/03/08/817987/0/en/RotaCare-Bay-Area-Names-Elisabeth-Whitney-as-Chief-Executive-Officer.html", "image": "http://globenewswire.com/Attachment/LogoDisplay/383648?filename=383648.jpg&size=1", "locale": "en_US", "article": {"tag": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc., Free Health Care, Community Clinic, NONPROFIT, Safety Net, RotaCare Bay Area, Affordable Care Act, Uninsured, MANAGEMENT CHANGES", "published_time": "3/8/2016 6:45:38 PM", "author": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc."}, "type": "article"}, "author": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc.", "DC.date.issued": "3/8/2016", "keywords": "RotaCare Bay Area, Inc., Free Health Care, Community Clinic, NONPROFIT, Safety Net, RotaCare Bay Area, Affordable Care Act, Uninsured, MANAGEMENT CHANGES", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cElisabeth brings strong leadership, management and strategic planning skills to RotaCare Bay Area, along with extensive experience in non-profit and health related organizations having studied and worked on four continents,\u201d said John Thomas, board president of RotaCare Bay Area.\nShe will also provide administrative direction and oversight to all programs, as well as our network of 12 RotaCare Bay Area Free Medical Clinics in the Greater Bay Area.\nMILPITAS, Calif., March 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RotaCare Bay Area, Inc., a non-profit 501(c) 3 organization with 12 free medical clinics in the Greater Bay Area, has named Elisabeth Kirby Whitney as its chief executive officer, effective immediately.\nCONTACT: Steve Polcyn RotaCare Bay Area Board Vice President C: 925-548-3516 E: stevep@rotacarebayarea.org\nAbout RotaCare Bay AreaRotaCare Bay Area is a non-profit 501 (c) 3 organization."}
