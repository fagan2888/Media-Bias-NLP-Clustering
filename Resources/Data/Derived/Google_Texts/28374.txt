The City of Tucson is holding a second 'warrant day' for those who have a warrant and who are interested in coming in to court to resolve them.

According to a recent city of Tucson release those with warrants who want to come in may go to Tucson City Court (103 E. Alameda) on December 5, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. to see a judge, on a walk-in basis.

Individuals can check the Court’s website to see if they have a warrant. Under “Online Resources” select the heading “See If You Have a Warrant” and follow the prompts. A case number or list of cases with the defendant’s name and case status will appear. If the case is in warrant status that will be indicated in the case status displayed.

The Court is asking individuals who have outstanding warrants and who are planning to come to the Court on Dec. 5, to address their warrant(s) to notify the Court in advance by email using the link 'Contact Us' on the website or by emailing courtweb@tucsonaz.gov. Notifying the Court in advance will allow for the proper files to be pulled and documents to be prepared in advance. This should allow the Court to see more defendants.

There will be no consequences if a defendant fails to show up on Warrant Day after sending an email indicating they would attend. The Court’s goal is to have cases prepared in advance to serve as many defendants as possible.
