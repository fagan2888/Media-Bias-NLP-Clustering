GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) - James Summers accounted for three touchdowns, two coming on the ground in a huge rushing performance, to help East Carolina beat Virginia Tech 35-28 on Saturday.

The backup quarterback ran for 169 yards in a bigger-than-expected role amid rainy conditions, going from the change-of-pace option behind Blake Kemp to the guy powering the Pirates (2-2) to their first home win against the Hokies (2-2) in 23 years.

Trevon Brown and Isaiah Jones each had touchdown catches for East Carolina, which ditched its pass-heavy ways and kept the ball on the ground. Summers carried the ball on 21 of ECU's 43 run plays, more than double their pass attempts in an unusual look under Ruffin McNeill.

Brenden Motley ran and threw for a score for the Hokies, who jumped to a 14-0 lead by capitalizing on two early turnovers only to squander that lead by the end of the opening quarter.
