For the 52-year-old farmworker, maintaining coverage is a must.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indispensable,\u201d said Santos, who asked that his last name not be used. Through a Spanish language interpreter, Mackenzie Mann, he continued, \u201cAs a farmworker, we are exposed to everything. For this reason, it\u2019s important for us to have health insurance.\u201d\n\nA native of Mexico but living now in central North Carolina\u2019s Harnett County, Santos has been working seasonally in that state for the past 12 years, picking tobacco, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, and other fruits and vegetables. He was on hand for an Affordable Care Act enrollment event at the Episcopal Farmworker Ministry in Dunn on Sunday. (Dunn is a city of about 9,000 residents on the eastern edge of Harnett County, near I-85.)\n\nThe event was sponsored by the North Carolina Farmworkers\u2019 Project in Benson, Legal Aid of North Carolina, Stedman-Wade Health Services Inc., Access East, Goshen Medical Center, Greene County Health Care, Lincoln Community Health Center, MDC Inc., and Legal Services of Southern Piedmont.\n\n\u201cWe as an organization want every farmworker to have access to affordable health care. The Affordable Care Act increases that access,\u201d explained Mann, an educator with the Farmworkers\u2019 Project. Her organization\u2019s objective is to connect workers to that care.\n\nThe May 22 event offered education to migrant farmworkers about the health insurance marketplace. Assisters were on hand to help workers choose a plan and enroll. Others who, like Santos, are already covered, could get help in understanding the paperwork they received post-enrollment.\n\nQualifying Events\n\nThe 50 or so farmworkers who signed up for help missed this year\u2019s ACA open enrollment period. But they\u2019re offered a second chance. A special open-enrollment period allows consumers who experience certain life events \u2013 a change in marital or immigration status, for example \u2013 to apply after the main enrollment period has ended.\n\nEntering the country on an H-2A work visa is considered a qualifying life event, making migrant workers eligible for the special-enrollment period. The H-2A visa allows non-immigrant workers to work seasonally in agriculture.\n\nAfter proving their immigration status, the workers must have proof of having paid federal income taxes and have an entry-exit card to prove they\u2019re here legally. They may qualify if their employer offers no health coverage or the employer coverage does not meet the minimum standards set by the ACA.\n\n\u2018Just in Case\u2019 Coverage\n\nThe event was the second for the Farmworkers\u2019 Project. The first was in February 2015, a time of year when large numbers of workers arrive for the planting season. The project covers portions of southern Wake County and most of Harnett, Johnston, Duplin, and Cumberland counties.\n\nMann said the group must work quickly to get the word out about the Affordable Care Act. Qualifying workers only have 60 days after their arrival in the U.S. to sign up. Rather than guide someone through telephone prompts or point them to the main HealthCare.gov website in Spanish, Mann said having in-person assisters who speak the language is a better approach. For many, she said, this is their first time accessing affordable coverage, and they need more explanation.\n\nSantos V. said he hasn\u2019t had to use his insurance yet, but that he feels more secure knowing that in case something happens, he\u2019s covered.\n\nMann said she\u2019s heard stories of workers who were lucky they had insurance. Last year, one worker she\u2019d met broke his leg. After numerous doctor\u2019s appointments, a surgery and rehab, the worker\u2019s treatment cost $32,000. The health insurance marketplace paid $31,000, Mann said.\n\nAnother farmworker, she said, had successful hernia surgery as soon as he needed it, rather than waiting to go back to Mexico at the end of the season.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, workers can continue working and providing for their families\u201d thanks to health insurance coverage, Mann said.\n\nThe project had 50 confirmed participants with more who could not get an appointment, Mann said. She hopes to schedule another event in June, when the next big wave of workers arrives for the picking season.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u2018Assisters\u2019 Help Migrant Farmers Sign up for Health Insurance During Grace Period By Brenda Porter-RockwellThis article was produced by North Carolina Health News and is used by permission.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, workers can continue working and providing for their families\u201d thanks to health insurance coverage, Mann said.\n\u201cWe as an organization want every farmworker to have access to affordable health care.\nSantos V. sat at a long folding table asking questions in Spanish about a letter he got concerning his health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\nThey may qualify if their employer offers no health coverage or the employer coverage does not meet the minimum standards set by the ACA."}
