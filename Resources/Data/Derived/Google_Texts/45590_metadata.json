The man knocked on the door of the apartment where the fire appeared to be coming from and ended up breaking the door down when nobody answered, Scholting said. A resident who had just moved in was asleep inside. The man pulled the resident to safety.\n\n\u201cThey tried to fight the fire for a while, and then got out of there,\u201d Scholting said.\n\nAbout 50 firefighters responded to the blaze that began on a second-story balcony, Scholting said.\n\n\u201cThe flames got into the attic and spread, which made it structurally unstable,\u201d Scholting said.\n\nFirefighters were pulled out twice because the building looked like it might collapse, she said.\n\nResponders then tried to fight the fire from the outside and keep it from spreading. Part of the roof collapsed in at least a few adjoining apartments, Scholting said.\n\nThere was one non-life threatening injury, although authorities are not sure what that injury is at this time.\n\nOfficials are still investigating the cause of the fire, Scholting said, although they have determined it to be accidental.\n\n\u201cThe building has been condemned,\u201d Scholting said.\n\nThe building contained 14 apartments. All of the families who lived there are now displaced, Scholting said.\n\nTwelve units were affected, according to the American Red Cross, which worked with the affected families on Sunday.\n\nThe organization has provided food, shelter, lodging, clothing and transportation for residents from four of the damaged units.\n\nThe Salvation Army and Jefferson County Victim Assistance are also trying to help the families who are without housing, Scholting said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Littleton apartment fire displaces a dozen families", "title": "Littleton apartment fire displaces a dozen families", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/16/littleton-apartment-fire-displaces-a-dozen-families/", "image": {"width": 479, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150816__Littleton_firep1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150816__Littleton_firep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-16T11:34:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T03:50:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde57\"", "article_summary": "Several Littleton families are displaced after a fire destroyed an apartment complex in The Dakota at Governor\u2019s Ranch Apartments.\nThe man pulled the resident to safety.\nThe Salvation Army and Jefferson County Victim Assistance are also trying to help the families who are without housing, Scholting said.\nThe second alarm fire began early Saturday evening in building 17 of the apartment complex at 9023 West Cross Drive, said West Metro Fire spokeswoman Ronda Scholting.\nTwelve units were affected, according to the American Red Cross, which worked with the affected families on Sunday."}
