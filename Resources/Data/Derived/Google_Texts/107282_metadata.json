He had a horse new to the sport on Sunday, a Morgan horse named Sassy.\n\n\"I love the challenge,\" he said.\n\nHe enjoys this event over other dressage events where a judge is viewing many horses in the arena at once.\n\n\"I don't care how good the judge is. They just can't do a good job,\" he said. \"If you have one judge judging dressage like this, that judge sees absolutely everything going on. It's fairer, plus it's more of a personal challenge.\"\n\nBloss also owns Carriage Machine Shop in Berthoud that produces horse drawn carriages.\n\nFall Follies was hosted by the Rocky Mountain Carriage Club, which is under the American Driving Society, based in Wisconsin.\n\n\"Carriage driving now is a sport. Back in England, it was the way you got around. A lot of this is tradition based on what people wore or did 100 years ago before cars were invented,\" Bruckhauser said.\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Carriage Club is a 501(c)3 that has been in existence since the 1980s to promote the sport of carriage driving. They have 80 members and around 22 of those participated on Sunday. Their club is based mainly on the north side of Denver while the Colorado Driving Society draws its members from the south side.\n\nJessica Benes: 970-669-5050 ext. 530, jbenes@reporter-herald.com, Twitter.com/jessicabenes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28888057/horse-owners-show-their-pull", "modificationDate": "2015-09-30T12:21:24-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0927/20150927__28RHAFALLFOLLIES~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Jessica Benes \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "From horses to ponies to VSEs or \"Very Small Equines,\" carriage drivers from around Colorado arrived in Johnstown on Sunday to participate in the Fall Follies horse driving competition.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:28888057:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-27T22:47:10-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28888057/horse-owners-show-their-pull", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0927/20150927__28RHAFALLFOLLIES~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "From horses to ponies to VSEs or \"Very Small Equines,\" carriage drivers from around Colorado arrived in Johnstown on Sunday to participate in the Fall Follies horse driving competition.", "title": "Horse owners show their pull at fall Follies"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "From horses to ponies to VSEs or \"Very Small Equines,\" carriage drivers from around Colorado arrived in Johnstown on Sunday to participate in the Fall Follies horse driving competition.", "title": "Horse owners show their pull at fall Follies", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28888057/horse-owners-show-their-pull", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0927/20150927__28RHAFALLFOLLIES~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-27T22:47:10-0600", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2025-09-27T22:05:18-0600", "sailthru.title": "Horse owners show their pull at fall Follies", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Loveland News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "byline": "By Jessica BenesReporter-Herald", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2015/0927/20150927__28RHAFALLFOLLIES~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-09-27T22:48:40-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland News, Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado Loveland News news, Loveland Colorado news, Loveland News Loveland news, Loveland News Colorado news, US Loveland News news, world Loveland News news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d4b\"", "article_summary": "Fall Follies was hosted by the Rocky Mountain Carriage Club, which is under the American Driving Society, based in Wisconsin.\nContest brings together competitors in carriage horse divisionsKathy Sassano and her pony Stonyhill's Merlot prance through the warm-up course Sunday during the Rocky Mountain Carriage Club Fall Follies event in Johnstown.\nFrom horses to ponies to VSEs or \"Very Small Equines,\" carriage drivers from around Colorado arrived in Johnstown on Sunday to participate in the Fall Follies horse driving competition.\n( Aaron R.
