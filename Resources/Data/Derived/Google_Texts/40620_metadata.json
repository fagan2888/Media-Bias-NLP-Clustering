Emma is her black and white cat, at her home in central New York state, 250 miles away. Her childlike reaction was, perhaps, not surprising. Kat is just 18.\n\nIt is a transgender moment. President Barack Obama was hailed just for saying the word \u201ctransgender\u201d in his State of the Union speech this year.\n\nBruce Jenner\u2019s transition from male sex symbol to a female named Caitlyn has elevated her back to her public profile as a gold-medal decathlete at the 1976 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe question is no longer whether gender reassignment is an option, but rather, how young should it begin. While no law prohibits minors from receiving sex-change hormones or even surgery, insurers have generally refused to extend coverage for these procedures to those under 18.\n\nNow advocates are fighting for coverage at an earlier age, beginning with hormone blockers at the onset of puberty. They say it is more seamless for a teenage boy to transition to becoming an adult woman, for example, if he does not first become a man.\n\n\u201cSome of these women are passing, but barely, when they transition at 40 or 50,\u201d said Dr. Irene Sills, an endocrinologist who just retired from a practice treating transgender children, including Kat. \u201cAt 16 or 17, you are going to have such an easier life with this.\u201d\n\nGiven that there are no proven biological markers for what is known as gender dysphoria, there is no medical consensus on the central question: whether teenagers \u2014 habitually trying on new identities and not known for foresight \u2014 should be granted an irreversible physical fix for what is still considered a psychological condition.\n\nThe debates invoke biology, ideology and emotion. Is gender dysphoria governed by a wiring of the brain or by genetic coding? How much does it stem from the pressure to fit into society\u2019s boxes? Has the Internet liberated teenagers like Kat from a narrow view of how they should live, or seduced them by offering an answer they might later choose to reject?\n\n\u201cBasically you have clinics working by the seat of the pants, making these decisions, and depending on which clinic you go to, you get a different response,\u201d said Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychiatrist who helped develop the latest diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.\n\nBut, he asked, \u201cIs it fair to make a child who\u2019s never going to change wait till 16 or 18 to get treatment?\u201d\n\nA young science\n\nAs a freshman in high school, Kat Boone became depressed and withdrawn.\n\n\u201cI knew that the changes going on with puberty were not me,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI started to really hate my life, myself. I was uncomfortable with my body, my voice, and I just felt like I was really a girl.\u201d\n\nWhen she discovered the transgender world on the Internet, she had a flash of recognition. One night, she crept into her mother\u2019s room and sat on the bed, crying. When she finally came out with what was bothering her, her mother\u2019s first impulse was to comfort her, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nKat\u2019s father, Andrew, had moved out when she was in fifth grade, and it took a few months for Kat and her mother to find the courage to tell him. Gail Boone had a background in psychology, which helped her understand. Andrew Boone, an operations and project manager, had a harder time.\n\n\u201cI was really eating myself up because I couldn\u2019t help this overwhelming feeling as if my child had died,\u201d he said. \u201cBut here was my child right in front of me.\u201d\n\nIt was the cutting that convinced them that if she could not live as a girl, Kat would kill herself. She still has two angry scars on her left forearm.\n\nAt 16 \u00bd , after seeing a therapist, Kat began taking estrogen and a blood-pressure drug, spironolactone, that is also used to block the actions of testosterone, to help her look more female.\n\nThe drive to treat children is relatively new. The puberty-blocking protocol gained legitimacy in 2009, when it was endorsed by the Endocrine Society, a physicians\u2019 group. It calls for administering drugs normally used to treat precocious puberty, as well as prostate cancer and endometriosis.\n\nThe theory is that this drug-induced lull from 12 to 16 \u2014 sometimes younger \u2014 will help teenagers decide whether they truly are transgender, without committing to irreversible physical changes. But in practice, experts warn, once children have \u201csocially transitioned\u201d it is difficult to go back.\n\nThe blockers cost thousands of dollars a year, and like all drugs used for transgender treatment, have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that use, though they may be prescribed \u201coff label.\u201d Some doctors have been able to drive the price down to $120 a month by getting the adult implant, which is much cheaper than the pediatric one, and stretching it out over two years instead of one.\n\nWhile hormones for minors are sometimes covered by insurance, surgery almost never is. Kat\u2019s surgeon, Dr. Christine McGinn, estimated that she had done more than 30 operations on children under 18, about half of them vaginoplasties for biological boys becoming girls, and the other half double mastectomies for girls becoming boys.\n\nKat\u2019s parents trusted McGinn not only as a specialist, but also as a role model: She had been a dashing male doctor in the Navy, before becoming a beautiful female doctor in civilian life.\n\nAdvocates say extending treatment to teenagers will alleviate depression and suicide. The evidence is mixed. Complicating matters, studies suggest that most young children with gender dysphoria eventually lose any desire to change sex, and may grow up to be gay, rather than transgender. Once into adolescence, however, their dysphoria is more likely to stick.\n\nDr. Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, is skeptical of the use of surgery for a psychological condition, and even more so for children.\n\n\u201cBruce Jenner \u2014 who cares?\u201d said McHugh, who said he played a role in closing a transgender surgery program at Johns Hopkins about 35 years ago. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderfully successful person. He\u2019s got all kinds of social networks. He\u2019s got plenty of money. No one\u2019s objecting to him if he wants to live as a woman. This is America, be my guest.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re talking about children with a future ahead of them.\u201d\n\nUnder the knife\n\nKat went into the surgery with high hopes. Her goal was to start college as a woman.\n\nThey were able to book a date during spring break, when McGinn\u2019s calendar begins filling up with college-bound patients.\n\nIt was too late to change some things, like Kat\u2019s tenor voice and facial hair. She chose not to save sperm \u2014 to her, a revolting reminder of masculinity \u2014 so she cannot have children. It was the one sacrifice that gave her father a pang.\n\nThe operation involved deconstructing her male genitals and repurposing the nerves and skin as female anatomy. When it was over, Kat developed aspiration pneumonia and had vomiting and dry heaves for days.\n\nThese are normal reactions to anesthesia, narcotics and antibiotics, but McGinn said Kat was hit harder than most. Six weeks after the operation, she was still so weak she had to take the elevator at school instead of stairs.\n\nAt her two-month checkup, she had gained back half the weight she had lost, but still looked frail and self-conscious. She treated herself to a new hair color \u2014 strawberry blond \u2014 for graduation. She said she had \u201czero regrets.\u201d\n\nBut she was anxious about having enough privacy in college, since her new vagina needs constant care or it will close off like a wound.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m thinking about now is the room situation,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/07/1003105752-FL_SAR_HFTRANS07-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe107b\"", "article_summary": "Is gender dysphoria governed by a wiring of the brain or by genetic coding?\nThe question is no longer whether gender reassignment is an option, but rather, how young should it begin.\nComplicating matters, studies suggest that most young children with gender dysphoria eventually lose any desire to change sex, and may grow up to be gay, rather than transgender.\n\u201cBruce Jenner \u2014 who cares?\u201d said McHugh, who said he played a role in closing a transgender surgery program at Johns Hopkins about 35 years ago.\nBut, he asked, \u201cIs it fair to make a child who\u2019s never going to change wait till 16 or 18 to get treatment?\u201dA young scienceAs a freshman in high school, Kat Boone became depressed and withdrawn."}
