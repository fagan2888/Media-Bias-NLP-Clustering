All of that is good news.\n\nBut there are still millions of people who lack this security \u2014 and many of them live in just a small number of communities across the country, including here in Chicago.\n\nSo I have a challenge for you, Chicago.\n\nOPINION\n\nOpen enrollment season for plans on the Health Insurance Marketplace just began, and we\u2019re launching the Healthy Communities Challenge to rally folks to get covered in 20 communities with the greatest potential for impact. And if Chicago signs up the highest percentage of your neighbors who aren\u2019t covered this year, I\u2019ll come visit to tell the whole country about all of your success.\n\nSo maybe you\u2019re a local official, a pastor or a sports hero who can spread the word. Maybe you\u2019ve got a cousin or an uncle who\u2019s been uninsured for far too long. Or, maybe you\u2019re between jobs and don\u2019t think that affordable coverage is an option for you. No matter who you are, everybody can get covered or help their neighbors do so.\n\nYou can start by telling folks about how affordable this coverage can be. In Illinois, more than 6 in 10 people can get covered for $100 or less a month, and more than 5 in 10 can get covered for $75 or less a month. For a lot of folks, that\u2019s less than their cell phone or cable bill. And last year, consumers in Illinois saved an average of $212 a month thanks to tax credits for Marketplace coverage.\n\nYou can tell folks how easy it is to sign up. Getting covered used to mean filling out endless pages of forms \u2014 and sometimes even a medical exam. But today, GetCovered Illinois makes the process fast and simple \u2014 you can shop around, compare plans and choose the one that works for you and your family.\n\nYou can tell folks that insurance companies can no longer deny coverage because of a preexisting condition \u2014 and that preventive care like checkups and mammograms are now covered for free.\n\nAnd most importantly, you should tell folks to go to GetCovered.Illinois.gov to sign up. Or, they can call 1-866-311-1119 for assistance. And in many cities, local events or assistance are available to help guide you and your neighbors through the process.\n\nOpen enrollment is already underway, and if you sign up by December 15, you\u2019ll have coverage on New Year\u2019s Day. But no matter what, you should sign up by January 31 to get coverage next year.\n\nSo I hope everyone in Chicago will get their families and their neighbors involved. That\u2019s what the Healthy Communities Challenge is all about \u2014 working together, block by block, community by community, to help each other and this country get ahead. So good luck \u2014 maybe I\u2019ll see you in Chicago next year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Today, more Americans have health insurance than ever before \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act, more than 17.6 million people have gained coverage,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/president-obama-sign-up-now-chicago-for-health-insurance/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "President Obama: Sign up now, Chicago, for health insurance"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/president-obama-sign-up-now-chicago-for-health-insurance/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "President Obama: Sign up now, Chicago, for health insurance"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0728\"", "article_summary": "And most importantly, you should tell folks to go to GetCovered.Illinois.gov to sign up.\nYou can tell folks how easy it is to sign up.\nPresident Obama: Sign up now, Chicago, for health insuranceToday, more Americans have health insurance than ever before \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act, more than 17.6 million people have gained coverage, uninsured rates have plummeted, and millions more families have the security of knowing that they won\u2019t go broke just because somebody got sick.\nOpen enrollment is already underway, and if you sign up by December 15, you\u2019ll have coverage on New Year\u2019s Day.\nYou can tell folks that insurance companies can no longer deny coverage because of a preexisting condition \u2014 and that preventive care like checkups and mammograms are now covered for free."}
