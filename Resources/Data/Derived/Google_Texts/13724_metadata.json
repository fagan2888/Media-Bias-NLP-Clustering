Sen. Rand Paul, the irascible Tea Party senator from Kentucky, is now reportedly threatening to block confirmation on the president\u2019s desired Federal Reserve chair.\n\nPresident Obama nominated Janet Yellen to chair the Federal Reserve earlier this month. If confirmed, she would be the first woman to ever hold the post.\n\nPaul, who has become one of the most vocal Federal Reserve critics in the Senate, will reportedly put a hold on Yellen\u2019s nomination unless Senate leadership allows a vote on his Fed transparency bill. The Federal Reserve Transparency Act would require a full audit of the notoriously opaque Federal Reserve by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\n\u201cWe must take a critical look at the Fed\u2019s monetary policy decisions, discount window operations, and a host of other things, with a real audit\u2014and not just pay lip-service to the idea of an audit,\u201d said Paul in a 2011 statement on his website explaining his support for the bill. \u201cAt a time when we\u2019re seeing great volatility in small Euro-zone economies like Greece, Portugal, and Ireland, it is more crucial than ever that we have real transparency at our own central bank.\u201d\n\nBoth Yellen\u2019s nomination and Paul\u2019s bill command strong progressive support. Richard Trumka, who leads the powerful labor organization AFL-CIO, has both endorsed Yellen and cosigned a letter demanding that the Fed be audited. Other signatories to the letter include progressive economist Dean Baker, left-wing journalist Naomi Klein, and the president of the United Steelworkers Union.\n\nIn Congress, a Fed audit has the support of many members of the president\u2019s own party. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., co-sponsored a similar measure in the House, along with Rand Paul\u2019s father, Texas Rep. Ron Paul.\n\nRand Paul\u2019s motives for auditing the Fed differ from those of his strange bedfellows, however. Whereas many progressives want the Federal Reserve to be more aggressive in promoting full employment, Paul has signalled that he would prefer to eliminate fiat money and return to the gold standard.\n\nThis is not the first time that Paul has worked to delay the confirmation of an Obama appointee. In March, he held a 13-hour filibuster against the president\u2019s proposed CIA director, during which he railed against the White House\u2019s secretive targeted killing program.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The irascible Tea Party senator from Kentucky is threatening to put a hold on the president's Fed Chair nominee.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-stop-yellen", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "The irascible Tea Party senator from Kentucky is threatening to put a hold on the president's Fed Chair nominee.", "title": "Rand Paul: Stop Yellen", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-stop-yellen", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/1837277051.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-stop-yellen", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/1837277051.jpg?itok=O-bSV9Al", "height": 553}, "title": "Rand Paul: Stop Yellen", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The irascible Tea Party senator from Kentucky is threatening to put a hold on the president's Fed Chair nominee."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-25T12:51:47-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "nedresnikoff", "title": "Rand Paul: Stop Yellen", "tags": "economy,federal-reserve,republicans,tea-party,all-in", "published": 1, "date": "10/25/2013 12:51:47 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/rand-paul-stop-yellen"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "The irascible Tea Party senator from Kentucky is threatening to put a hold on the president's Fed Chair nominee.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Economy, Republicans, Tea Party, Federal Reserve"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9f7b\"", "article_summary": "The Federal Reserve Transparency Act would require a full audit of the notoriously opaque Federal Reserve by the Government Accountability Office (GAO).\nSen.
