The superstar made the flag-waving fans gasp in awe 2:37 later with a drop pass to set up Evgeni Malkin\u2019s goal that gave Russia a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Slovenians were respectable for two-plus periods in their first Olympic hockey game ever.\n\nZiga Jeglic had two goals in the second period \u2014 one before Evgeni Malkin scored and one after \u2014 to pull Slovenia within a score of a talented team.\n\nRussia created a cushion in the first half of the third period when Valeri Nichushkin and Anton Belov.\n\nWhen the game was over, the team that is treated like rock stars in its country raised their sticks and got a standing ovation.\n\nMore than 11,000 fans filled the Bolshoy Ice Dome ready to party, chanting \u201cRo-ssi-ya! Ro-ssi-ya!\u201d before the game even started. They screamed the home nation\u2019s chant early and often during the game and did the wave when the only question was how much Russia would win by against an overmatched team.\n\nSlovenia has only one NHL player, Los Angeles Kings forward Anze Kopitar, whose father is the team\u2019s coach. Jeglic plays professionally in Germany.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has 16 players from the NHL and two stars, Kovalchuk and Alexander Radulov, who left the league to go back home to play in the Kontinental Hockey League.\n\nThe Russians\u2019 skill was on full display early in the game as they skated fast, shot hard and made slick moves.\n\nOvechkin charged down the left side of the ice early in the game and his wrist shot from the left circle was so sharp that Slovenia\u2019s goaltender, Robert Kristan, had no shot to stop it with his glove.\n\nThe Washington Capitals forward showed he could pass, too, when he lightly touched the puck near center ice to give Malkin an opportunity to score. The Pittsburgh Penguins star took full advantage of the chance, deking to his right in front of the net and shooting left to beat Kristan\u2019s blocker.\n\nInstead of rolling to a rout, though, the Russians had to make some stops and shots the rest of the way to win.\n\nSemyon Varlamov had to make just 12 saves, but one of them required him to kick his right leg out to deny Kopitar when the game was still in doubt.\n\nKristan faced a flurry of shots \u2014 18 in the first and 35 in the game \u2014 and gave his team a chance to compete in a game no one outside of Slovenia\u2019s dressing room thought it could win.\n\nFollow Larry Lage on Twitter: http://twitter.com/larrylage", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Semyon Varlamov\u2019s 12 saves help Russians beat Slovenia in hockey", "title": "Semyon Varlamov\u2019s 12 saves help Russians beat Slovenia in hockey", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/13/semyon-varlamovs-12-saves-help-russians-beat-slovenia-in-hockey/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213_092537_semyon-varlamov.jpg", "height": 783}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140213_092537_semyon-varlamov.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-13T09:26:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:15:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc899\"", "article_summary": "Ovechkin scored 1:17 after the puck dropped with a wrist shot that made the crowd roar.\nThe Russians\u2019 skill was on full display early in the game as they skated fast, shot hard and made slick moves.\nSOCHI, Russia \u2014 Alex Ovechkin had a goal and an assist in a breathtaking start and the Russians went on to beat Slovenia 5-2 Thursday in their Sochi Olympics opener.\nThe Slovenians were respectable for two-plus periods in their first Olympic hockey game ever.\nRussia created a cushion in the first half of the third period when Valeri Nichushkin and Anton Belov."}
