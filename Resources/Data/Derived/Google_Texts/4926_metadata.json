The show, premiering in April, is a spinoff of his popular \u201cStar Talk\u201d podcast.\n\nTyson, a veteran of scrappy shows like \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d said he doesn\u2019t have an agenda to stir up controversy with his guests, including noted biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins. \u201cThe goal is for you to learn, not to watch a fight,\u201d the \u201cCosmos\u201d host said Wednesday at the Television Critics Association press event in Pasadena, Calif., where Nat Geo and other outlets unveiled new programs.\n\nWhile Jimmy Fallon has his stage in historic 30 Rockefeller Plaza and David Letterman has the Ed Sullivan Theater, the late-night rookie has a pretty cool setting for his show, which is shooting inside the Hall of the Universe at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nNat Geo\u2019s other new shows include \u201cThe Big Picture,\u201d a \u201cFreakonomics\u201d style dive into data and maps which is hosted by \u201cHarold & Kumar\u201d star and former White House staffer Kal Penn.\n\nThe panelists promoting another show, \u201cAmerican Genius,\u201d about inventor rivalries such as Colt vs. Wesson and Tesla vs. Edison, included Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone and Science Guy Bill Nye. Their defiantly geeky Q&A veered into tangents on the state of America\u2019s education system and the vacuum tubes in Wozniak\u2019s customized wristwatch.\n\nOther Nat Geo programs slated for the spring include \u201cKilling Jesus,\u201d a three-hour movie based on the book by Bill O\u2019Reilly and Martin Dugard. It follows \u201cKilling Kennedy\u201d and \u201cKilling Lincoln,\u201d the two most-watched programs in the channel\u2019s history. Nat Geo says \u201cKilling Jesus\u201d is its most ambitious production yet.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Astrophysicist and \"Cosmos\" host Neil deGrasse Tyson will host a new series called \u201cStar Talk\u201d on the National Geographic Channel.", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson Makes Late-Night Move to Host \u2018Star Talk\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/07/neil-degrasse-tyson-makes-late-night-move-to-host-star-talk/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GI215_neil_G_20150107223436.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Neil deGrasse Tyson Makes Late-Night Move to Host \u2018Star Talk\u2019", "description": "Astrophysicist and \"Cosmos\" host Neil deGrasse Tyson will host a new series called \u201cStar Talk\u201d on the National Geographic Channel.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "John Jurgensen", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Astrophysicist and \"Cosmos\" host Neil deGrasse Tyson will host a new series called \u201cStar Talk\u201d on the National Geographic Channel.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-01-08T03:36:21-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/07/neil-degrasse-tyson-makes-late-night-move-to-host-star-talk/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-85878", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Astrophysicist and \"Cosmos\" host Neil deGrasse Tyson will host a new series called \u201cStar Talk\u201d on the National Geographic Channel.", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson Makes Late-Night Move to Host \u2018Star Talk\u2019", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/01/07/neil-degrasse-tyson-makes-late-night-move-to-host-star-talk/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GI215_neil_G_20150107223436.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-85878", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-06T18:18:25-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Neil deGrasse Tyson Getty ImagesThe universe of late-night television is expanding to include America\u2019s favorite astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson who will host a new series called \u201cStar Talk\u201d on the National Geographic Channel.\nThe show, premiering in April, is a spinoff of his popular \u201cStar Talk\u201d podcast.\nNat Geo says \u201cKilling Jesus\u201d is its most ambitious production yet.\nOther Nat Geo programs slated for the spring include \u201cKilling Jesus,\u201d a three-hour movie based on the book by Bill O\u2019Reilly and Martin Dugard.\nThe talk show will feature guest celebrities, comedians and other pop culture ambassadors, with Tyson serving as moderator and the voice of science."}
