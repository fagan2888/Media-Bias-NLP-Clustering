He stated that:\n\nI want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that we face in the world and the headlines we see every day, may seem improbable, but it\u2019s true. We are fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progressive era in human history.\n\nThe next day the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner ordered the insertion of 250 more troops into the no-win, US-created scenario in Syria. These are the troops that weren\u2019t supposed to be there, because the President had promised that there would be \u2018no boots on the ground\u2019, a promise he made in 2013 and again in 2014, and which the State Department tried to deny on Tuesday.\n\nThe President continued his remarks, saying we still need to be careful, and we REALLY need to watch out for the current \u2018bad-guy\u2019, Russia:\n\nNow, that doesn\u2019t mean that we can be complacent because today dangerous forces do threaten to pull the world backward, and our progress is not inevitable. These challenges threaten Europe and they threaten our transatlantic community. We\u2019re not immune from the forces of change around the world. As they have elsewhere, barbaric terrorists have slaughtered innocent people in Paris and Brussels, and Istanbul and San Bernardino, California. And we see these tragedies in places central to our daily lives \u2014 an airport or caf\u00e9, a workplace or a theater \u2014 and it unsettles us. It makes us unsure in our day-to-day lives \u2014 fearful not just for ourselves but those that we love. Conflicts from South Sudan to Syria to Afghanistan have sent millions fleeing, seeking the relative safety of Europe\u2019s shores, but that puts new strains on countries and local communities, and threatens to distort our politics. Russian aggression has flagrantly violated the sovereignty and territory of an independent European nation, Ukraine, and that unnerves our allies in Eastern Europe, threatening our vision of a Europe that is whole, free and at peace. And it seems to threaten the progress that\u2019s been made since the end of the Cold War.\n\nRussian is the cause of world instability, not remarks such as the following threatening to destroy North Korea:\n\nThe Community-Organizer-In-Chief finished up his remarks with a strong-arm sales pitch urging the continued development of a stronger European Union:", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "F6797679D7E81DB3F5C960F7552EF745", "og": {"site_name": "TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "description": "(TRUNEWS) President Barack Hussein Obama, also know by the name Barry Soetoro, spoke to a group of young Germans before departing back to the US on his European Tour. \u00a0He stated that: I want to begin with an observation that, given the challenges that we face in the world and the headlines we see every \u2026", "title": "Obama Says, \"Most Peaceful Era In Human History\"; Sends Troops - TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 628, "identifier": "http://www.trunews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/r-579.jpeg", "height": 429}, "updated_time": "2016-04-27T11:28:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.trunews.com/obama-says-most-peaceful-era-in-human-history-send-troops/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 107546629279454, "app_id": 107546629279454}, "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/trunews", "section": "Featured", "tag": "War", "published_time": "2016-04-27T11:14:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:28:40-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "We are fortunate to be living in the most peaceful, most prosperous, most progressive era in human history.\nThese challenges threaten Europe and they threaten our transatlantic community.\nAnd it seems to threaten the progress that\u2019s been made since the end of the Cold War.\nThe next day the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner ordered the insertion of 250 more troops into the no-win, US-created scenario in Syria.\nAs they have elsewhere, barbaric terrorists have slaughtered innocent people in Paris and Brussels, and Istanbul and San Bernardino, California."}
