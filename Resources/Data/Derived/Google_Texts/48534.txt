BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. -- - A new year but the same old headaches for many people trying to sign up for the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare as many call it.



On one of the first days people who signed up for Obamacare could walk into a doctor, many could not.



Several people in South Florida like Lovely Borgat, 24, of Boynton Beach are still getting the same error message despite trying to sign up multiple times.



"It's frustrating because I want to sign up, it's there for us and yet there is not help," said Borgat. "I know how to do it but their system, they're having problem with the system. I can't do it."



Each time she tried to sign up, she got the same message right at the end of the application. It tells her there is a problem with the site and to return in 24 hours. She has continued to do that since October and has had no success.



"I've memorized the whole application basically. I know exactly what they're going to ask me, so I just click, yes, yes or no, no. I know all the numbers and I could probably tell you the whole application," said Borgat.



Borgat now worries if she and her family will ever make it in to see a doctor. It has been years.



"It's still far from seamless," said John Foley, a Healtcare.gov navigator.



Foley said he is still hearing about problems daily.



He thinks it will be sorted out eventually, but said people who attempted to sign up before the December deadline will not be penalized.



"They need to get it fixed fast because time is running out," said Foley.



People who are experiencing problems should call 1-800-318-2596. They could also go to healthcare.gov and locate their local navigator.



Foley also said people should contact the insurance they have signed up with to ensure they are all on the same page.
