Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul plans a campaign stop in downtown Freeport next week.

According to Paul’s website, the campaign plans to hold “The Stand with Rand Rally” on Tuesday at Linda Bean’s Perfect Maine Kitchen and Topside Tavern at 88 Main St. The restaurant is in the heart of downtown Freeport, directly across Main Street from L.L. Bean’s flagship store.

Linda Bean and state Sen. Eric Brakey, R-Auburn, will host the event. Brakey said the rally will be held inside the restaurant beginning at 5:30 p.m. and is expected to last about 30 minutes.

He said Paul last visited Maine in 2014, when he was the guest speaker at the state Republican convention.

Paul’s campaign plans rallies in New Hampshire before visiting Freeport on Tuesday.

Elected to the U.S. Senate in 2010, Paul is an ophthalmologist who lives in Kentucky.
