Anitere Flores, R-Miami.\n\nSen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, noted that county health departments now see 200,000 fewer patients and provide 800,000 fewer individual services than they did when Armstrong became surgeon general in 2012.\n\n\u201cIs that because there is, in Florida, less need for preventive care, less need for primary care, less need for health education, less need for the services of our county health departments?\u201d Gaetz asked. \u201cIs that why we\u2019ve seen this extraordinary and precipitous decline in the number of patients served and in the number of services provided?\u201d\n\nArmstrong replied that \u201cchanging dynamics\u201d over the past three to five years have \u201ctransformed the nature of the relationship\u201d between the county health departments and their communities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these currents as a result of changes from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re also seeing these currents as a result of success with the state\u2019s Medicaid managed-care program.\u201d\n\nArmstrong added that he had asked local health administrators to advise him of service gaps and that it was the county health departments\u2019 responsibility to \u201cstep up to the plate\u201d where people were not being served.\n\nGaetz said counties such as Dixie, Escambia, Hardee, Okeechobee, Suwannee \u201cand many more (have seen) a 35- to 45- to 55-percent decrease in the amount of services that county health departments are providing, yet these are the counties that have high poverty, have high incidence of uninsured individuals \u2014 notwithstanding the Affordable Care Act, notwithstanding Medicaid managed care. What\u2019s happening to those people who used to come to the county health department?\u201d\n\nArmstrong said the change was due, in part, to the state\u2019s 51 federally qualified health centers, which are types of facilities that provide primary care in rural and urban areas.\n\n\u201cIn 43 of those areas, we see individuals who previously came to the county health department now using the federally qualified health center,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because of the changing dynamics in the health care environment, the gradient really does favor utilization of federally qualified health centers.\u201d\n\nHe also said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d by the numbers Gaetz cited.\n\nGaetz also questioned Armstrong about funding for clinics that serve low-income people. State funding for the state\u2019s 125 free and charitable clinics began with $4.5 million in 2014, which the clinics say allowed them to provide about $160 million worth of services. But last year, when lawmakers approved $9.5 million for the free clinics, Gov. Rick Scott vetoed the money.\n\n\u201c(The $9.5 million is) in the budget again this year,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cAs our state\u2019s chief health officer, are you prepared to advise the governor that it\u2019s a good idea to support free clinics that leverage local charitable resources in order to take up some of the slack that the county health departments are leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am prepared to advise the governor that free and charitable clinics provide important services of value in our communities and need to be supported,\u201d Armstrong said.\n\nFlores questioned Armstrong about how long it would take to provide data about the role of federal qualified health centers in the counties Gaetz mentioned, \u201cbecause I think that would help us clarify as to what correlation there is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin 24 hours,\u201d Armstrong replied.\n\nSen. Rene Garcia, R-Hialeah, said after the hearing that that while he\u2019d voted to confirm Armstrong, he wanted more data about how local health care is being provided, especially in rural counties.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re there to provide a service, you have to provide that service, and if you\u2019re the only entry point, then you cannot cut back on those services,\u201d Garcia said \u201cI think that\u2019s where Senator Gaetz was going. And for that reason, I think it\u2019s important that my vote was to ensure that more members get to vet him thoroughly at the next committee stop, and maybe get to the floor, and we\u2019ll have a through vetting of General Armstrong.\u201d\n\nArmstrong needs to receive Senate confirmation this year to stay in his job. The Senate could have confirmed him last year but did not. In addition to grappling with major issues at the department, Armstrong also has been treated in recent months for cancer.\n\nThe question of Armstrong\u2019s confirmation goes next to the Senate Ethics and Elections Committee.\n\nThe News Service of Florida\u2019s Margie Menzel contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a 5-4 vote, a Senate panel on Tuesday approved the confirmation of Surgeon General John Armstrong as secretary of the Florida Department of Health.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/02/16/senate-panel-narrowly-approves-armstrong-confirmation/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/florida-capitol-complex.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/florida-capitol-complex.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "In a 5-4 vote, a Senate panel on Tuesday approved the confirmation of Surgeon General John Armstrong as secretary of the Florida Department of Health.", "title": "Senate Panel Narrowly Approves Armstrong Confirmation"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsmiami.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/florida-capitol-complex.jpg?w=625", "description": "In a 5-4 vote, a Senate panel on Tuesday approved the confirmation of Surgeon General John Armstrong as secretary of the Florida Department of Health.", "site": "CBSmiami", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Senate Panel Narrowly Approves Armstrong Confirmation"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Miami's Best", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Miami", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbsmiami"}, "keywords": "florida news, local, news, politics, florida department of health, politics", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://miami.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0984ebcee75feff1a6ce7f3d00419048?s=16", "news_keywords": "florida department of health, politics"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn 43 of those areas, we see individuals who previously came to the county health department now using the federally qualified health center,\u201d he said.\nMembers of the Senate Health Policy Committee spent an hour peppering Armstrong with questions, nearly all dealing with Floridians\u2019 access to health care, before signing off on his nomination.\nIn the end, the three Democrats on the panel voted against confirming Armstrong and were joined by Sen.
