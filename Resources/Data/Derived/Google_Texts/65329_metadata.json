Steve Stockman is doing a great job drawing attention to himself. But he isn\u2019t doing conservatives any favors in his bid to unseat Sen. John Cornyn in the March primary.\n\nIf there\u2019s a debate to be had on whether Cornyn is conservative enough, Stockman isn\u2019t the guy to lead it. So far, his run for Senate rests largely on bogus allegations (\u201cCornyn loves Obamacare\u201d), ridiculous distortions (Cornyn supports \u201cObama\u2019s lifetime gun ban\u201d) and stunts (walking out of the State of the Union address).\n\nThe Republican Party needs a debate right now about its future. Cornyn\u2019s campaign for reelection is a great opportunity to have it. But Stockman is draining away the possibility that will happen in a serious way.\n\nToday, Todd Gillman reported that Ken Cope, one of the other seven people running to unseat Cornyn, called for Stockman to get out the race. Stockman\u2019s antics embarrassing and damaging to the Republican Party, he said.\n\nCope\u2019s right. The more the far right gives credence to the Stockmans of the world, the farther conservatives are going to find themselves from power.\n\nVoters are capable of deciding in March what they think of Stockman\u2019s ideas. And Stockman is certain to give them that chance. But when a candidate actually subtracts from the quality of the race, it\u2019s best if he\u2019d just go.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2RhbGxhc21vcm5pbmd2aWV3c2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNC8wMi9zdGV2ZS1zdG9ja21hbi1pc250LWhlbHBpbmctY29uc2VydmF0aXZlcy1vci1oaXMtcGFydHktaW4tcnVuLWFnYWluc3Qtam9obi1jb3JueW4uaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Rudolph Bush", "og": {"site_name": "Opinion Blog", "description": "Rep.
