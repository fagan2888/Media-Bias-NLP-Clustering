The takeaway: More kidnappings are \u201cdefinitely\u201d to come as a result of the deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to kidnap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people,\u201d the unnamed commander told TIME by telephone. \u201cIt has encouraged our people. Now everybody will work hard to capture such an important bird.\u201d\n\nRelated: Bergdahl Fallout Signals Obama\u2019s Risky Strategy\n\nAmidst great debate on whether or not the deal should have happened at all are lingering questions about whether Sgt. Bergdahl was a deserter. Although Bergdahl himself has yet to give his side of the story, questions remain unanswered about what exactly Bergdahl was doing off base the night he was captured by the Taliban.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, a classified military report on the night Bergdahl wandered off base in June 2009 says this wasn\u2019t the first time. In fact, the roughly 35-page report says that he\u2019d wandered off from both a training range in California and from his outpost in Afghanistan before returning back to his assigned area. The report concludes that Bergdahl likely did so on his own free will in the dark of night.\n\nPerhaps more important is what the report leaves out. There is no stated conclusion as to whether or not the then Private Bergdahl had any intention to officially desert.\n\nRelated: Susan Rice Is the Biggest Loser in Bergdahl Affair\n\nNonetheless, the price tag for bringing America\u2019s only living prisoner of war home to U.S. soil wasn\u2019t cheap. On May 31st, the United States released five top-level Taliban commanders from Guantanamo Bay, sending them to Qatar to live under a form of house arrest.\n\nSome believe the deal, executed by President Obama by executive order and which Obama makes \u201cno apologies\u201d for, sets a dangerous precedent. Not surprisingly, the loudest criticism has come from Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat does this tell terrorists?,\u201d Republican Senator Ted Cruz asked on ABC\u2019s This Week following Bergdahl\u2019s release. \u201cThat if you capture a U.S. soldier, you can trade that soldier for five terrorist prisoners?\u201d\n\nAfter hearing announcement of the deal on Saturday, Sen. John McCain criticized President Obama\u2019s decision, calling it a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nRelated: Did the U.S. Trade 5 Taliban Terrorists for an Army Deserter?\n\nOn Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers cited the deal as a clear \u201cbreak with U.S. policy.\u201d During an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d the Michigan Congressman said, \u201cThe No. 1 way that Al Qaeda raises money is by ransom \u2014 kidnapping and ransom. We have now set a price.\u201d\n\nThe two-and-a-half year back-and-fourth has resulted in the first prisoner exchange between the Taliban and the United States. And it marks an important\u2014and very public\u2014shift in White House policy. The deal was ultimately given the green light by the president who once vowed, \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "This morning, TIME Magazine featured a", "title": "Taliban Says Bergdahl Deal Means More Kidnappings", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/06/Taliban-Says-Bergdahl-Deal-Means-More-Kidnappings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06062014_Taliban.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/06/Taliban-Says-Bergdahl-Deal-Means-More-Kidnappings", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06062014_Taliban.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "This morning, TIME Magazine featured a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1fb9\"", "article_summary": "According to The New York Times, a classified military report on the night Bergdahl wandered off base in June 2009 says this wasn\u2019t the first time.\nThe takeaway: More kidnappings are \u201cdefinitely\u201d to come as a result of the deal.\nAlthough Bergdahl himself has yet to give his side of the story, questions remain unanswered about what exactly Bergdahl was doing off base the night he was captured by the Taliban.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to kidnap one person like Bergdahl than kidnapping hundreds of useless people,\u201d the unnamed commander told TIME by telephone.\nWe have now set a price.\u201dThe two-and-a-half year back-and-fourth has resulted in the first prisoner exchange between the Taliban and the United States."}
