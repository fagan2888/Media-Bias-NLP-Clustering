He pushed for nonviolent protest against segregation alongside Martin Luther King Jr.\n\n/ Download\n\nJAMES L. FARMER JR.\n\n(January 12, 1920\u2013July 9, 1999)\n\nCivil rights leader James Farmer was born in Marshall, Texas, in 1920. He spent his childhood in Austin but returned to Marshall to attend Wiley College, where he joined the team of \u201cgreat debaters\u201d coached by legendary teacher Melvin Tolson.\n\nThough Farmer had intended become a Methodist minister, Tolson\u2019s influence\u2014and segregation within the church\u2014led him to activism.\n\nIn 1942, Farmer organized the Congress of Racial Equality in Chicago. A decade before the civil rights movement made headlines, CORE followed Gandhian principles of nonviolent direct action, to fight racial discrimination in local businesses.\n\nIn 1961, CORE organized the Freedom Rides to desegregate bus travel. Farmer and twelve other activists, both black and white, faced violence and jail time as they rode from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans.\n\nThe Freedom Rides and the violence that erupted in response captured national attention. Blacks across the nation joined the civil rights struggle, as did whites in America and abroad. Within months, Attorney General Robert Kennedy issued an order banning segregation in interstate travel.\n\nFarmer later described the Freedom Rides as his \u201cproudest achievement.\u201d CORE had pioneered the tactics that eventually dismantled segregation in the South.\n\nFarmer retired from CORE in 1966 and turned to government service and teaching. In 1998, the year before his death, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor.\n\nFor More about James L. Farmer Jr.\n\nThe Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at The University of Texas at Austin holds the collected papers of Farmer and his wife Lula. These rich archival collections detail Farmer\u2019s activities in CORE from the 1940s to the 1960s, as well as documenting his time in government.\n\nFarmer\u2019s father, James Farmer Sr., was a prominent theologian who taught at institutions across the South. From 1925 to 1930, he taught at Samuel Huston College in Austin. Now Huston-Tillotson University, this historically African American institution sits at the center of the vibrant East Austin neighborhoods that Farmer called his childhood home. Indeed, a historical marker now adorns the house at 1604 New York Avenue where Farmer grew up. Farmer describes the place fondly in his 1985 autobiography Lay Bare the Heart.\n\nFarmer spent two periods of his life in the vicinity of Wiley College, one of the oldest historically African American colleges west of the Mississippi. Both times, he was drawn to Wiley because his father was a professor there. Today, a historical marker stands outside the Thomas Winston Cole Library commemorating James Farmer Sr. for his contributions to African American life and letters.\n\nSelected Bibliography\n\nArsenault, Raymond.
