Yet not only was Senator David Vitter (R-LA) allowed to propagate it on Your World two days ago, host Stuart Varney spouted the same falsehood in agreement.\n\nHere\u2019s what NewsHound Ellen wrote when Sean Hannity tried to make a $10,000 bet after Democratic Congressman Bill Pascrell debunked the lie (and, sadly, refused to take the bet):\n\nFrom an August 30, 2013 FactCheck.org article\u2026 called, No \u2018Special Subsidy\u2019 for Congress debunking a similar claim by Republican Congressman Robert Pittenger. (L)awmakers and their staffs face additional requirements that other Americans don\u2019t. And the \u201cspecial subsidy\u201d to which Pittenger refers is simply a premium contribution that his employer, the federal government, has long made to the health insurance policies of its workers. The Affordable Care Act says that starting in 2014, members of Congress and their staffs can no longer get their health insurance through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, as they have in the past. Instead, these federal employees will have to get insurance through the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act. Other Americans with work-based insurance aren\u2019t subject to such a requirement. They can continue to get health insurance through their employers. Other federal workers, too, can continue to select health insurance plans through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. But not Congress. \u2026Our readers may recall that before this provision was created, there were claims circulating that Congress was \u201cexempt\u201d from the law. This twisted reading of the legislation was based on the fact that originally Congress, like other Americans with work-based insurance or Americans on Medicare and Medicaid, wouldn\u2019t be eligible for the exchanges. In other words, Congress was supposedly \u201cexempt\u201d when members couldn\u2019t participate in the exchanges, and now that they are required to do so, they\u2019re still somehow \u201cexempt\u201d from the law. Neither of these convoluted claims is true.\n\nYet both Varney and Vitter expressed surprise that \u201chealth subsidies for lawmakers\u201d had not been part of the deal to raise the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown. And, of course, they used it to smear President Obama.\n\nVarney said, \u201cI am surprised at the intensity of the opposition to this. The President threatening a veto?\u201d\n\nVitter replied, \u201cIt really says a lot how dug in these Washington types are to protect their personal benefits, their personal subsidy, and for the President to personally talk about a veto threat specifically over this issue is sort of amazing.\u201d\n\nVarney even pretended \u2013 or ignorantly asserted \u2013 that Congress is somehow exempt from Obamacare. He said to Vitter, \u201cBut it is strange sir. I mean you would\u2019ve thought that by having everybody included in Obamacare, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re right there with the people of America.\u2019 Wouldn\u2019t that have been really good publicity? Good PR, and they totally rejected it, I\u2019m surprised.\u201d\n\nVitter \u2013 who, as a member of Congress, ought to know better - piled on. He said, \u201cThe message they\u2019re sending instead is sort of like the restaurant where the chef never eats there and won\u2019t eat there.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you explain why they\u2019re fighting so hard against this?\u201d Varney asked.\n\nVitter answered, \u201cBecause it\u2019s a big subsidy, and it\u2019s money in the pockets of Congress, staff, and administration officials, and they don\u2019t want to give it up. Look, it should be the first rule of American democracy that Washington lives by the same rule as America, operates in the same way, and that\u2019s what my language would ensure.\u201d\n\nVitter vowed, \u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting for a vote\u2026 And I\u2019m going to get a vote.\u201d\n\nEven if Varney didn\u2019t know about the Congressional requirements before he did the segment, he should have done some independent research rather than relying on a partisan Senator as the only source of information for the discussion. It\u2019s a habitual technique of Fox News that allows Republican spin to stand unchallenged and accepted as truth. And in this case, with a big assist from the host.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "jEs0tpirXVSjfnwsopbALI3DDr9pFBx8RsENEwcV2sA=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/varney_and_vitter_lie_about_obamacare_special_subsidies_for_congress_10182013", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Varney And Vitter Lie About Obamacare \u2018Special Subsidies\u2019 For Congress"}, "Title": "Varney And Vitter Lie About Obamacare \u2018Special Subsidies\u2019 For Congress"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe128d\"", "article_summary": "Other federal workers, too, can continue to select health insurance plans through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\nFox News seems either not to know or not to care that Republican charges that Congress receives \u201cspecial subsidies\u201d for Obamacare (that regular folks don\u2019t) is a lie.\nThey can continue to get health insurance through their employers.\n\u2026Our readers may recall that before this provision was created, there were claims circulating that Congress was \u201cexempt\u201d from the law.\nYet both Varney and Vitter expressed surprise that \u201chealth subsidies for lawmakers\u201d had not been part of the deal to raise the debt ceiling and end the government shutdown."}
