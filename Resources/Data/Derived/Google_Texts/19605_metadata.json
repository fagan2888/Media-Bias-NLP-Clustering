CRYP is requesting donations of new and gently used formal wear in sizes from 2 and up with an emphasis on sizes 18-24. Also needed are accessories, shoes, make-up, gift card and cash donations to assist our local teen girls in getting ready for their proms and spring formals. Organizers for the event say they are expecting to serve between 150-200 girls this year.\n\nPassion for Fashion is more than just playing dress-up, says Julie Garreau, CRYP executive director. It's also about providing support in a positive environment for a community where unemployment and under-employment hovers at around 80 percent. The event is a family affair that promotes self-esteem and encourages girls to make new friends and have fun while getting ready for prom. Along with their mothers, grandmothers, sisters, aunties and cousins, the girls are surrounded by generations of women to assist them in their journey.\n\n\u201cIt is a special time for these girls where they want to look and feel beautiful for their high school prom, which is one of the most important events in their young lives,\u201d says Garreau. \u201cOur mission is to help each young lady be her absolute best with the love and support of their families and community behind them all the way. Every girl deserves to walk into her prom feeling empowered and beautiful.\u201d\n\nThis year's theme is 25 Years of Fashion, which is a nod to CRYP's recent 25th anniversary celebration. Festivities will begin with a luncheon and keynote presentation, followed by a trip to the Cokata Wiconi gym where they can shop for dresses, shoes and accessories with their mothers. Additionally, the girls will be treated to makeovers, hair-styling, manicures, pedicures and facials. Dresses are being accepted until March 5, but CRYP will continue to take dresses after the event since some girls can't come in until after the event because they are unable to participate for one reason or another.\n\nAfterward, the girls will model their new looks at the CRYP runway fashion show. The evening will conclude with a special Passion for Fashion cake and fun activities such as karaoke. Each young lady will go home with a dress, accessories, new jewelry to compliment their dress and a gift bath set from CRYP. Participants may also include their names in drawings for prizes.\n\nView CRYP's Passion for Fashion video from 2013 here:\n\nVideo of Cheyenne River Youth Project Passion for Fashion 2013\n\nPlease send dress, accessories, shoes and gift card donations to: P.O.
