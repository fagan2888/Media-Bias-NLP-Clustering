But the IRS only received roughly 5,100 forms, and reaped just $913.4 million.\n\nRepublicans were quick to seize on the report as proof that the medical device tax, a key revenue-raiser included in the healthcare reform law that has bipartisan opposition, is flawed and should be scrapped.\n\n\u201cEverything from this ill-conceived tax\u2019s structure to its implementation has been a disaster,\u201d said Sen.

Of those 5,100 forms, the watchdog found 276 errors, resulting in a discrepancy of $117.8 million.\n\nTIGTA found cases where the tax was both overpaid and underpaid.\n\nWhile electronic returns automatically check to ensure that the tax paid is appropriate for the amount of medical device sales reported by a company, the IRS does not have a similar system in place for paper returns, where the problems were found.\n\nAs a result, things like missing or misplaced decimal points, either put there by the taxpayer or the agent processing the return, could lead to tax payments that miss the mark.\n\nTIGTA recommended the IRS hone its compliance tools to more accurately process medical device tax returns, and revisit those forms where errors were found. The IRS agreed with the recommendations.\n\nThis article updated at 4:24pm.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A tax imposed on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act is raising roughly three-quarters of the revenue originally expected, according to a new government report.", "description": "A tax imposed on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act is raising roughly three-quarters of the revenue originally expected, according to a new government report.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Schroeder", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A tax imposed on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act is raising roughly three-quarters of the revenue originally expected, according to a new government report.", "title": "Report: Medical device tax missing revenue mark", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215522-report-medical-device-tax-missing-revenue-mark", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215522-report-medical-device-tax-missing-revenue-mark", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-19T15:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Peter Schroeder", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-19T15:06:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "keywords": "Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Internal Revenue Service, Affordable Care Act, Orrin Hatch,Orrin Hatch, Harry Reid,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/215522-report-medical-device-tax-missing-revenue-mark", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A tax imposed on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act is raising roughly three-quarters of the revenue originally expected, according to a new government report.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Medical device tax missing revenue mark"}, "dcterms.title": "Report: Medical device tax missing revenue mark"}, "article_summary": "The watchdog for the Internal Revenue Service reported Tuesday that the tax collection agency was still facing problems implementing the medical device tax included in the 2010 healthcare reform law.\nRepublicans were quick to seize on the report as proof that the medical device tax, a key revenue-raiser included in the healthcare reform law that has bipartisan opposition, is flawed and should be scrapped.\nTIGTA recommended the IRS hone its compliance tools to more accurately process medical device tax returns, and revisit those forms where errors were found.\nA tax imposed on medical devices included in the Affordable Care Act is raising roughly three-quarters of the revenue originally expected, according to a new government report.\nIRS agents were still having a hard time determining exactly which medical device manufacturers were subject to the tax; both the returns filed and revenue raised have come in well short of expectations."}
