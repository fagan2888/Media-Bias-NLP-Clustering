Thomas Rosica, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) Christmas was a moveable feast for me this year - in fact it happened right smack in the middle of Lent, when the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church elected a man from Argentina to be the next Pope.\n\nI have been asking myself a ton of questions over the past months.\n\nWhat has happened in the church, and how can it be that a 77-year-old, retirement-bound archbishop from Buenos Aires has captivated the world?\n\nHow can we describe the sense of springtime that has come upon the church? How is it fathomable in our day and age that not only Christians and Catholics but millions of others are speaking about \u201cPapa Francesco\u201d as if he were their own?\n\nIs this all the work of a PR company or clever media strategists hired by the Vatican to rebrand its image? Or is there something else at work? Let me tell you what I think is afoot.\n\nJorge Mario Bergoglio took the name Francis upon his election as Pope and told us he did so because of his love for Francis of Assisi. For the past nine months, many of us have been associating the Pope\u2019s gestures and actions with the \u201cPoverello\u201d or \u201cLittle Poor One\u201d of Assisi, perhaps the most beloved saint of the Catholic tradition.\n\nWe can easily envision Francis of Assisi in that idyllic, medieval Umbrian hilltop town and mythologize about what really happened back in his day. But too often Francis\u2019 radical message is lost and we reduce him to a gentle, whimsical hippie who fed birds, smelled flowers and tamed wild wolves. We easily forget that in reality, Assisi\u2019s favorite son was and is the model of a radical Christian.\n\nOne day as a young man, Francis heard the plea of Jesus from the crucifix in the dilapidated San Damiano chapel on Assisi\u2019s outskirts. \u201cGo and repair my Church,\u201d he heard Jesus say. And he certainly did that in his lifetime and through the huge Franciscan family that he left behind to carry forward his dream and continue his work.\n\nMany of us have spent the past months finding similarities between Francis of Assisi and Francis of Buenos Aires, who took up residence in a guest house in Vatican City rather than the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace.\n\nWe become easily fixated on lots of eye-catching, buzz-causing externals and great photo opportunities: A Pope who abandoned the red shoes - that were never an official part of the papal wardrobe! A Pope who dresses modestly, pays his own lodging bills, drives around Vatican City in a Ford Focus, calls many people on the phone, brings jam sandwiches to on-duty Swiss Guards at his door and invites street people to his birthday breakfast.\n\nThis Roman pontiff specializes in kissing babies and embracing the sick, disfigured broken bodies, and the abandoned of society. We sit back, smile and utter: \u201cWhat simplicity!\u201d \u201cWow!\u201d Awesome!\u201d \u201cFinalmente!\u201d\n\nWe say: \u201cHere is a one world leader who speaks the truth to power, walks his talk, and names idolatry and greed for what they are. Here\u2019s a bold and courageous shepherd who lifts up the poor and tells us that if they are not part of our lives, then we are a sad and even doomed lot. Just like Francis of Assisi did in his day!\u201d\n\nBut that is not the whole story.\n\nI have realized more and more over the past months that while I have always loved Francis of Assisi and all the romantic ideals he embraced and stood for, Francis of Buenos Aires doesn\u2019t transport me back to medieval Assisi. He takes me back to Bethlehem, Galilee and Jerusalem.\n\nEverything the Pope is doing now is not just an imitation of his patron saint who loved the poor, embraced lepers, charmed sultans, made peace and protected nature. It\u2019s a reflection of the child of Bethlehem who would grow up to become the man of the cross in Jerusalem, the Risen One that no tomb could contain, the man we Christians call Savior and Lord. The one whose birth we celebrate on December 25.\n\nMore than anyone in my lifetime, Pope Francis has given me a powerful glimpse into the mind and heart of God.\n\nHe wants the church to be an instrument of reconciliation and welcome, a church capable of warming hearts, a church that is not bent over on herself but always seeking those on the periphery and those who are lost, a church capable of leading people home.\n\nFrancis knows only too well that at times we lose people because they don't understand what we are saying, because we have forgotten the language of simplicity.\n\nOn the late afternoon of March 13, 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio received the call to go, rebuild, repair, renew and heal the church.\n\nWhat we have witnessed over the past nine months is simply a disciple of Jesus, and a faithful disciple of Ignatius of Loyola (the founder of the Jesuits) and of Francis of Assisi, repairing, renewing, restoring, reconciling and healing the Church.\n\nThere are those who delight in describing the new Pope as a bold, brazen revolutionary sent to rock the boat. Others think he has come to cause a massive shipwreck.\n\nBut the only revolution that Pope Francis has inaugurated is a revolution of tenderness, the very words he used in his recent major letter on \"The Joy of the Gospel.\"\n\n\u201cTrue faith in the incarnate Son of God is inseparable from self-giving, from membership in the community, from service, from reconciliation with others. The Son of God, by becoming flesh, summoned us to the revolution of tenderness.\u201d\n\nIt is this revolution that is at the heart of Pope Francis\u2019 ministry.\n\nLast week during a banquet in Chicago, Cardinal Francis George revealed why the cardinals gathered in conclave last March elected Bergoglio pope. George said: \u201cBecause the cardinal from Argentina was completely free. He possessed an interior freedom that was so evident.\u201d\n\nIs it not this unflinching freedom that allows Pope Francis to do what he does because he is unafraid and totally free to be himself at the same time of being such faithful son of the Church?\n\nIn our war-torn world, where selfishness, sadness, meanness, vengeance and harshness seem to have the upper hand at times, we need the message of Christmas: goodness, joy, kindness, mercy and the tenderness of our God.\n\nThese are also the qualities of the current revolutionary Bishop of Rome. No wonder why he has taken the world by storm, and why so many people are paying attention to him. We need the Francis revolution of tenderness and mercy now more than ever before.\n\nThe Rev.
