Under Kean\u2019s system, professors and administrators in tenure-track positions are usually granted tenure after a five-year probation period.\n\nIn November, after campus protests surrounding the move, Farahi released a two-page statement defending his tenure recommendations.\n\n\"A lifetime job in the state university system is not an entitlement, it has to be earned,\" Farahi said. \"That is our responsibility to our students and to the taxpayers of New Jersey.\"\n\nYesterday students and faculty alike berated Farahi and defended the professors now facing likely termination.\n\n\"This is not the world-class education we advertise; this is an academic crime,\" said Richard Katz, a professor in the English department at Kean, who noted his department has well over 100 adjunct instructors, but just 17 tenured professors. \"Our students deserve more, not less, for their ever-increasing tuition and fees.\"\n\nOthers expressed their befuddlement that the university, which has been plagued by scandals in recent years, would further diminish an already small pool of tenured faculty members.\n\n\"This kind of mass firing \u2014 and that\u2019s what this is, a mass firing \u2014 can in no way be good for the institution,\" said Tim Haresign, of the Council of New Jersey State College Locals.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\u2022 Kean University professors plan last stand in tenure fight\n\n\u2022 Tensions rise at Kean U. as officials recommend denying tenure to 2/3 of eligible professors", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','kean-university','ocean-county','toms-river'", "title": "Kean trustees unanimously deny tenure to six professors", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Kean trustees unanimously deny tenure to six professors \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/kean_board_of_trustees_denies_tenure_to_six_professors.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/kean-tenure-protestjpg-c0870c2af0e3f492.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11787142\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-07T22:49:54Z\", \"author\": \"Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"kean-university\",\"ocean-county\",\"toms-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/13903685-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@sstirling", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The decision came with no explanation, after a day of impassioned protest."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, December 07, 2013,  6:51 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/12/kean-tenure-protestjpg-c0870c2af0e3f492.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"sstirling\", \"author_nickname\": \"Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"8027114\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The decision came with no explanation, after a day of impassioned protest.", "title": "Kean trustees unanimously deny tenure to six professors", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/12/kean_board_of_trustees_denies_tenure_to_six_professors.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, December 07, 2013,  5:49 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "The decision came with no explanation, after a day of impassioned protest."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfea\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Kean University professors plan last stand in tenure fight\u2022 Tensions rise at Kean U. as officials recommend denying tenure to 2/3 of eligible professors\nTOMS RIVER \u2014 After a day of emotional protests, the Kean University Board of Trustees voted unanimously to uphold the denial of tenure \u2014 and effective layoff \u2014 of six university professors at a meeting in Toms River.\nUnder Kean\u2019s system, professors and administrators in tenure-track positions are usually granted tenure after a five-year probation period.\nYesterday students and faculty alike berated Farahi and defended the professors now facing likely termination.\nJames Castiglione, President of the Kean Federation of Teachers, said the decision would compromise the university\u2019s academic standards."}
