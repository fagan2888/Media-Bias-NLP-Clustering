They were held in brutal conditions, which only worsened for Lindhout following a failed escape attempt.\n\nLindhout told a crowd at the Skidompha Library on Thursday that she found compassion and forgiveness for the men who tortured, starved and raped her during the darkest days of her captivity. Months after her release in 2009, she founded a nonprofit organization to support education, community and food relief in Somalia.\n\nDuring her teenage years in western Canada, Lindhout escaped into the pages of National Geographic. Shortly after she graduated, she moved to Calgary hoping to travel. Several years later, armed with a camera, the young woman was reporting from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2006, she and Brennan headed to Mogadishu, intending to visit a camp for internally displaced people.\n\n\u201cI felt, for the first time in my life, that what I was doing mattered,\u201d Lindhout said Thursday.\n\nSara Corbett of Portland, who co-authored \u201cA House in the Sky,\u201d recalled watching a YouTube video of Lindhout prior to her abduction, showing \u201cthis young, exuberant, utterly free young woman riding on top of trucks in northern Pakistan and wading through crowds of children in the slums of Delhi.\u201d\n\nOn their third day in Somalia, Lindhout and Brennan left a Mogadishu hotel with security guards to travel to the camp. Just outside the city, a dozen men armed with AK-47s blocked the road and pulled them out of the vehicle at gunpoint.\n\nThe kidnappers took them to an abandoned concrete building and called their parents, demanding a total of $3 million in ransom.\n\nTwo months into captivity, after they had been separated into two rooms and could only communicate by furtive whispers, Lindhout and Brennan plotted their escape through a tiny window high on a bathroom wall.\n\nBut they were spotted the day they jumped through the window to the ground below. Armed, angry men chased them into a mosque.\n\nAlong with her terror, what Lindhout remembers is a single Muslim woman wearing a black hijab, \u201cpulling me into her arms and, [in] English, calling me her sister,\u201d Lindhout said Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe began pleading with them to let me go. They pulled her by her ankles to the door, but this woman \u2014 she didn\u2019t give up. She literally threw her body on top of mine and held me as long as she could.\u201d\n\nAs Lindhout was dragged away \u2014 only to be chained in a dark room where she endured even crueler abuse \u2014 she glimpsed the woman holding out her arms, with tears on her face, still hoping to help.\n\n\u201cTo this day, I don\u2019t know what happened to her,\u201d Lindhout said. \u201cBut the next 10\u00bd months, for all the punishment I would have to endure, I thought of her \u2014 her courage gave me courage.\u201d\n\nThroughout the remainder of her captivity, Lindhout endured repeated sexual abuse. It was, she said, \u201cthe darkest time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality of my experience was very violent,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was difficult to get through a day, and I didn\u2019t know when, or if, it would end. It was almost constant abuse.\u201d\n\nDuring the very darkest time, Lindhout had what she calls a \u201cmoment of awakening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbdujllah was abusing me, he was hurting me, and I was protecting myself and had an almost out-of-body experience,\u201d she said. \u201cI found myself looking down on myself on the floor.\u201d\n\nLindhout said she thought about the violence her attacker had endured \u2014 discovering a piece of his aunt\u2019s leg following an explosion and one day hiding behind a truck, hungry and orphaned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear my captors were products of war and certainly had been shaped by that. Having that understanding helped me. They\u2019re human beings with painful stories of their own. It doesn\u2019t make them innocent by any means, but they\u2019re products of a culture of violence.\u201d\n\nIn November 2009, the two families managed to pay ransom, and the two journalists were finally freed. The sky she focused on during her first few months of captivity was wide open above her, and she sensed opportunity.\n\nFour and a half months later, Lindhout established the Global Enrichment Foundation, which provides higher education opportunities to women in Somalia.\n\nOne day, Lindhout opened Facebook only to see a message written by one of her captors. He praised her for her work in Somalia.\n\n\u201cThe fact that they know about the work I\u2019m doing now \u2026 that I have chosen compassion, that they could see that they didn\u2019t break me \u2014 that\u2019s the best justice I could have.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DAMARISCOTTA, Maine \u2014 Amanda Lindhout said she survived more than a year of captivity in Somalia by remembering the many countries she visited as a freelance journalist and imagining what life might hold if she were ever set free. \u201cThe \u2018House in the Sky\u2019 for me was my memory and [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "DAMARISCOTTA, Maine \u2014 Amanda Lindhout said she survived more than a year of captivity in Somalia by remembering the many countries she visited as a freelance journalist and imagining what life might hold if she were ever set free. \u201cThe \u2018House in the Sky\u2019 for me was my memory and [...]", "title": "Survivor of kidnapping in Somalia tells of compassion, forgiveness in bestselling book", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2014/06/29/news/midcoast/survivor-of-kidnapping-in-somalia-tells-of-compassion-forgiveness-in-bestselling-book/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BX097_65EB_9-600x663.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "DAMARISCOTTA, Maine \u2014 Amanda Lindhout said she survived more than a year of captivity in Somalia by remembering the many countries she visited as a freelance journalist and imagining what life might hold if she were ever set free. \u201cThe \u2018House in the Sky\u2019 for me was my memory and [...]", "title": "Survivor of kidnapping in Somalia tells of compassion, forgiveness in bestselling book", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2014/06/29/news/midcoast/survivor-of-kidnapping-in-somalia-tells-of-compassion-forgiveness-in-bestselling-book/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BX097_65EB_9-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "keywords": "Maine, news, elections, election results, politics, sports, Bangor, Portland, Augusta, weather, obituaries, Waterville, Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Hancock, Washington, bdn,global enrichment foundation,living,midcoast,news,regions,survivor of kidnapping in somalia tells of compassion, forgiveness in bestselling book,is_article,beth brogan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd276\"", "article_summary": "One day, Lindhout opened Facebook only to see a message written by one of her captors.\nSeveral years later, armed with a camera, the young woman was reporting from Iraq and Afghanistan.\nFour and a half months later, Lindhout established the Global Enrichment Foundation, which provides higher education opportunities to women in Somalia.\nMonths after her release in 2009, she founded a nonprofit organization to support education, community and food relief in Somalia.\n\u201cThe \u2018House in the Sky\u2019 for me was my memory and my imagination,\u201d she said, referring to the title of her bestselling book."}
