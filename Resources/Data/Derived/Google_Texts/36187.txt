NOW, CONVERSATION WITH THE CANDIDATE CONTINUES. WELCOME BACK, TONIGHT'S STOP -- GUEST, DONALD TRUMP. FOR RIGHT NOW, LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT WITH OUR FIRST QUESTION COMING FROM JIM ADAMS. MR. TRUMP, YOUR BUSINESS EXPERIENCE AND SUCCESS ARE WELL-KNOWN. HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT AND MOVE TO A PLACE WHERE WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF AND GET THOSE FOLKS TO WORK WITH YOU? DONALD TRUMP: IT IS REALLY ABOUT LEADERSHIP AND YOU HAVE TO GET PEOPLE IN A ROOM AND LEARN TO LEAD. OBAMA CANNOT GET ISRAEL, CANNOT GET INVOLVED WITH NET AND YAHOO! WERE ANYBODY, CANNOT GET ALONG WITH REPUBLICANS AND FRANKLY THE DEMOCRAT'S SO HE STARTS ON EXECUTIVE ORDERS, I CANNOT DO IT, I CANNOT GET ALONG WITH EVERYBODY. ULTIMATELY, TO DO THE RIGHT THING, IT WILL BE TOTALLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. IT IS RIDICULOUS WHAT HE HAS DONE. BUT HE DOES NOT LEAD. I DO NOT THINK HE WORKS VERY HARD, FRANK LAY. I DO NOT THINK HE IS WITH PEOPLE AND I DO NOT THINK HE WORKS HARD. PEOPLE IN THE SENATE, THEY NEVER HEAR FROM HIM. EVEN HIS OWN PARTY. YOU HAVE TO LEAD AND WORK HARD. ONE LITTLE THING THAT TAKES PLACE ON THURSDAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE, NOT THAT SIGNIFICANT BUT SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT REPRESENTS. PRESIDENT OBAMA GOES TO CALIFORNIA ON AIR FORCE ONE, A MASSIVE BOEING PLANE. HIS WIFE GOES THE SAME DAY AND HOUR LATER, IN HOUR EARLIER, RIGHT AT ALMOST THE SAME TIME. THE BOAT GOING TO BURBANK. THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO THE SAME STUDIO AND THEY GO IN SEPARATE PLANES. THEN THEY SAID, THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS SCHEDULED. I GUARANTEE YOU THAT ELLEN DEGENERES, NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, ELLEN DEGENERES AND JIMMY KIMMEL WOULD HAVE COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND WOULD HAVE SAVED IT, OR THEY AT LEAST COULD HAVE TAKEN ONE PLANE, BUT THEY TAKE TWO MASSIVE BOEING PLANES TO DUTY DOES INTERVIEWS AND IT IS THE SAME LOCATION, THE SAME CITY. THAT IS THE WAY THE COUNTRY RUNS, WHETHER THAT OR A 5 BILLION DOLLAR WEBSITE FOR OBAMACARE THAT NEVER WORKED PROPERLY AND STILL DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU COULD DO. ONE OTHER THING THE OTHER DAY, LAST WEEK, THEY CAME OUT WITH $125 BILLION IN WAYS THAT I CAN FIND -- THAT THEY CAN FIND. SOMEONE LIKE ME WOULD DO A GREAT JOB, BELIEVE ME. I'M AN OUTSIDER. REPUBLICANS AND INSIDERS,, THEY DO NOT LIKE THIS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO WITH POLITICIANS BIT I MADE A LOT OF MONEY WITH POLITICIANS. POLITICIANS ARE REALLY EASY FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME. THEY ARE REALLY EASY. LOOK, THEY ARE ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. THEY'RE ALL ABOUT SELF-PRESERVATION. THEY PRESERVE THEIR OWN JOB, BUT THEY DO NOT HELP US. IT IS ABOUT TIME WE HAVE AN OUTSIDER GOING IN. I TELL YOU WHAT, I COULD DO ONE HELL OF A JOB IF I DECIDE TO RUN P YOU WOULD BE REALLY HAPPY. CLIFF LET'S GO TO ANOTHER ONE FROM THE AUDIENCE. JEFF. I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF MY OWN HOUSEHOLD AND KEEP US OUT OF DEBT. WHY DOESN'T GOVERNMENT HAVE THE SAME IDEA? WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO GETTING US CLOSER OUT OF DEBT IN THE U.S. DONALD TRUMP: OUR MONEY IS BEING DRAINED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES DID EVERY DEAL WE MAKE IS A BAD DEAL. THESE ARE MASSIVE DEALS. YOUR DEALS ARE TOUGHER. IN A RAKE -- IN A WAY, YOUR SITUATION IS TOUGHER. IF YOU HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS PRESIDENT WHO KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING, THAT IS EASIER THAN STRAIGHTENING OUT YOUR SITUATION. I WOULD STRAIN OUT THE BIG SITUATION AND YOUR SITUATION WOULD FOLLOW. IT IS LIKE, IN A COUNTRY IN TROUBLE, IT IS HARD FOR THE PEOPLE TO DO WELL. WHEN THE COUNTRY IS SOLVED AND THE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED. CHINA IS DRAINING US AND JAPAN NOW WILL START AGAIN BIG-TIME DRAINING US. THEY JUST START CUTTING THEIR CURRENCY LIKE CRAZY AND THEY ARE SELLING THINGS LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER SOLD BEFORE. JAPAN WILL BE BIG TIME GOING AFTER US. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THIS, BUT MESKO IS A DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES AND I'M NOT ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE BORDERS. WE HAVE TO BUILD A WALL LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THE ILLEGALS OUT AND THAT IS AT. DO NOT EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. THE ON THAT, THEY ARE TAKING OUR JOBS. WE DO NOT NEGOTIATE WELL WITH ANYONE. IF WE DID, THIS COUNTRY WOULD MAKE A FORTUNE, SOCIAL SECURITY COULD STAY THE SAME, YOU COULD KEEP YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY WITHOUT CUTS COME MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND ALL OF THAT. NO POLITICIAN WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE COMPETENCE. ALL TALK AND NO ACTION TO IT I HAVE PLAYED WITH POLITICIANS ALL MY LIFE AND I'VE DONE VERY WELL WITH POLITICIANS. IT IS ABOUT TIME WE HAD AN OUTSIDER. ERROR --., TIME TO ASK A QUESTION. YOU'RE UP. SMALL BUSINESS ARE THE ENGINE FOR THE ECONOMY, BUT THEY CAN AFFORD -- CANNOT AFFORD TO FUND ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND HIRE LOBBYISTS WHO MAINTAIN POLITICAL INFLUENCE. HOW WOULD YOU PREVENT CORPORATE CRONYISM FROM CORRUPTING OUR GOVERNMENT? DONALD TRUMP: YOU ARE 100% RIGHT. IT IS NOT ONLY CORPORATE. A LOT OF PEOPLE REPRESENT YOU ARE NOT REALLY, BECAUSE THE LOBBYISTS HAVE THEM TOTALLY UNDER CONTROL. I ALWAYS WONDERED HOW OPEC FOR SO MANY YEARS GOT AWAY WITH MURDER AND THEY GOT EVERY LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON ON THEIR PAYROLL AND THE SENATORS WERE AFRAID TO GO TO GETS THEM BECAUSE THE LOBBYISTS GAVE BIG CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SENATORS, TO THE CONDOS MIN, TO EVERYBODY. YOU COULD NOT EVEN GET SOMEBODY WHO WAS NOT REALLY REPRESENTING OPEC. IF YOU LOOK FOR SOMEONE TO GO AGAINST OPEC, YOU CANNOT FIND ANYBODY. IT IS A REAL PROBLEM. ONE OF THE THINGS WITH SOMEBODY LIKE ME, I DO NOT NEED MONEY. I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE A DEAL BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO GIVE ME $5,000 TO RUN FOR OFFICE. I WILL BE BEHOLDEN TO THAT PERSON, WHICH POLITICIANS ARE. WE HAVE GOT TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE COUNTRY. YOU ARE RIGHT THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS P SMALL BUSINESS IS SO IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THE SMALL BUSINESSMAN IS BEING CRUSHED AND IT IS BEING CRUSHED BY BAD TRADE PACTS WE ARE MAKING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. YOU KNOW WE ARE LOSING SO MUCH, UP TO NEW HAMPSHIRE THEY'RE LOSING, YOU GO TO TENNESSEE AND YOU SEE WHAT JUST HAPPENED WITH MEXICO WHERE COMPANIES ARE YOU MOVING TO MEXICO FROM TENNESSEE. YOU GO TO IOWA AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN IOWA. COMPANIES ARE MOVING OUT OF IOWA AND OUT OF THE COUNTRY. WE ACTUALLY GIVE TAX INCENTIVES FOR THESE COUNTRIES. HARD TO BELIEVE IT. IF THE RIGHT PERSON IS IN OFFICE, SMALL BUSINESS, AND THERE'S NOTHING CLOSER TO MY HEART AND SMALL BUSINESS P RETIRE REALLY STARTED WITH SMALL BUSINESS AND BUILD A GREAT COMPANY. MY COMPANY IS A GREAT COMPANY. SOMEBODY SAID, HOW BIG IS IT? LAST TIME, I WAS THINKING ABOUT RUNNING AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH MITT ROMNEY BECAUSE IN THE END, HE FAILED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, HE CHOKED OR SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THEM. HE DID NOT GET THERE. HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BEAT OBAMA BUT IN THAT LAST MONTH, HE DISAPPEARED. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON AND FOR THE MIDDLE-CLASS GENERALLY BECAUSE THE MIDDLE-CLASS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BEING ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED. KIND OF A FOLLOW-UP ON ERIC'S QUESTION. SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO RUN, HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED IF OR HOW MUCH MONEY OF YOUR OWN YOU WOULD SPEND ON A CAMPAIGN? DONALD TRUMP: PROBABLY MOSTLY MY MONEY. I GOT A CHECK FROM A WOMAN THE OTHER DAY, $10, AND SHE SAID, I AM 79 YEARS OLD AND I LOVE OUR COUNTRY. I'M DESPERATE THAT THE COUNTRY GETS GREAT AGAIN AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL DO IT. THIS IS ALL I CAN AFFORD. $10. I SAVED IT. A BEAUTIFUL CHECK FROM A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. WHO LOVES THE COUNTRY. SHE SAID, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL DO IT. I WATCHED THESE PEOPLE ALL MY LIFE AND YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL DO IT. LAST THING WE NEED IS ANOTHER BUSH. WE HAVE HAD BUSHES AND CLINTON'S. THE LAST THING YOU NEED IN THIS COUNTRY IS ANOTHER BUSH PAIRED IT WILL BE THE SAME OLD DEAL. YOU DO NOT NEED IT AND I DO NOT NEED IT. IT WILL PROBABLY HURT ME TO SAY IT BECAUSE IF SOMEONE GETS IN, THEY WILL NOT LOVE YOU, WHO CARES? I DO NOT CARE. I WANT THE COUNTRY TO BE GREAT AGAIN. IT WILL NOT BE GREAT IF WE HAVE JEB BUSH WITH HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY, DO REMEMBER THE STATEMENT OF LOVE? THEY COME IN FOR LOVE? WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT? I DO NOT EVEN THINK HE KNOWS. THEN YOU LOOK AT EDUCATION. HE WANTS EDUCATION TO BE RUN BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, THE COMMON CORE. EDUCATION SHOULD BE A LOCAL STANDARD. IT SHOULD BE LOCAL. THE PARENTS, THE TEACHERS, THEY SHOULD BE SETTING IT WITHIN A MUCH BETTER THAN SOMEBODY SITTING IN WASHINGTON PITCHING -- PICKING UP A PAYCHECK AND NOT KNOWING WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. JEB IS IN FAVOR OF COMMON CORE AND WEAK ON IMMIGRATION, TOTALLY WEAK ON IMMIGRATION. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT. LET'S GET A SOCIAL MEDIA QUESTION ON FACEBOOK ON A SOCIAL MEET -- ON A SOCIAL ISSUE P OR TOM WRITES, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE? DONALD TRUMP: I HAVE SET I'M A TRADITIONAL PERSON AND FOR TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. AS A REPUBLICAN, I'M GETTING THAT QUESTION MORE AND MORE NIMH REMIT -- TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE PERSON, BUT IT IS A QUESTION THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE BEING ASKED MORE AND MORE. AN INTERESTING QUESTION. LET'S GO TO OUR NEXT QUESTION COMING FROM THE AUDIENCE NOW. MR. TRUMP, HOW WOULD YOU FIX THE COUNTRY'S BROKEN TAX SYSTEM. DONALD TRUMP: IT IS TO COPY KIDDED, TOO BIG, AND WE ARE TOO MUCH FOR IT WE ARE ONE OF THE HEAVIEST TAXED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE LOSING CORPORATIONS, THEY'RE LEAVING THE COUNTRY BECAUSE OF TREMENDOUS TAXES. WE ARE PROBABLY THE MOST, FIRST OR SECOND, BUT I WOULD SAY IT IS FIRST, IF YOU OUT OF EVERYTHING. WE ARE THE MOST HEAVILY TAXED NATION IN THE WORLD. ONE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS IT IS TOO COMPLEX AND IT HAS TO BE CHANGED, FLAT TAX, THERE ARE MANY PROCEDURES YOU CAN USE, ALL OF WHICH ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. WE RIGHT NOW HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS SO COMPLEX. I HAVE THE BIGGEST LAW FIRM, AND I SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON JUST PREPARATION. I HAVE MASSIVE TAX RETURNS, AND YOU GET DEDUCTIONS FOR THIS, YOU GET PENALIZED FOR THIS, YOU GET THIS AND THIS PAIR YOU HAVE TO HIRE THESE PEOPLE. IT COSTS YOU A FORTUNE. IN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE TO GO OUT AND HIRE. I WANT TO PUT H&R BLOCK OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO YOUR OWN TAX RETURN. WE HAVE TO MAKE IT SIMPLE AND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MUCH FAIRER THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW. IT IS NOT A FAIR SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. LET'S GO TO LAUREN BURNS. GOOD MORNING. THE RECENT THREAT TO U.S. AMBASSADORS IN ASIA CRUISE THAT AMERICA HAS AN IMAGE PROBLEM OVERSEAS. HOW DO WE STRENGTHEN THE IMAGE PROBLEM OVERSEAS BUT STILL PROTECT OUR SOCIAL INTERESTS HERE AT HOME? DONALD TRUMP: WHAT THEY DID TO THE AMBASSADOR WITH THE RAZOR BLADE IN ASIA, IN AN AREA PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS SAFE, IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL. THAT IS REALLY A LACK OVER SPEC FOR OUR COUNTRY ARE NOBODY DISLIKES HIM. NOBODY KNEW HIM. IT IS A DISRESPECT, A LACK OF RESPECT FOR OUR COUNTRY. THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE AND IT ALL STARTS AT THE TOP. THERE ARE THOSE WHO SAY HILLARY CLINTON WAS THE WORST IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY, THE WORST SECRETARY OF STATE OR SHE IS NOW RUNNING AND SHE WILL DO VERY WELL, IT WAS LIKE, DESPITE THE E-MAIL SCANDALS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. THE POLLS CAME OUT AND SHE IS STILL THE MOST POPULAR DEMOCRAT AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHE WILL NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGED. BUT IT ALL STARTS AT THE TOP. PEOPLE DO NOT RESPECT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ANYMORE. THEY USED TO BUT THEY DO NOT ANYMORE P OR WE ARE NOT THE SAME COUNTRY. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT LEADER, IT WOULD STOP. THANK YOU, MR. TRUMP. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. ANOTHER ONE FROM OUR AUDIENCE COMING FROM EILEEN. I WORK IN A LOCAL SOUP KITCHEN AND HOMELESS SHELTER AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT YOU SEE IS THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND THE COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THEIR ATTEMPTS TO SURVIVE THERE. DONALD TRUMP: IT IS A TREMENDOUS PROBLEM, AND MORE SO IN SOME STATES ARE YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON WITH FOOD STAMPS AND SOME OTHER THINGS, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. WE HAVE NEVER HIT THE KIND OF NUMBERS WE ARE HITTING NOW. VERY INTERESTING WAY. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND YOU STOP LOOKING FOR THAT JOB, THEY CONSIDER YOU EMPLOYED. THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBER'S ARE A TOTAL FRAUD. IT IS A TOTAL JOKE. THE NUMBERS ARE NOT FIVE POINT 6%. THEY SAY 5.6 PER THE REAL NUMBER IS PROBABLY 21, 22, 20, MAYBE EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT. AND THAT IS WHY YOU'RE ASKING THIS QUESTION. UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS UNBELIEVABLE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLY HIGH. THOSE NUMBERS THEY COME OUT WITH EVERY MONTH ARE TOTALLY SKEWED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE THE POLITICIANS LOOK BETTER. WE HAVE TO PUT OUR PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THAT IS THE WAY YOU GET RID OF THE KITCHENS AND THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO WORK. AS YOU KNOW, MANY OF THE PEOPLE, THEY WANT A JOB AND I CANNOT GET A JOB. THEN YOU WERE UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOING SO WELL. IT IS PROBABLY NEVER BEEN WORSE. THEN YOU ALSO HAVE ANOTHER NEWS -- NEW PHENOMENON CAUSED BY OBAMACARE, WHICH BY THE WAY IS A TOTAL DISASTER AND HAVE TO BE REPEALED AND REPLACED WITH SOMETHING MUCH BETTER, BUT OBAMACARE WITH THE PART-TIME WORKERS, EVERYBODY IS BECOMING A PART-TIME WORKER BECAUSE UNDER OBAMACARE, THAT IS THE CHEAPEST WAY FOR A COMPANY TO DO IT TO BE FRANK WITH YOU. SO OBAMACARE IS ABSOLUTELY A DISASTER. THE WHOLE THING HAS TO BE CHANGED. YOU KNOW, ANOTHER PHENOMENON YOU WILL SEE, AND REMEMBER, OBAMACARE DOES NOT REALLY KICK IN UNTIL 2016. THE PRESIDENT WAS SMART AND SAID, LET IT REALLY KICK INTO IT IN THE MEANTIME, OUR PEOPLE WILL NOT HAVE IT AND SENATORS WILL NOT. ALL THE PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING THIS ONEROUS PROBLEM AND HAVING THIS OWNER'S PROBLEM, THEY ARE NOT DOING IT APPEARED BUT OBAMACARE KICKS IN IN 2016. WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE CATASTROPHE THAT WILL TAKE PLACE IN 2016. ONE OTHER THING, DOCTORS. THEY ARE LEAVING THEIR PROFESSION AS THEY SAY THEY CANNOT DO IT AND IT DOES NOT WORK FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE TO HIRE MORE COUNTS. THEY USED TO HIRE NURSES AND NOW THEY HIRE ACCOUNTS BECAUSE IT IS SO COMPENSATED AND TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL. OBAMACARE HAS TO BE ENDED AND IT CAN BE DONE. IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT LEADER, JOBS CAN BE PRODUCED AT WE HAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE ARE JUST ABOUT OUT OF TIME IN THIS HALF HOUR. A QUICK FOLLOW-UP, YOU BROUGHT UP PUBLIC HEALTH. A BIG PROBLEM HERE IN THIS STATE ALONG WITH OTHER STATES, IS HEROINE. -- A HEROINE ADDICTION. DONALD TRUMP: THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT IS SERIOUS STUFF. IN COLORADO, A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE IT AND DO NOT LIKE IT AND IT IS MIXED AND THEY DO HAVE -- SOME PROBLEMS AND I WOULD SAY IN TERMS OF HELP WITH MARIJUANA AND OTHER THINGS, WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH, YOU HAVE PEOPLE DYING AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO GIVE THEM HELP. FOR THAT, YOU HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE. A FAR AS HEROIN, YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG WITH IT. HEROINE IS SO ADDICTIVE, WHEN THEY TAKE SHOTS OF HEROIN, THEY CANNOT GET OFF OF IT. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE AND YOU HAVE TO COME DOWN VERY STRONG ON THAT. IT STARTS ON THE BORDER. PEOPLE ARE FLOWING INTO THIS COUNTRY, PEOPLE THAT ARE IN MANY CASES, THEY ARE NOT SENDING OVER THE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY'RE SENDING OVER CRIMINALS. WE ARE TAKING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO WILL NOT HELP US FOR THE MOST PART. I'M SURE THEY WILL BE WONDERFUL PEOPLE, BUT FOR THE MOST PART, THEY WILL NOT BE HELPING TO THE ARC IN CRIMINALS AND GANG MEMBERS, THE WORST OF THE WORST, AND WE ARE JUST LETTING THEM FLOW RIGHT IN, COME ON IN. NOW THEY WILL BE VOTING? THE DEMOCRATS LIKE THIS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I WATCH THE REPUBLICANS AND I WATCH BUSH AND RUBIO WHEN HE CAME OUT VERY STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF IT, AND THEY WANTED TO HELP. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP. THESE PEOPLE WILL VOTE 100% FOR DEMOCRATS. I WE WILL KEEP THIS GOING ONLINE. THAT IS ALL THE TIME WE HAVE FOR TELEVISION. INTELLIGENCE RAND PAUL WILL BE ON THE PROGRAM. WHILE WE ARE SIGNING OFF ON THE TELEVISION TONIGHT, THE CONVERSATION WITH DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES ONLINE AND ON OUR MOBILE APP. YOU WILL FIND A POLL THERE. MORE QUESTIONS COMING FROM OUR STUDIO AUDIENCE FOR -- AUDIENCE. FOR NOW, THANK YOU FOR WATCHING.
