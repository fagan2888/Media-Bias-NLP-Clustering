The campaign ad began airing this week.\n\nBuck is the GOP nominee for the 4th Congressional District, which is so conservative he\u2019s a heavy favorite, but Democrat Vic Meyers has been campaigning feverishly in the border-to-border district. The two squared off on Aaron Harber\u2019s show. Also running in the 4th District are Jess Loban, a libertarian, and Grant Doherty, who is unaffiliated.\n\nBuck, the Weld County district attorney, lost the 2010 Senate race by 2 percentage points. He ran again this year against U.S. Democrat Mark Udall until he withdrew from the race to make way for Congressman Cory Gardner, who is challenging Udall. Buck is now running for Gardner\u2019s seat.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "4th Congressional District,Cory Gardner,Ken Buck,Mark Udall,Vic Meyers", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Ken Buck has left his mark on folks, according to a new campaign ad.", "title": "Ken Buck's new campaign ad features grateful testimonials", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/10/25/ken-buck-congress-campaign/114491/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/07/IMG_6405-495x399.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Ken Buck has left his mark on folks, according to a new campaign ad.", "title": "Testimonials to Ken Buck, who faces Democrat Vic Meyers in the 4th CD", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/10/25/ken-buck-congress-campaign/114491/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/07/IMG_6405-495x399.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Ken Buck has left his mark on folks, according to a new campaign ad."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdab6b\"", "article_summary": "So many campaign ads these days sound the same, so 30 seconds of grateful fans of prosecutor/coach/friend Ken Buck stands out.\nAlso running in the 4th District are Jess Loban, a libertarian, and Grant Doherty, who is unaffiliated.\nBuck, the Weld County district attorney, lost the 2010 Senate race by 2 percentage points.\nThe campaign ad began airing this week.\nHe ran again this year against U.S. Democrat Mark Udall until he withdrew from the race to make way for Congressman Cory Gardner, who is challenging Udall."}
