The estate of Jimi Hendrix is suing a Tucson man for a guitar once owned by the legendary guitarist.

The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson reported (http://bit.ly/1OuM1M5) Sunday that Experience Hendrix LLC, the company that runs Hendrix's estate, wants a Pima County Superior Court judge to order the guitar returned.

According to the Oct. 2, complaint, the estate says Harvey Moltz, owner of Rainbow Guitars, is not the rightful owner of the Black Widow acoustic guitar.

Estate attorney Ed McPherson says the guitar is valued between $750,000 and $1 million.

Moltz says he purchased the guitar in June 2014 from someone who bought it from Sheldon Reynolds, ex-husband of Hendrix's adopted sister, Janie Hendrix.

McPherson says Reynolds, a former member of Earth, Wind, and Fire, stole it.
