The launch was an epic fail: Although the site got 4.7 million visits in the first 24 hours, only six people were able to complete the enrollment process. According to the Washington Post, President Obama ended many of his meetings about the healthcare law the same way: \u201cIf the Web site doesn\u2019t work, nothing else matters.\u201d\n\nThe good news is that the technical problems have been fixed \u2013 millions of Americans have used healthcare.gov to choose a health insurance plan. The bad news is that a potentially far more important problem remains. A growing body of evidence suggests that the design of healthcare.gov can lead many people to pick the wrong insurance plan, a decision-making error with major financial consequences.\n\nConsider a study Saurabh Bhargava and George Loewenstein of Carnegie-Mellon University and I recently conducted. Using a simulated version of healthcare.gov, we showed that a diverse sample of adults choosing among plans that resemble those on the exchange choose quite poorly. These subjects selected a plan that was, on average, $888 more expensive than it needed to be based on their expectations of medical use. (This equates to about 16 percent of the cost of a typical premium.) Meanwhile, an earlier study, led by Eric Johnson at Columbia University, found that giving consumers more healthcare options on sites like healthcare.gov dramatically decreased their ability to find the best plan. In fact, even offering people a modest degree of choice meant that nearly 80 percent of them picked suboptimally.\n\nAs a behavioral economist, this news doesn\u2019t really surprise me. Health insurance is an incredibly complicated subject. (One study conducted by Lowenstein and colleagues found that only 14 percent of subjects were able to correctly answer questions about the basic concepts of health insurance, such as deductibles and co-insurance.) The end result is that, unless consumers are given effective decision-aids, they will be unable to choose the plan that best fits their medical needs.\n\nTo help you understand one common mistake made by health insurance shoppers, I\u2019m going to offer you two different plans. Please pick the one you\u2019d prefer:\n\nPlan A has a monthly premium of $150 and a deductible of $1000\n\nPlan B has a monthly premium of $100 and a deductible of $1500\n\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you picked Plan A. It probably seemed like the more responsible and less risky option, since it came with a deductible that was 33 percent lower. However, choosing a low deductible plan is often the incorrect choice, since low deductibles require higher monthly premiums. If you never got sick, then Plan B is obviously the better choice, since you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the higher deductible. (You\u2019d only pay $1,200 in premiums.) However, even if you did get sick and used up your entire deductible, Plan B is still the best choice. (You\u2019d pay $2,700 instead of $2,800.) This means that, no matter what happens to you, the lower premium plan is the smarter option, at least in the above scenario.\n\nAlas, the current design of healthcare.gov is not helping people avoid this costly error. It might even be making things worse. In the research with Bhargava and Loewenstein, we tested the decision aids used by healthcare.gov. On the website, each insurance plan is assigned one of four metal labels \u2014 bronze, silver, gold or platinum \u2014 depending on the percentage of healthcare costs covered. To test the effectiveness of this design, we asked several hundred subjects about their medical history and expected medical usage in the near future. Then, we asked them to choose a health insurance plan using the healthcare.gov layout. According to our data, the metal labels failed to improve outcomes, as the average subject chose a plan that was way too expensive. (This mistake cost them, on average, an amount equivalent to roughly 3 percent of their income.) In fact, people made worse decisions using the metal labels than they did when the plans were given generic names, such as Plan A and Plan B.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a limit to how much information we can process -- here's one easy way to help you narrow your choices", "title": "Healthcare.gov\u2019s choice overload: It\u2019s no wonder people end up spending more than they need to", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "There's a limit to how much information we can process -- here's one easy way to help you narrow your choices", "title": "Healthcare.gov\u2019s choice overload: It\u2019s no wonder people end up spending more than they need to", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/13/healthcare_govs_choice_overload_its_no_wonder_people_end_up_spending_more_than_they_need_to/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/couple_laptop_frustrated.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's a limit to how much information we can process -- here's one easy way to help you narrow your choices", "title": "Healthcare.gov\u2019s choice overload: It\u2019s no wonder people end up spending more than they need to", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/couple_laptop_frustrated.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Shlomo Benartzi and jonah lehrer", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, health insurance, Healthcare.gov, Insurance, Obamacare", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, health insurance, Healthcare.gov, Insurance, Obamacare, Innovation News, Business NewsOn Oct. 1, 2013, the United States government launched a new website, www.healthcare.gov, that was designed to help people choose health insurance.\nHowever, even if you did get sick and used up your entire deductible, Plan B is still the best choice.\nTo help you understand one common mistake made by health insurance shoppers, I\u2019m going to offer you two different plans.\nIn fact, people made worse decisions using the metal labels than they did when the plans were given generic names, such as Plan A and Plan B.\nHowever, choosing a low deductible plan is often the incorrect choice, since low deductibles require higher monthly premiums."}
