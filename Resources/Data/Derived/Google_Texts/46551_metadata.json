Top Russian officials, openly critical of the lingering American presence, have said they are seeking deeper ties to the Kabul government, as well the Taliban.\n\n(Reporting by Mirwais Harooni and Josh Smith; Editing by Richard Borsuk)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Dependent almost entirely on foreign aid, Afghan security forces are struggling to sec", "title": "Russia gives a gift of 10,000 automatic rifles to Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/24/Russia-gives-gift-10000-automatic-rifles-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-russia-arms_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/24/Russia-gives-gift-10000-automatic-rifles-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/afghanistan-russia-arms_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Dependent almost entirely on foreign aid, Afghan security forces are struggling to sec", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"This important donation is from an important friend of Afghanistan in a crucial time for Afghanistan and the region.\"\nDependent almost entirely on foreign aid, Afghan security forces are struggling to secure the country amid a rising insurgency.\nWednesday's delivery comes as Russian officials say they have become impatient with the failures of Washington's policies in Afghanistan.\nTop Russian officials, openly critical of the lingering American presence, have said they are seeking deeper ties to the Kabul government, as well the Taliban.\nRussia's ambassador, Alexander Mantytskiy, told the gathered military and security officers that his country is willing to work with Afghanistan to combat problems like terrorism and drugs."}
