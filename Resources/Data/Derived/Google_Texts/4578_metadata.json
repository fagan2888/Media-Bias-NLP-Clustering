But it\u2019s more than that. Obama plans a number of radical moves later this year when the administration believes the media, and the public, are paying less attention.\n\nThis includes a forced transformation of our neighborhoods, a huge influx of immigrants and billions of dollars in additional taxes.\n\nWill midterm voters really be fooled? Probably not. Republicans are expected to hold both the Senate and the House starting in the next term. But whether anyone can stop the executive actions Obama quietly plans is another matter.\n\nIn fact, the president is hoping you don\u2019t even notice.\n\nImmigration\n\nIn June, Obama vowed \u201cto fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own, without Congress,\u201d but now he\u2019s taking no executive action on immigration until after the midterms.\n\nThe White House reportedly is preparing to provide amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants in late November, including work permits and green cards for up to 34 million.\n\nImmigration and border security have become the most divisive and important issues of this election cycle, thanks to growing threats from Islamic terrorists and Ebola. Most Americans already opposed amnesty.\n\nNominations\n\nEven though Attorney General Eric Holder stepped down last month, Obama hasn\u2019t named a replacement \u2014 that\u2019s because he has someone more radical in mind: Thomas Perez.\n\nPerez, now serving as labor secretary, is a dangerous race-baiter \u2014 and a shameless liar to boot.\n\nHe recently told an all-black crowd at Howard University that he learned while visiting a Mississippi school district that officials were locking up black kids for farting. He used the outrageous anecdote as an example of lingering white racism in the Deep South. But as I reported earlier in The Post, the African-American school superintendent denied the whole story and said Perez never even visited schools there.\n\nSchool administrators aren\u2019t the only people Perez has framed as racists. He\u2019s also compared bankers to Klansmen, whom he says practice a more \u201csubtle\u201d kind of racism that\u2019s \u201cevery bit as destructive as the cross burned in a neighborhood.\u201d\n\nAs the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights chief, Perez sabotaged a landmark housing discrimination case before the Supreme Court to protect his use of the dubious \u201cdisparate impact\u201d theory to shake down bankers for billions in payola for Democrat groups.\n\nWhen Congress investigated his role, Perez swore he never personally intervened in the case, even though e-mails and voicemail transcripts say otherwise. In fact, the evidence shows Perez went out of his way to derail the high-court case \u2014 including flying to meet with the petitioners to get them to drop the case and then insisting they not leave a paper trail.\n\nRadical Latino activist groups have pressured Obama to appoint Perez as the second-ever Latino attorney general. But Perez is certainly not someone who will enforce the nation\u2019s laws equally \u2014 or enforce them at all in the case of illegal immigration. As he revealed in a National Press Club speech last week, he\u2019s all about getting more immigrants in to vote for Democrats to bring about more \u201cshared prosperity.\u201d\n\nObama is expected to ram through his radical nod in the lame-duck session before newly elected Senate members take their seats in January.\n\nWar on terror\n\nEven though the Army\u2019s investigation into Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s desertion of his post in Afghanistan is complete, the results won\u2019t be released until Pentagon brass can \u201creview\u201d it. That\u2019s bureaucrat-speak for \u201cbury.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt election politics factored into the delay. The case has become a political powder keg for President Obama and Democrats. The GOP would justifiably make great hay of the report, especially if it absolves Bergdahl of any wrongdoing.\n\nSince the president traded five imprisoned Taliban leaders for Bergdahl, the US Government Accountability Office has declared the swap illegal, and nearly two dozen House Democrats have joined Republicans in officially condemning the move for making \u201cAmericans less safe.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Taliban deal appears to have encouraged the Islamic State to put up American hostages as trade bait to free other terrorist detainees, namely \u201cLady al-Qaeda\u201d Aafia Siddiqui. And now lawyers for dangerous al Qaeda prisoners at Gitmo are arguing for their release, as well, based on the precedent set by Obama\u2019s Taliban amnesty.\n\nIn fact, a Gitmo parole board just approved for release al Qaeda assassin Muhammad al-Zahrani to Saudi Arabia. His lawyers successfully argued that the terrorist no longer meets the threshold for a high-risk detainee because Obama, with his release of the Taliban commanders, lowered the bar for what\u2019s considered high-risk.\n\n\u201cWe have demonstrated that Mr. al-Zahrani represents a lower threat than the [Taliban] detainees that have been released,\u201d his defense team wrote the board, \u201cand therefore does not rise to the standard for \u2018continuing significant threat to the security of the United Sates.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFellow soldiers and other critics fear the military\u2019s delayed Bergdahl investigation is shaping up to be a whitewash. A senior Army official told me court-martialing Bergdahl would \u201cmake the president look bad\u201d \u2014 and by extension, make Democrats look weak on national security at a time when the war on terror has rekindled. Dragging out his case past the election keeps voters from being reminded of the bad Taliban deal.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is expected to release new power-plant restrictions that will cost the industry some $366 billion, but the onerous rules won\u2019t be finalized until later this year.\n\nThis looks to be just the beginning of more regulations and fines Obama will pursue without congressional approval to pursue his environmental visions.\n\nOil\n\nObama also refuses to make a pre-election decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline. A move on the massive oil and gas pipeline, opposed by environmental activists, has been delayed for six years. Now it has been delayed again by the president, who fears angering his environmental allies.\n\nObamaCare\n\nThe administration has announced that health-insurance premium rates on the ObamaCare exchange won\u2019t be available until Nov. 15, when the Healthcare.gov website is set to start enrolling people for 2015.\n\nHow politically convenient.\n\nRates are expected to go up by a whopping 14%, but voters won\u2019t know because they won\u2019t be revealed until after the election. Last year, enrollment began on Oct. 1. Clearly, the date was pushed back to hide the increases from the voting public.\n\nMasking the costs of Obama\u2019s unpopular law until after the midterms proves just how bad a deal ObamaCare is for consumers \u2014 and just what a liability it is for Democrats like North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, one of its biggest backers.\n\nIranian nukes\n\nObama is expected to hand even more concessions to Iran in pursuit of a nuclear deal \u2014 but not until after Election Day. As part of the pact, set for Nov. 24, Obama is reportedly prepared to suspend economic sanctions against Tehran and allow it to triple the number of centrifuges in operation \u2014 an outrageous deal no Democrat would want to defend in televised debates.\n\nHousing\n\nAfter a delay, the administration\u2019s final \u201cAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing\u201d regulation is now expected to be announced in December. Originally scheduled for finalization in October, the new Housing and Urban Development Department rules will force all cities and suburbs to accept subsidized housing in the name of racial diversity, superceding all local zoning ordinances.\n\nThe Orwellian-sounding regulation would force some 1,200 municipalities to redraw zoning maps to racially diversify suburban neighborhoods.\n\nWhile temporarily punting away politically fraught issues may be smart politics, it\u2019s cowardly leadership.\n\nUnder the scheme, HUD plans to map every US neighborhood by race and publish \u201cgeospatial data\u201d pinpointing racial imbalances. Areas deemed overly segregated will be forced to change their zoning laws to allow construction of subsidized and other affordable housing to bring more low-income minorities into \u201cwhite suburbs.\u201d HUD\u2019s maps will be used to select affordable housing sites.\n\nIt\u2019s part of the administration\u2019s ambitious agenda to eliminate \u201cracial segregation,\u201d ZIP code by ZIP code, block by block, through the systematic dismantling of allegedly \u201cexclusionary\u201d building ordinances. In effect, federal bureaucrats will have the power to rezone your neighborhood.\n\nOf course, Obama and Democrats are loath to inject this decidedly radical issue into the elections, so they\u2019ll keep it out of the headlines until after voters go to the polls.\n\nWhile temporarily punting away politically fraught issues may be smart politics, it\u2019s cowardly leadership.\n\nIf the president\u2019s policies are so popular, why does he have to try to hide them from voters? And who can trust Democrats now distancing themselves from him and his ideas when they voted with him 99% of the time previously?\n\nPaul Sperry is a Hoover Institution media fellow and author of \u201cThe Great American Bank Robbery,\u201d which exposes the racial politics behind the mortgage crisis.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "He\u2019s the Staller in Chief \u2014 President Obama has punted almost every hot-button issue past the key midterm elections on Nov. 4.\nObama has postponed decisions on a raft of contentious issues related", "creator": "@nypost", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/unnamed.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "title": "Obama's post-election plans for a secret radical agenda", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-7770556\"}", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,immigration,obamacare,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-26 00:00:54", "sailthru.title": "Obama\u2019s post-election plans for a secret radical\u00a0agenda", "nypost-section": "News", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/unnamed.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "He\u2019s the Staller in Chief \u2014 President Obama has punted almost every hot-button issue past the key midterm elections on Nov. 4.\r\n\r\nObama has postponed decisions on a raft of contentious issues related to ObamaCare, Gitmo, immigration and his Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThis is partly to protect Democratic candidates and hold onto the Senate.
