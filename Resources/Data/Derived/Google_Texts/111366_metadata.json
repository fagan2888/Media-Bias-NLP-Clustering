The RTS,S vaccine, by comparison, showed significant efficacy in protecting children from the disease, with nearly half of all children aged 5 to 7 months, and a quarter of infants between 6 and 12 weeks, receiving protection.\n\nProtection lasted only 18 months, which may not reassure parents in the industrialized world, but is expected to revitalize a continent that has seen millions die from the disease in a matter of years. GSK\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said the company has high hopes for the vaccine despite its waning effectiveness.\n\n\"While we have seen some decline in vaccine efficacy over time, the sheer number of children affected by malaria means that the number of cases of the disease the vaccine can help prevent is impressive,\" he said.\n\nWHO estimates that 3.3 billion people currently face serious risk of contracting malaria. In 2010, there were roughly 219 million cases of malaria worldwide. But the organization is optimistic, if timidly so, as mortality rates have been dropping steadily since 2000, when they were 25 percent higher than they are today. In the WHO African region, rates have fallen 33 percent since 2000.\n\n\"Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals,\u201d Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso, told the BBC. \"Progress is being made with bed nets and other measures, but we need more tools to battle this terrible disease.\u201d\n\nGSK has spent the last three decades developing the disease. Now, through partnerships with the nonprofit Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), and supported by a $200 million investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the British pharmaceutical company hopes their seven-country study, which included nearly 15,500 children, will be granted licensure. So far, GSK has put in $350 million for the vaccine, and plans for another $260 million before it reaches children. The vaccine will be not-for-profit, but a five percent increase on its price will be added to offset future research into tropical diseases.\n\nBefore it can approach WHO to get approval, GSK must first submit its dossier \u2014 a distillation of over a million pages of paperwork, handled by 40 people \u2014 to the European Medical Agency next year. Only then will it have the chance to obtain a license.\n\nThe only hiccup to the study, experts argued, was how quickly doctors were available to treat children with negative reactions to the vaccine. Dr. Lucas Otieno, of the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Walter Reed Project, who\u2019s been working on trials since 2005, said this may mean the vaccine is actually less effective than has been reported. However, he lauded the study\u2019s ability to recruit volunteers \u2014 a hopeful note with perhaps darker undertones.\n\n\"The volunteers were keen across all the sites,\" he told The Guardian. \"In my site, we had 1,631 children and we recruited the initial 1,000 within about three months, which was very impressive.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "malaria vaccine, world health organization, glaxosmithkline, gsk, africa, disease, vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "GlaxoSmithKline hopes to have the first ever malaria vaccine reach children in Africa by 2015.", "title": "First Malaria Vaccine Could Hit The Market In Africa By 2015", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/first-malaria-vaccine-could-hit-market-africa-2015-after-3-decades-development-259285", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/08/malaria.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GlaxoSmithKline hopes to have the first ever malaria vaccine reach children in Africa by 2015.", "title": "First Malaria Vaccine Could Hit The Market In Africa By 2015", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/first-malaria-vaccine-could-hit-market-africa-2015-after-3-decades-development-259285", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/08/malaria.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/08/malaria.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2013-10-08T13:34:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T13:34:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "GlaxoSmithKline hopes to have the first ever malaria vaccine reach children in Africa by 2015."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1456\"", "article_summary": "The world\u2019s fourth-largest pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), has announced its intent to seek licensing for the world\u2019s first malaria vaccine, which the company hopes to distribute across Africa beginning in 2015.\n\"Many millions of malaria cases fill the wards of our hospitals,\u201d Halidou Tinto, a lead investigator on the RTS,S trial from Burkina Faso, told the BBC.\nIn 2010, there were roughly 219 million cases of malaria worldwide.\nGSK\u2019s chief executive, Sir Andrew Witty, said the company has high hopes for the vaccine despite its waning effectiveness.\nSo far, GSK has put in $350 million for the vaccine, and plans for another $260 million before it reaches children."}
