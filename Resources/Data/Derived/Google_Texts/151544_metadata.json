John Kasich is the Republican in the 2016 presidential field whom Democrats I know like the most. He evokes his Christian faith to explain his support for government spending. At the CNBC debate, he declared, \u201cI care about poor people\u2019\u2019 \u2014 in a way that made you wonder if he thought he was the only R who could make that claim. Kasich even liked the CNBC debate. Leon Wolf, a blogger for the conservative website RedState, seized on Kasich\u2019s remarks to declare him \u201cfar and away the candidate in this field who is just utterly clueless about the Republican electorate as a whole.\u201d\n\nDebates have not been good for Kasich. The more GOP voters hear him, the thinner are the ranks of those who support him. Kasich\u2019s high mark in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls was about 5 percent. He\u2019s now in ninth place at 2.2 percent. The Kasich campaign has staked his candidacy on scoring big in New Hampshire, where the RealClearPolitics average puts him in fifth place with 8.3 percent of the vote.\n\nKasich should be doing better, because he has impeccable conservative credentials. At the CNBC debate, he boasted he was \u201cthe chief architect of balancing the federal budget.\u201d PolitiFact ruled he was not the only party responsible, but indeed was \u201cone of the chief architects of the balanced federal budget.\u201d In 1996, when Kasich was chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed a budget that reduced domestic appropriations by 9 percent and cut discretionary spending by $53 billion over two years. A year later came the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\nWhen Kasich became Ohio governor in 2011, the state faced an $8 billion projected shortfall. That deficit is gone and has been replaced by a $2 billion rainy day fund.\n\nAs a GOP presidential nominee, he will need to win the Buckeye State. While Ohio voters preferred Barack Obama to John McCain in 2008 and to Mitt Romney in 2012, Kasich has done well in his battleground state. In 2010, he beat the Democratic incumbent governor, Ted Strickland, in a tight race. The vote was 49 percent to 47 percent. In 2014, Kasich won re-election with 64 percent of the vote.\n\nSome conservatives won\u2019t forgive Kasich for expanding Ohio Medicaid rolls under the Affordable Care Act. (For the first three years, Obamacare funds new enrollees at full freight, then the federal contribution decreases to 90 percent.) Kasich told Fox News he expanded the rolls because it\u2019s his job to \u201cbring Ohio money back to Ohio.\u201d His constituents pay federal taxes, so it makes no sense to send them to pay for health care in other states. That\u2019s a strong answer.\n\nSometimes, however, Kasich strays from pragmatic to sanctimonious. He famously told one conservative critic, \u201cWhen you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor.\u201d There have been respectable arguments on both sides of the Medicaid expansion issue. So my advice: When you\u2019re running in the Republican primary, it\u2019s best not to talk like Nancy Pelosi.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2015 CREATORS.COM", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Kasich even liked the CNBC debate.\nJohn Kasich is the Republican in the 2016 presidential field whom Democrats I know like the most.\nWhen Kasich became Ohio governor in 2011, the state faced an $8 billion projected shortfall.\nSome conservatives won\u2019t forgive Kasich for expanding Ohio Medicaid rolls under the Affordable Care Act.\nWhile Ohio voters preferred Barack Obama to John McCain in 2008 and to Mitt Romney in 2012, Kasich has done well in his battleground state."}
