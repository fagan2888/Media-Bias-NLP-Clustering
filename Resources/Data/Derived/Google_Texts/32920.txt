Pan-American Life Insurance Group shares MedLion’s mission to provide high-quality, affordable healthcare nationwide. We are thrilled to work with them as we continue to expand our Direct Primary Care services to businesses across the country.

MedLion Management, Inc., the nation’s largest Direct Primary Care provider, and Pan-American Life Insurance Group, a company with a 100 year heritage of providing life, accident and health insurance, announced today the formation of a program designed to benefit employers and employees across the country. The arrangement marks the first joint effort between a Direct Primary Care company and a national insurance company to offer employee benefits nationwide.

Pan-American Life’s U.S. Benefits’ suite of insurance products will be coupled with MedLion’s Direct Primary Care programs to benefit businesses. In addition, Pan-American Life’s U.S. Benefits division will administer a supplemental “wrap” insurance program exclusively for MedLion Direct Primary Care clients.

Reflecting Pan-American Life’s position as the thought leader for alternative benefits strategies throughout the United States, the combination benefits package is specifically designed to lower healthcare costs for employers across the country and offer innovative solutions that are compatible with Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandates.

The working relationship with Pan-American Life will accelerate MedLion’s growth beyond the 26 states it currently operates in. “Pan-American Life Insurance Group shares MedLion’s mission to provide high-quality, affordable healthcare nationwide. We are thrilled to work with them as we continue to expand our Direct Primary Care services to businesses across the country,” said Dr. Samir Qamar, Founder and CEO of MedLion Management, Inc.

“In our ongoing effort to seek affordable, creative, and compliant benefit solutions for U.S. employers, we are excited to join MedLion in this unique packaging of meaningful employee benefits,” said Carlo Mulvenna, Pan-American Life’s Vice President for U.S. Benefits.

“Employers will be able to save up to 30 percent on premiums and will be delighted by the enhanced access and quality of care delivered by MedLion's Direct Primary Care model,” stated Praveen Mooganur, MedLion’s President and COO. “The combined products from MedLion and Pan-American Life are designed to offer cost effective alternatives to employers, including those that need to meet the employer mandate effective January 1, 2016. It’s a huge step forward for the Direct Primary Care and employee benefit industries.”
