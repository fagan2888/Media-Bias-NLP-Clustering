Lincoln, NH

Sick of snow and ice?

Millions of people across the U.S. are ready for spring. But New England ice castles could be the perfect way to put a positive spin on the long winter.

There are four of these across the United States. One was built in Utah, and there's another one in Stratton, Vermont.

A man-made ice castle, in Lincoln, New Hampshire, has lots of nooks and crannies for adventurous visitors to explore. It's got tunnels, slides and even a glacial waterfall.

The word is out, and a lot of people are bundling up and showing up to play or just stand around in awe. There are lights buried under the ice, and when darkness falls, the ice castles glow. They have a blue tint because properties in the water used absorb all colors expect blue.

These ice structures will be around through March, if weather permits.
