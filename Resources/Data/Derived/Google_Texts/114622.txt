PUNE: Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will be shifting the Jijamata hospital in Pimpri to a nearby school building.Speaking to TOI, Navnath Jagtap, chairman, standing committee, PCMC said that a decision in this regard has been taken during the discussions held at the standing committee meeting.Sunita Waghire, NCP corporator from Pimpri and member of the standing committee, said, "The building of the Jijamata hospital at Pimpri has become too old. The poor and middle class people staying in these areas have to go to Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital which is located more than three kilometres from Pimpri camp for getting affordable medical treatment. As a result the local residents have been demanding that a modern hospital be constructed in the premises of Jijamata hospital to provide better medical care at affordable rates."She added, "The old building of the Jijamata hospital needs to be demolished to provide space for constructing this modern hospital. Jijamata hospital will be shifted to the primary school building located near Deluxe theatre chowk located a few 100 meters from the present hospital premises.K Anil Roy, medical officer of health (MOH), PCMC said, "The health department runs a 70 bed hospital in Pimpri called as Jijamata hospital. It will soon appoint a consultant for preparing the plan for the construction of a new hospital building at the Jijamata hospital premises in Pimpri. The existing OPD and maternity wards will be shifted to the nearby newly constructed primary school building."
