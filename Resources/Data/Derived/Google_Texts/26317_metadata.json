REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n5020345\n\nHealth insurer Humana announced it is considering pulling out of Obamacare exchanges in certain states Wednesday after seeing a 46 percent drop in earnings in the first quarter.\n\nThe insurance company, which is planning to merge with Aetna, said it is also weighing increasing premiums in an attempt to make up for the financial hit caused by provisions in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe company said it has seen an increase in medical services and prescriptions used with those who reenrolled in individual plans through the Obamacare marketplace from 2015 into 2016, which has taken a toll on its profit margin.\n\nReuters reports Humana is currently weighing what changes it will make and products it will offer next year.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the early indicators we are seeing in our Medicare and Healthcare Services businesses but remain cautious while our healthcare exchange experience continues to develop,\u201d Brian A. Kane, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said in a statement. \u201cWe remain keenly focused on an enterprise\u2010wide view of driving shareholder value by balancing continued pretax margin improvement and membership growth across our franchise.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s revenue dropped from 13.83 billion to $13.8 billion since the first quarter last year.\n\n\u201cThe Health Care Reform Law, including The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humana\u2019s results of operations,\u201d it said in its earnings report, adding the health-care law is \u201crestricting revenue\u201d and preventing the company from expanding.\n\nHumana is not the first insurer to consider leaving the Obamacare exchanges. UnitedHealth Group announced in April it was pulling out of most states after incurring major losses due to the president\u2019s landmark health-care legislation.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
