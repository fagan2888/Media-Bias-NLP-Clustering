Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., is holding to the political center, a position becoming increasingly tenuous in today\u2019s Washington. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nHANOVER, N.H. \u2013 Independence is a valuable trait in this \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d state.\n\nAnd it\u2019s how the Granite State\u2019s junior senator, Republican Kelly Ayotte, plans to sell herself in next year\u2019s reelection race, one of the most competitive Senate contests on the ballot in 2016.\n\nShe is one of five Republican senators up for reelection next year in states that have historically tipped blue in presidential elections. Ayotte\u2019s race is critical for Republicans fighting to hold on to their already slim Senate majority. But even if she does make it back to Washington, the Republican could find herself an odd woman out in a chamber where conservatives frequently speak the loudest.\n\nAs her party lurches rightward in the halls of the Capitol, Ayotte is positioning herself as a Party of One. She has deliberately broken with Senate Republicans \u2013 most notably, by publicly calling out Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) for insisting on defunding Planned Parenthood in the budget bill and by announcing her support for President Obama\u2019s clean power plan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to focus on issues where we can find common ground,\u201d Ayotte said. \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to need some bridge builders who can actually be consistent with their principles but bridge divides.\u201d\n\n[Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet]\n\nWhile the first-term senator\u2019s not-so-subtle declaration of independence is a gamble, she may find that occupying the middle means nobody is happy on either the right or the left.\n\nPolls show the senator running neck-and-neck with sitting New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan, a recruiting coup for Democrats who recently declared she would challenge Ayotte. And recently, a group of conservative state legislators began a search for a Republican willing to mount a primary challenge to Ayotte.\n\n\u201cI understand the frustration of my constituents, particularly those on my side of the aisle,\u201d Ayotte said in a recent interview here, referring to conservative criticism that Washington Republicans have failed to roll back many of President Obama\u2019s policies on Obamacare and immigration.\n\n\u201cRepublicans won and they had a very good 2014 election, they took the Senate. [Voters] feel like why then can\u2019t we do all of these things. I understand the frustration, but that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important to sit [voters] down and walk them through, \u2018Here are some things we did do.\u2019\u201d\n\nAyotte is known around Washington as a disciplined, careful politician who made a name for herself early in her Senate career as a defense hawk. She quickly rose to chair the military readiness subcommittee on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nHer voting record in recent years has drifted further towards the center, much to the frustration of influential conservative outside groups. Heritage Action gives Ayotte a 29 percent rating for 2015, down from a term average of 63 percent. The Club for Growth ranked her the 8th most conservative senator in 2011 and the 32nd in 2014.\n\nThat drift toward increasing independence makes Ayotte one of the most coveted votes on legislation as the band dwindles of so-called GOP Senate moderates. The small group now includes GOP Sens. Mark Kirk (Ill.), Pat Toomey (Pa.) and Rob Portman (Ohio), who are also up for reelection next year.\n\nBut breaking from her Washington colleagues isn\u2019t guaranteed to help Ayotte \u2014 a former prosecutor and state attorney general, who was elected with more than 60 percent of the vote in 2010 \u2013with Democrats and independents.\n\nNew Hampshire is highly competitive, with The Cook Political Report recently dubbing the Senate race a tossup. President Obama won the state with about 52 percent of the vote in 2012, the same year that Hassan secured her seat with about 55 percent. Both chambers of the state\u2019s legislature are controlled by Republicans, who have gone toe-to-toe with Hassan this year over the state budget\n\nLiberal groups like Planned Parenthood and the Senate Majority PAC are already on the air with ads attacking Ayotte\u2019s record on women\u2019s health and her ties to big business. The New Hampshire Democratic Party set up a project devoted to debunking every moderate claim Ayotte has made about her record. The goal is to call out the senator as an ideological carpetbagger.\n\n\u201cIn Washington, Kelly Ayotte has always put her special interest backers first,\u201d said Hassan campaign communications director Aaron Jacobs in a statement. \u201cAyotte has voted repeatedly to make college more expensive, defund Planned Parenthood, turn Medicare into a voucher system, and opposed efforts to protect Social Security \u2014 and voters will see right through her transparent political efforts to hide her true record.\u201d\n\nAyotte\u2019s race is ground zero for the fight over abortion rights, and the debate over Washington Republicans\u2019 push to defund Planned Parenthood in the wake of undercover videos in which conservatives believe the group\u2019s employees are seen selling fetal tissue. It\u2019s an issue that is likely to repeat itself in the contests of other Republican senators running in blue states. Ayotte is anti-abortion rights, but supports exceptions for rape and incest and for the life and health of the mother.\n\nAbortion nearly divides New Hampshire voters. A recent poll from Suffolk University found that 49 percent of Republicans in New Hampshire call themselves pro-choice while 41 percent call themselves pro-life.\n\nAyotte has a history of supporting individual health initiatives, like legislation to expand breast cancer awareness and screenings and combat eating disorders. But she also voted for a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood and favored a ban on abortions after 20-weeks.\n\nYet Ayotte was unafraid to call out Cruz in a tweet storm unleashed during the budget fight, arguing there was no point in attaching the Planned Parenthood language to must-pass government funding legislation. She supported the budget bill without the defund language.\n\nDespite the fact we don't have the votes to redirect Planned Parenthood funding, some are still pushing to tie this to govt funding bill \u2014 Kelly Ayotte (@KellyAyotte) September 22, 2015\n\nIn a letter to Cruz, Ayotte asked: \u201cDuring the last government shutdown, I repeatedly asked you what your strategy for success was when we did not have the votes to achieve the goal of defunding Obamacare, but I did not receive an answer.\u201d\n\nAyotte\u2019s opposition to some of her colleagues hasn\u2019t stopped Democrats from attacking her on women\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cIf Senator Ayotte got her way, women would not have access to breast cancer screenings at Planned Parenthood-the largest provider of reproductive and sexual health care in New Hampshire,\u201d said Jennifer Frizzell, vice president of policy at Planned Parenthood New Hampshire Action Fund. \u201cShe cannot hide this decade long record of working against women\u2019s health by trying to pinkwash it in an election year.\u201d\n\nAyotte has also split with Washington Republicans on environmental issues.\n\nShe recently backed Obama\u2019s clean power plan \u2014 which would require electric companies to cut carbon emissions \u2014 and is among just five Republicans who supported an amendment to the Keystone XL pipeline bill stipulating that \u201chuman activity significantly contributes to climate change.\u201d But she backed a bill to approve the controversial pipeline long before Obama rejected the plan. Ayotte also recently joined GOP Sens. Kirk, Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to launch a GOP environmental working group.\n\nBut days afterwards, she supported a failed effort to force the Environmental Protection Agency to roll back and modify clean water regulations.. And the League of Conservation voters gave her a lifetime score of just 23 percent.\n\nAyotte is aggressively courting environmentalists in New Hampshire, joining a conservation group on an October hike.\n\nWith green-minded constituents in tow, she trekked across a stretch of the Appalachian Trail just outside the idyllic campus of Dartmouth College, crunching over leaves and muddy streams led by members of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy.\n\nEarlier this year, the group honored the Republican with its annual award because she supports renewing the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses oil and gas royalties to support conservation. The program expired in September and Ayotte has been leading the charge to permanently reinstate it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have the same view as some of my colleagues,\u201d Ayotte said along the 90-minute walk in the woods. \u201cI went to the Senate to solve problems for the country and New Hampshire. When you have something like the land and water conservation fund that you know has bipartisan support\u2026yet you\u2019re fighting to get that vote to get it done, it\u2019s frustrating but it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nThe fighting and contradictions may be tough to explain on the campaign trail but Ayotte\u2019s independence has gained her considerable respect among the small cadre of more moderate Republicans still in the Senate.\n\n\u201cKelly has an independent streak,\u201d said Alexander in a recent interview. \u201cThe Senate badly needs members from both parties who have respect and want to get things done.\u201d\n\nBut back in New Hampshire, the Republican Party is struggling with the same hard-line revolt that has been roiling the Washington power structure. Last week, a group of conservative activists and state lawmakers met to begin drafting a GOP candidate to challenge Ayotte.\n\nThe group, led by the politically divisive former New Hampshire House speaker, is angry with Ayotte\u2019s willingness to compromise and the state\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid to help bolster Obamacare enrollments.\n\n\u201cAll Kelly Ayotte has to do is comply with the platform of the party at the state and the federal level,\u201d said Aaron Day, chairman of the conservative PAC Stark 360.\n\nBut Ayotte is confident the center will hold. She argued that it is unrealistic to think Republicans will win a filibuster-proof Senate majority, meaning compromise is necessary.\n\n\u201cI, too, hope for a Republican president. That would make it a lot easier getting things done that are consistent with my principles,\u201d she said. \u201cEither way, we\u2019re still not going to have all of the cards and we\u2019re still going to have to work to get people on board.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the first-term senator's not-so-subtle declaration of independence is a gamble, she may find that occupying the middle means nobody is happy on either the right or the left.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "While the first-term senator's not-so-subtle declaration of independence is a gamble, she may find that occupying the middle means nobody is happy on either the right or the left.", "title": "Ayotte is Party of One in her 2016 New Hampshire reelection bid", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/09/ayotte-is-party-of-one-in-her-2016-new-hampshire-reelection-bid/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-10-20/AP/Congress-0fe91.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kelsey_snell"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "kelly ayotte, new hampshire, ted cruz, planned parenthood, new hampshire republicans, abortion, environment, senate conservatives", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/kelsey.snell.3"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "kelly ayotte, new hampshire, ted cruz, planned parenthood, new hampshire republicans, abortion, environment, senate conservatives"}, "article_summary": "As her party lurches rightward in the halls of the Capitol, Ayotte is positioning herself as a Party of One.\nBut she also voted for a stand-alone bill to defund Planned Parenthood and favored a ban on abortions after 20-weeks.\nThe New Hampshire Democratic Party set up a project devoted to debunking every moderate claim Ayotte has made about her record.\nAyotte is aggressively courting environmentalists in New Hampshire, joining a conservation group on an October hike.\nAnd it\u2019s how the Granite State\u2019s junior senator, Republican Kelly Ayotte, plans to sell herself in next year\u2019s reelection race, one of the most competitive Senate contests on the ballot in 2016."}
