Visit Denver on Tuesday named Ken Chin as the first executive director of the reorganized Metro Denver Sports Commission, which now goes by simply Denver Sports.

Chin’s 20 years in sports business marketing includes his most recent stint as vice president of business development for the Atlanta Sports Council, a division of the Metro Atlanta Chamber. In that role he is credited with broadening Atlanta’s host-city profile on the national sporting events scene as well as expanding the council’s reach from downtown into the 29-county metro Atlanta region. He worked as the city’s point man for bid submissions to the NCAA and the U.S. Olympics Committee, experience that can help Denver as it mulls a bid for the Winter Olympics. Denver Sports is spearheading the exploration of a potential bid to host the Winter Olympics.

Chin also served as vice president of events and entertainment for the National Hockey League.

“Ken Chin brings the perfect mix of experience in both managing major sports events, and in recruiting and creating these types of events for city destinations,” said Richard Scharf, president of Visit Denver, in a statement released Tuesday. “We were particularly pleased with his experience in creating partnerships and outreach that involve an entire community in bringing major sporting events to the region.”

Denver Mayor Michael Hancock helped align Visit Denver with the Metro Denver Sports Commission, creating Denver Sports.

Hancock said Chin and Visit Denver can help metro Denver land “major new sporting events.”

“Together, the future is bright for stimulating the regional economy and strengthening our national and international recognition,” Hancock said in a statement.
