Maybe you\u2019ve been feeling depressed, getting headaches, or keep forgetting to pop the tiny tablet. Perhaps you\u2019ve been experiencing some really strange stuff that didn\u2019t happen before you started the pill\u2014like inflamed, bleeding gums or cringing at another person\u2019s touch.\n\nBoth personal anecdotes and research studies have linked these and other side effects, such as breast tenderness and nausea, to the pill. (One study suggested it might even make you pick the \u201cwrong\u201d partner by altering your chemical attraction to a man\u2019s scent.)\n\nMost randomized control trials haven\u2019t actually found any real difference in the frequency of side effects among women taking the pill versus those taking a placebo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon,\u201d says Dr. Alisa Goldberg, director of clinical research and training at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. \u201cClearly some women are sensitive to the pill and experience these things, but when you try to study it scientifically on a population basis, there\u2019s really no difference.\u201d\n\nStill, while four out of five American women have used the pill at some point, 30 percent have discontinued its use due to dissatisfaction\u2014most commonly because of its side effects. The latest federal statistics on contraception use are due this fall, and experts expect trends from recent years to continue: IUD use will continue to rise, while pill use seems to have plateaued.\n\nI tried five different formulations of the pill, but never managed to escape all the annoying symptoms.\n\nThe issues a woman experiences\u2014or whether she has any at all\u2014vary greatly based on the specific dosage of hormones and the unique individual swallowing them every day. Personally, along with bloating and mood swings, I got migraines with an aura, or what felt like a laser light show in my left eyeball. Twice I had to retreat to my office\u2019s \u201cPump and Pray Room\u201d\u2014reserved for new mothers and religious employees\u2014to lie down and recover. (What I did not know at the time was that, because of this symptom, I should not have been on an estrogen-containing pill in the first place. Women with aura migraines, along with other conditions that put them at risk for strokes, blood clots, heart disease or some cancers, should not take combination pills.)\n\nFinally, I gave up on the pill\u2014only to be blindsided by a whole new challenge: the unexpected side effects of going off the pill. To help others avoid similar unpleasant surprises, I spoke with three experts about what to expect when you ditch the pill for another birth control method.\n\nOf course, just as each woman has a unique reaction to the pill, she\u2019ll also have a unique reaction to going off. According to the feminist women\u2019s health organization Our Bodies, Ourselves, there is \u201cenormous variability in any individual\u2019s response to her own hormones or any synthetic hormones she takes.\u201d One woman\u2019s skin may break out in pimples, while another\u2019s clears up completely.\n\nWith this disclaimer in mind, here are eight possibly unexpected changes you might experience when you cancel your monthly refill of that crinkly foil packet:\n\n1. Most of the side effects should disappear in a few days.\n\nFirst off, while many women decide to have their period before pitching the pack, it\u2019s safe to stop taking the pill at any point. However, you should stop immediately if experiencing any serious side effects, like headaches or high blood pressure, says Dr. Jennifer Moore Kickham, the medical director of a Massachusetts General Hospital outpatient gynecology clinic.\n\nBecause they are taken daily, the synthetic hormones from oral contraceptives leave your system in a couple days. This is why you have to use another form of birth control after missing more than two doses of the pill. But it\u2019s also why most acute side effects, like nausea, will go away pretty soon after giving the pill the boot. Other issues, such as mood swings or irregular bleeding, may take a bit longer. If they persist, you should visit your doctor to investigate possible other causes, Dr. Kickham says.\n\nIn addition to migraines, I had major stomach bloating while on the pill\u2014a side effect so perpetual that I came to view it as normal. I also experienced anxiety and a general irritability that I\u2019m sure my family and boyfriend didn\u2019t particularly enjoy. Eventually, after six years of being on and off the pill, I couldn\u2019t tolerate it anymore. I decided to ditch it for good. I felt better almost immediately. After a month, my headaches and bloating vanished. (I had no idea I could eat without my stomach inflating like a balloon!) My mood issues took a bit longer, but eventually faded away, too.\n\nWhen you stop the pill after a few years, you may actually realize you were experiencing mild side effects the entire time, like bloating or breast tenderness. According to Dr. Kickham, \u201cSome women come off and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t realize I had a low-level headache the whole time I was on the pill, and now it\u2019s gone.'\u201d\n\n2. But some of the pill\u2019s benefits will go too.\n\nThough I may have started this story with a little pill-bashing party, oral contraceptives do have major benefits that usually outweigh any negative side effects. \u201cThe pill is an effective form of contraception with a lot of great benefits,\u201d Dr. Kickham says. \u201cSo as long as it\u2019s safe for patients to use and they\u2019re not having horrible side effects, it can be a really great option.\u201d\n\nWhile about half of my friends are dumping the pill in favor of IUDs, the other half have had serious commitments with the same oral contraceptives for years with little or no side effects. \u201cThere are some women who are very sensitive to the hormones and switch a variety of times and always have some type of side effect,\u201d says Dr. Goldberg of Planned Parenthood. \u201cThen, other women can tolerate most formulations without much difficulty.\u201d\n\nBecause most versions of the pill include both estrogen and progestin, it also has a number of health perks that you can\u2019t get from progestin-only or hormone-free methods, like IUDs or condoms. In fact, many women who don\u2019t actually need birth control take the pill for its other health benefits, like lighter periods and reduced cramping. Other benefits of the pill include some protection against: acne, PMS symptoms, iron deficiency anemia, endometrial and ovarian cancer, and additional health problems.\n\nWhen you stop taking the pill, you may lose these benefits. It\u2019s like flipping a coin. The benefits you got on the pill morph into the new side effects of being off it, whereas the side effects you had turn into benefits. The light, regular periods you had on the pill may be replaced by spotting and cramping, and your porcelain skin may turn into a pimply mess. But, on the flip side, your sex drive may return and your irritability may evaporate.\n\n\u201cAll these choices are a balance of risks and benefits,\u201d Dr. Kickham explains. Do the benefits tip the scale in the pill\u2019s favor, or are the side effects weighing you down like a bag of bricks? \u201cFor any medication, if the risks or negative side effects are outweighing the benefits, then they should consider other options,\u201d she says.\n\n3. You\u2019ll need to use another form of birth control. Immediately.\n\nProtection from an unwanted pregnancy is one crucial\u2014and obvious\u2014benefit of the pill that will vanish almost instantly. Just as acute side effects should stop in a couple days, the contraception will too.\n\n\u201cMost women resume ovulation pretty quickly after stopping the pill,\u201d Dr. Goldberg explains. \u201cSo, the most important thing for women to know is that when they stop the pill they are at risk for pregnancy almost immediately.\u201d It\u2019s crucial to find a new method as soon as possible without any gaps in coverage, she says.\n\n4. Your normal period might not return for a while.\n\nAlthough my teenage self would hate me for saying this, I actually looked forward to having a regular period when I went off the pill. The low-dose oral contraceptive that I had taken for the past three years made me stop having one all together. I waited for eight months. No period. I had no idea this wasn\u2019t normal at first. I just thought it was part of transitioning off the pill.\n\nAfter a number of doctor visits, blood tests and even a rather uncomfortable ultrasound, I was diagnosed with secondary amenorrhea\u2014the absence of menstruation. I had to take two weeks of progestin-only pills, then restart the pill for a month in order to \u201cjumpstart\u201d my hormones and ensure my body could cycle.\n\nI dropped the pill last September without knowing what changes to anticipate in my body. I eagerly welcomed most of them, but my unexpectedly absent period made me worry about fertility and my future. In fact, this surprising change was my impetus for writing this story.\n\nAccording to the experts I spoke with, if your period hasn\u2019t returned for three months after stopping the pill, you should visit your doctor, who can investigate other potential causes. I\u2019m not alone in my post-pill amenorrhea. It took one of my friends nine months to regain her period after stopping the pill.\n\nBut for most women, ovulation should resume in a few days and periods should return within a couple of months. \u201cIf you stop the pill and you don\u2019t get a regular period for a month or two, it\u2019s just a delayed menses\u2014give it a little more time,\u201d Dr. Goldberg says.\n\nEven if your period does return right away, it might be different. The pill often lightens bleeding and reduces cramping, while also making your periods more regular and predictable. According to Dr. Kickham, this is why many women love the pill.\n\nWhen you stop taking the pill, you may experience irregular periods for a few months or even years, especially if you had erratic menstruation pre-pill, says Judy Norsigian, executive director of Our Bodies, Ourselves. If you had heavy, crampy periods before the pill, they might also return when you go off.\n\n5. You may find yourself more interested in sex.\n\nLying down with a heating pad on your stomach is not the only thing you might be doing more of in bed. After discontinuing the pill, you may also find yourself wanting to get sexually intimate more often. The combination pill limits the amount of free testosterone in the blood, which creates anti-androgenic (\u201canti-masculine\u201d) symptoms in some women, including lower libido and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\u201cWhere the pill helps with acne and hair growth, some of my patients will come back saying \u2018I don\u2019t have the desire I used to and I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve noticed a difference,'\u201d Dr. Kickham explains. Other women may actually experience increased libido while on the pill because it reduces their anxiety about getting pregnant.\n\nSeveral studies over the past 30 years have found that oral contraceptives hinder sexual function by decreasing sexual interest and arousal, as well as the frequency of sexual intercourse and enjoyment. When you stop taking the pill there is more free testosterone in your system, so don\u2019t be surprised if you notice a big boost in your sex drive. Reminder of No. 3 above: You need new protection right away.\n\n6. Your skin may break out like a prepubescent teenager\u2019s.\n\nFor the first time in a while, you\u2019re not bloated or moody, and you\u2019re the one initiating sex. You\u2019re feeling confident and sexy\u2014like a million bucks. But then, a pimple pops up on your chin. Then, a few more. Soon, you feel like a prepubescent teen desperately trying every acne face wash and zit-zapper from the drugstore. So much for that boost in libido.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to me. After years of clear skin and a mostly pimple-free adolescence, a painful mess of cystic acne covered my chin and jaw\u2014often where hormonal acne appears in adults. The pill can help mitigate hormone-related symptoms like acne and hair growth, so when you stop taking it, these issues may, literally, surface.\n\nCue a visit to the dermatologist. After a couple months of very unsexy, painful acne, I finally got my skin under control with salicylic acid and spironolactone (a medication that reduces circulating androgens), but I\u2019m left with red acne marks and blotchy skin.\n\nSome women with post-pill acne may actually find out they have Polycystic Ovary Syndrome\u2014a common hormonal disorder often accompanied by acne. \u201cIf a woman has been on the pill for a long time, like 10 years, other pathologies could have developed and be unmasked when she comes off,\u201d says Dr. Goldberg. Say a woman had mild PCOS before going on the pill but wasn\u2019t diagnosed. The pill may help improve or control the symptoms of acne and irregular periods so much that the PCOS doesn\u2019t become apparent until she stops taking it a decade later, she says.\n\nFor many women, cystic acne is worse than any side effect they experience while taking the pill. For me, I\u2019d still rather apply an extra coat of concealer every morning than risk ruining my relationships because of my erratic mood swings and irritability.\n\n7. Your emotions and mood swings might get better\u2014or worse.\n\nAlthough this change is difficult to prove and slightly resembles a daytime talk-show confession, I finally feel like \u201cmyself\u201d since ditching the pill. I have more energy and excitement about school and my relationships, and don\u2019t find myself wanting to strangle a friend who asks about my day.\n\nAccording to Judy Norsigian, mood swings, depression and general brain \u201cfogginess\u201d are some major reasons women go off the pill and use other birth control methods.\n\nOn the other hand, women who use the pill to treat severe PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder may actually experience improvements in their mood while taking it. If they have mood fluctuations related to their natural cycle, the balancing effect of the pill\u2019s synthetic hormones can help, so mood issues may return when they go off, Dr. Kickham explains.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to predict who will respond in what way to the variety of pills,\u201d she says. \u201cFor instance, I\u2019ve definitely had people call me a couple weeks after starting the pill saying, \u2018I\u2019m crying all the time, I\u2019ve noticed a huge change in my mood.\u2019 So we have them come off it right away, immediately.\u201d\n\nSince the hormones metabolize out of the system within a couple days, your mood issues should improve once you go off the pill\u2014if it was actually to blame.\n\n8. You might still have side effects with your new method. (Sadly, it turns out there is no perfect birth control.)\n\nIf you\u2019re going off the pill and still need a birth control method, there are a number of other options to choose from. \u201cI usually just go through the whole list of contraceptives and try to decide with my patients what they\u2019re looking for based on their goals and their response to the pill,\u201d Dr. Kickham says.\n\nRegardless of the new method you\u2019re choosing, sadly, no birth control is perfect. Since both the patch and the vaginal ring contain a combination of estrogen and progestin, you might have similar side effects with these that you had on the pill, like breast tenderness and nausea.\n\nThe birth control shot, which injects progestin every three months, is associated with irregular bleeding and weight gain, as well as osteoporosis. Another of its biggest drawbacks is the inability to take the hormones back out once they\u2019re injected. Unlike the pill, the hormones will not metabolize out of the system until after the three months.\n\nThe implant, which is a matchstick-sized rod placed in your arm for up to three years, also releases only progestin. Since both the shot and implant don\u2019t release estrogen, you might miss out on some of its perks. For instance, you won\u2019t have the benefits of more regulated periods, reduced acne or protection against reproductive organ diseases, like endometrial cancer.\n\nThough it has its own cult following, even the IUD\u2014a T-shaped device placed in the uterus\u2014is also not without fault. The ParaGard, which does not release any hormones and works for up to 10 years, is associated with heavier and crampier periods. The hormonal IUDs, Mirena and Skyla, release progestin and last for three to five years. Unlike the ParaGard, they may lighten your period and actually get rid of it entirely. But on the flip side, IUDs don\u2019t provide the benefits linked to estrogen.\n\nAs with the pill, experts say you should stick with your new birth control method for at least three months as long as you\u2019re not experiencing any severe side effects, since it can take that long for your body to adjust.\n\nBottom line: It may take some trial and error to find the birth control method that works best for you. Next up for me: I\u2019m giving the Mirena IUD a shot. Maybe one day there will be a perfect birth control that works for everyone\u2014perhaps even one that\u2019s remote-controlled. Until then, it\u2019s all about weighing the costs and benefits, finding the best personal fit\u2014and being aware that side effects can crop up both when you start a method and when you stop.\n\nReaders, what\u2019s been your experience of going off the pill?
