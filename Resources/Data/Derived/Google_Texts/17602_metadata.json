They all strive to do one thing. No, not to sneer with the upper lip or even to gyrate their hips.\n\nThese entertainers strive to deliver some elements of what made Presley the best-selling solo artist of all time in the United States.\n\nRay Fischer, now 54, has been performing his \u201cVegas Elvis\u201d show for the past 20 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s more important, to \u201csound\u201d like Elvis or to \u201clook\u201d like him?\n\n\u201cYou gotta do both, or the audience won\u2019t buy it,\u201d says Fischer.\n\nBy day, Fischer works for Imagine Physical Therapy in North Charleston as the vice president of patient accounts.\n\nIn the beginning, Fischer admits he didn\u2019t really know all that much about Elvis. His first show was in the Horseshoe, an outside venue at MUSC. He had no back-up group. It was just him singing to a music track as traffic passed on Ashley Avenue.\n\nFischer says he was Elvis-esque but was very raw and not nearly as polished and proficient as he is today.\n\nSinging for those desperately sick children, though, totally changed his outlook. He also received an enlightened understanding of how people looked at him when he was Elvis.\n\nAlways on my mind\n\nFollowing his performance that day at MUSC, a little girl grabbed Ray\u2019s hand and insisted he visit some of her friends in the Children\u2019s Hospital. He said he would if it was OK with hospital officials.\n\nA few minutes later, he found himself in a cancer patient\u2019s room who had been unresponsive for more than two weeks. The child\u2019s mother asked him to sing \u201cLove Me Tender.\u201d\n\nBefore he finished that song, the desperately sick child opened her eyes and looked straight at him. Everyone in the room started to cry.\n\nA year later, Fischer was asked by a dad on Johns Island to visit his small, sick boy. This boy was an Elvis fan and the father thought it might raise his spirits.\n\nFischer put on the jumpsuit, the wig, the white boots ... the whole get-up and visited the little boy. Two weeks later, the boy died, and his father said the family placed a silk scarf in the small coffin.\n\nThe moves, facial expressions and mannerisms of Elvis are often duplicated by many tribute artists. Very few have taken the steps Fischer has made to go the extra mile.\n\nAre you lonesome tonight?\n\nThere are all kinds of ETAs around the world. There\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll Elvis,\u201d \u201cmilitary Elvis,\u201d \u201cleather Elvis\u201d and \u201cVegas Elvis.\u201d Fischer does nothing but \u201cVegas Elvis,\u201d the one that wears the jumpsuit.\n\nFischer just ordered a new suit. It\u2019s actually a creation of Presley\u2019s designer. Apparently, tribute artists still keep the designer in business.\n\nThere are eight of Fischer\u2019s previous \u201cElvis suits\u201d on sale on eBay.\n\nThe audience comes to see Fischer\u2019s shows with certain expectations. Fischer makes a point to interact with those fans by letting them touch the suit, feel the rings and receive a scarf.\n\nHe also requires that his musicians play their instruments just how Elvis\u2019 band played.\n\nEverything changes when Fischer slips into the white, rhinestone-covered jumpsuit. His voice deepens, his accent becomes a twinge more Southern and his entire persona is transformed.\n\nThe jet-black wig with sideburns tops it off.\n\nFischer continues to believe that the most important aspect of capturing Elvis is capturing the singer\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cNo matter how good the look, the sound or performance, his heart is what people react to.\u201d\n\nTribute artists take the stage all over the world. Some really look like Elvis, some really sound like him.\n\nI\u2019m not sure any of them have the heart of Elvis as much as Ray Fischer.\n\nThank ya, thank ya very much.\n\nReach Warren Peper at peperwarren@gmail.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tribute artist Ray Fischer has heart of Elvis, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nArts & Travel, \r\nWarren Peper, \r\nWarren Peper, Elvis Presley,entertainer  ,Medical University of South Carolina,Ray Fischer,tribute artist", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Elvis Presley left the building 38 years ago, but his music never did.", "title": "Tribute artist Ray Fischer has heart of Elvis", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150606/150609550/tribute-artist-ray-fischer-has-heart-of-elvis", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1201/150609550/AR/0/AR-150609550.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1201/150609550/AR/0/AR-150609550.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Elvis Presley left the building 38 years ago, but his music never did.", "title": "Tribute artist Ray Fischer has heart of Elvis", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1201/150609550/AR/0/AR-150609550.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150609550}}, "keywords": "Tribute artist Ray Fischer has heart of Elvis , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nArts & Travel, \r\nWarren Peper, \r\nWarren Peper, Elvis Presley,entertainer  ,Medical University of South Carolina,Ray Fischer,tribute artist", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T13:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T16:38:00Z", "author": "Warren Peper"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Elvis Presley left the building 38 years ago, but his music never did."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca525\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll Elvis,\u201d \u201cmilitary Elvis,\u201d \u201cleather Elvis\u201d and \u201cVegas Elvis.\u201d Fischer does nothing but \u201cVegas Elvis,\u201d the one that wears the jumpsuit.\nRay Fischer, now 54, has been performing his \u201cVegas Elvis\u201d show for the past 20 years.\nThere are thousands of ETAs (Elvis tribute artists) around the world.\nI\u2019m not sure any of them have the heart of Elvis as much as Ray Fischer.\nThe moves, facial expressions and mannerisms of Elvis are often duplicated by many tribute artists."}
