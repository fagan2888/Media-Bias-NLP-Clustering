A litany of code violations leads to complaints and questions about a small home in Southeast Oklahoma City.

The home is located in the 1000 block of South Fairmont Street, and is littered with trash and debris. Several neighbors say an elderly woman named Shirley lives there, but it’s not her fault. Neighbors say a younger family member has caused the problems.

Since last December, Oklahoma City Spokesperson Kristy Yager says the city’s fielded 35 complaints about the condition of the property, which has resulted in 14 code violations.

“That many calls in one year on one property is absolutely unusual and it’s a big problem for that neighborhood,” said Yager.

Viola Morris is one of several neighbors concerned for Shirley. “She’s worked all her life to have this house. She took care of a handicapped child just to have this house, so she would have somewhere to live.”

News 9 tried to contact Shirley, the homeowner, but nobody answered the front door.
