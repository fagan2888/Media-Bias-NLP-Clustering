Nuisance issues represent everything that\u2019s wrong with political discourse \u2013 because they prey on people who don\u2019t know any better.\n\nWhich again \u2026 is why the tents of the nullification circus have pitched in South Carolina.\n\nAnyway, we have come to recognize the ongoing \u201cdebate\u201d over nullification as a nuisance issue \u2013 and have exposed it as such on several prior occasions (HERE, HERE and HERE).\n\nWait \u2026 does that mean we are for Obamacare?\n\nHa!\n\nHell no \u2026 FITS has been fighting this law for the past five years, opposing it at literally every stage of its tortured evolution. But we don\u2019t need to recant the litany of our anti-Obamacare credentials in this post \u2026 there are literally hundreds of articles on this website attesting to it.\n\nOur problem \u2013 as we\u2019ve repeated ad nauseam \u2013 is that the so-called \u201cObamacare nullification\u201d bill currently moving before the S.C. General Assembly doesn\u2019t actually nullify Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of an important point, don\u2019t you think?\n\nSeriously, if you\u2019re going to lure a cadre of hunched-over geriatrics (a.k.a. \u201cactivists\u201d) out from the assisted living community to the S.C. State House \u2013 at least have legitimate reason.\n\nAfter all, oxygen tanks are heavy \u2026\n\nAs we noted in one of our exclusive reports on this issue, a key player in the Obamacare nullification \u201cmovement\u201d is Jesse Graston \u2013 who represents the John Birch Society (and possibly the interests of other entities).\n\nGraston has been a primary driver of this legislation \u2013 drafting language, organizing \u201crallies,\u201d working lawmakers, etc. \u2013 but as we\u2019ve noted previously his motivation for all of that work has nothing do with ideology.\n\nShortly after we began posting about Graston, sources in Florida began lighting us up with information about his past in the Sunshine State \u2013 specifically a 2006 bust on charges of soliciting for prostitution and the always enjoyable \u201cexposing sexual organs in a vulgar/ indecent manner\u201d charge.\n\n\u201cWanking,\u201d in other words \u2026\n\n(More on that HERE and HERE).\n\nLook, this website isn\u2019t going to begrudge anybody for (allegedly) soliciting sex. We\u2019ve made our views on prostitution perfectly clear: We think it should be legal.\n\nBut Graston is a guy who endorsed former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for president in 2008 because of \u201chis moral fiber.\u201d\n\nHmmmmm \u2026\n\nAt the end of the day we care less about inconsistencies in Graston\u2019s past private life than we do about deliberate misrepresentations in his present public persona \u2013 but there\u2019s a fundamental hypocrisy about political animals like him that troubles us.\n\nGraston doesn\u2019t care about nullifying Obamacare. If he did, he would have written/ lobbied for a bill doing that.\n\nHe cares about one thing: The interests of whichever entity is paying him to fool impressionable South Carolinians into thinking their state is about to nullify Obamacare.\n\nAnd that\u2019s dangerous \u2026\n\nIf Graston had written a straight up Obamacare nullification bill \u2013 like the original legislation filed by S.C. Rep. Bill Chumley \u2013 we\u2019d be happy to have a debate on its merits. Hell, Graston might even find us outflanking him to the right.\n\nAs it stands, though, he\u2019s just wasting everyone\u2019s time \u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2014/03/03/nullification-wanker-shall-lead/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/graston-605x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Nullification: \u201cAnd A Wanker Shall Lead Them\u201d"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda362\"", "article_summary": "Our problem \u2013 as we\u2019ve repeated ad nauseam \u2013 is that the so-called \u201cObamacare nullification\u201d bill currently moving before the S.C.
