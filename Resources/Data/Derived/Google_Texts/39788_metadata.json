In a TED-Ed video, Nina Tandon, a tissue engineering researcher and CEO of New York City-based company EpiBone, explains that growing your own bones is possible by regenerating a person\u2019s own multi-potent stem cells, a process that may save many lives.\n\nBones have the ability to reconstruct, but there are certain situations like cancer removal, traumatic accidents, and genetic defects that can exceed the body\u2019s natural ability for repair. In the U.S., there are more than 900,000 allografts, bone or soft tissue transplants, performed, according to the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation. These allografts are done either with the patient\u2019s own tissue, requiring two surgeries, or with synthetic or donated material such as metal or animal bones, which the patient\u2019s body sometimes rejects.\n\nTandon and her colleagues suggest the solution to these problems may lie within simply viewing the body as a renewable resource of stem cells that can regenerate new parts as needed. Growing a bone made from a patient\u2019s own cells that\u2019s customizable to the exact shape of the hole may be possible by first extracting stem cells from a patient\u2019s fat tissue, followed by CT scans to determine the exact dimensions of the missing bone.\n\nSurgeons would then model the exact shape of the hole by either using 3D printers or by carving decellurized cow bones. The cells of these cow bones have been stripped away and only contain a sponge-like mineral lattice. The patient\u2019s stem cells would then be added to the lattice and placed in the bioreactor \u2014 a device that will simulate all of the conditions found inside the body.\n\nIn order for this part of the process to be successful, temperature, humidity, acidity, and nutrient composition need to be exact for the stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts \u2014 specialized bone-forming cells that deposit more mineral, giving bones their strength \u2014 and other cells. The mineral lattice is then colonized and remodeled with living tissue. Lastly, to avoid the artificial bone from coming out weak and brittle, the bioreactor constantly pumps fluid throughout the bone as the pressure tells the osteoblasts to add more density.\n\nAccording to Tandon, within three weeks, the living bone is ready to come out of the bioreactor and be implanted into the patient\u2019s body.\n\nTandon\u2019s idea has already been successful on animals. Back in March, Epibone conducted a study that involved implanting grown cheekbones into 16 pigs at Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine. Tandon and her colleagues chose pigs because they have a very similar-sized head to humans and use the bone (temporomandibular) in a similar way.\n\nDue to the success of lab-grown bones implanted in pigs and other animals, Tandon says human trials may begin as soon as 2016.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "stem, cells, cow, bones, and, other, materials, may, soon, be, combined, bioreactor, grow, human", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The future of bone transplants may lie in harvesting stem cells into healthy living human bones.", "title": "Growing Human Bones Outside Of The Body [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/stem-cells-cow-bones-and-other-materials-may-soon-be-combined-bioreactor-grow-human-340564", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/30/stem-cells-cow-bones-and-other-materials-may-soon-be-combined-bioreactor-grow-human.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The future of bone transplants may lie in harvesting stem cells into healthy living human bones.", "title": "Growing Human Bones Outside Of The Body [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/stem-cells-cow-bones-and-other-materials-may-soon-be-combined-bioreactor-grow-human-340564", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/30/stem-cells-cow-bones-and-other-materials-may-soon-be-combined-bioreactor-grow-human.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/30/stem-cells-cow-bones-and-other-materials-may-soon-be-combined-bioreactor-grow-human.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-03T13:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-03T13:00:03-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The future of bone transplants may lie in harvesting stem cells into healthy living human bones."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc62a\"", "article_summary": "The patient\u2019s stem cells would then be added to the lattice and placed in the bioreactor \u2014 a device that will simulate all of the conditions found inside the body.\nDue to the success of lab-grown bones implanted in pigs and other animals, Tandon says human trials may begin as soon as 2016.\nThe cells of these cow bones have been stripped away and only contain a sponge-like mineral lattice.\nTandon and her colleagues suggest the solution to these problems may lie within simply viewing the body as a renewable resource of stem cells that can regenerate new parts as needed.\nSurgeons would then model the exact shape of the hole by either using 3D printers or by carving decellurized cow bones."}
