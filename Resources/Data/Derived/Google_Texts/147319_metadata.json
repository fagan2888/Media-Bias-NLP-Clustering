Economics professors Leslie Muller and Paul Isely surveyed local businesses in Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon and Allegan counties.\n\n\u201cConservatively, there would be 1,000 more workers today in Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon and Allegan counties if not for the ACA,\u201d Muller said. \u201cThis is not even taking into effect the decrease in hours firms are making to keep employees at part-time.\u201d\n\nThe report found 49 percent of firms already have increased employees\u2019 share of health care costs. Of those shifting costs:\n\n\u2022 37 percent are using high-deductible plans\n\n\u2022 30 percent are changing prescription drug coverage\n\nIn changes to hiring, the report found employers made the following changes:\n\n\u2022 15 percent increased use of temporary workers\n\n\u2022 22 percent plan to reduce or limit hiring\n\n\u2022 29 percent have limited employee hours\n\nThe full report can be found on GVSU\u2019s website.\n\nRelated: Medical patents, binge drinking, outpatient visits all rising in West Michigan\n\nSue Thoms covers health care for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.
