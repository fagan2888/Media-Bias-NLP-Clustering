Milwaukee police are dealing with a rash of shootings which have left at least 10 people wounded and three dead in less than a week. Four people were shot and one of them died Friday night. Officers were called to the city’s north side at about 9:30 p-m to a shooting scene where a 27-year-old man was dead. Just a few minutes before that call, police had responded to the location where a 51-year-old man had been shot in an alley during an apparent robbery. He was expected to survive. Another shooting victim – a 16-year-old girl – was wounded while she was sitting in her home.

U.S. Senator Ron Johnson says he feels compelled to do everything he can to challenge the president’s executive actions. The Wisconsin Republican from Oshkosh plans to appeal the dismissal of his lawsuit challenging rules requiring members of Congress and their staff members to get their subsidized health insurance coverage through small-business exchanges. A federal judge ruled last month that Johnson and an aide didn’t have legal standing to bring their court action because they hadn’t been injured. Johnson argues the Affordable Care Act has been changed by the rules to make sure members of Congress and their staffs are placed above the American people by the health insurance subsidies they receive.

Researchers at the University of Minnesota are conducting an experiment on the Mississippi River near Genoa to see if an underwater speaker system could possibly repel the invasive Asian carp. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has cleared the way for the study at a lock on the river. The owner of a fishing business nearby has voiced concerns the sounds from the speakers might affect the migration of native fish species. The owner of Clements Fishing Barge says that could mean millions of dollars in lost business. One expert with the DNR says it may be too late. Asian carp have been caught near the mouth of the St. Croix River and the high-water conditions earlier this summer may have helped them migrate north.
