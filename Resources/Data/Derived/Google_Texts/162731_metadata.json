No need to single out that dreary evening; the ritual partisan dance where one side cheers while the other pouts is a staple of State of the Union speeches.\n\nSo it was interesting to see the assembled pols, on their Sunday-best behavior as Pope Francis \u2013 appearing well-versed on their chronic gridlock and dysfunction \u2013 gentle admonished the members that \u201cwe must move forward together, as one.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, it seemed as if they might be listening. The usual partisan posturing and snark were replaced by what seemed to be genuine emotion at the sight and sound of a true spiritual leader. Democrat Congressman John Lewis, an iconic civil rights activist from the 1960s, was openly moved by the Pope\u2019s tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, the son of immigrants, teared up when the Pope talked immigration.\n\nWhy can\u2019t our politicians behave more like this when the Holy Father isn\u2019t there to chaperon?\n\nFor ideologues like Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, anything short of total validation of their pet positions is unacceptable, even from the Pope.\n\nPitts said afterwards he was disappointed the pope \u201cdidn\u2019t use his forum to speak on behalf of the unborn,\u201d even though the pontiff called for protection of human life \u201cat every stage of development.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact is, Congress is jam-packed with people afraid to do anything \u2013 like, say, compromise \u2013 that might cost them their seat.\n\n\u201cA good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces,\u201d said Pope Francis.\n\nBut it\u2019s fear of losing their space by alienating the voters, special-interest groups and donors who put them there that drive DC these days. And it isn\u2019t likely that a few hours of good feeling engendered by the Pope\u2019s persona will leave a dent in that.\n\nYou can listen to Keller At Large on WBZ News Radio every weekday at 7:55 a.m. You can also watch Jon on WBZ-TV News weeknights at 11 p.m.\n\nEmail Jon at keller@wbztv.com or reach him on Twitter @kelleratlarge.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jon Keller says Pope Francis' message to members of Congress is an effort in futility.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/09/24/keller-large-pope-francis-futile-message-to-congress/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/popecongress.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/popecongress.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Jon Keller says Pope Francis' message to members of Congress is an effort in futility.", "title": "Keller @ Large: Pope Francis\u2019 Futile Message To Congress"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsboston.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/popecongress.jpg?w=625", "description": "Jon Keller says Pope Francis' message to members of Congress is an effort in futility.", "site": "CBSboston", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Keller @ Large: Pope Francis\u2019 Futile Message To Congress"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Boston News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Boston's Best", "msvalidate.01": "FDD12CE797EAB78953FDE9ACF7F312A5", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Boston", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSBoston"}, "keywords": "jon keller, pope francis, keller @ large, congress", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://boston.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/72ff1baf55fe94c284ce5747d8d4a96e?s=16", "news_keywords": "congress, jon keller, keller @ large, pope francis"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing spaces,\u201d said Pope Francis.\nBOSTON (CBS) \u2014 You know how it normally goes when the US House and Senate gather in joint session to hear a speech.\nAnd it isn\u2019t likely that a few hours of good feeling engendered by the Pope\u2019s persona will leave a dent in that.\nFor ideologues like Rep.
