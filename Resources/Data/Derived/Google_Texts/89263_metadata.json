Here\u2019s reaction from executive director Anthony Wright of Health Access California, the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition:\n\nNO RESTORATIONS TO RECESSION-ERA CUTS IN THE HEALTH BUDGET: \u201cThe Governor\u2019s proposal continues many recession-era cuts to health and human services. California needs a better balance between preparing for the possibility of the next recession and the unfinished work of undoing the damage from the last recession. After $15 billion in HHS cuts, it\u2019s high time to restore cuts to Medi-Cal benefits and rates and other public health programs,\u201d said Wright. \u201cCalifornia should invest in removing barriers to coverage, ensuring Medi-Cal patients have access to benefits and providers, and extending care to the remaining uninsured.\u201d\n\nCONTINUING THE PROGRESS UNDER HEALTH REFORM: \u201cCalifornians should be proud of the progress our health system has made under the Affordable Care Act and, starting Monday, for the Medi-Cal expansion to all children regardless of immigration status. We should continue the momentum to improve the health system on which we all rely,\u201d said Wright. \u201cWe appreciate that this budget delays shifting new legal immigrants from Medi-Cal to Covered California until technical and administrative issues are resolved, which will prevent some of these individuals from inadvertently losing coverage.\u201d\n\nESTATE RECOVERY: \u201cThis budget does not address some key policy issuses, such as Medi-Cal estate recovery. It\u2019s disappointing the budget does not remove the estate recovery provision that discourages patients from signing up for Medi-Cal coverage. The Governor previously vetoed a bill to limit Medi-Cal estate recovery, arguing the policy change should be done in the budget instead. We will vigorously pursue this change, so some older Californians won\u2019t need to fear that their loved ones will lose the family home as a result of signing up for health coverage,\u201d said Wright. SB 33 (Hernandez), which would limit Medi-Cal estate recovery, is pending in the Assembly.\n\nIMMIGRANT HEALTH CARE: \u201cWe should build on the commitment to care for all California children made in last year\u2019s budget, and we will continue to push this year for all Californians to have access to coverage, regardless of immigration status,\u201d said Wright. \u201cImmigrants are a vital part of our community and economy and should be fully included in our health system.\u201d SB 1418 (Lara), which would extend access to health care to all Californians regardless of immigration status, is pending in the Assembly.\n\nREVENUES ON THE BALLOT THIS FALL: \u201cWe haven\u2019t restored the cuts made since the last recession\u2013it\u2019s imperative that voters this fall prevent additional cuts to HHS programs by extending existing upper-income taxes, and allowing California to make needed investments in health care with revenues from a tobacco tax. By extending the existing rate on high-income earners and increasing the tobacco tax, Californians can prevent cuts to vital services and make the investments needed in the health care system on which we all rely.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Budget continues recession-era cuts to HHS, without restorations to public health programs, Medi-Cal benefits,\u00a0and Medicaid provider reimbursement rates...", "og": {"site_name": "State of Reform", "description": "Earlier today, Governor Jerry Brown released the May Revision to the proposed 2016-17 state budget, which continues California\u2019s \u2026", "title": "CA budget revision continues reform progress and recession-era cuts to health", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/stor-thumb-health-access.jpg", "url": "http://stateofreform.com/issues/medicaid/2016/05/31007/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Budget continues recession-era cuts to HHS, without restorations to public health programs, Medi-Cal benefits,\u00a0and Medicaid provider reimbursement rates...", "creator": "@StateofReform", "image": "http://stateofreform.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/stor-thumb-health-access.jpg", "title": "CA budget revision continues reform progress and recession-era cuts to health - State of Reform", "site": "@StateofReform", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 17821687}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/stateofreform/", "section": "California", "published_time": "2016-05-13T13:25:10+00:00"}, "OBKey": "12RjP7ip2KRyl5dliGRkEQ==", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Here\u2019s reaction from executive director Anthony Wright of Health Access California, the statewide health care consumer advocacy coalition:NO RESTORATIONS TO RECESSION-ERA CUTS IN THE HEALTH BUDGET: \u201cThe Governor\u2019s proposal continues many recession-era cuts to health and human services.\nAfter $15 billion in HHS cuts, it\u2019s high time to restore cuts to Medi-Cal benefits and rates and other public health programs,\u201d said Wright.\nIt\u2019s disappointing the budget does not remove the estate recovery provision that discourages patients from signing up for Medi-Cal coverage.\nThe Governor previously vetoed a bill to limit Medi-Cal estate recovery, arguing the policy change should be done in the budget instead.\nBy extending the existing rate on high-income earners and increasing the tobacco tax, Californians can prevent cuts to vital services and make the investments needed in the health care system on which we all rely.\u201d"}
