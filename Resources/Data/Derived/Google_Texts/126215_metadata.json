He was the skilled manager who could identify problems, root out dysfunction and make anything work better. The guy who rescued the Olympics. The guy who led the search for his co-worker\u2019s missing daughter. The Romney pitch was, in large part, about being manager-in-chief. It was a pitch with little policy content.\n\nThat didn\u2019t fly in 2012. But it might actually work pretty well in 2016.\n\nThe 2012 election had to be about the big \u201cwhat is government for?\u201d questions because huge policy decisions loomed in 2013. The Affordable Care Act would be implemented, or not; parts of the Bush tax cuts would expire, or not; entitlements would be greatly reformed in an effort to shrink deficits, or not. A large fiscal adjustment was needed, if not right away, sometime within the next few years.\n\nWhichever candidate won was going to have a lot of power to determine the shape of the federal government for years to come, so he had to talk about what he would have the government do.\n\nBarack Obama defended the principle that government ought to take a strong and active role in the economy, by using fiscal policy to offset the effects of recessions, by regulating the financial sector more tightly, by offering a near-universal health care entitlement, and by taxing the rich more.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Romney proved an awkward messenger for Republicans\u2019 big idea that the government should tax and spend less, and not discourage people from working and supporting themselves. The \u201c47 percent\u201d speech \u2014 essentially, a declaration that we\u2019d have to grow the economy by making Americans less lazy \u2014 was the clearest example of Mr. Romney offering a big-picture vision that did not sell.\n\nThat failure sounds like a good reason for Mr. Romney not to run again. But in 2016, he might actually be able to bracket the big ideological questions and run on the small stuff.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe big questions from 2012 mostly got resolved in 2013. Tax rates went up, the spending cuts known as sequestration went into effect, and the Affordable Care Act is proceeding. The federal budget deficit has fallen below $500 billion, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that the national debt will be stable as a share of the economy over the next decade. As a result, Congress will probably leave the federal budget more or less on autopilot for the next several years.\n\nThe health act has already been de-emphasized in 2014 midterm campaigns, in part because the existence of popular provisions in the law makes it awkward for Republicans to demand repeal without specifying a clear replacement.\n\nWhile \u201cwhat will government do?\u201d was very much an open question in 2012, greater policy certainty means there will be more room to run on \u201cI\u2019ll be a better manager\u201d in 2016. That will be especially true if the news continues to be dominated by stories of managerial and technical failure in the government.\n\nHealthcare.gov was plagued by \u201cglitches.\u201d The Secret Service let a man with an arrest record and a gun get in an elevator with the president, and a man with a knife get near the Obamas\u2019 private residence. The Department of Veteran Affairs failed to provide timely medical care to sick veterans, then falsified records to hide that fact. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was overwhelmed by a surge of child migrants. The administration has faced criticism on coordinating response to Ebola in West Africa.\n\nEven the big scandal obsessions of the conservative fever swamps \u2014 the Benghazi attack, the I.R.S. scandals and Fast & Furious \u2014 are, after you strip away the conspiracy theories, fundamentally stories about managerial failure. And while foreign policy debates obviously have huge ideological components, there\u2019s a lot of room for dissatisfaction with this administration\u2019s execution on its strategies in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nWhether the increase in gaffes is real or just perceived, there have been a lot of news stories that might lead voters to say, \u201cGee, this looks like the sort of problem Mitt Romney might have handled better.\u201d\n\nOf course, to get to the point of making this case in a general election, Mr. Romney would first have to be renominated. The Republicans haven\u2019t renominated a losing presidential candidate since Richard Nixon in 1968, but then, no losing Republican nominee has sought renomination during that time either.\n\nIn most of the last 50 years, there has been a clear heir apparent for the Republican nomination, whether a sitting vice president or a runner-up in a former primary campaign. The existence of a strong next-in-line candidate has been one reason not to try again. In this case, nobody is next in line. Especially if Jeb Bush does not run for the nomination, the Republican establishment figures who backed Mr. Romney in the last campaign will have no obvious place to go, putting him in an unusually good spot to seek renomination.\n\nCandidates run all the time on airy ideas about leadership and competence, and win. Look at Rick Snyder\u2019s election as governor of Michigan in 2010, or Mr. Romney\u2019s own election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002. It\u2019s standard to say Washington is \u201cdysfunctional,\u201d but that can mean several different things. If people mean the government has the wrong priorities, Mr. Romney has already shown his difficulty in convincing voters he has the right ones. But if people mean the government is not executing well on the priorities it has, Mr. Romney may find himself on favorable ground.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141010065322, "twitter": {"description": "The loser in the 2012 race has never been a big ideas guy, but the next presidential election might just be small enough for him to win.", "title": "Why 2016 May Be Mitt Romney\u2019s Year", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/upshot/why-2016-may-be-mitt-romneys-year.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003165468"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jbarro", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/09UP-Romney/09UP-Romney-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/upshot/why-2016-may-be-mitt-romneys-year.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003165468", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/upshot/why-2016-may-be-mitt-romneys-year.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 10, 2014", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Romney  Mitt,Republican Party,Presidential Election of 2016,Presidential Election of 2012", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Josh Barro", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/09UP-Romney/09UP-Romney-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Romney, Mitt", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By JOSH BARRO", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The loser in the 2012 race has never been a big ideas guy, but the next presidential election might just be small enough for him to win.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/09UP-Romney/09UP-Romney-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "The loser in the 2012 race has never been a big ideas guy, but the next presidential election might just be small enough for him to win.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/josh_barro/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2014-10-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Presidential Election of 2012", "published": "2014-10-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "11up-romney", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20141010104806, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/upshot/why-2016-may-be-mitt-romneys-year.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/upshot/09UP-Romney/09UP-Romney-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The loser in the 2012 race has never been a big ideas guy, but the next presidential election might just be small enough for him to win.", "title": "Why 2016 May Be Mitt Romney\u2019s Year"}, "pdate": 20141010, "des": "Presidential Election of 2012", "articleid": 100000003165468, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Why 2016 May Be Mitt Romney\u2019s Year", "col": "Manager-in-Chief", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c09\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Romney\u2019s case for himself was heavily bound up in his careers in consulting and private equity.\nLook at Rick Snyder\u2019s election as governor of Michigan in 2010, or Mr. Romney\u2019s own election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002.\nOne of the main problems with Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential candidacy was that it was never clear what he wanted to do if elected.\nBut if people mean the government is not executing well on the priorities it has, Mr. Romney may find himself on favorable ground.\nIf people mean the government has the wrong priorities, Mr. Romney has already shown his difficulty in convincing voters he has the right ones."}
