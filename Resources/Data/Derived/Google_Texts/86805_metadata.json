Time is running out before the ball drops in Times Square and ushers in 2016. That means it\u2019s time to make some key last-minute financial fixes to clear your money plate. Here are six moves you can make before saying good-bye to 2015:\n\n1. Mind your interest rates.\n\nWith the Federal Reserve set on gradually increasing a key benchmark rate, higher interest rates are on the 2016 horizon. If you have a home equity line of credit, or HELOC, with an adjustable rate, ask your lender now to fix the interest rate on the amount you have already borrowed. That way, any rate increase would only affect future borrowing.\n\nSimilarly, if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, it\u2019s time to ask a loan officer or mortgage broker about your options for refinancing before the rate adjusts higher.\n\nPay off your credit cards, which typically have variable interest rates. Otherwise, you\u2019ll soon be paying a higher rate to reflect the Fed\u2019s most recent rate hike, says Neil Waxman, a certified financial planner at Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio. If you can't pay down the entire balances, start shopping for a credit card that offers a 0-percent balance transfer for a year or longer.\n\nRelated: The Fed Just Raised Rates. Here\u2019s What It Means for Your Money\n\n2. Reassess your investments.\n\nThe markets\u2014stocks, bonds, oil and everything in between\u2014had a volatile year and have likely changed the mix of asset classes within investment portfolios. That means you should review and rebalance your portfolios to stay in line with your risk tolerance.\n\n\u201cPeriodic rebalancing allows investors to take advantage of market volatility by trimming positions that have recently run up in value and adding to positions that are currently out of favor with investors,\u201d says Benjamin Smith, a wealth manager at Wealthcare Solutions in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. \u201cOver the long-term, this is a winning strategy.\u201d\n\nWith that said, don\u2019t dump stocks simply because of volatility; instead, think long-term, says Waxman. For example, don\u2019t ditch foreign stocks in developed and emerging markets because of recent subpar returns because \u201cthose asset classes present higher projected returns over the next decade,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\n3. Make sure everything is up to date.\n\nFamilies change from one year to the next. Marriages, births, divorces and deaths all happen and can change the particulars of your finances. Review your life and disability insurance policies to make sure they keep up with a growing family. Update beneficiaries on insurance and retirement accounts and make changes to wills, powers of attorney and health proxies to reflect new family circumstances.\n\nRelated: 7 Money-Saving Tax Moves to Make Before 2016\n\nIf you renovated your home this year, make sure your homeowner\u2019s policy reflects the increase in your house\u2019s value.\n\n4. Spend down your health care FSA.\n\nDon\u2019t lose tax-free dollars in your flexible spending account because you didn\u2019t spend them before year-end. Stock up on the following FSA eligible items that don\u2019t require a prescription from a doctor: athletic treatments/braces, bandages, first-aid kits, condoms and other OTC contraceptives, and contact lenses and solution. Consider getting a new pair of glasses or another set of dentures. Or, visit a chiropractor or acupuncturist.\n\nIf your employer offers a grace period through the first two and a half months of next year, call your primary care doctor, dentist and eye doctor to set up check-ups in January or February for you and your family. Pay for the check-ups with your FSA money.\n\n5. Review automatic bills.\n\nCheck your recent credit card statements for any automatic subscriptions and make sure you still want them, says Pamela Sandy, president-elect of The Financial Planning Association. Often, people sign up for a free trial period for a service and forget to cancel it. Review your cable, wireless and cellphone bills, too. Give each provider a call to request a lower rate for the new year, especially if you can show a better deal from a competitor.\n\nRelated: The $5 Stocking Stuffer That Keeps on Giving\n\n6. Have a plan for extra money.\n\nTis the season of pleasant surprises, whether it\u2019s an unexpected bonus from your boss or a generous holiday check from Aunt Ida. Workers who earn more than $118,500 also will get a bigger paycheck near the end of the year after maxing out Social Security contributions for 2015. In these cases, know where you want to put the extra cash\u2014paying Christmas bills, toward a vacation next year or into savings for an emergency fund. Whatever you do, have a plan, so you don\u2019t blow your windfall.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Tick tock, tick tock.", "title": "6 Money Moves to Make Before Midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/6-Money-Moves-Make-Midnight-New-Year-s-Eve", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12152010_NewYears_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/22/6-Money-Moves-Make-Midnight-New-Year-s-Eve", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/12152010_NewYears_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Tick tock, tick tock.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "With the Federal Reserve set on gradually increasing a key benchmark rate, higher interest rates are on the 2016 horizon.\nMind your interest rates.\nOtherwise, you\u2019ll soon be paying a higher rate to reflect the Fed\u2019s most recent rate hike, says Neil Waxman, a certified financial planner at Capital Advisors in Shaker Heights, Ohio.\nPay off your credit cards, which typically have variable interest rates.\nThat means it\u2019s time to make some key last-minute financial fixes to clear your money plate."}
