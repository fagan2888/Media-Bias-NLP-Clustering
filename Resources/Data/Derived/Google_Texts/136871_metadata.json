It was about liberal overreach\u2013the stimulus, Obamacare, over-taxation, over-regulation, and we know what the result was. That set off this counterreaction called the Tea Party. And what we\u2019re seeing now six years later is an election that\u2019s not only about ideology. It is a rejection of hyper-liberalism, but there\u2019s now an overlay of sheer incompetence.\n\nKrauthammer\u2019s predictions came as Americans have been signaling that they don\u2019t trust huge portions of the government, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Secret Service.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that [Democrats] are the party in government, they are the party of government,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201c[Yet] they can\u2019t run the d**n thing! And that\u2019s why there\u2019s this huge resentment against the Democratic Party and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve got to start calling people names.\u201d\n\nOne of those names: racist.\n\nKrauthammer offered his advice for Republicans who get hit with the rhetorical charge of racism:\n\nI think that when you\u2019re accused of being a racist, you don\u2019t even dignify the accusation with a response because then you\u2019re conceding the premise. I have to prove I\u2019m not a racist. I oppose the president because of his policies, I have since the beginning of his administration. If someone wants to imply it\u2019s on account of his race, I will not give them the dignity of a response. That\u2019s not America.\n\n(H/T: Mediaite)\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Zach Noble (@thezachnoble) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The best response might be no response at all.
