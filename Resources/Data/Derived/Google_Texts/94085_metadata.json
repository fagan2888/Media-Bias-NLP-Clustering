But at a recent advisory committee meeting, broker Chris McKiernan, of Abercrombie, Burns and McKeirnan, said the advent of the Affordable Care Act has reduced competition for small business health care, because of the new coverage rules for small group plans.\n\nMcKiernan also said he hasn\u2019t sold a single SHOP plan to his clients. \"It certainly wasn\u2019t ready for prime time last year, for a variety of reasons,\" he told the meeting. \"Plan summaries weren\u2019t ready; the tax credit was very difficult to try to talk to our clients about; and even with the potential of a tax credit, many of them were somewhat nervous, because they associated Access Health CT as a government agency.\"\n\nTim Pusch, a broker at Burns, Brooks and McNeil, said the whole new health insurance structure is proving disruptive to employer insurance. \"I already have experienced groups saying, I\u2019m not going to offer a group plan anymore; let my employees go and buy their own,\" he said, \"which I know was not the intention of Congress, to encourage employers to stop offering medical plans. But it is an unintended consequence to some degree, and I believe we may see more of it in this upcoming renewal season.\u201d\n\nThe SHOP committee said it's developing new marketing and outreach programs to employers, and it will be publicizing improved plan designs. SHOP programs will also be available to companies with up to 100 employees in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business", "description": "The state\u2019s health insurance marketplace has been congratulated for its success in getting individuals enrolled, but insurance brokers say small businesses", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/connecticut-health-care-programs-meet-resistance-among-small-businesses", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201403/Health_insurance_paperwork.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The state\u2019s health insurance marketplace has been congratulated for its success in getting individuals enrolled, but insurance brokers say small businesses", "title": "Connecticut Health Care Programs Meet Resistance Among Small Businesses"}, "story_id": 354102579, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@wnpr"}, "author": "Harriet Jones", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Connecticut Health Care Programs Meet Resistance Among Small Businesses"}, "nid": 29498, "datePublished": "2014-10-06", "keywords": "The Daily, Connecticut, Access Health CT, small business, health care, insurance", "wordCount": 337, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7e2\"", "article_summary": "The state\u2019s health insurance marketplace has been congratulated for its success in getting individuals enrolled, but insurance brokers say small businesses aren\u2019t signing up.\nTim Pusch, a broker at Burns, Brooks and McNeil, said the whole new health insurance structure is proving disruptive to employer insurance.\nConnecticut launched its SHOP program last year, ahead of many states, with the intention of providing more choices for small businesses.\nSHOP programs will also be available to companies with up to 100 employees in 2016.\nMcKiernan also said he hasn\u2019t sold a single SHOP plan to his clients."}
