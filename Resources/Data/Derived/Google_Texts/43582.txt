WATCH: Billy Eichner Plays the Game 'Obamacare or Shut Up!'

Billy on the Street host Billy Eichner quizzes actress Olivia Wilde on how much a former television doctor (remember her on House M.D.?) knows about Obamacare. In the game, "Obamacare or Shut Up!" Wilde is given 90 seconds to determine whether Eichner's fast-talking factoids are about the Affordable Care Act or just annoying pop-culture references. "Gwenyth Paltrow is in a new movie about sex addiction." Shut up!
