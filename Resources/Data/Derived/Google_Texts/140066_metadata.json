Then they get free medical care and in-state tuition. (Not really, but who knows what the future holds?)\n\nBut neither federal law nor an empty treasury is stopping California State Sen. Ricardo Lara from submitting a bill that will cover illegals. Under Lara\u2019s proposal, illegals would be allowed to apply for coverage under Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s home-grown Medicaid plan.\n\nIllegals making $32,000 a year with a family of four would get free coverage. Make more than that and the family could experience the joys of buying insurance under Covered California, which is the state-administered Obamacare exchange.\n\nIn a refreshing change from Obama administration actions, this bill is actually constitutional, if you overlook the fact legislators are undermining the rule of law by passing a bill that conflicts with federal immigration law. Under Federalism the Constitution allows states more legislative flexibility than the federal government has.\n\nUnless the state law is in opposition to federal law and unless Barack Obama is in office. Federal law is supposed to prohibit illegal immigration so a law that encourages what the feds prohibit should be ruled unconstitutional. But not in the looking-glass world of Obama. In that alternate reality Arizona\u2019s law that aided enforcement of federal immigration statutes was ruled unconstitutional, California\u2019s act that undermines federal law by encouraging illegals to stay will have smooth sailing.\n\nIn keeping with standard Democrat fiscal policy there is no price tag on the measure. Nothing is too expensive for Democrats expressing compassion with our tax dollars. Anthony Wright, executive director of the Health Access special interest group, explained in the Sacramento Bee, \u201cThe idea under this bill is to extend the same level of help that the Affordable Care Act provides but to all Californians. It's about fairness and inclusion for all Californians.\u201d\n\nThe only problem with that explanation is illegals most certainly aren\u2019t Californians. They are Mexicans, Guatemalans, El Salvadorians, and the like, but not California citizens. But to Lara and his allies that fact doesn\u2019t even constitute a technicality, because he\u2019s certain people who are California citizens won\u2019t object to being taxed more to cover the medical bills of long-term trespassers.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "California,Illegals,Obamacare,Lara", "pubdate": "2014-02-18T10:55:34", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "There is something very tempting about forcing illegal aliens into the tender clutches of Obamacare bureaucrats, but I\u2019m doing my best to remain strong.", "title": "California Bill Gives Illegals Free Healthcare", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/California-Illegals-Obamacare-Lara/2014/02/18/id/553312/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/California-Illegals-Obamacare-Lara/2014/02/18/id/553312/", "title": "California Bill Gives Illegals Free Healthcare", "description": "There is something very tempting about forcing illegal aliens into the tender clutches of Obamacare bureaucrats, but I\u2019m doing my best to remain strong.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1392720934, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "California,Illegals,Obamacare,Lara", "article": {"section": "Reagan", "published_time": "2014-02-18T10:55:34"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/California-Illegals-Obamacare-Lara/2014/02/18/id/553312/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A California Bill Gives Illegals Free Healthcare."}, "article_summary": "But neither federal law nor an empty treasury is stopping California State Sen.
