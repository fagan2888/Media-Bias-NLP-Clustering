Kay Hagan is sitting on the most expensive hot seat in Senate history.\n\nSpending in her Senate race against Republican State House Speaker Thom Tillis topped $100 million, according to the Sunlight Foundation\u2014$10 million more than the second most expensive Senate contest this year in Colorado, and roughly $30 million more than the priciest Congressional race in history before 2014.\n\nHagan and Tillis have been running neck-and-neck for months. In the latest CNN/ORC poll Friday, Hagan's lead was within the margin of error, 48 to 46 percent. But the closeness of the race doesn\u2019t fully explain the costs. Across the map, endangered Democrats and Republican hopefuls are locked in competitive contests within the margin of error.\n\nGerry Broome/AP Photo\n\nAccording to media experts, political observers and officials with state and national organizations involved in the race, a combination of large and expensive media markets, early spending, and the state\u2019s history as a political toss-up has propelled the record-setting spending in North Carolina.\n\nHere are three reasons why this year\u2019s Senate contest in the Tar Heel state is a record-setter:\n\n1. The Ad Wars\n\nAccording to the Center for Public Integrity, candidates, parties and groups have run more than 100,000 ads in North Carolina this election cycle -- more than any other Senate race in the country. On top of that spending, the state also has a number of large, costly media markets.\n\n\u201cThe media markets are more expensive than other states,\u201d said Elizabeth Wilner, the senior vice president of Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks political advertising across the country. \u201cThat\u2019s the number one reason for the spending.\u201d\n\nFour of North Carolina\u2019s television markets are among the 50 largest in the country, according to Nielsen\u2019s yearly ranking of television markets.\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s population is also well distributed across the media markets. To reach voters, campaigns, parties and outside groups need to spend in all of them, unlike in states like Colorado, where most of the population can be reached by advertising in a single media market.\n\n\u201cOther races are just as critical, but it\u2019s a matter of proportion,\u201d Wilner said.\n\nWith demand so high, buying ads in expensive markets have become even more costly as the race has progressed, said Thomas Mills, a North Carolina Democratic analyst familiar with media buying in the state.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re paying out the ass per-spot with inventory so low,\u201d Mills said.\n\n2. Early Start\n\nTillis announced his campaign for Senate in May 2013, months before other Republican Senate hopefuls like Joni Ernst of Iowa (July 2013) and Tom Cotton of Arkansas (August 2013) declared.\n\nIn August 2013, Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political group with ties to the billionaire Koch brothers, began running television anti-Obamacare ads, according to Democrats tracking ad buying in the state and invoices from North Carolina television stations made available by the FCC. From November to February, the group, which has spent more than $9 million in the race, ran ads attacking Hagan. Representatives from Americans for Prosperity declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen ads come up so early here,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThey wanted a wounded incumbent and they felt like they had an issue to do it.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority PAC, the Super PAC led by former aides to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with the goal of helping Senate Democrats, responded in November and December of 2013 with ads supporting Hagan. By Jan. 1, 2014, the group had spent $1.4 million on ads defending Hagan. Since March, it has spent $9 million attacking Tillis.\n\n\"Hagan and groups like ours have really framed this race as a choice, highlighting Tillis\u2019 disastrous record in the state legislature,\u201d Ty Matsdorf of the Senate Majority PAC said.\n\nOutside groups have spent more money in the North Carolina Senate race than any other in history, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Organizations like the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Rifle Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce followed with ads of their own, according to independent expenditure filings.\n\nThe League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group supporting Kay Hagan, has spent $5 million on commercials and mailings in the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our biggest cycle ever,\u201d said Jeff Gohringer, spokesman for the League. \u201cWe\u2019re spending as much right now in North Carolina as we did on all political work in 2010.\u201d\n\nThe candidates have spent large sums as well. Hagan has spent $22 million on her reelection campaign, the second-highest spending candidate after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Tillis has spent roughly $9 million on his bid.\n\n3. Swing State Status\n\nWhile both parties have spent gamely in races across the map, North Carolina\u2019s recent voting history gives both Republicans and Democrats reason to believe the Tar Heel State is in play until the polls close.\n\nIn 2008, the year Hagan took office, African-Americans helped deliver the state to President Obama by just under 14,000 votes. Four years later, the state supported Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential bid by 98,000 votes, making North Carolina one of only two states to flip from 2008 to 2012.\n\n\u201cIn a state that supported Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012, it\u2019s not surprising to see both sides try to have as big an impact as they can,\u201d said Paul Lindsay, spokesman for Crossroads GPS, the national Republican organization that has spent $6.5 million on ads in North Carolina.\n\nRepublicans are hoping the president\u2019s disapproval can help deliver the state to Tillis\u2014and the Senate majority to the GOP. In January, 43 percent of North Carolinians approved of Obama\u2019s performance, according to a Gallup poll.\n\n\u201cPeople who disapproved of Obama in 2012 voted Republican down the line. The same thing could happen this year,\u201d said Carter Wrenn, a Republican consultant in North Carolina.\n\nDespite the Republican turn in 2012, Democrats believe they can defend Hagan by turning out their base while reaching out to undecided voters.\n\n\u201cSome swing states have large numbers of persuadable voters,\u201d said a North Carolina Democrat close to the Hagan campaign. \u201cNorth Carolina in this cycle has been very narrowly divided. It\u2019s become an arms race on television to see who can turn their folks out and depress the others.\u201d\n\nWith Election Day nearly upon us, North Carolina is likely to retain its spot as the costliest Senate race of the cycle\u2014unless runoffs in Georgia and Louisiana force campaign spending into overtime.\n\nGet real-time updates as this story unfolds.
