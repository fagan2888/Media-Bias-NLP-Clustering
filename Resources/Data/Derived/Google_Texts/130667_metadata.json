The envelope containing my car tax bill screams, \u201cOPEN IMMEDIATELY!\u201d \u2014 written just like that. The all-caps and exclamation point mean serious business, Buster!\n\nA former employer sent me a letter that didn\u2019t yell but did include a threat from the federal government. The employer requested information from me to properly document that my family and I purchased government-approved health insurance. My failure to document compliance with the Obamacare mandate \u201cmay result in a financial penalty from the IRS.\u201d Yes, another reminder that Obamacare has changed the rules.\n\nThe federal government can now demand that we perform certain behaviors, such as purchasing health insurance, and demand that we document our compliance with its original demand. The government can also use threats to take away money as a means to enforce our compliance with its demands. Is this freedom?\n\n***\n\nOur federal government wasn\u2019t always like this. The Constitution was written for a free people. Unlike living life subject to the whims of a parliament and king they didn\u2019t elect, American citizens lived subject only to those laws their elected representatives enacted. More importantly, the laws were limited to what was specifically written into the Constitution and their state constitutions. Otherwise, the citizens decided how to live.\n\n(The Founders didn\u2019t write these freedoms into the Constitution for women, Indians, blacks, or the poor. Thankfully, we\u2019ve amended the Constitution so that everybody is supposed to have the same freedoms.)\n\nBut things didn\u2019t always change for the better. As the modern world grew more complicated, certain people decided that common citizens weren\u2019t capable of navigating it for ourselves. In the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s administration decided that we were no longer able to provide for our own retirement or take care of older relatives in need. They produced Social Security which took money from our paychecks to manage that responsibility for us.\n\nFDR and Congress also decided that we were too irresponsible to pay our own taxes. The federal and, eventually, state governments started withholding our taxes from our paychecks before we even saw the money. We can decide not to have any money withheld, but if we don\u2019t prepay enough taxes before they\u2019re due, we\u2019re fined. As complicated as the tax code is, how can we know if we\u2019ve prepaid enough? It\u2019s easier to let the government withhold the money for us.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Johnson administration decided we couldn\u2019t provide for our medical care after retirement or provide medical care for the poor. Medicare and Medicaid now handle those responsibilities.\n\n***\n\nThree decades later (Do these things happen in 30-year cycles?), Hillary Clinton began drawing up the plans for Hillarycare, the aborted health care reform of the 1990s. At that time, the enlightened ones decided that Americans weren\u2019t capable of choosing the health care we need.\n\nHillary\u2019s reasoning for more government control of citizens\u2019 health care decisions \u2014 as opposed to employer-provided health savings accounts that citizens manage for themselves \u2014 was that she thinks people will be too focused on saving money and they won\u2019t get the care for their children and themselves that they need. Government needs to make our health-care decisions for us. Do we sit at the kids\u2019 table, too?\n\nObamacare is the natural progression from what has gone before. It\u2019s part of Obama\u2019s vision of \u201cremaking America,\u201d as he said at his first inauguration. It stops just short of a single-payer system in which money for health care is confiscated from us and paid into a government- administered national health service. Instead, we are told what to do with our money: purchase government-approved health insurance for ourselves and our dependents (up to age 26), whether we want to or not. If we don\u2019t, we pay a large penalty to the government.\n\nSo, the government can force us to do what it thinks we should. It has no constitutional limits on that power as long as there is a financial penalty labeled a tax. The Supreme Court said so; therefore, it must be true. But how can a penalty be a tax? Do we pay a speeding tax? Do wife-beaters pay an assault and battery tax?\n\nI\u2019ll do what I can to overturn this loss of freedom, such as Obamacare, and replace it with conservative reforms that actually do reduce the costs of health insurance and health care and don\u2019t cost us any freedom. I\u2019ll campaign for candidates who will work to that end. I\u2019ll work to change public opinion.\n\nFor the moment, I must comply. In the words of the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, \u201cI know. But I do not approve. And I am not resigned.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond Times-Dispatch", "description": "Every so often, my local government yells at me.
