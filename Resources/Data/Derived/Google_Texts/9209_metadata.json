Absolutely no. Do we have a perfect exchange? Absolutely not,\u201d Counihan said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing well.\u201d\n\nNeither Kansas nor Missouri have set up their own exchanges, so the exchanges in those two states are administered by Washington. Only 44 percent of eligible Missourians have signed up. In Kansas, only 30 percent of eligible people have. The national average is 41 percent.\n\nCounihan said he looks at hard numbers and not percentages. He said 11 million people are signed up in 2016 and more than 3 million of those sign-ups are new.\n\nOne thing many people are watching is the rate of premium increases this year. The Kaiser Foundation analysis, using a popular version of a plan for a 40-year-old making $30,000 per year shows a 13 percent increase in Kansas rates and a 4 percent increase in Missouri.\n\nCounihan hopes people will be patient.\n\n\u201cThis is a four to five-year implementation,\u201d he said. \u201cI know we live in a culture where we want everything to be perfect and running right away. Something which is new like this, and complicated, takes a little bit more time.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to sign up is Jan. 31.\n\nFor more information about sign-ups, you can go to this site.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 18:22:15 CST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Micheal Mahoney", "og": {"site_name": "KMBC", "description": "The CEO of the federal governments\u2019 health insurance program said even though fewer than half of eligible Kansans and Missourians have signed up for the program, he\u2019s not discouraged.", "title": "Government's health care CEO urges people to sign up", "url": "http://www.kmbc.com/news/governments-health-care-ceo-urges-people-to-sign-up/37560616", "image": "http://www.kmbc.com/image/view/-/37561532/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/n162vk/-/Government-s-health-care-CEO-urges-people-to-sign-up.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kmbc.com/news/governments-health-care-ceo-urges-people-to-sign-up/37560616", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kmbc://content/article/37560616", "iphone": "kmbc://content/article/37560616", "googleplay": "kmbc://content/article/37560616"}, "name": {"ipad": "kmbc", "iphone": "kmbc", "googleplay": "kmbc"}, "id": {"ipad": 505212819, "iphone": 505211829, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kmbc"}}, "site": "@KMBC", "card": "app"}, "description": "The CEO of the federal governments\u2019 health insurance program said even though fewer than half of eligible Kansans and Missourians have signed up for the program, he\u2019s not discouraged.", "al": {"android": {"url": "kmbc://content/article/37560616", "app_name": "kmbc", "package": "com.hearst.android.kmbc"}, "ios": {"url": "kmbc://content/article/37560616", "app_store_id": 505211829, "app_name": "kmbc"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 97580448106}, "keywords": "Kansas City, Missouri, health care, health insurance, exchange, Kevin Counihan", "google-site-verification": "daWthB2Zr-3U8bobkm4X_d2lv1fY5e8Eygvj6E4c9Hk", "news_keywords": "Kansas City, Missouri, health care, health insurance, exchange, Kevin Counihan"}, "article_summary": "The CEO of the federal governments\u2019 health insurance program said even though fewer than half of eligible Kansans and Missourians have signed up for the program, he\u2019s not discouraged.\nKevin Counihan, the CEO of Healthcare.gov, was in Kansas City Thursday to encourage people to sign up before the deadline.\nOnly 44 percent of eligible Missourians have signed up.\nSomething which is new like this, and complicated, takes a little bit more time.\u201dThe deadline to sign up is Jan. 31.\nHe said 11 million people are signed up in 2016 and more than 3 million of those sign-ups are new."}
