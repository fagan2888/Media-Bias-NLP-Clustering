The area is suddenly a curious and compelling archeological site.\n\nDescendants of both groups recently came together at the site near Little Rock, Arkansas to observe unmarked African American graves among prehistoric Indian mounds, and discuss what they might do together to learn more and preserve the unmarked graves. Members of the Quapaw Tribe met with members of Preservation of African American Cemeteries (PAAC), along with Dr. John House of the Arkansas Archeological Survey and state Sen. Linda Chesterfield of Little Rock. The meeting sparked feelings of histories colliding\u2014again, it seems\u2014to provide a kind of closure.\n\n\u201cWe feel like this is fate, in a way, because our tribal heritage and our ancestry especially here in Arkansas is very important to us,\u201d said Chairman John Berrey of the Quapaw Tribe. \u201cThe fact that this particular discovery brought us together with another important group from Arkansas history made it a unique and special meeting.\u201d\n\nAs a former teacher and a lifelong Arkansas history enthusiast, Chesterfield said she was touched by the meaning of the moment.\n\n\u201cThe history of African Americans and Native Americans are very much aligned here in Arkansas,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Quapaws are especially interesting because while Africans were being brought here in slavery, the Quapaws were being taken into slavery by Europeans. So it is wonderful to see these two groups working together now to discover and preserve their separate and mutual histories.\u201d\n\nTamela Tenpenny-Lewis, president of the PAAC, described it as \u201ccoming full circle\u201d in a common mission.\n\n\u201cHistory put us together to do something that both groups felt strongly about and had been working on independently,\u201d Tenpenny-Lewis said. \u201cWe have both answered the call.\u201d\n\nCarla Hines-Coleman, vice president of PAAC, said: \u201cThis was meant to happen in its own time and way. It feels wonderful to be part of it, and we are all excited to see what we can do together to make the most of the opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe burial sites were discovered on land purchased by the tribe in 2013, which was part of the historic Thiboult Plantation near the Little Rock Port Authority, and, before that, part of the tribe\u2019s historic Arkansas reservation. The tribe and PAAC wished to keep the burial site\u2019s exact location unknown to the public because of the possibility of looters who might disturb the graves in search of historic artifacts, which Dr. House said has been known to happen at other early Indian burial sites in Arkansas.\n\nRELATED: Quapaw Tribe Discovers Slave Cemetery on Newly Acquired Ancestral Land\n\n\u201cThis is a very special place on the landscape,\u201d House said. \u201cSo much of Arkansas\u2019 history is told only through the lens of what occurred after white Europeans came here. But there were centuries of prior history, very much of it involving the Quapaw Tribe and other Native American tribes.\u201d\n\nHouse estimated that the Native American graves at the site dated to between 1400 and 1600, while the African American graves in the same location probably date from before the Civil War to the early 1900s. He said it was not necessarily uncommon for a prehistoric grave site to serve as grave sites for later cultures. \u201cWhat made it suitable for grave sites in earlier centuries made it suitable in more recent history as well, such as being on land that rises above the level of normal floods,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Preservation of African American Cemeteries was founded in 2003 to create a network of persons and groups committed to locating, documenting and preserving previously unknown African American cemeteries.\n\nThe Quapaw Tribe is one of the main Indigenous Peoples of the state of Arkansas. They occupied areas spreading from Little Rock southward and eastward to the Mississippi River for centuries before white European explorers arrived in the 15th and 16th centuries. The Quapaws were relocated to northeast Oklahoma in the mid-1800s, and they have been active for numerous recent years in \u201ccoming home\u201d to celebrate and preserve their Arkansas cultural heritage.\n\n\u201cWe look so forward to working with our new friends, and with Dr. House, to learn more about this particular site,\u201d Berrey said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure yet exactly what we will do at the site, so the immediate desire is to simply not disturb it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The centuries-old remains of American Indians and what are believed to be former African American slaves have shared a common resting place for years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/01/african-american-and-native-history-collide-arkansas-archeological-site-155573", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/quapaw-tribe-and-paac.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "African American and Native History Collide at Arkansas Archeological Site"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "African American and Native History Collide at Arkansas Archeological Site"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/01/african-american-and-native-history-collide-arkansas-archeological-site-155573", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-01T12:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Quapaw Tribe, Archaeological Site, Native American History, African Americans", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "African American and Native History Collide at Arkansas Archeological Site"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd815e\"", "article_summary": "The Preservation of African American Cemeteries was founded in 2003 to create a network of persons and groups committed to locating, documenting and preserving previously unknown African American cemeteries.\n\u201cThe fact that this particular discovery brought us together with another important group from Arkansas history made it a unique and special meeting.\u201dAs a former teacher and a lifelong Arkansas history enthusiast, Chesterfield said she was touched by the meaning of the moment.\n\u201cSo much of Arkansas\u2019 history is told only through the lens of what occurred after white Europeans came here.\nThe centuries-old remains of American Indians and what are believed to be former African American slaves have shared a common resting place near Little Rock for a long, long time.\n\u201cThe history of African Americans and Native Americans are very much aligned here in Arkansas,\u201d she said."}
