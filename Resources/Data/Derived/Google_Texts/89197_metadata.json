House Bill 1263 passed the House last week by a 74-24 margin after a change to placate conservative lawmakers, and now is before the Senate.\n\nThe legislation would permit physicians, physician assistants and advanced-practice nurses to write prescriptions for remote patients, as long as they have established a provider-patient relationship. The two parties may establish a relationship via telemedicine by collecting the patient\u2019s medical history, obtaining informed consent, discussing the diagnosis and treatment options, creating a medical record of the patient and developing a plan for follow-up care.\n\nThis bill does excludes vision services provided by telephone, audio-only communication, fax, e-mail or instant messaging. It also excludes controlled substances and abortion drugs; the abortion provision was added during committee deliberations.\n\nBill sponsor Rep. Cindy Kirchhofer (R-Indianapolis) previously cited telemedicine as a way to expand access to care in the Hoosier State, which did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and ranks above the national average in terms of uninsured residents. She also noted, as this tweet pointed out, that Indiana lags in acceptance of telemedicine. (Kirchhofer retweeted it.)\n\n\"Indiana is one of the few states that does not fully offer telemedical services\" -Cindy Kirchhofer @CindyKirchhofer #1263 \u2014 IN Minority Health (@IMHC_Indiana) January 25, 2016\n\nOne lawmaker in opposition to the bill worried about overprescription of drugs, thanks to out-of-state drug marketers. \u201cSo are they going to get on TV and see somebody in Ohio or Nevada who tells them, \u2018Why don\u2019t you take this or that and the other,'\u201d Rep. Ed DeLaney (D-Indianapolis) said, according to Indiana Public Media.\n\nFor her part, Kirchhofer told IPM that the legislation is intended to make it easier for patients with chronic diseases to get the medications they need to control their conditions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The legislation would permit physicians, PAs and NPs to write prescriptions for remote patients, as long as they have established a provider-patient relationship.
