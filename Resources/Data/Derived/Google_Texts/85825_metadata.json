Setting a new standard for lethargic mediocrity, the body, which formally adjourned this week, passed just 200 bills over the last two years. By comparison, the 80th session of 1947-1948, affectionately referred to as the \u201cDo-Nothing Congress,\u201d shepherded a whopping 900 pieces of legislation. Harry Truman\u2019s clever branding of Washington\u2019s stuffed shirts was accurate at the time, but seems quaintly innocent from the vantage point of late 2014.\n\nIn an Associated Press piece entitled, 113th Congress Ends With More Fights Than Feats, writer Alan Fram observes (somewhat poetically), \u201cThe tempestuous 113th Congress has limped out of Washington for the last time, capping two years of modest and infrequent legislating that was overshadowed by partisan clashes, gridlock and investigations.\u201d Limp is right. What little paperwork did make it to the President\u2019s desk did nothing to address the nation\u2019s broken immigration system, declining infrastructure, archaic and biased tax code, unlivable minimum wage and a host of other dire issues rendering America less functional.\n\nOf course, despite maintaining a despotic stranglehold on the House of Representatives, none of this should be blamed on the GOP. Just ask them:\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell: \u201cHow many times did we have the point of the week?\u2026 It was designed to make us walk the plank. It had nothing to do with getting a legislative outcome.\u201d\n\nMichael Steel, spokesman for House Majority Leader John Boehner: Republicans passed \u201cjobs bill after jobs bill\u2026But Washington Democrats \u2014 including President Obama and Senate Democratic leaders \u2014 have utterly failed to act.\u201d\n\nMoira Bagley Smith, spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise: \u201cConsidering the Senate is sitting on over 350 pieces of House-passed legislation from this Congress, I believe Senator Reid\u2019s chamber single-handedly has earned the title of \u2018least productive\u2026\u2019The contrast in productivity between these two chambers couldn\u2019t be more obvious.\u201d\n\nExamples of these \u201c350 pieces of House-passed legislation\u201d include more than 50 votes designed to kill or weaken the now clearly successful Affordable Care Act. And if you can\u2019t recall the reported avalanche of awesome Republican jobs bills, you are not alone. Meanwhile in the Democratic-led Senate, legislation designed to raise the federal minimum wage, create equal pay for women, improve the student loan morass and extend jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, proved DOA in the House.\n\nSo goodbye and good riddance 113th Congress, with your 15 percent approval rating. Better luck next year. Oh wait.\n\nPer writer Aileen Graef of UPI, \u201cWhen the 114th Congress enters its first session in January, it will be controlled by the Republican party which has already vowed to fight the White House on contentious issues including healthcare and immigration. With President Obama waiting to meet the new Congress ready to veto, it spells a grim future for productivity and approval ratings.\u201d\n\nAs I suggested shortly after the November midterm elections, frustrated voters who thought they were sending President Obama and the Democrats a message at the ballot box (\u201cDo something!\u201d) were speaking to the wrong party. There\u2019s no reason to believe that the 114th session will be any more productive than the last. Stonewalling has proven a GOP ballot box-winning strategy. Nothing will change until we demand it, and stop rewarding sandbaggers with additional terms in office.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Similar to overpaid NFL \"star\" Jay Cutler's reign of terror as the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears, the best thing we can say about the 113th session of Congress is that it's over.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Becky Sarwate", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Similar to overpaid NFL \"star\" Jay Cutler's reign of terror as the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears, the best thing we can say about the 113th session of Congress is that it's over.", "title": "113th Congress Produces 22% of \"Do-Nothing\" 1947-1948 Counterpart", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/12/20/113th-congress-produces-22-do-nothing-1947-1948-counterpart.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Do-Nothing-Congress.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-20T14:13:41+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,U.S. House of Representatives,U.S. Senate,Associated Press,Barack Obama,Chicago Bears,Congress,Democratic Party,harry truman,House Majority,House of Representatives,Jay Cutler,Minority Leader,mitch mcconnell,national football league,Politics of the United States,Republican Party,Steve Scalise,United States Congress,United States House of Representatives,White House,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "U.S. Senate", "published_time": "2014-12-20T14:13:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T14:13:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Associated Press, Barack Obama, Chicago Bears, Congress, Democratic Party, harry truman, House Majority, House of Representatives, Jay Cutler, Minority Leader, mitch mcconnell, national football league, Politics of the United States, Republican Party, Steve Scalise, United States Congress, United States House of Representatives, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecdd\"", "article_summary": "So goodbye and good riddance 113th Congress, with your 15 percent approval rating.\nIn an Associated Press piece entitled, 113th Congress Ends With More Fights Than Feats, writer Alan Fram observes (somewhat poetically), \u201cThe tempestuous 113th Congress has limped out of Washington for the last time, capping two years of modest and infrequent legislating that was overshadowed by partisan clashes, gridlock and investigations.\u201d Limp is right.\nBy comparison, the 80th session of 1947-1948, affectionately referred to as the \u201cDo-Nothing Congress,\u201d shepherded a whopping 900 pieces of legislation.\nSimilar to overpaid NFL \u201cstar\u201d Jay Cutler\u2019s reign of terror as the starting quarterback for the Chicago Bears, the best thing we can say about the 113th session of Congress is that it\u2019s over.\nSetting a new standard for lethargic mediocrity, the body, which formally adjourned this week, passed just 200 bills over the last two years."}
