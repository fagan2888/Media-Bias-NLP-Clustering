Jerry Brown signed landmark legislation to change the state\u2019s definition of sexual consent, along with several other laws to promote the rights of LGBT citizens. But the governor also signed another key law earlier in the month, to significantly less fanfare: On Sept. 18, California quietly adopted AB 336, a law to protect sex workers from prosecution for carrying condoms.\n\nThe new law, which originally would have banned condoms as evidence of prostitution entirely, requires courts to confirm explicitly the relevance of condoms as evidence, adding an important potential legal deterrent that could prevent law enforcement officials from targeting sex workers who carry them. According to a Huffington Post report, police frequently use the presence of condoms as justification for arrest, making both sex workers and many transgender women reluctant to carry (and, as a result, use) the contraceptives. As a result, these groups become disproportionately more susceptible to contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, posing a serious public health concern.\n\n\u201cRight now, there\u2019s no process, and condoms are admitted into court even when they aren\u2019t actual evidence,\u201d Wendy Hill, senior legislative assistant to the bill\u2019s sponsor, Assemblymember Tom Ammiano, told HuffPost. \u201cThere are very few cases [against sex workers] in which an actual condom is listed as a valid piece of evidence. \u2026 There are cases where HIV health outreach workers would go out and distribute condoms, and then law enforcement will follow up right behind them as a means of \u2018cleaning up the streets.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carrying condoms used to be a call for condemnation -- but advocates say that's a problem for public health", "author": "Jenny Kutner", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Carrying condoms used to be a call for condemnation -- but advocates say that's a problem for public health", "title": "California quietly enacted a law that makes it harder to prosecute sex workers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/29/california_quietly_enacted_a_law_that_makes_it_harder_to_prosecute_sex_workers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/condom_hand.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carrying condoms used to be a call for condemnation -- but advocates say that's a problem for public health", "creator": "@@JennyKutner", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/condom_hand.jpg", "title": "California quietly enacted a law that makes it harder to prosecute sex workers", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "California quietly enacted a law that makes it harder to prosecute sex workers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California, Condoms, HIV/AIDS, jerry brown, New York, Prostitution, public health, Sex Work, sex workers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeed8\"", "article_summary": "Topics: California, Condoms, HIV/AIDS, jerry brown, New York, Prostitution, public health, Sex Work, sex workers, Life News, News, Politics NewsCalifornia made headlines over the weekend after Gov.\n\u201cThere are very few cases [against sex workers] in which an actual condom is listed as a valid piece of evidence.\nBut the governor also signed another key law earlier in the month, to significantly less fanfare: On Sept. 18, California quietly adopted AB 336, a law to protect sex workers from prosecution for carrying condoms.\nAs a result, these groups become disproportionately more susceptible to contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, posing a serious public health concern.\n\u2026 There are cases where HIV health outreach workers would go out and distribute condoms, and then law enforcement will follow up right behind them as a means of \u2018cleaning up the streets."}
