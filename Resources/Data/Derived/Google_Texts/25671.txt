They come from all around the country to Panama City Beach.

"I think it's great. It keeps them active and in shape," Bob Becnel said, watching his grandson from New Orleans play in the Snapper Bowl. "It gets them off the computers a couple nights a week at least."

For almost 50 years, dozens of teams have made their way to the Panhandle for the annual tournament.

An event county tourism officials say scores both on and off the field.

"The Snapper Bowl in particular has an economic impact of about $2 million," David Demarest with the Bay County Tourist Development Council said. "You've got 65 teams here for this event. You're seeing about 12 people per team, plus their families. That's bringing in a lot of people. And they're staying here around four nights, so they're really making a vacation out of it."

As some like Becnel say they plan to spend the holidays in the Panhandle, while enjoying some good old-fashioned football.

"I think all of us realized what a beautiful place Panama City Beach is," Becnel said. "We will be coming back possibly next Thanksgiving if he's chosen again, but before that we'll probably come for a vacation weekend just to get away from New Orleans, and have some fun in the sun down here."

According to Snapper Bowl Director Kenny Creel, organizers expect anywhere from 6,000 to 8,000 people to attend this year's tournament.

As for football, they say they planned on playing on the gridiron Friday at Pete Edwards Field and Frank Brown Park until about midnight.

Creel says the tournament will wrap up with the championship games set for Saturday.
