Skies stay continue to clear Monday night and temperatures drop to the upper teens with a light northeast wind.

Tuesday will be another cold day with partly cloudy skies and highs in the low to mid-30s.

A piece of energy moves in Tuesday evening, bringing another round of snow. Snow amounts will stay low with a dusting expected in central Oklahoma and higher amounts of up to 2 inches in far northwest Oklahoma.

This chance will end early Wednesday morning.
