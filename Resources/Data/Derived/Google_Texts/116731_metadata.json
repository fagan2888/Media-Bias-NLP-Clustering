Having lost a few family members to other forms of cancer, Jochim knew what could lie ahead. So when his doctors at UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center presented him with an option to participate in a clinical trial involving two forms of chemotherapy, he decided to give it a shot. \u201cIf it does me some good, great. Otherwise, it will do someone else some good,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve gotta find some better treatments for cancer, and the only way they will find them is through trials.\u201d\n\nJochim\u2019s lung cancer is just one of thousands of diseases and disorders getting special treatment, so to speak, through clinical trials, a process by which new approaches to patient care are evaluated. And while 2013 data from The Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation shows that more than 90 percent of North Americans understand what a clinical trial is, local research facilities report that they see low participation rates among minorities and women. \u201cWithout the participation of a variety of individuals, we\u2019re not going to be able to answer definitive questions if we don\u2019t have a sample that reflects the end user of that treatment,\u201d says Linda D. Marks, director of operations, office of clinical research, at Sutter Institute for Medical Research.\n\nThrough building awareness of how clinical trials work, more consumers may be willing to consider participating in one and helping to advance medical care. With that in mind, here are five facts you may not know about clinical trials, along with information about current studies going on locally.\n\nFACT 1: IT\u2019S NOT ALL ABOUT NEW DRUGS. News stories often report the results of clinical trials for prescription drugs. However, in the same way that there are many different ways to treat medical conditions, several kinds of clinical trials exist. Screening and diagnostic trials strive to find new methods for identifying early indicators of diseases and disorders. Trials of medical devices or surgical procedures can look at new technology, techniques, both, or a combination of traditional treatment methods with new tools. Quality-of-life trials investigate ways of caring for patients with chronic conditions. Marks says quality-of-life studies are often used by hospitals and medical centers to improve internal procedures and caregiving methods.\n\nSome trials involve testing an FDA-approved drug for a new purpose, either alone or in combination with other treatments. Cancer clinical trials can focus on using treatments with a good track record against one form of cancer on a different form of cancer. For example, Primo Lara, M.D., an oncologist at UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, is spearheading a trial featuring an immunotherapy drug effective in treating lung cancer and melanoma on chemotherapy-resistant bladder cancer.\n\nFACT 2: PARTICIPANTS DON\u2019T HAVE TO PAY. Those wondering who pays for clinical research, rest assured that participants pay nothing. Clinical trials can be funded or sponsored by a variety of means. Federally funded trials take place at the Bethesda, Md., headquarters of the National Institutes of Health, the federal government\u2019s main biomedical research facility; NIH also sponsors research at universities, medical schools, hospitals and private institutions throughout the United States. Institutionally sponsored trials are funded by private sources, such as Sutter Institute for Medical Research. Lastly, industry-sponsored clinical trials are paid for by corporations; pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing companies fall into this category.\n\nBut what about any medications, doctor visits and lab work that come with being in a clinical trial? Will insurance pay? It depends. Sponsors often cover the cost of treatment, but coverage for routine patient costs, such as office visits and screenings, can be less clear. The Affordable Care Act says a qualified individual who participates in an approved clinical trial cannot be denied coverage of associated routine patient costs. In California, for patients who participate in certain approved cancer treatment trials, health plans must pay for routine costs. Before deciding whether to participate, consumers should discuss coverage issues with their health care provider and health plan administrator.\n\nFACT 3: A VIGOROUS REVIEW PROCESS PREVAILS. Before clinical trials even begin recruiting patients, researchers and institutional review boards work to ensure positive outcomes. \u201cWe make sure that the trial is highly likely to succeed and has strong potential in improving patient care,\u201d says Andrew G. Hudnut, M.D., medical director for Sutter Institute for Medical Research. \u201cWe only offer a clinical trial if we think it will improve care or answer questions.\u201d All clinical trials have protocols, a written guide on how to conduct the research, and clinicians are responsible for ensuring the protocols are followed.\n\nTo join a clinical trial, patients are pre-screened, which includes interviews with researchers and clinicians, laboratory testing and other factors, all to ensure that the patient is a good candidate. Once accepted into a trial, patients work with a coordinator who manages all the details\u2014a luxury when dealing with a challenging diagnosis. Folsom resident and cancer survivor Cindy Baumeister praises the work of the patient coordinator who has guided her through two different clinical trials. \u201cShe gives me a calendar with all the doctor appointments, labs and scans already scheduled\u2014I don\u2019t have to manage any of that,\u201d she says. Hudnut says patient coordinators play a key role in ensuring a trial\u2019s success. \u201cThe excellence of the data [gathered] is built in part upon the relationship and communication between patient and coordinator,\u201d he says. \u201cThe coordinator provides a lot of knowledge, support and access.\u201d\n\nFACT 4: PATIENTS CAN BAIL OUT ANY- TIME. Participants have many rights, and the freedom to leave a trial at any time is among them. During initial screenings, researchers and coordinators state the risks, possible side effects and possibility of receiving placebos. \u201cPatients need to feel comfortable that research is about answering our ignorance,\u201d says Hudnut. \u201cSometimes we haven\u2019t improved an outcome, and patients need to feel comfortable with ambiguity.\u201d\n\nIn cancer clinical trials, however, everyone wins: No patient goes without treatment if one is known to be beneficial, and a trial will end early if a treatment is found to be harmful or ineffective. According to the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center website, \u201cif it becomes clear during a clinical trial that one treatment is better than another, the trial is stopped and all patients in the trial are offered the more effective treatment.\u201d\n\nFACT 5: IT\u2019S UP TO PATIENTS TO START THE CONVERSATION. While doctors participating in research at UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center and Sutter Institute for Medical Research will recruit from their patient rosters, other physicians may be unaware of what clinical trials are available. It\u2019s then the patient\u2019s responsibility to seek out relevant clinical trials. Online resources such as clinicaltrials.gov are a good place to begin. If an appropriate clinical trial is available, Baumeister recommends lots of talking: \u201cTalk to other folks in clinical trials, talk to family members, friends, talk to your [doctor].\u201d For tips on how to talk to your health care provider about clinical trials, visit the Patient Advocate Foundation website at patientadvocate.org.\n\nEven if the idea of participating in a trial is daunting, the potential of a positive outcome inspires many to take the chance. Finding out that her ovarian tumor had shrunk to 57 percent of its original size after 18 weeks was tremendously encouraging for Baumeister. \u201cWhen you hear results like that, it\u2019s the reason why you do clinical trials,\u201d she says.\n\nCurrently Recruiting: Local Clinical Trials\n\nUC DAVIS COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER (916) 734-3089\n\nBladder Cancer: Feasibility Trial of Pembrolizumab + Docetaxel or Gemcitabine in Platinum Pre-treated Urothelial Cancer.
