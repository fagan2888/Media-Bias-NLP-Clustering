That comes as many adults are having trouble getting out of debt, saving for retirement or putting cash away for a rainy day.\n\n\u201cWe find there are two things parents want to accomplish with talks about money. First and foremost is financial literacy,\u201d says Mitchell Kraus, principal of Capital Intelligence Associates, a wealth management firm in Santa Monica, Calif. \u201cBut a second goal, and often bigger with wealthy families, is teaching values.\u201d\n\nFor younger kids, Kraus recommends parents use the three-bucket approach to saving money. There\u2019s one bucket for money to spend now, one for spending later on a bigger goal and one for spending on others. Older kids can use the same approach, but with bank accounts instead of buckets.\n\nTerri Munro, a senior financial planner at BT Wealth Management in Atlanta, uses the classic board game \u201cMonopoly\u201d to teach younger children the basics of counting and making change, while older children grasp more complex concepts of going into debt and paying rent.\n\n\u201cAll ages get exposure to negotiation, budgeting and investing and general togetherness of family that can't be beat,\u201d she says.\n\nMunro\u2019s recommendation is among the 14 toys and games that foster a financially smart kid.
