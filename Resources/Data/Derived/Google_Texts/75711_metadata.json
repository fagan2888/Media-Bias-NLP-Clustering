They said it was not yet clear how many more people might require more intensive treatment to lower blood pressure.\n\nSystolic blood pressure, the arterial pressure when the heart contracts, is the top number in a blood pressure reading. High blood pressure is widely considered a leading risk factor for heart disease, kidney failure and other health problems.\n\nThe vast majority of blood pressure medicines from a variety of classes are available as inexpensive generics. The classes include angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs, such as Novartis' Diovan, calcium channel blockers, like Pfizer's Norvasc, ACE inhibitors, including Pfizer's Altace, and diruetics, such as Merck's Hyzaar.\n\nDoctors on a conference call to discuss the study said blood pressure of 120 over 80 was seen as desirable, but that 140/90 was a commonly used target. They also noted that there is no real consensus, which was a reason for conducting the trial.\n\nPatients in the study, conducted between 2010 and 2013, had a mean age of 68, with 25 percent over 75, and were deemed at increased risk of heart disease or had kidney disease. It did not include patients who had a prior stroke or those with diabetes.\n\nThe intensive treatment group received an average of three blood pressure-reducing medicines, while the 140 target group was taking an average of two medicines.\n\nWhile adverse side effects in the intensive treatment group were still being analyzed, researchers said, the study was stopped early when the significant benefits of intense treatment became obvious.\n\n\"Patients should talk to their doctor to determine whether this lower goal is best for their individual care,\" said Dr. Lawrence Fine, chief of Clinical Applications and Prevention at the NHLBI.\n\n(Editing by Bernadette Baum and Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "aggressive, blood, pressure, reduction, cuts, death, heart, problems, study", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Lowering blood pressure below a commonly used target significantly reduced serious heart problems and cut the risk of death in adults aged 50 and older.", "title": "Aggressive Blood Pressure Reduction Cuts Death, Heart Problems: Study", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aggressive-blood-pressure-reduction-cuts-death-heart-problems-study-352236", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/11/blood-pressure.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lowering blood pressure below a commonly used target significantly reduced serious heart problems and cut the risk of death in adults aged 50 and older.", "title": "Aggressive Blood Pressure Reduction Cuts Death, Heart Problems: Study", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/aggressive-blood-pressure-reduction-cuts-death-heart-problems-study-352236", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/11/blood-pressure.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/09/11/blood-pressure.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-09-11T14:46:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-11T14:46:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Lowering blood pressure below a commonly used target significantly reduced serious heart problems and cut the risk of death in adults aged 50 and older."}, "article_summary": "Systolic blood pressure, the arterial pressure when the heart contracts, is the top number in a blood pressure reading.\nThe vast majority of blood pressure medicines from a variety of classes are available as inexpensive generics.\nThey said it was not yet clear how many more people might require more intensive treatment to lower blood pressure.\nHigh blood pressure is widely considered a leading risk factor for heart disease, kidney failure and other health problems.\nThe intensive treatment group received an average of three blood pressure-reducing medicines, while the 140 target group was taking an average of two medicines."}
