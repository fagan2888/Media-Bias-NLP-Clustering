Spotlight on… Johnny Boychuk, defenseman, New York Islanders

When: The Avalanche hosts the Islanders on Thursday night, one of its two meetings this season.

What’s up: Boychuk, a former member of the Avalanche, was traded by the Boston Bruins before the season and has played very well for a New York team that got off to a good start. He can become an unrestricted free agent next summer and will likely score a big contract if he does.

Background: Boychuk was drafted 61st overall by the Avs in 2002 and spent four years in the minors before playing four games for Colorado in 2007-08 — as a forward. The Avs traded him in 2008 to Boston for Matt Hendricks, and he spent another year in the minors before getting a chance on the Bruins blue line. He has been a regular player since, winning a Stanley Cup in 2011 with the Bruins.

Dater’s take: It’s too easy to second guess now, but the Avs would probably love to get a do-over on letting Boychuk go. So might the Bruins this year too, especially with captain and defensive stalwart Zdeno Chara out long-term with a knee injury. But the Bruins were caught in a salary-cap squeeze and got something for Boychuk while they still could. The star-studded Avs of yesteryear just never had much room for him while he was here. Maybe they can still get him back next summer — but it won’t come cheap.
