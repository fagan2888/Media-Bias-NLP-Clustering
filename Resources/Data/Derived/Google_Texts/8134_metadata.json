Italy and Uruguay have three points each and England has already been eliminated with zero points.\n\n\u201cWe have only one necessity now,\u201d Italy coach Cesare Prandelli said. \u201cWe must regain our energy. \u2026 With this match either you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out and I\u2019m hoping to see an Italy with a different approach.\u201d\n\nThat was why Prandelli put an emphasis on sprinting in training Sunday, instructing his players to rush into the area at full speed before attempting shots on goal.\n\nThe match at the Arena das Dunas \u2014 named after this coastal city\u2019s massive sand dunes \u2014 will start at 1 p.m. local time (noon EDT/1600 GMT), meaning that heat could be an issue again.\n\nPrandelli is also tinkering with potential formation and lineup changes. He faces widespread calls to insert Ciro Immobile alongside Mario Balotelli in attack.\n\nImmobile led Serie A with 22 goals \u2014 none of them penalties \u2014 for Torino before signing with Borussia Dortmund just days before departing for Brazil. But his only appearance so far in this tournament was in the final 17 minutes of the 2-1 win over England.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018In or out': Italy and Uruguay battle to advance", "author": "Andrew Dampf", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\u2018In or out': Italy and Uruguay battle to advance", "title": "\u2018In or out': Italy and Uruguay battle to advance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/22/in_or_out_italy_and_uruguay_battle_to_advance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-italy.jpeg32-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u2018In or out': Italy and Uruguay battle to advance", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/brazil-soccer-wcup-italy.jpeg32-1280x960.jpg", "title": "\u2018In or out': Italy and Uruguay battle to advance", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u2018In or out': Italy and Uruguay battle to advance", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd829c\"", "article_summary": "Italy and Uruguay have three points each and England has already been eliminated with zero points.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNATAL, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Luis Suarez and Uruguay are full of momentum after beating England.\nIf the Azzurri win or draw they go through, while Uruguay must win to reach the last 16.\nMario Balotelli and Italy are struggling to recover after a draining loss to Costa Rica.\nBut his only appearance so far in this tournament was in the final 17 minutes of the 2-1 win over England."}
