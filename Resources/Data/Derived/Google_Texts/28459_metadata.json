Make that super admiring.\n\nThe back issues of business magazines are full of the Next Big Things we\u2019ve never heard from again, of course, and problems with regulation, technology, competition or management could upend this Cinderella story. Theranos (you really should read the Fortune article; it\u2019s fascinating and well-reported, and asks all the right questions even if it can get them all answered) performs conventional blood tests with a fraction of the amount of blood used by Quest and LabCorp and others, we\u2019re told in the article; it charges less and provides results faster; there\u2019s less pain involved (Holmes, we learn, is also needle-phobic). And it builds its own diagnostic equipment, while Quest and LabCorp buy theirs from the likes of Siemens (SIEGY), Olympus (OCPNY) and Beckman Coulter.\n\nCredible people vouch for the science. Holmes says she\u2019s determined to bring transparency to medicine, but of course keeps much of what\u2019s going on at Thernanos secret, for competitive reasons we\u2019re told. Fair enough. (Holmes\u2019 board includes former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz and former U.S. Senators Sam Nunn and Bill Frist. David Boies, the famous litigator, provides advice.)\n\nIf most of what\u2019s reported by Fortune pans out, the threat -- while not immediate to Quest and LabCorp \u2013 would be substantial. The companies\u2019 innovation has been to consolidate and standardize lab testing, rolling up hundreds of little competitors. That has made their dominance seem inevitable. Doing so, however, they\u2019ve built large corporate establishments on the assumption that pricing will be stable.\n\nDGX Total Employees (Annual) data by YCharts\n\nSome disappointing forward guidance sent the shares of Quest and LabCorp plunging last December and we were moved to recite the many pluses of their businesses. Insurers \u2013 the government and private companies \u2013 have been lamentably poor at reducing healthcare costs for decades, so why would we bet they\u2019d be any good at it now?\n\nTheir stocks have rallied since the December plunge and they now trade at a forward PE ratio closer to 15, as opposed to the 12.5 or so when they scraped bottom. The current multiple is reasonable for a wide moat company \u2013 one with significant barriers to entry that protect its business.

But one can at least envision a scenario over the next decade in which Quest and LabCorp are forced to cut price to hang onto business and forced to invest in expensive technology like that at Theranos. That could narrow profit margins further.\n\nDGX Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nAnd divert capital that has been going to aggressive stock buybacks in recent years, which has rewarded shareholders by substantially reducing shares outstanding.\n\nDGX Shares Outstanding data by YCharts\n\nJeff Bailey, The Editor of YCharts, is a former reporter, editor and columnist at the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.
