In the tweet chats I\u2019ve attended where the differences between being a patient vs. customer are discussed and in the articles I\u2019ve read, some people seem to have a very clear idea of the difference between the two; others not so much. The patient-customer often has a different perspective on this topic than the physician-provider.\n\nThere\u2019s the argument that \u201cCustomers go to places willingly, while patients go to hospitals mostly out of necessity.\u201d Indeed, who\u2019s going to be looking for an in-network hospital and checking on physician credentials while lying I\u2019m in the back of an ambulance? Physicians argue that they offer a special breed of services and that providing \u201ccustomer satisfaction\u201d and needing to \u201cencourage brand loyalty\u201d are not part of their responsibility.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not sure where the majority or \u201cpopular opinion\u201d stands on this topic, I can attest for my own situation: Over the past few years, I have been performing many duties and tasks associated with being a customer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are these customer duties I\u2019m performing?\n\nSearching for an In-network Provider\n\nAlmost every year I have to validate that our various family physicians are still contracted with our health plan. In fact, one of my son\u2019s PCP\u2019s changed practices this year and didn\u2019t tell us. I found out when I started receiving invoices with out of network charges! Sure, I\u2019ll pay $350 for an office visit. Not!\n\nValidating Professional Services for Primary Services Performed at a Facility\n\nClosely related to ensuring coverage by in-network providers, I spent some time this year making sure that radiologists reading various imaging exams performed by a facility that billed separately for their services were also contracted with my health plan. It appears our families various PCP\u2019s will ensure they send an order for imaging to a network facility but then the facility \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 has the image read by an out of network radiologist.
