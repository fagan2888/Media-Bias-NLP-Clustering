Starting in 2008 and continuing through present day, Kristina has been responsible for crafting social media, grassroots, and online strategies for dozens of successful national and state level campaigns.\n\nKristina is the Senior Coalitions Director for the Foundation for Government Accountability - a leading conservative multi-state think tank focused on health care and welfare reform. In addition to TheBlaze, her work has been published at other leading outlets such as IJ Review, HotAir, PJ Media, and the Daily Caller. She is also a frequent guest on both national radio and TV networks such as TheBlazeTV and Fox Business.\n\nWhen New Mexico opted to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, they bought into the whole \u201cfree money\u201d scam believing that it would be easy to pay for new enrollees on the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nWell, as many level-headed people pointed out, nothing is ever really free, and New Mexico would eventually have to cough up the cash to pay for this expansion.\n\nThat day has come, and the bill is unaffordable.\n\nThe Albuquerque Journal reports that \u201cNew Mexico\u2019s budget crunch has left the state facing a $417 million Medicaid shortfall over the next 16 months.\u201d\n\nAs they point out this is likely to mean \u201creduced reimbursement rates for providers and hospitals and, down the road, new mandatory payments for some patients.\u201d This will undoubtedly lead to more health care providers turning away Medicaid patients; a problem that is already hampering access to care in many places across the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind the dramatic shortfall?\n\nHigher than expected enrollment, something else that the state should have foreseen, as it\u2019s a problem seen coast-to-coast in states that expanded Medicaid. Now \u201croughly 850,000 New Mexicans are on the state\u2019s rolls, and that number is expected to rise.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve reported on this issue in New Mexico before. The trend started last spring when enrollment was already nearly 20 percent higher than they had planned. That upward momentum continued into the summer when the rolls ballooned by 46,000 more than initial estimates.\n\nAt the time David Abbey, the director of New Mexico\u2019s Legislative Finance Committee, said there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that the state\u2019s Medicaid spending would \u201cbe the driver of future budget negotiations.\u201d He has been proven to be correct.\n\nThe unexpected costs and poor budget planning at the state\u2019s capitol have led to the problem they are now facing. Last legislative session, the state\u2019s Human Services Department didn\u2019t get enough funding and \u201ccame up $86 million short of what it projected it needed in state funds for the next 16 months.\u201d Washington, D.C. pays New Mexico $3 or $4 for every dollar the state spends, \u201cso the total shortfall balloons to $417 million when the missing federal matching funds are factored in.\u201d\n\nThe state admits that although cost-cutting measures, like provider rate cuts and new co-pays for currently free services are on the table, \u201cmaking up the entire shortfall by cutting costs is impossible.\u201d\n\nJim Hinton, CEO and president of New Mexico\u2019s Presbyterian Healthcare Services, told the Albuquerque Journal that \u201cit\u2019s just simply not possible to take that much money out of Medicaid and not directly affect patients, members and health care providers.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the problem is only set to get worse, as the state\u2019s Human Services Department is estimating that by July of next year, \u201cmore than 925,000 New Mexicans \u2013 nearly half the state\u2019s population \u2013 will be enrolled in Medicaid. That\u2019s up from about 560,000 New Mexicans on Medicaid rolls at the start of 2013.\u201d\n\nEven more drastic budget cuts will need to be made at that point. Schools, public safety, transportation, all those sections of the budget and more will be on the chopping block just to cover the skyrocketing costs of their expanded Medicaid program. New Mexico is already one of the poorest states in the Union, this mistake will only make that worse.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
