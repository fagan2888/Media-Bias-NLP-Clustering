Specifically, the two will be discussing data from the RA-BEACON and RA-BUILD studies at the EULAR Congress in Italy.\n\nAs a quick refresher, Incyte and Lilly announced positive top-line results from the RA-BEACON study in December, noting that it met its primary endpoint of improved ARC20 response relative to the placebo. Estimates on peak sales potential of this oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor range wildly, from the low $1 billion's to as high as $3 billion.\n\nThe other major catalyst, announced last Friday, was that Eli Lilly was partnering with AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) to test its anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in solid tumors. The press release notes that AstraZeneca's MEDI4736 will be tested in combination with Lilly's VEGF receptor 2 antiangiogenic drug Cyramza in patients with advanced solid tumors. Although no financial terms or solid tumor targets were discussed, the simple fact that Lilly has an opportunity to take advantage of the checkpoint inhibitor craze is great news.\n\nNow what: Amazingly enough, Friday's closing price marked a 13-year high for Eli Lilly, which seems mind-boggling considering just how much of its portfolio has been in flux due to patent exclusivity losses. If there is good news to be had here, it's that Eli Lilly is finally past the bulk of its patent woes and, through hefty cost-cutting, can actually get back to reasonable EPS growth.\n\nBut, there's another side to this story too. Lilly's sales have fallen off by close to 20% over the last three fiscal years, to $19.6 billion from $24.3 billion. Lilly has been repurchasing shares and paying an above-average dividend in the meantime, but its outlook through 2018 only calls for revenue growth to average about 3% per year. That's not much considering that Lilly is boasting a forward P/E of 22. Even giving the company the benefit of the doubt, it's still trading at a lofty 18 times its 2018 EPS estimates with a growth rate of roughly 3% per year.\n\nPut plainly, Eli Lilly seems as if it's already fully valued, or perhaps even valued higher than it should be considering its growth prospects. If Eli Lilly can turn its collaborations into something special this could be worth taking a closer look at, but from a fundamental perspective I would suggest keeping your distance from Eli Lilly.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "09:38", "date": "2015-06-04T13:38:00Z", "description": "Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly made double-digit percentage gains in May after two end-of-the month announcements.
