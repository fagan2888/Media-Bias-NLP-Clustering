Brendan Boyle (D-Philadelphia) took some time this morning to sit down with PoliticsPA and discuss why the voters of Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th Congressional District should send him to Congress, and what he would do when he got there.\n\nThis is our third installment of this feature, you can read about Boyle\u2019s competitors, Daylin Leach and Valerie Arkoosh here. Marjorie Margolies\u2019 will be coming next week.\n\nBut, back to Representative Boyle.\n\nWhy do you want to run for Congress?\n\n\u201cI see it actually as an extension I made to leave the private sector and get involved in public service,\u201d Boyle responded to the soft-opener we asked each of the candidates. \u201cI decided to run out a mixture of idealism and frustration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idealism is believing that through politics you make a difference in people\u2019s lives, and I was frustrated with the political climate in Philly: a stale climate that doesn\u2019t welcome change.\u201d\n\nBoyle was elected to the General Assembly in 2008 to represent the 170th legislative district in north Philadelphia. He is the first Democrat to represent that seat.\n\nThe competition & the race\n\nBoyle didn\u2019t dish on his competitors, but sees himself having distinct advantages that will help him win the primary.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that we agree on far more than what we disagree,\u201d Boyle said magnanimously. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference in term of background and biography, all three of my opponents are millionaires or married to one and in a time where income equality is the biggest issue to send someone to Congress who is a part of the wealthiest one percent sends the wrong message.\u201d\n\nHis district now fits within the 13th Congressional, and believes that will help him with name recognition, despite that fact that one of his opponents, Marjorie Margolies, represented the very same seat in the early 90s.\n\n\u201cI think that fortunately I\u2019m very popular in my district, and I\u2019ve benefitted greatly that my brother is popular in his,\u201d Boyle said. His brother, Kevin, was elected to represent a neighboring district in 2010 and the two are the only concurrently serving brothers in the General Assembly.\n\n\u201cWe took Republican seats and made them Democratic, built favorability and name ID,\u201d Boyle explained. \u201cWe start off there but also in Montco, we have really great room to grow. When I talk about the way working families are getting the short end of the stick, that resonates as much as in Lansdale as it does in Philly.\u201d\n\nA brief history of Brendan Boyle\n\nIn a race against a wide field of wealthy opponents, Boyle certainly has a unique story.\n\nHe\u2019s the son of a janitor and an immigrant, the first of his family to go to college (and not just any college, he\u2019s a graduate of the University of Notre Dame and Harvard).\n\n\u201cFor me and my family, I know how hard it was to get to college how hard it was to pay for it,\u201d he said, mentioning the $60,000 he still owes in student loans.\n\nAfter graduation, Boyle worked in private consulting before he made the jump into public service.\n\nHe named Barbara Jordan and Thaddeus Stevens as his congressional role models.\n\n\u201cBeing from Pennsylvania, I have to say Thaddeus Stevens, even though he was a Republican, I admire his commitment to civil rights.\u201d\n\nFor those of you who aren\u2019t history-buff, Ivy-League grads, Stevens represented Pennsylvania\u2019s 9th Congressional District from 1859-1868 and was an outspoken advocate for the abolition of slavery while he was Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, a committee that Boyle himself said he would like to serve.\n\nOn the issues\n\nBoyle made no mistake that his biggest issue would be job creation and retention.\n\n\u201cIn terms of [focusing on] jobs vs deficit, there\u2019s absolutely no question that unemployment and underemployment are more important than the deficit,\u201d Boyle stated. \u201cThe deficit was cut by 50% over the last 5 years, if you look at our real underemployment, they are historicially high.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo instead of focusing on the deficit, the focus should be on unemployment and underemployment and getting people back to work. The average family salary is actually lower than it was 10 years ago and that\u2019s bigger than some abstract argument about the deficit.\u201d\n\nOn social issues, Boyle has been hit for pro-life votes in the House, including one that resulted in the closing of many clinics that provide abortion services across the state.\n\n\u201cI support Roe v Wade and it would be a tragically criminal to interfere with the choices between a woman and her doctor,\u201d Boyle explained. \u201cIn terms of the Gosnell vote, I joined a majority of Democrats in the state legislature [in voting for it.]\u201d\n\nHe also mentioned that he had been the number one target of pro-life groups in SEPA, and is surprised that he\u2019s now being attacked from the opposite side of the argument.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\n\n\u201cThe ACA was such a complex piece of legislation, you have to break it down into its parts,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cWe talk about the ban on denying coverage based on preexisting conditions, making insurance affordable, younger people can stay on their parents insurance through the age of 25, especially given the underemployment of young people. These are all positive things.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a mistake that theres no public option, I don\u2019t know why our side of the aisle gave up and didn\u2019t get a single Republican vote anyway,\u201d Boyle explained, looking at ways he would add to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI think the ACA was an opportunity to insert the bulk purchasing of drugs in the Medicare program and would save millions year after year. Two areas of opportunity for improvement.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC has declared that all of their candidates will run on the merits of the ACA, and nationwide, it will be an issue for congressional candidates.\n\nCongressman Brendan Boyle?\n\n\u201cEven here, I have the reputation of working in a bipartisan way, as opposed to some who just seem to want to go on a talk show and say crazy things, I think its more important to do the hard work,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re at a historic point in the nations history, under investment in infrastructure has been going on for 60 years,\u201d Boyle said, speaking about the work he\u2019d like to do in Congress. \u201cWe\u2019ve fallen behind Europe and Asia on everything from roads to bridges, and even our traditional water, sewer, electric grid. [I\u2019d love to have] the opportunity to serve on Transportation or Ways and Means.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlso if I had my choice and could serve on environment committee, it\u2019s kind of related to this. The revolution that\u2019s going on now thats going on in the energy sector has a lot of impacts but we need to make sure that we are taking care of the resources that we have. I\u2019ve been very active on environmental issues.\u201d\n\nApril 7th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 2 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boyle shares his unique history in a sit-down interview with PoliticsPA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-13-an-exclusive-interview-with-brendan-boyle/56713/", "description": "Boyle shares his unique history in a sit-down interview with PoliticsPA.", "title": "PA-13: An Exclusive Interview With Brendan Boyle"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "pa 13,boyle,interview", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10c4\"", "article_summary": "Congressman Brendan Boyle?\nPA-13: An Exclusive Interview With Brendan BoyleWritten by Brittany Foster, Managing EditorState Rep.
