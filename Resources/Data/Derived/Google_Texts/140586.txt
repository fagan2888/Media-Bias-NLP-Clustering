An advocacy group for the disabled claims that portions of the newly minted Denver Union Station are not friendly toward those who use wheelchairs.

The Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) and individual plaintiffs Julie Reiskin and Tom Carter filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court on Monday, targeting the city and county of Denver and the Regional Transportation District.

Both plaintiffs say the revamped Union Station is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Namely, the city and RTD constructed a raised area near the station’s Great Hall that is open to the public but that is inaccessible to those using wheelchairs.

The raised area can be reached only by steps and is essentially off-limits to wheelchair users. The area features seating and shuffleboard tables, Reiskin said.

Reiskin, executive director of the coalition, noted that Union Station opened July 26, which also was the 24th anniversary of the ADA becoming law.

“We have needed to bring lawsuits against RTD and Denver before to get them to comply with the law,” said Reiskin, who uses a wheelchair. “It stands to reason that they would want the new Union Station to be open and usable by everyone.”

Denver officials could not be reached for comment. RTD spokeswoman Pauletta Tonilas said the agency had not been served with the lawsuit and has not had the opportunity to review the specific allegations.

The coalition has previously sued Denver and RTD over access issues. In October, it alleged RTD bus operators were not enforcing ADA rules that required wheelchair areas and aisles to be kept clear of baby strollers, packages and grocery carts. A settlement agreement prompted RTD to launch an education campaign.

“RTD is partnering with CCDC on other issues affecting transit and is disappointed that CCDC did not choose to first notify RTD of its concerns with the historic Union Station building,” RTD’s Tonilas said.
