Count the ways.\n\nThere\u2019s taking on the risk of participating in the public exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act that are now (if quite shakily) available to consumers. Health insurers are also now forced to make assumptions for purposes of financial planning and forecasts based on massive government programs they\u2019ve never before had to factor in. Another major consideration is staying current in an environment where business is transferring from group health plans to retail plans, a trend that\u2019s likely to not only continue but to accelerate.\n\nFailure to act with foresight and determination could be fatal. \u201cIf we stayed on the path that\u2019s been successful for us, we might find ourselves irrelevant in two or three years,\u201d says Ken Avner, finance chief at Health Care Service Corp.\n\nHCSC is the largest \u201cmutual legal reserve\u201d heath insurance company \u2014 i.e., a nonprofit insurer owned by its policyholders \u2014 in the United States. The company, which operates the Blue Cross Blue Shield businesses in Illinois, Texas, New Mexico, Montana and Oklahoma, says it uses its earnings to support its financial stability, provide members with high service levels and broad medical-provider networks, and temper rate increases.\n\nAvner is now completing his third year as finance chief at HCSC, where he\u2019s worked for 27 years. Until he became CFO he was a career actuary. In the fall of 2010, when he was the firm\u2019s chief actuary, HCSC\u2019s CFO retired and the company decided to merge its finance and actuarial departments, with Avner leading the combined unit.\n\nAvner recently spoke with CFO about the impact of health-care reform, his role and his efforts to make HCSC a less-conservative company. An edited transcript of the discussion follows.\n\nAfter an actuarial career, were you prepared to take over finance for such a large company?\n\nIt\u2019s not like I have no accounting background. One of the requirements for an actuary is that you have a certain amount of insurance-accounting education. Also, I come from a family of CPAs. I did a lot of hanging around with accountants growing up. And I have an excellent accounting staff.\n\nOur CEO felt we weren\u2019t taking advantage of some synergies that we could have, and also that because we\u2019re entering a chaotic couple of years with the Affordable Care Act, it would be useful to get finance and actuarial more closely integrated.\n\nIn general, why does it make sense to have an actuary be CFO of an insurance carrier?\n\nActuaries are used to dealing with uncertainty, modeling alternatives and communicating a financial story with alternatives. In this time of chaos, especially because we are not a publicly held company, understanding the various alternatives our company faces is paramount.\n\nActuaries are the engineers of the insurance business. What should the product look like, how should we build it, how do we make sure it stays modern? Actuaries have a different view of what the insurance business is than, say, somebody who comes from the accounting side.\n\nHow would you describe the \u201cchaos\u201d you referred to?\n\nThe ACA completely changes the way we\u2019re looking at our business. We, like the health insurance industry generally, were already moving toward more retail business because of the private exchanges. It was clear 10 years ago that changes were coming. But clearly, the ACA put change on a particular path, and the public exchanges have accelerated the change much faster than would otherwise have been the case.\n\nOn top of that, we have to deal with the so-called three R\u2019s \u2014 the ACA\u2019s reinsurance program, risk-adjustment program and risk corridor, all designed to mitigate health-insurance carriers\u2019 risk. Without them, the drain on the market [from taking on millions of previously uninsured people with chronic conditions, as they must do starting in 2014] would be so bad that no carriers would have participated in the public exchanges.\n\nIt means that our financials, even for 2014, will be filled with a lot of estimates of numbers that nobody has had to estimate in the past. I\u2019m talking about hundreds of millions of dollars recovered through the reinsurance program alone. Nobody has run anything like that program before, the rules aren\u2019t completely written, and it\u2019s going to be an estimate as to how big those receivables are.\n\nDo you have projections for how many healthy people will buy insurance for the first time because of the individual mandate?\n\nWe do. Not only how many will buy, but who: people from high-risk pools, people coming out of group insurance, individuals, people from Medicaid. You might guess that we have very complicated models for this. And we do \u2014 but they\u2019re all based on significant assumptions.\n\nAre you comfortable about being in the public exchanges yourself?\n\nWe made a decision to go all in on the exchanges very early on. It\u2019s interesting \u2014 I remember hearing the CEO of Aetna say during a Wall Street session that \u201cif this is a land grab, we\u2019re sitting it out.\u201d And it turns out that Aetna is participating in a big way through its acquisition of Coventry.\n\nWe had to revamp our whole retail model, even though we had a very large and successful one, to take on millions of new members who we were not otherwise going to get. I\u2019m assuming the government will eventually get its exchange act together.\n\nWe\u2019re making a lot of changes. Three or four years ago we decided to enter the government market, meaning Medicare and Medicaid management, in a much bigger way. Before that we hadn\u2019t been a Medicaid player at all and had just dabbled a little in Medicare. We\u2019re now a Medicaid contract holder in Texas and also in New Mexico, which has a high percentage of Medicaid enrollees. We were just accepted as a managed Medicaid player in Illinois, and two years ago we started a Medicare Advantage program that\u2019s growing.\n\nGetting into a business where we don\u2019t have a long history of success is a challenge. We had people saying, \u201cWhy are we doing this? Why don\u2019t we just continue operating along the path that\u2019s been successful for us?\u201d So as a management group we had to show them what the future was probably going to look like.\n\nWhat else are you doing to prepare for the future?\n\nWe\u2019ve historically had a pretty conservative investment portfolio. Actually it was incredibly conservative. That was probably appropriate for an insurance company, because it\u2019s a risky business to begin with. And there is also a fair amount of regulation that forces us to be relatively conservative.\n\nBut there are a lot of small but good ideas, in some cases disruptive ideas, that are looking for funding. My position now is that as we enter what I see as a very uncertain future, it\u2019s less risky for us to get involved in some of them than to just sit here in a big castle saying that those shots will never get over our walls.\n\nWe had made an investment from our venture capital fund in [private-exchange player] Bloom Health, but it was something we thought we should get involved with. So we, along with Michigan Wellpoint, bought it out from the owners. I\u2019m on the board. We\u2019ve used that to help us understand the move to private exchanges. It\u2019s a good example of trying to get an understanding of getting involved with smaller companies that may be disrupters.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "aca, actuary, affordable care act, blue cross blue shield, hcsc, health care service corp., insurance, ken avner, medicaid, medicare", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is reshaping the business of carriers like Health Care Service Corp., but CFO Ken Avner is taking charge of the future.", "title": "CFO of HCSC, Ken Avner, on Insurance and Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2013/11/Avner-Head-Shot-2008-200x300.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-04T14:26:50+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/risk-management/2013/11/health-insurer-cfo-grapples-obamacare-impact/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is reshaping the business of carriers like Health Care Service Corp., but CFO Ken Avner is taking charge of the future.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "CFO of HCSC, Ken Avner, on Insurance and Obamacare", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "topicRoot": "Risk & Compliance", "topic": "Risk Management", "headline": "Health-Insurer CFO Grapples with Obamacare Impact", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Health-Insurer CFO Grapples with Obamacare Impact\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/risk-management\\/2013\\/11\\/health-insurer-cfo-grapples-obamacare-impact\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-07 14:36:10\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-11-04 14:26:50\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22789,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"ACA\",\"Actuary\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Blue Cross Blue Shield\",\"HCSC\"],\"categories\":[\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"People\",\"Risk &amp; Compliance\",\"Risk Management\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/11\\/Avner-Head-Shot-2008.jpg\"}", "date": 20131107, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Risk Management", "tag": "Medicare", "published_time": "2013-11-07T14:36:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-04T14:26:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is reshaping the business of carriers like Health Care Service Corp., but CFO Ken Avner is taking charge of the future."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb2f\"", "article_summary": "Actuaries have a different view of what the insurance business is than, say, somebody who comes from the accounting side.\nAvner recently spoke with CFO about the impact of health-care reform, his role and his efforts to make HCSC a less-conservative company.\nActuaries are the engineers of the insurance business.\nWe, like the health insurance industry generally, were already moving toward more retail business because of the private exchanges.\nThat was probably appropriate for an insurance company, because it\u2019s a risky business to begin with."}
