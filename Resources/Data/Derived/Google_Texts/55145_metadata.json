Bobby Jindal, speaks at the RedState Gathering, Friday, Aug. 7, 2015, in Atlanta. (Photo: David Goldman, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Just before Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal stepped on stage in New Orleans to announce his bid for president in June, the Rev. Mark Foster and a handful of pastors from across the state prayed with him.\n\n\u201cHe has good Christian values that definitely resonate with me and much of the Christian community,\u2019\u2019 said Foster, pastor of the Pentecostals of the Twin Cities in West Monroe. \u201cI think it would resonate with many, many people. ... If he gets in there and actually is able to get his message out in these (early-voting) states, I think he can stand a good chance.\u2019\u2019\n\nJindal, who just wrapped up a five-day campaign swing in Iowa and returns there Sunday, also hopes his message of faith resonates with voters as he courts evangelicals, who are influential in states where ballots are cast early in the presidential nominating contest.\n\nBut political experts say Jindal faces a major challenge standing out among a field of 17 GOP candidates, including better-known contenders targeting the same voters, such as former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s certainly trying,\u2019\u2019 said John Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cHowever, when you have Mike Huckabee in the race, it\u2019s kind of hard to be the most evangelical guy out there.\u201d\n\nOn the campaign trail, Jindal, 44, repeatedly touts his faith and family values, including his opposition to abortion and to legalizing same-sex marriage. He also often talks about his conversion from Hinduism to Catholicism and the need to protect religious freedom.\n\n\u201cThe governor is a fervent defender of religious freedom rights and will continue fighting to preserve the First Amendment,\u2019\u2019 said Shannon Dirmann, a Jindal spokeswoman. \u201cHe is also not afraid to talk about his faith and finding Jesus Christ. That said, he doesn\u2019t believe in dividing Americans and is going after 100 percent of the vote.\u2019\u2019\n\nA July Washington Post-ABC News poll of Republican-leaning voters who are white evangelicals put Jindal\u2019s support at 3% among GOP presidential contenders. Donald Trump was the most popular at 20%, followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (14%) and Huckabee (12%). Santorum had just 2%.\n\nDirmann dismisses early polls, calling them \u201cfluid and topsy-turvy.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cRepublican voters are kicking the tires, as is their right to do,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cMomentum is building and voters are signing up at our town halls.\u2019\u2019\n\nJindal not only hasn\u2019t distinguished himself, but appears to be \u201cgetting increasingly desperate\u2019\u2019 and making comments \u201calmost to the point of sheer madness,\u2019\u2019 said Albert Samuels, chairman of the Political Science and Criminal Justice Department at Southern University at Baton Rouge.\n\nSamuels pointed to Jindal\u2019s comments in June that Louisiana wouldn\u2019t recognize gay marriages despite the Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. Jindal has since said the state will comply.\n\nEarlier this month, Jindal announced plans to stop reimbursing Planned Parenthood for services provided to Medicaid recipients. Federal health officials, however, warned this week that the state may be violating federal law.\n\n\u201cThese are desperate attempts by this governor to somehow distinguish himself,\u2019\u2019 Samuels said. \u201cYou have to keep upping the ante.\u2019\u2019\n\nPitney said many GOP candidates are talking about religion, noting that Huckabee is a former preacher and Walker repeatedly reminds audiences his father was a preacher. And retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u201cmight as well be a preacher,\u2019\u2019 Pitney said.\n\n\u201cThe question is, what is Bobby Jindal\u2019s unique selling proposition?\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a clear answer to that question. Most people aren\u2019t even noticing him.\u2019\u2019\n\nBut the Rev. Gene Mills, president of the Louisiana Families Forum in Baton Rouge, said it\u2019s hard for \u201cthe most normal\u2019\u2019 GOP candidates, such as Jindal, to attract media attention.\n\n\u201cAs long as the debates remain the zoo-like environment that the media\u2019s been fixated on creating, we\u2019re going to have the funniest animal at the zoo who gets the most attention,\u2019\u2019 said Mills, who said he\u2019s been Jindal\u2019s prayer partner for more than a decade.\n\nDemocratic critics say Jindal\u2019s efforts haven\u2019t worked.\n\n\u201cHis numbers in the polls say all that need to be said,\u201d said former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing about Gov. Jindal that would warrant him getting more than 1 percent in the polls. What would he have to offer the country? He\u2019s left the state budget in shambles. He\u2019s raided every trust fund \u2014 left us a deficit as far as the eye could see.\u2019\u2019\n\nJindal supporters counter that he\u2019s been in the forefront on key issues, including vowing not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling the young man might be what everybody\u2019s looking for \u2014 they just hadn\u2019t noticed that guy who keeps generating all these good ideas,\u2019\u2019 said Mills. \u201cIt ain\u2019t courting. He\u2019s a covenant brother and he\u2019s been that way for a long time. He just does so naturally.\u2019\u2019\n\nFollow @dberrygannett on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TCghJI", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Louisiana Gov.
