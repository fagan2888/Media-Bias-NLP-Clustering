Federal appeals courts don\u2019t grant this sort of \u201cen banc\u201d rehearing very frequently. They do so only when the stakes of the case are big and when they think the initial decision is suspect. (It takes a majority of active judges to grant such a hearing.) \u201cAt a minimum, it signals discomfort from a majority of the Court with the [three-judge] panel\u2019s reasoning,\u201d says Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor who has followed the case closely and written frequently about it.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee that a majority of judges on the D.C. Circuit will ultimately vote to overturn the initial decision. But there are many reasons to think that\u2019s what will happen, for reasons that Ian Millhiser lays out clearly at ThinkProgress. The lawsuits\u2019 architects claim that Obamacare authorizes the federal government to help people pay for private insurance only in those states that have taken it upon themselves to reorganize and operate new insurance markets. The basis for that claim is some ambiguous language in one key section of the law. The law\u2019s supporters, including just about everybody who worked on the legislation or followed its journey through Congress, say that\u2019s nonsense\u2014the ambiguity is merely a drafting error, the kind that happens all the time in complex legislation. The law\u2019s supporters also point to prevailing legal doctrine, under which courts defer to executive agencies when legal language is ambiguous.\n\nThe supporters\u2019 arguments (which, as readers know, I support wholeheartedly) prevailed with federal trial judges who heard two of these cases initially. While that two-to-one majority on the D.C. Circuit overturned one of those verdicts, a three-judge panel from the Fourth Circuit upheld the other one\u2014and did so unanimously. In other words, so far the arguments have convinced only two federal judges, both of whom happened to be Republican appointees. The majority of sitting judges on the D.C. Circuit are Democratic appointees and now, thanks to the en banc hearing, the case is in their hands.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "What it means and how the legal challenge could play out", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "The challenge lives, but its vital signs are looking a lot worse.", "title": "Obamacare Lawsuits Suffer a Big Blow", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/3ebff9657a4c441c7b25c6fc25d869bdd096ebba.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119318/obamacare-lawsuits-dc-circuit-grants-en-banc-hearing-halbig", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/3ebff9657a4c441c7b25c6fc25d869bdd096ebba.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Obamacare Lawsuits Suffer a Big Blow", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The challenge lives, but its vital signs are looking a lot worse."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/3ebff9657a4c441c7b25c6fc25d869bdd096ebba.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obamacare Lawsuits Just Suffered a Big Setback\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119318/obamacare-lawsuits-dc-circuit-grants-en-banc-hearing-halbig\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-04T15:43:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119318,\"author\":\"Jonathan Cohn\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"QED\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"Halbig\",\"subsidies\",\"lawsuit\",\"Circuit Court\",\"textualism\",\"Libertarian\",\"Michael Cannon\",\"Jonathan Adler\",\"Nicholas Bagley\",\"Simon Lazarus\",\"Supreme Court\",\"Antonin Scalia\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-09-04"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc176\"", "article_summary": "In other words, so far the arguments have convinced only two federal judges, both of whom happened to be Republican appointees.\nCircuit are Democratic appointees and now, thanks to the en banc hearing, the case is in their hands.\nCircuit overturned one of those verdicts, a three-judge panel from the Fourth Circuit upheld the other one\u2014and did so unanimously.\nFederal appeals courts don\u2019t grant this sort of \u201cen banc\u201d rehearing very frequently.\nThat doesn\u2019t guarantee that a majority of judges on the D.C."}
