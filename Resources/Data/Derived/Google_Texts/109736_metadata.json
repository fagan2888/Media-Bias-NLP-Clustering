(JASON REED / REUTERS)\n\n4458013\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy stated on Wednesday during an interview with \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that not only is medical marijuana effective for some medical conditions, but its effectiveness means that a switch in federal drug policy may be on the horizon.\n\nAccording to Murthy, medical marijuana has significant policy implications, one of which is additional pressure to reclassify marijuana and remove its status as a Schedule 1 drug, since the Schedule 1 category is normally reserved for drugs without any medical value, Marijuana.com reports.\n\n\u201cWe have some preliminary data showing that for certain medical conditions and symptoms, that marijuana can be helpful,\u201d Murthy stated. \u201cI think that we have to use that data to drive policymaking.\u201d\n\nMurthy, a 37-year-old graduate from Yale University Medical School, was recently confirmed by the Senate as the 19th surgeon general of the United States by a 51-43 vote in December 2014. At his Senate confirmation hearing, Murthy told the panel that he didn\u2019t recommend marijuana.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good habit to use marijuana. If I had kids, I would tell them not to use it,\u201d Murthy stated, also remarking that more research needs to be done before final conclusions.\n\nBut his tune changed on Wednesday morning, following the Obama administration\u2019s trend of a friendlier approach to marijuana. In a recent interview, President Obama predicted that more states will continue to legalize the drug and stated that the Department of Justice isn\u2019t interested in wasting enforcement resources to crack down on the still illegal substance.

Marijuana Legalization Into Obama\u2019s Budget)\n\n\u201cDr. Murthy\u2019s comments add to a growing consensus in the medical community that marijuana can help people suffering from painful conditions,\u201d Tom Angell, chairman of the Marijuana Majority, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy that federal law still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, a category that\u2019s supposed to be reserved for substances with no medical value. In light of these comments from his top medical adviser, the president should direct the attorney general to immediately begin the process of rescheduling marijuana.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that a surgeon general has been sympathetic to marijuana. During the Clinton administration, surgeon general Jocelyn Elders argued that the U.S. should push for legalization, but in 1993, few were ready for such a proposal, and there was little to no political will from which to draw. Since then, Elders has actively supported medical marijuana laws across the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what effect Murthy\u2019s remarks will have, but they may signal that the Obama administration is considering moving the Schedule 1 reclassification process forward through the attorney general.\n\nFollow Jonah Bennett on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
