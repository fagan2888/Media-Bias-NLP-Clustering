The event, which was hosted by the Center for Student Involvement and the Freshman Urban Program, brought Chicago artists to Northwestern\u2019s campus.\n\nChicago singers, dancers, comedians and spoken word artists performed for a crowd of over 100 students in Fisk Hall on Wednesday night as part of the first ever NU Arts Night.\n\n\u201cChicago is definitely going through a cultural renaissance,\u201d said emcee Kevin Coval, an organizer of \u201cLouder Than a Bomb,\u201d one of the country\u2019s largest youth poetry festivals. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a lot of violence, a lot of closed schools, a lot of gentrification, a lot of industrialization. And in the wake of that destruction is creation.\u201d\n\nSponsored by Northwestern\u2019s Center for Student Involvement and the Freshman Urban Program, NU Arts Night is the first event FUP has organized outside of its pre-Wildcat Welcome orientation program.\n\n\u201cNormally FUP Arts Night happens during the pre-orientation program week,\u201d said Taylor Billings, a former co-chair of FUP. \u201cWe bring in artists from Chicago as well as Northwestern just to showcase their talent to the freshmen.\u201d\n\nBillings, a Weinberg senior, said they noticed there wasn\u2019t anything like FUP Arts Night for the rest of NU and decided to bring it to non-FUP students this year.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted to bridge the gap between Northwestern and Chicago culture as well as address some of the extreme social justice issues that exist in Chicago,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first performers of the night were semi-finalists from this year\u2019s \u201cLouder Than a Bomb\u201d competition. A group from Maine East High School performed a spoken-word piece titled \u201cShortcuts.\u201d\n\nThe crowd snapped and cheered when the group spoke about how about how people today are obsessed with \u201cquantity over quality, efficiency over excellence, speed over service.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t want to talk to your kids about sex?\u201d they during the piece. \u201cBan sex ed. Don\u2019t want to examine your beliefs about sexuality? Ban gay marriage. Don\u2019t want to admit you\u2019re racist? Blame Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPoet and visual artist Krista Franklin performed after, reading one of her poems and talking about her artwork, most of which focuses on issues of race, gender and class.\n\n\u201cI learned the art of collage through watching my family make something out of nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really where my collage aesthetic comes from. It comes from an idea of necessity, you know, how you make something beautiful out of scraps.\u201d\n\nBillings said Chicago has a \u201cwealth of diversity and a wealth of culture\u201d that NU students aren\u2019t always exposed to.\n\n\u201cThere are issues we talk about in the classroom but they also exist in Chicago, in real life, and it\u2019s important to get your hands on those, to really face the issues,\u201d she said.\n\nOther acts of the night included multi-genre singer, pianist and composer Akenya Seymour; comedian Calvin Evans; poet Malcolm London and dance ensemble The FootworKINGz.\n\nCommunication senior Bea Cordelia performed a spoken word poem about her transgender identity and German roots.\n\n\u201cThat my people have always been murdered and are still today subjected to infected needles and gunshots is the subject of my poem,\u201d she said during her performance.\n\nCoval, who is also a co-founder of \u201cLouder Than a Bomb,\u201d helped organize the event. He said he wanted to bring a diverse group of artists from multiple genres to show students how broad Chicago\u2019s art scene is.\n\n\u201cWe had folks from the South Side, North Side and even suburbs,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a good representation of some of the spaces that exist in the city.\u201d\n\nWeinberg junior Stephanie Brock-Wilson said she found out about NU Arts Night from her friends in FUP and really enjoyed the performances.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s such a cultural scene in Chicago that we often don\u2019t partake in because we\u2019re up in Evanston,\u201d she told The Daily. \u201cThere was so much talent on the stage tonight and it was great to experience that.\u201d\n\nEmail: [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Northwestern", "description": "Chicago singers, dancers, comedians and spoken word artists performed for a crowd of over 100 students in Fisk Hall on Wednesday night as part of the first ever NU Arts Night. \u201cChicago is definitely going through a cultural renaissance,\u201d said emcee Kevin Coval, an organizer of \u201cLouder Than a Bomb,\u201d one of the country\u2019s largest...", "title": "NU Arts Night brings Chicago artists to Northwestern", "url": "http://dailynorthwestern.com/2015/05/21/campus/nu-arts-night-brings-chicago-artists-to-northwestern/", "image": "http://dailynorthwestern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ARTS_SophieMann-900x598.jpg", "type": "article"}, "robots": "follow, all", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": "10206467072817791,100000535384181", "app_id": 545410622222566}, "article": {"section": "Campus", "tag": "Akenya Seymour,Bea Cordelia,Calvin Evans,Center for Student Involvement,Freshman Urban Program,Kevin Coval,Krista Franklin,Louder Than a Bomb,Maine East High School,Malcolm London,NU Arts Night,Stephanie Brock-Wilson,Taylor Billings,The FootworkKINGz"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Northwestern University and Evanston's Only Daily News Source Since 1881"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe36e8\"", "article_summary": "Bea Cordelia performs a poem at NU Arts Night on Wednesday night.\n\u201cNormally FUP Arts Night happens during the pre-orientation program week,\u201d said Taylor Billings, a former co-chair of FUP.\nChicago singers, dancers, comedians and spoken word artists performed for a crowd of over 100 students in Fisk Hall on Wednesday night as part of the first ever NU Arts Night.\nAnd in the wake of that destruction is creation.\u201dSponsored by Northwestern\u2019s Center for Student Involvement and the Freshman Urban Program, NU Arts Night is the first event FUP has organized outside of its pre-Wildcat Welcome orientation program.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with a lot of violence, a lot of closed schools, a lot of gentrification, a lot of industrialization."}
