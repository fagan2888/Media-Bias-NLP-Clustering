Bobby Jindal (R) is leaving behind. Mr. Jindal put ideological purity over prudence, the Grover Norquist no-tax pledge over good policy. The result has been, as with Kansas under Gov. Sam Brownback (R), a state-level conservative experiment gone awry.\n\nEither candidate who sought to succeed Mr. Jindal would have been an upgrade. Mr. Edwards and Mr. Vitter both rightly criticized the outgoing governor\u2019s plans to fill massive budget gaps. The latest is a $500 million midyear hole that the state\u2019s leaders are trying to close. It appears the \u201csolution\u201d will involve digging more into health-care funding and pushing some payments off into the next fiscal year \u2014 making budget imbalances the next governor\u2019s problem.\n\nThis is the same basic budget strategy Mr. Jindal\u2019s Louisiana has used for some time: loot the state\u2019s rainy-day funds and other one-time sources while cutting education and other state programs. The outgoing governor\u2019s last budget raised some revenue through cigarette taxes and other measures, but it clearly wasn\u2019t enough given the midyear fiscal straits the state is dealing with now. While it\u2019s true that the energy-rich state\u2019s revenue has suffered from the drop in oil prices, Mr. Jindal\u2019s mismanagement \u2014 optimized to appeal to voters in GOP presidential primaries \u2014 has been a major contributor to the problem.\n\nMr. Jindal also bears responsibility for his decision to \u201cfight Obamacare\u201d by refusing to accept federal funds to expand Louisiana\u2019s Medicaid program. Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the federal government has offered to foot practically the entire bill for increasing access to the health-coverage program to very-low-income workers. Analysis after analysis in state after state has shown that there are no good reasons, beyond anti-Obamacare demagoguery, for states to reject the Medicaid expansion. In Louisiana, 192,000 people would receive access to health-care coverage. Without the expansion, these people end up with less help than do those who earn far more.\n\nMr. Edwards vows to make Medicaid expansion a top priority, and we hope that he will be able to negotiate an agreement with the GOP-dominated legislature to make that happen. Republican-run states such as Arkansas and Indiana have struck deals with the federal government that allow them to use Medicaid expansion funds to experiment with GOP-friendly public-private coverage health-care models. This should be on the table in Louisiana.\n\nIf, that is, Louisiana\u2019s leaders have time to think about anything other than the state\u2019s fiscal mess. With another budget deficit projected for next year, Mr. Edwards is promising to call a special legislative session in February, and he\u2019s looking to raise badly needed revenue by rolling back various state tax breaks. Not yet known is how long it will take to undo the damage of the Jindal years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic Gov.-elect Jon Bel Edwards inherits a conservative experiment gone awry.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Democratic Gov.-elect Jon Bel Edwards inherits a conservative experiment gone awry.", "title": "Cleaning up Bobby Jindal\u2019s mess in Louisiana", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cleaning-up-bobby-jindals-mess-in-louisiana/2015/11/26/58cd4e2c-9231-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/26/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Jindal_Returns-0a99a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "postopinions"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cleaning-up-bobby-jindals-mess-in-louisiana/2015/11/26/58cd4e2c-9231-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "louisiana, governor, election, gubernatorial, john bel edwards, david vitter, bobby jindal, tax pledge, grover norquist, tax cuts, budget, medicaid, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpostopinions"}, "eomportal-uuid": "58cd4e2c-9231-11e5-b5e4-279b4501e8a6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "louisiana, governor, election, gubernatorial, john bel edwards, david vitter, bobby jindal, tax pledge, grover norquist, tax cuts, budget, medicaid, obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Jindal put ideological purity over prudence, the Grover Norquist no-tax pledge over good policy.\nEither candidate who sought to succeed Mr. Jindal would have been an upgrade.\nMr. Edwards and Mr. Vitter both rightly criticized the outgoing governor\u2019s plans to fill massive budget gaps.\nMr. Jindal also bears responsibility for his decision to \u201cfight Obamacare\u201d by refusing to accept federal funds to expand Louisiana\u2019s Medicaid program.\nAnalysis after analysis in state after state has shown that there are no good reasons, beyond anti-Obamacare demagoguery, for states to reject the Medicaid expansion."}
