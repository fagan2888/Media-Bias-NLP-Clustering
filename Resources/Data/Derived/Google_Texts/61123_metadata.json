The bill passed 22-13, leaving supporters two \u201cyes\u201d votes short of the two-thirds majority needed to override an expected veto by Gov. Paul LePage. The House could vote next week.\n\nThe poll was paid for by Action Point Campaigns, a consulting firm in Florida that has the same address as Strategic Advocacy, a political consulting firm that has operated in multiple Maine campaigns and is active in Florida.\n\nStrategic Advocacy is run by Roy Lenardson, a 20-year veteran of Maine politics and an adjunct fellow for the Maine Heritage Policy Center, a conservative advocacy group that opposes the expansion of Medicaid. The firm has locations in Augusta and Ave Maria, Fla., a planned college community that is led by Tom Monaghan, a Roman Catholic philanthropist who founded Domino\u2019s Pizza.\n\nStrategic Advocacy is also affiliated with the Foundation of Government Accountability, a conservative advocacy group led by Tarren Bragdon, a former head of the Maine Heritage Policy Center. Both groups have vigorously opposed expansion of Medicaid in Maine and Florida.\n\nBragdon, who lives in Ave Maria and whom Lenardson describes as a close friend, was at the State House during the buildup to Wednesday\u2019s Senate vote. His organization deployed a social media campaign last week opposing Medicaid expansion.\n\nLenardson confirmed Thursday that his firm was commissioned to conduct the poll, which he said reached 600 to 900 people. He would not say who commissioned it, citing client confidentiality.\n\nLenardson denied that the survey was a push poll, saying it was intended to determine how voters would respond to certain information or arguments.\n\n\u201cBasically, it\u2019s typical message testing,\u201d he said. He said the messages are no different from expansion advocates\u2019 claims that 157 Mainers will die if the Legislature doesn\u2019t vote to expand MaineCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nThe Portland Press Herald obtained a partial audio clip of the poll. The questions were primarily about Medicaid expansion and support for Gov. Paul LePage, a staunch opponent of the proposal before the Legislature.\n\nThe survey began by asking respondents whom they favor in this year\u2019s gubernatorial race: LePage, Democrat Mike Michaud or independent Eliot Cutler. It then described Medicaid expansion as providing health care coverage to thousands of \u201cable-bodied\u201d Mainers. It asked respondents if they would be more or less supportive of expansion if they knew that \u201calmost one in three Mainers eligible for expansion are former prison inmates.\u201d\n\nThe computerized caller also asked a series of questions about whether respondents would support expansion if they knew it would cause funding cuts to other state programs and veterans benefits; prolong the wait for severely disabled people who need additional Medicaid benefits; or increase health care costs.\n\nSOURCE OF INMATES CLAIM UNCLEAR\n\nAside from the inmate question, several questions reflected familiar talking points of expansion opponents. Lenardson said that he didn\u2019t know where the claim about inmates originated, and that his firm only edits questions for \u201cgrammatical errors, not content.\u201d\n\nAn article published Sunday in The New York Times cited estimates by health care analysts and the U.S. Department of Justice that as many as 35 percent of the people who have gained eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have had contact with the criminal justice system. Those people were not necessarily incarcerated.\n\nThe Times also reported that states with expanded Medicaid eligibility are actively enrolling inmates.\n\nMedicaid, in Maine and elsewhere, does not cover standard health care for inmates unless they\u2019re hospitalized for more than 24 hours. Instead, states contract with private providers to give inmates care.\n\nStates that expand Medicaid will receive 100 percent federal reimbursement for inmates\u2019 hospital visits of more than 24 hours until 2016. The reimbursement will gradually go down to 90 percent thereafter. Maine typically pays one-third of claim costs now.\n\nNational corrections officials \u2013 and people who testified in support of Maine\u2019s expansion bill \u2013 say that enrolling inmates in Medicaid would allow them to have coverage when they get out. Proponents say that could mean fewer of them would end up back in prison or need hospital charity care.\n\nProviding coverage for former prisoners is a positive result of Medicaid expansion, said Sara Gagne-Holmes, executive director of Maine Equal Justice Partners, an advocacy group for the poor and a supporter of expansion.\n\n\u201c(The poll) makes it sound like a negative, but providing these people care is a good thing and could save money,\u201d she said.\n\nIn Arkansas a Medicaid feasbility study by the Alexander Group \u2014 the controversial firm contracted by Maine\u2019s DHHS \u2014 found that the expansion would yield an annual savings in that state\u2019s corrections budget of between $3.5 million and $4.5 million because of the increased federal match rate and other factors.\n\nThe Alexander Group did not conduct such a savings analysis in its Maine analysis for corrections, or any other program affected by expansion.\n\nAN ATTEMPT TO INFLUENCE OPINIONS?\n\nLenardson said he expects his client to publicize the poll results soon. If the message about Medicaid and prisoners polls well, it could become part of the debate as the House takes up the expansion bill next week. Or it could become a message in this year\u2019s legislative and gubernatorial races.\n\nThe definition of a push poll varies, and Maine\u2019s legal definition is narrower than guidelines endorsed by national polling experts.\n\nState election law defines push polls as paid telephone surveys that refer to candidates or groups of candidates \u201cother than in a basic preference question.\u201d The definition does not include specific issues.\n\nOther standards for a Maine push poll include failure to ask demographic questions about a respondent\u2019s age, income or if they\u2019re a likely voter \u2013 questions that don\u2019t appear to have been asked in this week\u2019s Medicaid survey.\n\nPaul Lavin, assistant director of the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, listened to audio of the survey. He said it appeared that the survey was geared toward getting reaction to certain messages, but he acknowledged that it focused solely on presumed negative aspects of expansion.\n\nThe American Association for Public Opinion Research describes push polls as an \u201cinsidious form of negative campaigning, disguised as a political poll.\u201d\n\nIt adds: \u201c \u2018Push polls\u2019 are not surveys at all, but rather unethical political telemarketing.\u201d\n\nPush polls often are done before elections and are designed to influence voters. However, they can sometimes be used by legislative leaders to influence votes among lawmakers, meaning the poll done Wednesday could be used to preserve Republican opposition to Medicaid expansion through upcoming votes in the House and Senate.\n\nSteve Mistler can be contacted at 791-6345 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @stevemistler", "article_metadata": {"description": "Were the calls to hundreds of Mainers asking negative questions on expansion an attempt to influence opinions?
