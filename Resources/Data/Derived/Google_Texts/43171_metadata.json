The center does not plan to treat patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to work with existing services,\u201d said Matt Vogl, executive director of the new center.\n\nPart of its role, he said, will be to help businesses, schools and first responders recognize signs of mental illnesses early, when they are easiest to treat. He likened that role to backstage workers at a theater production.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just there to get them up and running,\u201d he said, \u201chelping do whatever needs to be done.\u201d\n\nIn a 2014 series, The Denver Post reported that Colorado spends relatively little for mental health services, that tens of thousands of people who need treatment get none and that prisons end up housing many people with advanced mental illnesses.\n\nIn December 2014, Colorado received a $65 million grant for mental health programs. A coalition of Colorado experts has been working to help primary care physicians and pediatricians add mental health therapists to their practices.\n\nVogl said the university grant is separate, but the center may work with the state on elements of mental health care such as suicide prevention.\n\n\u201cThere are few areas of health care more important and less understood than mental and behavioral health,\u201d university president Bruce Benson said of the pledge. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more grateful for their continued philanthropic partnership.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU gets $10 million pledge for mental health services training", "title": "CU gets $10 million pledge for mental health services training", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/25/cu-gets-10-million-pledge-for-mental-health-services-training/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-25T12:58:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-25T12:58:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "higher education, K-12 education"}, "article_summary": "A $10 million pledge will help the University of Colorado create a center dedicated to improving mental health services in Colorado.\n\u201cThere are few areas of health care more important and less understood than mental and behavioral health,\u201d university president Bruce Benson said of the pledge.\nIn December 2014, Colorado received a $65 million grant for mental health programs.\nA coalition of Colorado experts has been working to help primary care physicians and pediatricians add mental health therapists to their practices.\nVogl said the university grant is separate, but the center may work with the state on elements of mental health care such as suicide prevention."}
