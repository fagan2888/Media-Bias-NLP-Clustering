Everyone has witnessed the dramatic rift playing out in the Republican presidential primary race.\n\nFor the last several years, the Republican electorate has been begging elected Republicans to pass a bill to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. We can all predict the inevitable fate of such an act, if pushed to passage. It will go the Rectangular Desk in the Oval Office where Obama will use the Tubular Pen to veto it with Circular Reasoning: \u2018Obamacare was passed to help people so repealing it ipso facto hurts people. Planned Parenthood gives women a particular choice so opposing it for any reason represents an effort to restrict the rights of women.\u2019\n\nMore than likely, he will exploit the event to deliver a pseudo-factual report on Obamacare\u2019s spectacular success in meeting and exceeding all its stated goals. He might also bark to the dog whistle by praising Planned Parenthood for defending the dignity of the human being, not the helpless one who gets to die but the ostensibly mature one who gets to kill\u2026 or to order a doctor to kill for her.\n\nPoliticians, Republicans more than most, disdain to volunteer for this sort of abuse. They do not enjoy flaunting their futility by birthing a baby bill that is doomed for the abortion knife, or the veto pen. Why showcase your powerlessness? Why swim directly at the wall like a dam fool? Better to pretend to be a big shot than to take a shot, to turn up your nose than to bloody it, to act like machers than like schleppers.\n\nThe voters differ. They say:\n\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;\n\nOr close the wall up with our American dead.\n\nIn peace there\u2019s nothing so becomes a man\n\nAs modest stillness and humility:\n\nBut when the blast of war blows in our ears,\n\nThen imitate the action of the tiger;\n\nStiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\n\nDisguise fair nature with hard-favour\u2019d rage;\n\nThen lend the eye a terrible aspect;\n\nLet pry through the portage of the head\n\nLike the brass cannon; let the brow o\u2019erwhelm it\n\nAs fearfully as doth a galled rock\n\nO\u2019erhang and jutty his confounded base,\n\nSwill\u2019d with the wild and wasteful ocean.\n\nNow set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,\n\nHold hard the breath and bend up every spirit\n\nTo his full height. On, on, you noblest Americans.\n\nWhose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!\n\nFathers that, like so many Alexanders,\n\nHave in these parts from morn till even fought\n\nAnd sheathed their swords for lack of argument:\n\nDishonour not your mothers; now attest\n\nThat those whom you call\u2019d fathers did beget you.\n\nBe copy now to men of grosser blood,\n\nAnd teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,\n\nWhose limbs were made in America, show us here\n\nThe mettle of your pasture; let us swear\n\nThat you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;\n\nFor there is none of you so mean and base,\n\nThat hath not noble lustre in your eyes.\n\nOr words to that effect. Their reasoning is simple. The purpose of electing representatives is for them to represent our views in legislation. If the Executive Branch uses its veto power to overrule, that is the Constitution in action. The Rule of Law has been observed.\n\nNothing changes in tangible terms, but there is a real benefit, beyond making a statement. What happens here is that the majority of the nation, through its representatives, has spoken. It has put forth its vision. It has established its priorities. It has communicated that the Legislative Branch is foursquare behind that approach.\n\nThe President can choose to exercise a technical power to overrule the will of the people. But he is now exposed as promoting a minority view. The people are saying \u201cLet my babies live!\u201d and Don Veto the Godfather cancels the christening.\n\nThere are two clear voices here. We declare victory in the battle for hearts and minds. He gets to declare victory in propping his desk against the door to stop the battering ram. How long will that hold up?\n\nOnce we open the case of The People vs. The White House, Republican candidates vying for the White House can first follow the road map to the voter\u2019s doors. Then perhaps one of them can pull the moving van up at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and reclaim The People\u2019s House.\n\nNow the Republicans in the House and Senate have finally heard their voters. They have engineered just such a bill. It is important for the same good folks who prodded them long and hard to cheer long and loud when the two Houses finish the job and put this bill on that desk in the White House. Obama can enjoy the veto perk but the vox populi can make sure his victory is Pyrrhic.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1165\"", "article_summary": "The White House, Republican candidates vying for the White House can first follow the road map to the voter\u2019s doors.\nFor the last several years, the Republican electorate has been begging elected Republicans to pass a bill to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.\nThey do not enjoy flaunting their futility by birthing a baby bill that is doomed for the abortion knife, or the veto pen.\nObama can enjoy the veto perk but the vox populi can make sure his victory is Pyrrhic.\nNow the Republicans in the House and Senate have finally heard their voters."}
