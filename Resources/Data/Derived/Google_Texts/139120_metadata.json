The new Florida Department of Corrections Secretary says she\u2019s making progress on the issue\u2014something lawmakers are keeping an eye on.\n\n\n\nListen to the story!\n\nAbout a month ago, a very candid Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Julie Jones gave a panel of lawmakers a report on the standard of prison health care provided by two private contractors.\n\n\u201cThe standard of healthcare with our current providers is not at the level that\u2019s required by their contracts, and we\u2019re working very diligently with those two vendors to try to get the standard of care up to the level that\u2019s required in those contracts,\u201d said Jones, during a committee hearing last month.\n\nShe relayed that to the Senate Criminal Justice Committee chaired by Sen. Greg Evers (R-Baker), who\u2019s visited a couple correctional facilities in the Florida Panhandle area.\n\nHe says after stopping by Santa Rosa Correctional Facility, it was clear to him the prison health care contracts needed to be re-bid because the health care was insufficient.\n\n\u201cThat was the blatant thing that came up and slapped me in the face,\u201d said Evers, speaking to reporters.\n\nAnd, he says he\u2019s heard of other stories at other correctional facilities across the state.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an issue when two inmates get into a fight, and one of the inmates has to go medical,\u201d added Evers. \u201cAnd, medical says, \u2018Aw, just take him back and put him in his bunk. He\u2019ll be alright\u2019 Well, ultimately, you run into a situation where one of the guards is extremely upset about it, and he calls the warden, and the warden says, \u2018call 911.\u2019 I mean, to me, that\u2019s a major issue.\u201d\n\nThe prison system has come under intense scrutiny because of inmate deaths, alleged abuse by prison guards, and cover-ups. And, Sen. Evers says he has confidence the prison system can be fixed.\n\n\u201cTo some extent, we are going to fix it,\u201d said Evers. \u201cLook, we\u2019re only at 10,000 feet. We\u2019ve got a long way to go before we hit the ground. And, it may not be a soft landing, but it will be a perfect landing when it comes in.\u201d\n\nIn his capacity as chair of the committee, Evers has filed a bill that\u2019s a comprehensive prison reform package aimed at revamping the current prison system, which includes a provision that inmates are provided with the necessary health care.\n\nJones recently announced she\u2019s started the negotiations for the rebidding contract process, opening the door to potential new private vendors. The current two private prison health care providers, Wexford and Corizon, took over the state\u2019s prison health care in 2013 after the issue got tied up in the courts for about two years. Unions had sued on behalf of thousands of employees who did not want to lose their state jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, the new rebid contracts are expected to be worth $1.4 billion. It includes new services, like providing electronic health records, which Jones promised lawmakers she\u2019d look into.\n\n\u201cAs part of those contracts with those two vendors, there\u2019s no provision for electronic medical records, and I\u2019m in direct contact with both vendors in asking they consider that either in a rebid or in a new contract to make that a requirement, so yes, that is on our radar screen,\u201d said Jones, last month.\n\nShe and Evers even exchanged some words at an earlier committee hearing, after he expressed disbelief that the private providers weren\u2019t doing that already.\n\n\u201cWhy would we have to renegotiate a contract? I mean, you would think that they would unhook and horse and buggy and put it in a barn, and be moved into the computer age,\u201d asked Evers.\n\n\u201cI mean, Mr. Chairman, the vendors responded to me that there\u2019s a significant cost associated with getting that implemented and those records scanned, and that would be part of something that would be an additional cost to the contract,\u201d replied Jones.\n\nMeanwhile, both Wexford and Corizon released statements, saying they\u2019re on board with rebidding the contracts and will continue their services to the state\u2019s correctional facilities throughout the negotiations.\n\nFor more news updates, follow Sascha Cordner on Twitter: @SaschaCordner.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "none", "description": "Prison reform is slated to be a big issue this upcoming legislative session, and a re-do of prison health care contracts will be part of the reform efforts", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/fla-lawmakers-keeping-eye-private-prison-health-care-rebid-process-begins", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201503/389730277.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Prison reform is slated to be a big issue this upcoming legislative session, and a re-do of prison health care contracts will be part of the reform efforts", "title": "Fla.
