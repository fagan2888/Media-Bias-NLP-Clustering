The 12 are thought to have been staying in a home that was swept off the riverbank and smashed into a bridge. 1 teenage boy has been confirmed dead already.\n\n6-10 inches of rain fell in the Houston area last night. Evacuations are now underway in Austin as flooding threatens homes. 81,000 are without power.\n\nMore storms are possible today. We\u2019ve got Fox team coverage including Casey Stegall from Wimberley, Texas which was hardest hit.\n\nAt least two are dead, and several more injured after a shooting at a Wal-Mart in Grand Forks, North Dakota. More on this developing story as we get it.\n\nWe\u2019re watching the growing GOP field of likely and declared candidates for the White House. Senator Rand Paul, Senator Marco Rubio, Ohio Governor John Kasich all making appearances today. Tomorrow it\u2019s expected former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum will jump into the race. Carl Cameron is covering the candidates.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders who is running for the Democratic nomination holds a campaign kickoff event today in Vermont. Ed Henry covering.\n\nThe Supreme Court could soon make some serious news on the Affordable Care Act. The Wall Street Journal, AP, Politico, and the New York Times all writing about the ACA today. SCOTUS will rule at the end of June about whether or not the subsidies paid by the Federal Government to folks in states without exchanges are valid. It could end subsidies for more than 7 million Americans. It could also imperil President Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal writes, \u201cAverage premiums for individual coverage in the affected states would increase by 35%, the study found, presuming that people with more medical needs would remain insured, shrinking the proportion of healthy policyholders.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times writing about the threat to the law from SCOTUS today and also writing about the penalties for people who don\u2019t get insurance \u201cObamacare's big stick doesn't seem to be scaring many people into buying health insurance.\u201d The Times reports \u201c.. several close watchers of the law say that the special enrollments look low enough to raise more substantial questions about whether the health law's penalty will have the intended effect of increasing sign-ups for insurance in the coming years.\u201d\n\nPolitico has a good write up on the politics of the ACA. Jennifer Haberkorn and Rachel Bade writing,\n\n\u201cThe growing divide between the two chambers leaves the GOP in an awkward spot. The court could gut Obamacare in June, handing Republicans a long-sought victory they couldn\u2019t achieve legislatively. But without a backup plan that the whole party supports, the GOP has no way to blunt the political damage if millions of Americans lose the ability to pay for their health insurance.\u201d\n\nCharter Communications will buy Time Warner Cable for nearly 57 billion dollars in a deal that will create one of the country\u2019s largest cable and broadband companies. It comes just a few weeks after Comcast withdrew its bid for Time Warner Cable in the face of regulator skepticism. This deal is more likely to get approval.\n\nWe get reads on durable goods, home sales and consumer confidence today.\n\nIraq says it will soon launch an operation to try and dislodge ISIS terrorists who\u2019ve taken over the Anbar province. ISIS took Ramadi earlier this month and has had a string of victories against Iraq\u2019s Army despite U.S. airstrikes and aid to Iraq.\n\nIran began its trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian who\u2019s been detained in Iran for more than 10 months. Happening Now guest and New York Times Tehran Bureau Chief Thomas Erdbrink will be our guest to discuss the case .\n\n\n\nFor more news follow me on Twitter: @ClintPHenderson", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-05-28 03:07:56 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Terrible news out of Central Texas. 12 people remain missing at this hour after flash-flooding sent the Blanco River over its banks.", "twitter": {"description": "Terrible news out of Central Texas. 12 people remain missing at this hour after flash-flooding sent the Blanco River over its banks.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1440023823141.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Texas Torn Apart by Storms; Will SCOTUS Tear Apart Obamacare?", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Clint Henderson\",\"subSection\":\"us\",\"title\":\"Texas Torn Apart by Storms; Will SCOTUS Tear Apart Obamacare?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1440023823141.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-26T12:44:35Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"cc06d91a-a712-4b71-bc3c-f3ad05da1d8b\",\"section\":\"us\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Terrible news out of Central Texas. 12 people remain missing at this hour after flash-flooding sent the Blanco River over its banks.", "dc.identifier": "cc06d91a-a712-4b71-bc3c-f3ad05da1d8b", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "description": "Terrible news out of Central Texas. 12 people remain missing at this hour after flash-flooding sent the Blanco River over its banks.", "prism.section": "us", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Texas Torn Apart By Storms; Will Scotus Tear Apart Obamacare?", "dcterms.created": "2015-05-28 03:07:56 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Terrible news out of Central Texas. 12 people remain missing at this hour after flash-flooding sent the Blanco River over its banks.", "title": "Texas Torn Apart by Storms; Will SCOTUS Tear Apart Obamacare?  | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1440023823141.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2015-05-26", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Clint Henderson\",\"subSection\":\"us\",\"title\":\"Texas Torn Apart by Storms; Will SCOTUS Tear Apart Obamacare?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1440023823141.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-26T12:44:35Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/26/texas-torn-apart-by-storms-will-scotus-tear-apart-obamacare.html\",\"post_id\":\"cc06d91a-a712-4b71-bc3c-f3ad05da1d8b\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"us\"}", "dc.creator": "Clint Henderson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2ad\"", "article_summary": "Happening Now guest and New York Times Tehran Bureau Chief Thomas Erdbrink will be our guest to discuss the case .\nIt comes just a few weeks after Comcast withdrew its bid for Time Warner Cable in the face of regulator skepticism.\nThe Wall Street Journal, AP, Politico, and the New York Times all writing about the ACA today.\nIran began its trial of Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian who\u2019s been detained in Iran for more than 10 months.\nAt least two are dead, and several more injured after a shooting at a Wal-Mart in Grand Forks, North Dakota."}
