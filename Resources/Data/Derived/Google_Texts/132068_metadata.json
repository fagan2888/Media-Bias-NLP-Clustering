In primaries, I\u2019ve always voted for the candidate I thought was more progressive, regardless of sex. In New York\u2019s 1992 Senate primary, I voted for Bob Abrams over Liz Holtzman or Geraldine Ferraro. In 2008, I supported Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton. In 2013, I voted for Bill de Blasio over Christine Quinn for New York City mayor. Way back in the distant past, there were times that I didn\u2019t support a woman Democrat in the general election energetically, even though I voted for her, because she wasn\u2019t left enough for me. At the time, those votes looked high-minded and principled and based on a careful examination of the issues and the candidates\u2019 records, but I wonder if I didn\u2019t outsmart myself. Abrams was a terrible campaigner and lost to the dreadful Alfonse D\u2019Amato; Ferraro, a more mainstream Democrat with a vibrant personality, probably would have won. Yes, Ferraro supported the death penalty\u2014but should that have been the litmus test for a senator? More than the fact that Ferraro was a solid, experienced feminist\u2014the first woman vice-presidential nominee\u2014and the Senate was 98 percent male at the time? And if not Ferraro, why didn\u2019t I choose Holtzman, a hero of the Watergate hearings? She attacked Ferraro over her husband\u2019s business dealings in a way that seemed desperate and unfair\u2014but so, if less loudly, did Abrams. Ad Policy\n\nMoving on, I tepidly supported John Edwards in 2008 because he campaigned on the issue of poverty despite being an obvious phony, and then backed Obama even though he gave plenty of loud hints that he wasn\u2019t as progressive as the halo around him suggested. (He said he\u2019d bomb Al Qaeda inside Pakistan, for example, and rejected the individual mandate in health insurance, which Clinton and Edwards both rightly said was essential.) I even signed a letter circulated by the great historian Linda Gordon called \u201cNew York Feminists for Peace and Barack Obama.\u201d I\u2019m kind of embarrassed by that now. I don\u2019t regret my vote for Obama\u2014unlike Bernie Sanders, I think the Affordable Care Act was a huge achievement\u2014but was he, on balance, a better president than Hillary would have been? Or even much different? For more from The Nation on Hillary Clinton, check out Who Is Hillary Clinton?

She opposed paid sick leave, he supported it, and now we have it. But over my 40-odd years of casting ballots, if I had always voted for the woman in a Democratic race\u2014\u201cvoted my vagina,\u201d in the unlovely phrase now aimed at Hillary\u2019s female supporters\u2014I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve done worse than I did by choosing the candidate I believed was \u201cthe best\u201d on the issues. Looking back, I almost always had a compelling reason why, in that particular case, the man was better than the woman, but the reasons were always different. (The one exception is Zephyr Teachout, the brilliant and energetic law professor and activist whom I voted for in her 2014 primary race against New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.) The one thing they had in common was that they were more important to me than the simple, brute fact of women being underrepresented at every level of government: 19 percent of Congress, 24 percent of state legislators, a pathetic 12 percent of governors, and, of course, 0 percent of presidents and the major parties\u2019 presidential nominees. I factored all of that right out of the equation, and I did it when women officeholders were even rarer than they are now.\n\nAs so often happens, I have met the enemy and it is me.\n\nI\u2019ve taken some flak for supporting Hillary Clinton, and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s good that passions are strong. But the extraordinary hostility to the mere notion of women putting a collective thumb on the scale for a woman\u2014not Sarah Palin, but a smart and highly qualified liberal Democrat\u2014got me thinking. After all, it\u2019s an accepted fact of American political life that people often vote their ethnicity or race or geography. For decades, New York City politics was organized as Irish, Italian, and Jewish voting blocs electing their own if they could; for the top city jobs, it was de rigueur to visit the \u201cthree Is\u201d (Ireland, Italy, and Israel). Boston, Chicago, and many other cities were organized along similar lines. That system may be fading, but not because city dwellers have been persuaded that it\u2019s selfish and narrow to vote for \u201cone of their own.\u201d Ethnic and racial feelings are alive and well in presidential politics today: It is assumed that there\u2019s a Latino vote, and there\u2019s been much speculation whether Marco Rubio\u2014whose election would be of no practical benefit to Latinos whatsoever\u2014could win a good share of it. Nobody says, \u201cHow short-sighted of Latinos to consider ethnicity in casting their ballot.\u201d Similarly, only racists criticize black people for their near-unanimous support for Barack Obama. And if he hasn\u2019t done a lot for them? That wasn\u2019t the only reason that he got African Americans\u2019 vote. The sheer fact of a black president is an enormous thing, and not just for black people. That\u2019s why elderly ladies in Harlem are still wearing their Obama buttons eight years later. LIKE THIS?

I want to tear my hair out when women say they don\u2019t support Hillary because she\u2019s \u201cnot likable\u201d or \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d or \u201ctoo stiff.\u201d Ladies, you\u2019re not voting for a best friend! Choose Bernie if you like\u2014I won\u2019t say a word against him. But don\u2019t reject the first woman in history who could win the White House because she doesn\u2019t fit your notion of how women should behave. Men put a thumb on the scale for men all the time: It\u2019s called being \u201cgender neutral\u201d while defining leadership in male terms. (Can you imagine a 74-year-old democratic socialist named Bernice Sanders making a run like Bernie? The jokes write themselves.) And overt misogyny still exists. You\u2019ll never persuade me that \u201cBernie bros\u201d\u2014the men who harass female Hillary supporters with patronizing, insulting, and sometimes-obscene tweets and posts\u2014are just Internet will-o\u2019-the-wisps. But if you want hard numbers, how about this: According to Gallup, 8 percent of people say they would never vote for a qualified woman for president. That\u2019s nearly one in 12 voters. But if one in 12 female primary voters is choosing Hillary just because she\u2019s a woman\u2014and not also because she\u2019s experienced, super-smart, shares their values, and looks more likely to win the general\u2014I would be surprised.\n\nTwenty years ago, I was very critical of Hillary in this column, lambasting her book It Takes a Village for its namby-pamby, moralistic approach to poverty\u2014and Hillary herself, for standing by while Bill Clinton was reforming welfare. Now I wonder why her book was the only politician\u2019s book I have ever written about\u2014and she was just a first lady! And I ask myself why, given that welfare reform is being hurled at Hillary\u2019s supporters as sufficient reason to oppose her now, there\u2019s little pressure on Bernie to call for restoring those benefits?\n\nOn February 1, Hillary became the first woman in history to win the Iowa primary. The media barely noticed that. Maybe I\u2019ll go back to voting for men when women are 51 percent of the government.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Katha Pollitt at first neglected to consider her vote for Zephyr Teachout in the 2014 gubernatorial primary race against Andrew Cuomo.
