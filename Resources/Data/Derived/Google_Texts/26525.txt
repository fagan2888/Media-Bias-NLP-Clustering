The New York Times reports that Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin has informed the Obama administration that he intends to shut down his state's health insurance exchange. The move will mean that Kentuckians will have to seek health insurance from the federal exchange. The newly-elected Republican governor may also make changes to the state's Medicaid expansion program. Both moves would fulfill promises that Bevin made on the campaign trail last year.

Health insurance exchanges were established by the Affordable Care Act to serve as a marketplace for individuals who are not covered by the employer-based market. While the law envisioned that these exchanges would be run entirely by the states, in practice there are only 13 state-based exchanges, including the one in Washington, D.C. The rest of the states rely, either in part or entirely, on the federal exchange, Healthcare.gov.

Of the states that chose to run their own exchanges, Kentucky was doing well. The state's exchange, known as Kynect, has in fact been lauded as one of Obamacare's best success stories. The Washington Post reports that since it launched, Kynect has cut Kentucky's uninsured rate in half. While some other states have struggled in their efforts to establish their own state-based exchange, Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, told the New York Times that "Kynect is working perfectly, and it's been good for Kentucky."
