There\u2019s the corporate shills, there are the religious fanatics and then there are the freedom fiends \u2014 the ones who want to make sure that you have the right to sleep under a bridge.\u201d\n\nAnd Maher agreed.\n\n\u201cSo Jesus freaks, gun nuts, generic-obese suburbanites and let me add the super rich,\u201d the \u201cReal Time\u201d host said. \u201cThat\u2019s the Republican Party isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\nAs the House and Senate continue debates over the government shutdown and continuing resolution to fund the government, the GOP finds itself increasingly divided over action to that. Some in the House argued they are taking orders from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) while others remain steadfast in their quest to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCheck out the \u201cReal Time\u201d segment below, courtesy of Mediaite.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Rep.
