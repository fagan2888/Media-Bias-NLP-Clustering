However, opponents said that the bills will make it even harder for the IRS to complete its job effectively.\n\n\u201cThis is simply our committee saying clearly to the IRS, Republican or Democrat, that you will have a real customer service plan for the American taxpayer, who pays your salaries, or if you don\u2019t, there will be consequences,\u201d Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re truly concerned about customer service, then you have to fully fund the agency,\u201d Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) said. \u201cYour budgets have consistently starved the IRS of the resources they need to do their job. \u2026 It\u2019s very convenient to handicap the agents, and then point the finger at them for not functioning. While we pass legislation increasing the IRS workload, we reduce their funding and we reduce their workforce.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHR 4890: IRS bonuses tied to measurable metrics, which would forbid the IRS from allocating bonuses until they\u2019ve composed a comprehensive strategy to improve customer service and had it approved by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, incited roughly an hour-long debate.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how anybody goes home and says \u2018I want to improve the service of the IRS, so I propose legislation eliminating any bonus until there\u2019s a plan,\u2019 when that person voted against providing money for customer service,\u201d Ranking Member Sandy Levin (D- Mich.) said, after displaying a chart that showed that average telephone wait times at IRS have risen proportionately as appropriations have fallen.\n\nRepresentatives opposed to the bill said that it wasn\u2019t as easy as simply directing employees to answer the phone before the third ring. They pointed to shrinking budgets and workforce at IRS over the last few years as the root cause of the problem, rather than a lack of strategy.\n\nPascrell referred to testimony from IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who said that by the end of this year, IRS will have lost roughly 17,000 employees since 2010. Meanwhile, Thomas Barthold, chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, was on hand for the hearing and testified that the IRS customer base has increased by about 10 million in that same timeframe.\n\nSupporters of the bill said that it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for the IRS to compose such a strategy, as a number of other agencies have done so without congressional prompting, and businesses do it all the time.\n\nConcern over customer service at the IRS was prompted by a GAO report that estimated wait times for customers trying to reach an IRS agent over the phone to be roughly half an hour.\n\nHR 4885: IRS oversight while eliminating spending act 2016 also sparked some debate. It called for money raised by the IRS through direct fees for services, such as private letter ruling or reviews of business accounting changes, to be placed in a general Treasury fund, and prohibits the IRS from spending the money without going through the appropriations process. Barthold said that the fee has to reflect the cost of the service, and that in 2015, the total amount of fees came to about $11 billion.\n\nOpponents of the bill argued that it made no sense to take even more money away from an already financially disadvantaged organization while still expecting them to accomplish more work than before. They also suggested that removing control of money earned from fees might disincentivize the organization from performing the services.\n\n\u201cThe notion that we are going to eviscerate the accounts receivable department of the federal government because we\u2019ve got a vendetta against taxation I think is misplaced,\u201d Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D- Ore.) said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand the efficacy, the value of taking money away from the service that it collected because it did a particular special service for a taxpayer,\u201d Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) said.\n\nHowever, supporters of the bill expressed distrust in the IRS\u2019 ability to manage its own money responsibly, citing failures to take advantage of cost saving measures, such as using Justice Department lawyers instead of private, and diverting money away from customer service in order to fulfill requirements placed upon the agency by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe point is not whether there\u2019s going to be money charged for private letter rulings \u2026 but the question is who is going to maintain disposition of it and how is it going to be allocated?\u201d Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) said. \u201cShould this be applied governmentwide? Well, maybe, yeah, if you\u2019ve got entities that have been acting with malevolence, I would argue, and some incompetence as the IRS has.\u201d\n\nHR 1206: No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act would prevent the IRS from hiring any new employees until all current employees \u2014 82,203 in total \u2014 are themselves cleared of any delinquency in paying their taxes.\n\n\u201cSome of our IRS\u2019 own workers have serious delinquencies on their personal tax obligations,\u201d Brady said during the opening statement. \u201cTalk about the fox guarding the hen house. This is outrageous and the American people deserve better.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the bill argued that this is simply a case of leading by example. Opponents countered that IRS already has the lowest rate of delinquency in the federal government \u2014 at 1.2 percent of its total population delinquent \u2014 and that this goal is unrealistic. In addition, they said, this would further hobble the already understaffed agency from acquiring the personnel they need to make positive changes.\n\n\u201cThis bill says that the IRS, an agency of roughly 80,000 employees, cannot hire a single person until it\u2019s certified that no single employee in the entire agency has a serious tax debt. That is unreal. That is unbelievable,\u201d John Lewis (D-Ill.) said. \u201cIf we really want to improve customer service and security for taxpayers, we should fully fund the agency. Some of us have been demanding this for some time.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you\u2019re doing to federal employees in the IRS is designed to make that agency not work, all because you\u2019re mad over what happened around the allegations that somehow they were picking on right wing PACs. This is not responsible legislative action,\u201d Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) said.\n\nBlumenauer suggested an amendment to the bill, saying that he would vote yes if Congress and its staffers would be held to the same standard. That amendment was not added.\n\nHR 3724: Ensuring integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2015 would prohibit the IRS from rehiring any employees who were previously fired for misconduct. This bill prompted the least discussion, with no dissenting votes.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Customs-Bill-Climate-Change--150x150.jpeg", "news_keywords": "irs, bill, congress, house, bill pascrell, earl blumenauer, house ways and means committee, internal revenue service, jim mcdermott, john koskinen, john lewis, kevin brady, peter roskam, sandy levin, thomas barthold, treasury department, xavier becerra", "application-name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "og": {"site_name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "description": "Four bills aimed at improving IRS accountability passed the House Ways and Means Committee, but not without strenuous objections.", "title": "Lawmakers debate bills with serious implications for the IRS", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Customs-Bill-Climate-Change-.jpeg", "updated_time": "2016-04-15T09:52:03+00:00", "url": "http://federalnewsradio.com/legislation/2016/04/lawmakers-debate-bills-serious-implications-irs/", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Customs-Bill-Climate-Change-.jpeg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "sailthru.canonical": "http://federalnewsradio.com/legislation/2016/04/lawmakers-debate-bills-serious-implications-irs/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Agency Oversight", "tag": "Bill Pascrell,Earl Blumenauer,House Ways and Means Committee,Internal Revenue Service,Jim McDermott,John Koskinen,John Lewis,Kevin Brady,Peter Roskam,Sandy Levin,Thomas Barthold,Treasury Department,Xavier Becerra", "published_time": "2016-04-15T04:23:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T09:52:03+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "sailthru.date": "2016-04-15 04:23:12", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Four bills aimed at improving IRS accountability passed the House Ways and Means Committee, but not without strenuous objections."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIf you\u2019re truly concerned about customer service, then you have to fully fund the agency,\u201d Rep.
