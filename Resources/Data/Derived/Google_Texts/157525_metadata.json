It\u2019s a party. It\u2019s festive. I think there\u2019s more spark (for the sport) by coming here.\u201d\n\nHaskell tradition has Springsteen\u2019s \u201c\u2018Born to Run\u201d anthem played over the sound system as the horses enter the track before the race. To maybe have The Boss play live? Nice touch.\n\nHere are a few Springsteen-inspired reasons it\u2019s a good thing for Triple Crown winner American Pharoah to make his next start in the Haskell:\n\n___\n\nLUCKY TOWN\n\nNot exactly his hometown, but American Pharoah trainer Bob Baffert has had nothing but good luck in Oceanport. Not only has he won a record seven Haskells \u2014 all since 2001 \u2014 but he won two Breeders\u2019 Cup races at Monmouth Park in 2007. He doesn\u2019t often show up for the Haskell, but he\u2019ll be there for this one. His sunglasses will come in handy since the beach is nearby. Owner Ahmed Zayat also lives about 60 miles north of the track in Teaneck. He and Baffert won the 2012 Haskell with Paynter. Springsteen, it should be mentioned, has a home \u2014 mansion \u2014 in Rumson, about seven miles away.\n\n___\n\nGLORY DAYS\n\nWith or without Bruce, Monmouth Park is anticipating a record crowd for American Pharoah\u2019s show. All 13,000 reserved seats were sold a few weeks ago, and the current mark stands at 53,638, when 2003 Derby and Preakness winner Funny Cide showed up. Track officials are planning all sorts of concerts, contests and giveaways for the race (on a Sunday) \u2014 and are billing the three-day weekend \u201cThe Pharoah Phan Phestival.\u201d Even NBC \u2014 not NBCSN \u2014 is in and will televise the race as part of its Breeders\u2019 Cup Challenge series. Zayat hopes the race will attract entertainers, athletes and politicians. Along with Springsteen, he mentioned Jon Bon Jovi, Kobe Bryant and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Also possible? Track officials are reaching out to Springsteen\u2019s daughter Jessica, a world-class show rider, about leading the post parade.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tuning up for American Pharoah\u2019s next race in the Haskell", "title": "Tuning up for American Pharoah\u2019s next race in the Haskell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Tuning up for American Pharoah\u2019s next race in the Haskell", "title": "Tuning up for American Pharoah\u2019s next race in the Haskell", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/04/tuning_up_for_american_pharoahs_next_race_in_the_haskell/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/haskell-american-pharoah-horse-racing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tuning up for American Pharoah\u2019s next race in the Haskell", "title": "Tuning up for American Pharoah\u2019s next race in the Haskell", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/haskell-american-pharoah-horse-racing.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Richard Rosenblatt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsThe race, date and place are set for American Pharoah\u2019s next start: the Haskell Invitational, Aug. 2, Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New Jersey.\nHere are a few Springsteen-inspired reasons it\u2019s a good thing for Triple Crown winner American Pharoah to make his next start in the Haskell:___LUCKY TOWNNot exactly his hometown, but American Pharoah trainer Bob Baffert has had nothing but good luck in Oceanport.\n___GLORY DAYSWith or without Bruce, Monmouth Park is anticipating a record crowd for American Pharoah\u2019s show.\nNot only has he won a record seven Haskells \u2014 all since 2001 \u2014 but he won two Breeders\u2019 Cup races at Monmouth Park in 2007.\nZayat hopes the race will attract entertainers, athletes and politicians."}
