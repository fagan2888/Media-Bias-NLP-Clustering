REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n4945150\n\nHouse Committee on the Budget Chairman Tom Price slammed Democrats for accusation Republicans are threatening seniors\u2019 health care with proposals to reform Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security during a marathon markup of the Republican Fiscal Year 2017 budget blueprint Wednesday.\n\nThe \u201cBalanced Budget for a Stronger America\u201d calls for a complete repeal of Obamacare, a stop to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act and giving the states more power over their programs by providing them with State Flexibility Funds. Medicare would transition, allowing beneficiaries to pick from a list of federally-certified plans \u2013 similar to how Medicare Advantage, the private-sector part of Medicare, and Medicare Part D operate. Social Security would also see reforms in that individuals would not be allowed to receive both unemployment insurance and disability insurance simultaneously.\n\nRanking Member Chris Van Hollen charged the budget of helping the wrong demographic, a statement Republicans quickly shot down.\n\n\u201cWho does it come after? It cuts Medicaid by $1 trillion. Two-thirds of that goes to seniors and people with disabilities. Two-thirds of those funds,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. \u201cIt cuts Medicare by $450 billion. Seniors will have to go back to paying co-pays for preventive services. It reopens the prescription drug donut hole.\u201d\n\nGOP lawmakers argued the Congressional Budget Office predicts the programs will be insolvent in the near future, with the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund slated to be exhausted by 2030 and Medicare\u2019s Hospital Insurance trust fund expected to run out around 2026.\n\n\u201cThe longer we wait to do something about that unsustainable trajectory, the worse fiscal shape we will be in,\u201d he said in his opening statement. \u201cBut, more importantly, the longer we ignore the insolvency of programs like Medicare, the bigger the threat to our fellow Americans. Price said Democrat inaction is more responsible for the issue than Republicans who are trying to find a solution to keep the programs alive.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be absolutely clear. The threat to seniors\u2019 health care is not coming from those of us trying to save Medicare and provide more choices and higher quality,\u201d the Georgia Republican said. \u201cIt is coming from those who are unwilling to do anything that can realistically secure and strengthen this program and many other programs like Medicaid and Social Security that are either failing those they serve or headed toward insolvency.\u201d\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
