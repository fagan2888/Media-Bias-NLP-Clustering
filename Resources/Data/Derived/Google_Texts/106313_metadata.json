The conversation ranged from the rural opiate crisis to the need to improved technical job training.\n\nBefore leaving the factory, Clinton went out of her way to talk to reporters about an anticipated book that alleges foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation and payment for her husband\u2019s speeches were made in return for favors from the State Department, according to BuzzFeed\u2019s Ruby Cramer.\n\nClinton called the book one of many \u201cdistractions\u2019\u2019 inherent in running for president, though did not address the allegations specifically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough she did not take any public questions, Clinton spoke with a roundtable of Whitney Brothers furniture factory employees in front of a small gathering of pre-credentialed media. The former first lady, senator and secretary of state reminisced about her father\u2019s drapery and marveled at the companies advanced manufacturing technology (compared to her dad\u2019s).\n\nHowever, she lamented the fact that most of the machines in the factory were imported from Europe as an indicator of a national decline in manufacturing.\n\n\u201cWe have stalled out,\u2019\u2019 said Clinton, emphasizing that Europe also has a relatively high-wage labor market.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t we producing those machines?\u2019\u2019 she went on. \u201cWhat do we need to do to jump start high-quality manufacturing?\u2019\u2019\n\nDavid Stabler, the owner of Whitney Brothers, told Clinton it was difficult to get young employees with good technical skills for his business. Clinton said she supports President Barack Obama\u2019s proposed plan to make community college \u201cas free as possible.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cWe need to persuade young people that this is an opportunity,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nClinton also addressed panel members\u2019 concerns about the opioid crisis that has affected rural New England. In June 2014, the five governors of the region convened to address the increase in overdoses from heroin, painkillers, and other drugs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton said it was a \u201chidden epidemic\u2019\u2019 made worse by cuts to state resources to deal with the issue. She also cited aspects of the Affordable Care Act that she said addressed the problem and added that mental health issues would play a big part in her campaign.\n\nAfter the formal Q&A ended, Clinton hugged and talked to familiar faces who were watching in attendance.\n\nClinton said the first time she visited New Hampshire in 1991 \u2014 during her husband Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign \u2014 she celebrated her 44th birthday at Kristin\u2019s Bistro and Bakery, where she had visited again before the panel discussion. CNN reports she had a black tea.\n\nThe then-Arkansas governor Bill Clinton went on to be nicknamed the \u201cComeback Kid\u2019\u2019 after he placed second in 1992 New Hampshire presidential primary. Despite the fact Sen. Paul Tsongas from neighboring Massachusetts won, Clinton\u2019s relatively close runner-up finish was treated as a win by the press.\n\nThe Clintons had since remained close with the Granite State, as well as its important political players. Most recently, during the 2014 election, both ofthe Clintons visited New Hampshire to campaign for Gov. Maggie Hassan, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and Reps. Annie Kuster and Carol Shea-Porter.\n\nClinton\u2019s 2016 national campaign manager Robby Mook managed Shaheen\u2019s winning 2008 senatorial campaign. Mike Vlacich, Shaheen\u2019s 2014 re-election campaign manager, joined Clinton\u2019s campaign as the New Hampshire state director, along with multipleother former 2014 Shaheen campaign alums.\n\nClinton is scheduled to tour New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord and hold roundtable discussion there Tuesday morning. According to a press release from the campaign, Clinton\u2019s two-day New Hampshire return also includes private meetings with elected official, activists, and community leaders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In her first visit to New Hampshire since she made her 2016 presidential candidacy official, Hillary Clinton struck a friendly, pragmatic tone at the panel discussion in Keene on Monday afternoon.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "In her first visit to New Hampshire since she made her 2016 presidential candidacy official, Hillary Clinton struck a friendly, pragmatic tone at the panel discussion in Keene on Monday afternoon.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Visits New Hampshire for First Time as 2016 Presidential Candidate", "image": "http://cache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/BDC_b_logo_transparent_background_og.jpg", "creator": "@BostonDotCom", "site": "@BostonDotCom", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/smalltile.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Boston.com", "description": "In her first visit to New Hampshire since she made her 2016 presidential candidacy official, Hillary Clinton struck a friendly, pragmatic tone at the panel discussion in Keene on Monday afternoon.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Visits New Hampshire for First Time as 2016 Presidential Candidate", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/470462376-850x478.jpg", "url": "http://www.boston.com/news/politics/2015/04/20/hillary-clinton-visits-new-hampshire-for-first-time-as-2016-presidential-candidate", "type": "article"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/boston", "section": "News", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-04-20T19:39:39-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc/images/favicons/mediumtile.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21e3\"", "article_summary": "The then-Arkansas governor Bill Clinton went on to be nicknamed the \u201cComeback Kid\u2019\u2019 after he placed second in 1992 New Hampshire presidential primary.\nClinton is scheduled to tour New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord and hold roundtable discussion there Tuesday morning.\nMike Vlacich, Shaheen\u2019s 2014 re-election campaign manager, joined Clinton\u2019s campaign as the New Hampshire state director, along with multipleother former 2014 Shaheen campaign alums.\nAccording to a press release from the campaign, Clinton\u2019s two-day New Hampshire return also includes private meetings with elected official, activists, and community leaders.\nIn her first visit to New Hampshire since she made her 2016 presidential candidacy official, Hillary Clinton struck a friendly, pragmatic tone at the panel discussion in Keene on Monday afternoon."}
