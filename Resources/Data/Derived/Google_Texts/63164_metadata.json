Expect to see a lot more of Romine the rest of the season, however. He rallied the Falcons to 20 consecutive points in a 27-20 loss.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take whatever role they give me and prepare harder than ever,\u201d said Romine, who took over for an injured Karson Roberts. Romine is the fourth quarterback coach Troy Calhoun has used this season.\n\n\u201cHopefully Karson recovers and will be ready to play, but if not, I\u2019ll get ready to play Notre Dame,\u201d Romine said.\n\nAir Force plays Notre Dame on Oct. 26 after a bye this week.\n\nRomine showed no signs of nerves, operating the option-oriented offense like a veteran. He spent most of the first quarter just trying to stay warm in the 39-degree chill. He had no expectations of seeing action. San Diego State took a 6-0 lead late in the first quarter.\n\nSuddenly, Romine heard his name called out by Campbell.\n\n\u201cHe meant get loose now,\u201d Romine said. \u201cI had no idea what had happened to Karson.\u201d\n\nRoberts had suffered a head injury on the previous drive, leading Calhoun to call on the 5-foot-11, 195-pound Romine from Upland, Calif.\n\nRomine passed for 111 yards and a touchdown and ran for another TD to help the Falcons build a 20-6 lead entering the fourth quarter. But San Diego State rallied for the victory with 21 points in the final quarter.\n\n\u201cIt would have been great to win,\u201d Romine said. \u201cI went to war with my teammates all week in practice. This was just like practice, only faster.\u201d\n\nCalhoun was impressed with Romine\u2019s poise. \u201cEven the last ball he threw down the field was a pretty good throw,\u201d Calhoun said.\n\nRomine connected on a 32-yard pass to receiver Garrett Griffin on Air Force\u2019s last possession, but the drive ended at San Diego State\u2019s 37-yard line.\n\nWhoever plays quarterback for Air Force will be asked to help turn around a disastrous season.\n\nAir Force\u2019s 1-6 start is the school\u2019s worst since a similar start in 1993.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain when Roberts will be able to return.\n\n\u201cHe got dinged,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cAny time a player takes a shot in the head, we\u2019re not taking any chances.\u201d\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irv moss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nate Romine answers Air Force call of duty", "title": "Nate Romine answers Air Force call of duty", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/12/nate-romine-answers-air-force-call-of-duty/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__Nate-Romine-afap1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131013__Nate-Romine-afap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-12T19:58:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:04:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8cf\"", "article_summary": "AIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014 \u201cGet loose!\u201dThose were the words of Air Force assistant football coach Jake Campbell, calling on freshman quarterback Nate Romine late in the first quarter here Thursday night.\nRomine\u2019s collegiate debut against San Diego State was a surprise for himself, and everyone else at Falcon Stadium.\nAir Force plays Notre Dame on Oct. 26 after a bye this week.\nWhoever plays quarterback for Air Force will be asked to help turn around a disastrous season.\nSan Diego State took a 6-0 lead late in the first quarter."}
