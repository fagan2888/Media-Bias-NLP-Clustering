Today, it\u2019s 35 percent, and they\u2019re projecting by 2030 that it will represent 60 percent of our income.\u201d\n\nIrwin attributed these higher costs in part to increased government regulation through the colloquially named Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe premiums and the plans are government regulated, so each insurance carrier has to abide by these regulations,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat\u2019s covered, how it\u2019s covered, what out-of-pocket (expenses) can be implemented. There are taxes and fees everyone is responsible for. In some cases, it\u2019s on the insurance carrier and in other cases, it\u2019s directly related to the employer.\u201d\n\nThese increased regulations and fees are then felt by the employees signing up for health insurance, with Irwin noting that funding these requirements needs to come from somewhere.\n\n\u201cFor the employer, in order to be able to afford offering their employees benefits, they have to lower the type of coverage they can afford to offer, which increases the out-of-pocket contributions from employees,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is all directly related to these Affordable Care Act plans, designs and the regulations attached to them.\u201d\n\nBradford acknowledged that the ACA has come with some benefits, giving access to covereage to millions of Americans who had no coverage before.\n\n\u201cBut it put a lot more burden on small and large employers in that process,\u201d he said.\n\nBeverly Beery of Beery Insurance Services in Lima noted that, given the current situation, gaining health coverage from your employer may become a thing of the past.\n\n\u201cWe find that as health care costs continue to rise, I think the viability of employer-sponsored health care is threatened,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen where the Affordable Care Act has brought the cost of insurance down at all. If anything, it\u2019s caused it to go up, so the preservation of a sustainable market-based healthcare system is critical.\u201d\n\nNational Association of Health Underwriters northwest Ohio chapter president Karen Irwin, along with health insurance agent Jason Bradford, speak to Lima business professionals Thursday at Shawnee Country Club on how the Affordable Care Act has affected small businesses. http://limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/web1_ACASmallBiz.jpg National Association of Health Underwriters northwest Ohio chapter president Karen Irwin, along with health insurance agent Jason Bradford, speak to Lima business professionals Thursday at Shawnee Country Club on how the Affordable Care Act has affected small businesses.
