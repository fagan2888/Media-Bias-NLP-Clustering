ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) - A former Concordia Parish couple has pleaded guilty in a scheme to steal veterans’ benefits, federal prosecutors say.

U.S. Attorney Stephanie Finley said Tuesday that Alfred Lewis Jr., 67, of Ferriday, Louisiana, pleaded guilty Friday to one count of theft of government funds: $197,780 in veterans’ benefits received over 10 years.

She said in a news release that Rose Lewis, 36, of Natchez, Mississippi, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to steal the money.

Alfred Lewis, who served in the Air Force, applied for veterans’ benefits in July 2003 and received them until November 2013.

Prosecutors say Rose Lewis was earning more than $50,000 a year, but both Lewises sent Veterans Affairs written statements denying that she was working.

Alfred Lewis could get up to 10 years in prison, and Rose Lewis up to five. Each also could be fined $250,000 and ordered to repay the money.

U.S. District Judge Dee Drell scheduled sentencing Nov. 23 in Alexandria.
