Together with a photographer from the Times-Picayune newspaper, they headed out in a four-seat helicopter with only enough fuel to get to the site and shoot for a few minutes.\n\n\u201cYou could see it for miles,\u201d Herbert recalled. The smoke \u201cstarted appearing through the haze as a thick blob,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs we got closer, we realized how immense it was. The smoke was actually higher than us, and we were circling around it trying to avoid it.\u201d\n\nHovering at 4,000 feet \u2014 the lowest authorities would allow them to fly \u2014 the three were struck by the scale of the unfolding disaster.\n\n\u201cThe enormity of it did not escape us, because you could see that what looked like a tiny little burning ember was a massive oil platform. You could see oil in the water,\u201d Herbert said.\n\nThe images were the first from what would become the nation\u2019s worst offshore spill. The rig would sink within three days of exploding, and oil would flow from the well for nearly three months.\n\n___\n\nA SURREAL SEASCAPE\n\nMore than two weeks later, oil had yet to wash ashore, and images of huge ships floating amid a slick above the broken well had grown commonplace. San Antonio-based shooter Gay was sent on a mission to capture the scale of the slow-motion catastrophe.\n\n\u201cI had been on helicopter several times trying to show the oil coming to the coast, because we knew it was going to hit at some time,\u201d he said.\n\nOne day, he found it: a massive area of orange swirls against a floating field of black.\n\n\u201cI expected to see a big black blob floating out there,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then it was this orange, swirling thing that looked like something from another planet.\u201d\n\nSeveral miles out from land, and with no ships nearby, the image was abstract. Gay flew back out the following day to put the pollution into context.\n\n\u201cWe noticed this armada of shrimp boats that had been converted\u201d to oil skimmers deploying floating boom, something many shrimpers did to make money while the area was closed to fishing. After shooting them from a few hundred feet above, Gay asked the pilot to move a little higher.\n\n\u201cYou could see the boats and the orange swirls, and it gave it this strange perspective.\u201d\n\nThe result was a set of surreal, artistic shots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sad that something so tragic looks so beautiful,\u201d Gay recalled, \u201c\u2026 but it was pretty, from a distance.\u201d\n\n___\n\nA DRAGONFLY TRAPPED\n\nA month after he\u2019d first gone up in the helicopter, Herbert was on a boat tour with local officials and had stepped onto a small marsh island awash in syrupy crude.\n\nSomeone pointed out a blue dragonfly perched on a reed, and Herbert stooped to capture the insect, the tips of its translucent wings tinged brown.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "title": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "title": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/20/behind_the_lens_of_5_iconic_ap_photos_of_the_bp_oil_spill/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/gulf-oil-spill-iconic-images.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "title": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/gulf-oil-spill-iconic-images.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Behind the lens of 5 iconic AP photos of the BP oil spill", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37a5\"", "article_summary": "The rig would sink within three days of exploding, and oil would flow from the well for nearly three months.\nIt turned into a marathon as at least 134 million gallons of crude spewed from the well over 87 days.\n\u201cYou could see the boats and the orange swirls, and it gave it this strange perspective.\u201dThe result was a set of surreal, artistic shots.\nOne day, he found it: a massive area of orange swirls against a floating field of black.\nThe images were the first from what would become the nation\u2019s worst offshore spill."}
