In pursuit of stricter gun control laws, President Obama continues to employ unilateral executive action to achieve what he cannot accomplish legislatively.

The Hill reported this week that new gun control regulations targeting stolen and missing weapons are being reviewed by the White House, having been drawn up by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

The agency would not comment on the draft rule, since it has not yet been released to the public, but a description provided by the White House asserts that it would target cases where guns go missing “in transit,” according to the report.

Licensed gun dealers are required to tell federal agents after they discover a firearm has gone missing, but they aren’t required to do routine checks.

“They can discover a gun missing today and have no idea when it went missing, which really makes that information useless to law enforcement,” said Chelsea Parsons, associate director of crime and firearms policy at the Center for American Progress.

“I think that in the area of guns and gun violence and gun commerce, we have had a complete lack of data and a lack of information,” Parsons added.

An indication that the regulations will require stronger action from dealers to monitor and track guns.

Gun enthusiasts have good reason to be alarmed — the Center for American Progress was founded by former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta and also has close ties to far-left philanthropist George Soros.
