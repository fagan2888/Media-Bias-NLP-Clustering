Meanwhile, incomes in the top decile rose.\n\nDeclining Incomes, But Not at the Top Percent change in median family income, 2010-2013.

Nor should we be inattentive to the often ignored role that government plays in determining income distribution in each country.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s rarely reported:\n\nBefore the impact of tax and spending policies is taken into account, income inequality in the United States is no worse than in most developed countries and is even a bit below levels in Britain and, by some measures, Germany.\n\nHowever, once the effect of government programs is included in the calculations, the United States emerges on top of the inequality heap.\n\nDoing Less to Redistribute Income The U.S. ranks favorably in the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality \u2014 until taxes and government transfers are factored in. Then, among these countries, it is the worst.

In 1995, the 400 taxpayers with the biggest incomes paid an average of 30 percent in taxes; by 2009, the tax rate of those Americans had dropped to 20 percent.\n\nThe Low American Tax Burden Effective tax rates on gross income of $100,000 in 2012.

Social Security typically provides a retiree with about half of his working income; European countries often replace two-thirds of earnings.\n\nSimilarly, we spend less on early childhood education and care. And another big difference, of course, is the presence of national health insurance in most European countries.\n\nAll told, social spending in the United States is below the average of that of the wealthiest countries. And other governments help their less fortunate citizens to a greater extent than we do in ways that are not captured in the income statistics. The United States, which is the only developed country without a national paid parental leave policy, also has no mandated paid holidays or annual vacation; in Europe, workers are guaranteed at least 20 days and as many as 35 days of paid leave.\n\nLow-Vacation Nation Government-mandated paid annual leave and paid public holidays, in working days.

Expanded training programs and better education should be the centerpiece of any strategy to improve the lives of the middle class. A more robust economic recovery will also help the middle class, as will pro-growth policy initiatives like investment in infrastructure.\n\nCritics from the right argue that doing more to level the income pyramid would hurt growth. In a recent paper, the International Monetary Fund dismissed that concern and suggested that a more equal distribution of income could instead raise the growth rate because of the added access to education, health care and other opportunities.\n\nWhile some believe that the recent elections will stimulate both parties to make progress on the mound of challenges, in my view, that\u2019s a bit of a fantasy. But we can\u2019t stop talking about the problem of inequality, because then there really would be no hope.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20141116205137, "twitter": {"description": "Have we become inured to the struggles of the working class?", "title": "Inequality, Unbelievably, Gets Worse", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/opinion/inequality-unbelievably-gets-worse.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003236358"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/rattner-contributor/contibutors-images-slide-5F3G-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/opinion/inequality-unbelievably-gets-worse.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003236358", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/opinion/inequality-unbelievably-gets-worse.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Inequality, Unbelievably, Gets Worse", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 16, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/r/steven_rattner/", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-01-30", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development", "published": "2014-11-16", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "keywords": "Income Inequality,Income Tax,Taxation,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Unemployment Insurance,Disability Insurance,Republican Party,Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development", "description": "Have we become inured to the struggles of the working class?", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Steven Rattner", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/rattner-contributor/contibutors-images-slide-5F3G-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "17rattner", "byl": "By STEVEN RATTNER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Have we become inured to the struggles of the working class?", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "utime": 20150130143101, "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/rattner-contributor/contibutors-images-slide-5F3G-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Tax", "CN": "steven-rattner", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 16, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "org": "Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "CT": "column", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/17/opinion/inequality-unbelievably-gets-worse.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/04/opinion/rattner-contributor/rattner-contributor-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Have we become inured to the struggles of the working class?", "title": "Inequality, Unbelievably, Gets Worse"}, "pdate": 20141116, "des": "Disability Insurance", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/steven-rattner", "tagline": "Economics and finance.", "uri": "/column/steven-rattner", "display-name": "Steven Rattner", "identifier": "steven-rattner", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000003236358, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Inequality, Unbelievably, Gets Worse", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "However, once the effect of government programs is included in the calculations, the United States emerges on top of the inequality heap.\nAll told, social spending in the United States is below the average of that of the wealthiest countries.\nBut we can\u2019t stop talking about the problem of inequality, because then there really would be no hope.\nDoing Less to Redistribute Income The U.S. ranks favorably in the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality \u2014 until taxes and government transfers are factored in.\nNor should we be inattentive to the often ignored role that government plays in determining income distribution in each country."}
