Researchers also found that the abortion rate had reached its lowest level since 1973. As Joerg Dreweke at Guttmacher notes, the study\u2019s authors couldn\u2019t point to concrete causation, but hypothesized that the decline was related to increased use of highly effective methods of contraception (including the intrauterine devices that private corporations and government officials want to prevent from being covered by insurance) and improved access to sex education.\n\nThis seems pretty straightforward. Having the tools to prevent pregnancy \u2014 and knowing how to use them effectively \u2014 should prevent pregnancy in most cases. But Michael New, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn writing this week for the conservative National Review Online, disagrees with Guttmacher \u2014 and most medical and public health associations and people with good functioning brains in their heads. New argues that contraception is not the real reason behind the decline. Instead, he believes that \u201cpro-life efforts to change the hearts and minds of women facing crisis pregnancies\u201d are driving the trend.\n\nThis is a funny thing. Not because it\u2019s entirely off base to suggest that anti-choice efforts have had an impact on abortion rates \u2014 they likely have. (More on this later.) But it\u2019s New\u2019s framing that strikes me as particularly bizarre. The anti-choice movement has been wildly successful in recent years in its mission of eradicating legal abortion in the United States, but that success has crud to do with \u201cchanging hearts and minds.\u201d To suggest otherwise is pretty much a dark joke. Anti-choice politicians have used restrictions on clinics, doctors and the procedure itself as blunt instruments to put abortion out of reach \u2014 both geographically and financially \u2014 for millions across the country. This isn\u2019t gentle persuasion, this is a state agenda that forces pregnant people to carry to term whether or not they want to, or find ways to terminate pregnancies on their own.\n\nAnd what of the protesters themselves? The people on the front lines of this \u201chearts and minds\u201d movement? Bud and Tara Shaver drive around their neighborhood in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in a van featuring images that appear to be mangled fetuses. Operation Rescue sends high school students bused in from out of state to protest outside of a Holocaust museum and the confrontation becomes so heated that the place is forced to shut down for the afternoon. Others from the same organization have printed the names, photos and contact information of abortion providers and clinic escorts from across the country with the not at all subtle implication, \u201cWe know where you live and we know where you work.\u201d Coming from a group that was affiliated with the man who murdered George Tiller, it\u2019s impossible to ignore the subtext. Antiabortion protesters stand outside of clinics \u2014 and far from being \u201cplump grandmas\u201d asking for a quiet chat, these men and women physically obstruct and hurl vile insults at patients entering these facilities. Sometimes, they shoot people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "National Review Online thanks the loving power of the anti-choice movement \"changing hearts and minds\" for the drop VIDEO", "author": "Katie McDonough", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "National Review Online thanks the loving power of the anti-choice movement \"changing hearts and minds\" for the drop VIDEO", "title": "Delusional National Review writer thinks \u201cpro-life\u201d efforts \u2014 not contraception \u2014 reduce abortion rate", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/18/delusional_national_review_writer_thinks_pro_life_efforts_not_contraception_reduces_abortion_rate/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/AP317426870375-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "National Review Online thanks the loving power of the anti-choice movement \"changing hearts and minds\" for the drop VIDEO", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/AP317426870375-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Delusional National Review writer thinks \u201cpro-life\u201d efforts \u2014 not contraception \u2014 reduce abortion rate", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Delusional National Review writer thinks \u201cpro-life\u201d efforts \u2014 not contraception \u2014 reduce abortion rate", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, abortion rights, buffer zones, clinic harassment, reproductive health, reproductive justice, Reproductive Rights, Video, Violence, Women's Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc19e\"", "article_summary": "Instead, he believes that \u201cpro-life efforts to change the hearts and minds of women facing crisis pregnancies\u201d are driving the trend.\nNot because it\u2019s entirely off base to suggest that anti-choice efforts have had an impact on abortion rates \u2014 they likely have.\nResearchers also found that the abortion rate had reached its lowest level since 1973.\nHaving the tools to prevent pregnancy \u2014 and knowing how to use them effectively \u2014 should prevent pregnancy in most cases.\nThe people on the front lines of this \u201chearts and minds\u201d movement?"}
