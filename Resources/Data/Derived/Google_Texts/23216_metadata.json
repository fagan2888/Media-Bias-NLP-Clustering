A number of bills passed to reduce the deficit. But a cigarette tax, which was a major component in paying for healthcare, is dead. That has a lot of Oklahomans scared.\n\nWanda Felty wears a four leaf clover necklace. They're special she said, because they're different.\n\n\"If you think about it that's my daughter,\u201d said Felty. \u201cSo when I wear a four leaf clover, I think of Kayla.\"\n\nKayla is mentally challenged, blind, and has a long list of medical problems. On her swing, Kayla doesn't have a worry in the world. But her mom is worried about what healthcare cuts could mean.\n\n\"If Kayla can't see her endocrinologist then she can't keep the medicine that keeps her alive. If I can't get a pharmacy that accepts her Medicaid card and cover her medicine, what\u2026what am I going to do?\" Mrs. Felty said.\n\nA key component of healthcare funding, a planned tax on cigarettes is dead.\n\n\u201cThe cigarette tax is not an option at this point,\u201d said Representative Jeff Hickman (R) House Speaker. \u201cThe only way the cigarette tax could even be considered would be in special session.\u201d\n\nDemocrats refused to back it unless Republicans agreed to accept Obamacare dollars. Neither side would budge.\n\n\u201cThe folks in charge who now point their fingers at us and say we need to raise cigarette taxes and without them the whole world is coming to an end it was their obstruction that prevented those important federal resources from coming in,\u201d said Representative Scott Inman (D) House Minority Leader.\n\nRepublicans said they'll find the money.\n\n\u201cThe cigarette tax would have allowed us to do that without taking as much money from other agencies to do it.\u201d Hickman said, \u201cSo it's going to mean probably some deeper cuts to some other agencies to do that.\u201d\n\nMrs. Felty said lawmakers don't seem to understand the thousands of lives; the field of four leaf clovers, they're impacting.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I don't think so,\u201d said Felty. \u201cOr they'd still be working today.\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "It was a rough week as lawmakers struggle to fill an estimated $1.3 billion budget gap.", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/32029110/cigarette-tax-to-help-pay-for-healthcare-hits-a-wall", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10606695_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It was a rough week as lawmakers struggle to fill an estimated $1.3 billion budget gap.", "title": "Cigarette Tax To Help Pay For Healthcare Hits A Wall"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10606695_G.jpg", "description": "It was a rough week as lawmakers struggle to fill an estimated $1.3 billion budget gap.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cigarette Tax To Help Pay For Healthcare Hits A Wall"}, "wnreadableurl": "cigarette-tax-to-help-pay-for-healthcare-hits-a-wall", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/05/20", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS16", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,newsok,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,sports,video,live streaming,interactive"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe cigarette tax is not an option at this point,\u201d said Representative Jeff Hickman (R) House Speaker.\nBut a cigarette tax, which was a major component in paying for healthcare, is dead.\n\u201cThe only way the cigarette tax could even be considered would be in special session.\u201dDemocrats refused to back it unless Republicans agreed to accept Obamacare dollars.\nA cigarette tax, which was a major component in paying for health care, is dead.\nA key component of healthcare funding, a planned tax on cigarettes is dead."}
