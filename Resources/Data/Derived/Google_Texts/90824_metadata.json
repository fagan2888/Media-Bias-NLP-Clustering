If she wins the Democratic nomination, Rogers would face Harwell in November.\n\nThe 65-year-old Rogers, who spent 30 years in different roles at Nashville State Community College, in January announced plans to retire from the nonprofit Alignment Nashville at the end of June. The mission of the group, where Rogers was founding executive director, is to connect businesses and other community groups with public schools.\n\nIn recent weeks, Harwell has become the focus of a statewide billboard campaign funded by Martha Ingram and other health care activists to urge Harwell to bring Insure Tennessee to a floor vote.\n\nHarwell has countered by arguing she can\u2019t unilaterally force a vote on Insure Tennessee, the health care program backed by Gov. Bill Haslam to extend health care coverage to low-income Tennesseans through federal funds made available by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nExpect Rogers \u2014 who lives just three blocks from Harwell \u2014 to bring up the issue of Insure Tennessee frequently in her uphill election against Harwell.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible to me how we cannot even have this discussion on the House floor,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThat is an issue that I will absolutely address. My two big issues are Insure Tennessee and public education.\u201d\n\nDistrict 56, which includes Forest Hills, Oak Hill, Belle Meade and Green Hills, features some of Davidson County\u2019s wealthiest and most conservative neighborhoods.\n\nHarwell, first elected in 1988 and on the short-list of potential 2018 Republican Tennessee gubernatorial candidates, has faced Democrat opponents twice in recent years and won both races easily.\n\nIn 2014, Harwell defeated Democrat Chris Moth in the House District 56 race by a margin of 63 percent to 37 percent. In 2010, Harwell beat Democrat Matt Kenigson by an even larger margin of 67 percent to 32 percent.\n\nRogers responded to those results by saying \u201ctimes are changing and people are increasingly frustrated \u2014 even and especially in this district.\u201d\n\nReach Joey Garrison at 615-259-8236 and on Twitter @joeygarrison.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1RTbCPY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Sydney Rogers, the head of a Nashville education nonprofit group, is mounting a campaign.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Sydney Rogers, the head of a Nashville education nonprofit group, is mounting a campaign.", "title": "Democrat Sydney Rogers to run for Beth Harwell's seat", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/03/democrat-sydney-rogers-run-beth-harwells-seat/82586818/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sydney Rogers, the head of a Nashville education nonprofit group, is mounting a campaign.", "title": "Democrat Sydney Rogers to run for Beth Harwell's seat", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f1aeb629d9945f4b51d61c48cbf9fb8c91d3354c/c=0-59-2272-2331&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Beth Harwell", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Beth Harwell", "title": "Democrat Sydney Rogers to run for Beth Harwell's seat", "author": "Joey Garrison", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca81babf9d85030bd92dd001613dd263811997c3/c=323-0-2115-2389/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6139402678dd912c65f8b4e82eae145d1ae456d9/c=0-59-2272-2331/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/79d9c85f2aa992c1c6f1a5911856a46b3d541c67/c=0-91-2269-1797/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20f0ee16fbc9fb72d11fc538553c6acbd3635c7b/c=0-27-2269-1309&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-04-03T17:41:04.547000-05:00", "shorthed": "Demcorat Rogers to run for Harwell seat", "articleid": 82586818, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/040940c8e7846bfff77506fc97b540b9e19b6981/c=0-27-2269-1309/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2403df66fe0cf799d43b3a045f1729d1171f9303/c=467-0-1805-2389/local/-/media/2016/04/03/Nashville/Nashville/635952980230087208-sydney-rogers.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Beth Harwell, Sydney Rogers"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Sydney Rogers (Photo: Tennessean/Sam Simpkins)Buy PhotoSydney Rogers, the head of a Nashville education nonprofit group, is mounting a campaign to run as a Democrat to challenge Republican Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell for her Nashville seat.\nBill Haslam to extend health care coverage to low-income Tennesseans through federal funds made available by the Affordable Care Act.\nHarwell has countered by arguing she can\u2019t unilaterally force a vote on Insure Tennessee, the health care program backed by Gov.\nExpect Rogers \u2014 who lives just three blocks from Harwell \u2014 to bring up the issue of Insure Tennessee frequently in her uphill election against Harwell.\nIn 2010, Harwell beat Democrat Matt Kenigson by an even larger margin of 67 percent to 32 percent."}
