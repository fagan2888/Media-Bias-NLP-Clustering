The Washington Post didn\u2019t exaggerate in today\u2019s front-page headline (paper edition) that read: \u201cSenator [Schumer] assailed on Iran stance: White House, allies go on the offensive.\u201d\n\nSchumer has previously said that the timing of the passage of Obamacare was a political mistake. This makes the New York Senator 0-2 when it comes to the main Obama legacy items, as far as the President\u2019s team is concerned\n\nSchumer is slated to become the next leader of the Senate Democrats. But Dan Pfeiffer, until recently Obama\u2019s \u201csenior political adviser\u201d and still a shill for the president, warned that Schumer could lose support for this position based on his stand against the Iran deal. He tweeted:\n\nSenator Schumer siding with the GOP against Obama, [Hillary] Clinton and most Democrats will make it hard for him to lead the Democrats in 2016. The base won\u2019t support someone who thought Obamacare was a mistake and wants War with Iran.\n\nI doubt that Schumer\u2019s stance will hurt his ability to lead Senate Democrats. He\u2019s apparently quite popular with his colleagues, many of whom he worked hard to elect. But contrast Obama, a lame duck, is said not be very popular with Senate Dems, many of whom blame him for their shrinking numbers. Pfeiffer\u2019s ludicrous claim that Schumer \u201cwants war with Iran\u201d won\u2019t increase his man\u2019s popularity among Senators of either party.\n\nYes, a majority of Senate Democrats will vote with Obama on the Iran deal. But his doesn\u2019t mean they think there\u2019s enough merit in it to hold Schumer\u2019s \u201cno\u201d vote against him.\n\nAs for the \u201cbase,\u201d Pfeiffer is correct in believing that it wants this deal. Like Obama, much of the American left dislikes Israel. Like Obama, much of the American left is not ill-disposed towards the Iranian regime, the \u201cdeath to America\u201d chants notwithstanding.\n\nBut Pfeiffer assumes that the base\u2019s preference matters when it comes to selecting Senate leaders. That\u2019s certainly not true on the Republican side. Mitch McConnell and Trent Lott were hardly base favorites. Indeed, a substantial portion of the base dislikes McConnell. Same with John Boehner in the House.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s different for Democrats, but I doubt it. Harry Reid was hardly a base favorite before he became the Democrats\u2019 leader in the Senate \u2014 the demands of remaining popular in Nevada had stood in the way.\n\nThe Senate used, notoriously, to be a club. Now, I believe, it usefully can be viewed as two clubs. The Democratic club is unlikely to take its cues on who shall lead it from either an unpopular, non-clubby lame duck president or a rabble of outsiders.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "As John has noted, the White House didn\u2019t take kindly to Chuck Schumer\u2019s announcement that he opposes the Iran nuclear deal.
