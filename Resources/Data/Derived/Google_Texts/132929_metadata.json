In the video, Dyer said StemExpress procures \u201cintact cases\u201d from abortion facilities such as Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\nThe actors portraying buyers from a human biologics company met with Dyer to discuss a potential partnership between their two companies.\n\n\u201cI mean if you had intact cases, which we\u2019ve done a lot, we sometimes ship those back to our lab in its entirety,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cSo that would also be great if you guys have those.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Center for Medical Progress, \u201can \u2018intact case\u2019 refers to an intact abortion with a whole fetus. \u2026 Feticidal chemicals like digoxin cannot be used to kill the fetus in a tissue procurement case, so a fetus delivered intact for organ harvesting is likely to be a born-alive infant.\u201d\n\nThe actors portraying buyers ask Dyer, \u201cWhat would keep your lab happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother 50 livers a week,\u201d Dyer said, adding that \u201cwe\u2019re working with almost triple-digit number clinics.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s a lot on volume a little more than what we do. It\u2019s a lot. So, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hit a capacity with us anytime in the next 10 years,\u201d she continued.\n\nDyer stressed that her business has experienced \u201cconsistent growth\u201d and implied that there would be a financial benefit to the relationship.\n\n\u201cWell, I mean we\u2019re going into it knowing that it has to be financially beneficial for you,\u201d the actor said.\n\n\u201cYeah, yeah, and both of us, for sure,\u201d Dyer replied.\n\nA StemExpress flier promised \u201cfinancial profits\u201d to clinics that supply them with aborted fetal tissue.\n\nDyer said that through \u201ctesting,\u201d she has seen unsanitary conditions in abortion facilities, and they are \u201cclinic-specific.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen really rampant, rampant problems with bacteria in certain clinics. Some where you\u2019re kind of in question of should they really, you know. \u2026 I\u2019ve seen staph [staphylococcus bacteria] come out of clinics. So, I mean, I\u2019ve seen all sorts of things come out of clinics, so.\u201d\n\nThe actor asks, \u201cDo you feel that support from Cecile [Richards] and from Deborah [Nucatola]?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, oh yeah,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cYou know, everyone at PPFA and just the affiliates. I just think that you\u2019re in the cause or you\u2019re not. If you\u2019re not in the cause, they don\u2019t need you around. They need champions, and if you\u2019re not a champion, then you should go. That\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know, the clinics are very guarded, as they should be. Who do they let in their house; they want champions in their house.\u201d\n\nDyer said the ratio between Planned Parenthood clinics and independent abortion clinics that StemExpress works with is \u201cprobably\u201d 50-50.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that one has more pros or cons than the other. I mean, Planned Parenthood has volume, because they are a volume institution,\u201d Dyer said.\n\nStemExpress recently announced it has terminated its relationship with Planned Parenthood.\n\nBoth StemExpress and Planned Parenthood are under congressional investigation, with lawmakers questioning the financial nature of their relationship.\n\nProfiting from the sale of fetal human organs is illegal in the United States.\n\n\u201cStemExpress is the \u2018weakest link\u2019 that unravels Planned Parenthood\u2019s baby parts chain\u2014they readily admit the profit-motive that Planned Parenthood and their proxies have in supplying aborted baby parts,\u201d the Center for Medical Progress\u2019 David Daleiden said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCongress and law enforcement should immediately seize all fetal tissue files from StemExpress and all communications and contracts with Planned Parenthood,\u201d Daleiden added. \u201cThe evidence that Planned Parenthood profits from the sale of aborted baby parts is now overwhelming, and not one more dime of taxpayer money should go to their corrupt and fraudulent criminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nIn a series of statements, Planned Parenthood and StemExpress have denied breaking any laws and making a profit from the sale of fetal body parts.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Daily Signal, Dyer claimed that she had been discussing intact livers rather than intact cadavers.\n\n\u201cConsistent with the company\u2019s prior public statements, StemExpress has never requested, received or provided to a researcher an \u2018intact fetus.\u2019 CMP\u2019s and Daleiden\u2019s continued lies reflect a sad attempt to malign StemExpress and me personally,\u201d Dyer said.\n\n\u201cAs anyone can see and read, the entire discussion was, in fact, about \u2018intact livers,\u2019 which are used by StemExpress to develop and purify isolated cells used by our customers to support their critical scientific research. My use of the term \u2018intact cases\u2019 is a medical term of art that refers solely to \u2018intact livers,\u2019 as there was absolutely no mention of \u2018intact fetuses\u2019 at any point in over two hours of illegally recorded video.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood did not immediately return The Daily Signal\u2019s request for comment.\n\nA temporary restraining order preventing the Center for Medical Progress from releasing the video of an undercover business meeting was lifted by a judge Friday, and the group subsequently released a trailer for its \u201cHuman Capital\u201d series featuring a clip of Dyer.\n\nThis post has been updated to include a response from StemExpress, who returned our request for comment after this article\u2019s publication.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She also wants \"50 livers a week.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "She also wants \"50 livers a week.\"", "title": "In New Video, StemExpress CEO Says She Wants \u2018Intact Cases,\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150825_CMPVideo_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-25T17:23:46+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1MKJUD3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "She also wants \"50 livers a week.\"", "title": "In New Video, StemExpress CEO Says She Wants \u2018Intact Cases,\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150825_CMPVideo_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-25T09:26:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-25T17:23:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, pro-life, Center for Medical Progress, undercover Planned Parenthood videos, Planned Parenthood videos"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0714\"", "article_summary": "In the video, Dyer said StemExpress procures \u201cintact cases\u201d from abortion facilities such as Planned Parenthood clinics.\nThe Center for Medical Progress released a new undercover video of a meeting with Cate Dyer, chief executive of StemExpress.\n\u201cSo that would also be great if you guys have those.\u201dAccording to the Center for Medical Progress, \u201can \u2018intact case\u2019 refers to an intact abortion with a whole fetus.\nBoth StemExpress and Planned Parenthood are under congressional investigation, with lawmakers questioning the financial nature of their relationship.\n\u201cCongress and law enforcement should immediately seize all fetal tissue files from StemExpress and all communications and contracts with Planned Parenthood,\u201d Daleiden added."}
