Now they actually are.\n\nOnly Lovers Left Alive is a bloodsucker romance filtered through writer-director Jarmusch\u2019s familiar downtown sensibility. It\u2019s filled with boho banter and deadpan in-jokes, and its score is a no-wave mash of stately lute pieces (by composer Jozef van Wissem) drenched with squalling guitar feedback (provided by Jarmusch and his band, SQ\u00dcRL). The picture drifts like a dark bank of fog\u2014it\u2019s mostly atmosphere. But it has feeling, too\u2014about the passage of time, the ebb and flow of worldly things. It\u2019s a little skimpy, but also entertainingly strange, and it\u2019s not likely to be confused with any other movie.\n\nThe vampire protagonists are Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton). They\u2019re ageless hipsters whose romantic devotion has spanned centuries. They\u2019ve seen it all\u2014the Flood, the Plague, the Inquisition\u2014and they\u2019ve known everybody worth knowing (Lord Byron was \u201ca pompous ass,\u201d Adam recalls). Eve is currently based in Tangier, surrounded by old books in many languages and venturing out at night to connect with her blood-dealing friend Marlowe (John Hurt), a playwright (yes, that Marlowe) who provides her with pure type O negative.\n\nAdam, meanwhile, is hunkered down in the dismal ruins of Detroit, cultivating his depression about the sorry state of the modern world (especially its contaminated blood supply) and his disdain for the humans who\u2019ve screwed it up. A gifted composer eternally cheated of public recognition by his vampire nature, he also broods about the injustice of his artistic obscurity. Eve, worried from afar about his mental state, books a flight to Detroit (a night flight, naturally) to cheer him up.\n\nHiddleston, with his dead-rockstar hair, and Swinton, with her wax-white skin and otherworldly eyes, are a droll undead couple, and Jarmusch surrounds them with wonderfully cluttered sets that suggest endless centuries of consumer accumulation. Adam\u2019s gothic mansion is a mad jumble of vinyl records, retro audio equipment, and all manner of vintage instruments. Apart from nighttime excursions to buy top-drawer blood from an amenable doctor (Jeffrey Wright), his only conduit to the outside world is a disheveled gofer named Ian (Anton Yelchin), who thinks Adam is just a reclusive musical genius and who tracks down the rare guitars he prizes.\n\nEve\u2019s arrival briefly dispels Adam\u2019s doleful solitude. But their reunion is spoiled by the unbidden appearance of Eve\u2019s sister, Ava (Mia Wasikowska), a chattering pixie vampire from Los Angeles. Her intrusion precipitates a bloody crisis that threatens to finally bring Adam and Eve\u2019s twilight lives to an end.\n\nThe movie is an original take on the vampire genre (although there\u2019s a nightclub scene that nods in the direction of Tony Scott\u2019s vamp-camp classic The Hunger). The picture might be interestingly paired, on some future double bill, with Jonathan Glazer\u2019s Under the Skin, which opened in limited release last week and is expanding across the country this weekend. That movie opens up the alien-invasion genre for an art-house mood exercise, dispensing with most of the gruesome specifics of the book on which it\u2019s based to focus on Scarlett Johansson\u2019s mysterious off-world visitor luring men to their doom in a strange pitch-black room. Glazer\u2019s film doesn\u2019t much resemble Only Lovers Left Alive\u2014it\u2019s coolly oblique where Jarmusch\u2019s movie is warm and engaging. Together, though, the two pictures demonstrate new possibilities in the musty realm of the horror flick. They may seem slight, in different ways, but they take root in the mind, where the best of the old-school monster films still linger.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston out for blood.", "title": "Only Lovers Left Alive", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/04/11/only-lovers-left-alive", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13971547755926.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The new Jim Jarmusch movie unfolds in what might\nbe an after-hours nightclub of the 1980s\u2014a hermetic world where\nit\u2019s always dark, but the pale-faced patrons wear shades anyway and\ncould easily pass for vampires.
