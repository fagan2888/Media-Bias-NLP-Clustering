The House now has the option of accepting changes or negotiating a deal. A third reading is still pending in the lower chamber.\n\nThe Senate added a provision allowing women to buy insurance through Vermont Health Connect when they get pregnant. Currently, pregnant women need to wait for an open enrollment period, because becoming pregnant is not considered a \u201clife change\u201d that qualifies for special enrollment.\n\nThe main provisions of H.620 codify the federal Affordable Care Act into Vermont law, saying that health insurance companies must provide access to birth control, including intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, with no copay.\n\nThe bill goes further to require Vermont\u2019s insurers to cover vasectomies for men with no out-of-pocket cost and allow women to buy a one-year supply of birth control pills, as opposed to one month or three months\u2019 worth.\n\nThe bill also would increase how much Vermont\u2019s Medicaid program reimburses doctors for inserting intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants. Advocates for the bill say doctors with higher reimbursement rates are more likely to stock expensive IUDs and implants, therefore giving women more access to those birth control methods.\n\nSen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison, spoke in favor of the bill on the Senate floor. She said 50 percent of pregnancies in Vermont are unintended and that unintended pregnancies affect women\u2019s educational and career goals.\n\nFurther, Ayer said 74 percent of unintended pregnancies in Vermont are paid for through Medicaid. \u201cThis bill will ensure contraceptive access,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will improve our public health and save the state money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "birth control, contraceptive, h.620, health care, vermont health connect, vermont legislature, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "The Senate has passed a bill that would expand women\u2019s access to long-acting birth control and men\u2019s access to vasectomies, and allow pregnant women to enroll in Vermont Health Connect more conveniently.
