Late Monday, the Long Beach, Calif.-based company reported losses that were double those of estimates from analysts polled by FactSet, and fell short of sales predictions. Shares fell 5% in recent action to $34.05.\n\nMolina Healthcare Logo from Molina\u2019s 2012 Investor Day program\n\nAnalysts say, though, that the real key to finding out where Molina is headed will come Thursday. That\u2019s when the company holds its investor day presentations in New York and is expected to discuss its own 2014 forecast, as well as corporate strategy and business outlook.\n\n\u201cGuidance given at investor day, not [fourth-quarter] earnings, will be the main driver on sentiment for Molina, in our view,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Sarah James said in a note to clients. She said that she sees 2015 results as a more important guide for future earnings, which she sees as being $14.7 billion to $15.7 billion, well above the current $12.28 billion now estimated by FactSet.\n\nMolina could well offer its own updated 2015 number on Thursday, and James expects it to be above that FactSet estimate. Key to the Thursday meeting is Molina\u2019s view on contracts in Ohio, South Carolina and Michigan.\n\nJefferies & Co. analyst David Windley agreed with James that the upcoming investor day was critical to the point where he simply titled his post-earnings note on Molina: \u201cThursday, Thursday, Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cManagement deferred the most interesting parts to the investor meeting on Thursday in NY,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnother thing that may be offering a false reading on the company\u2019s stock is whether Molina actually missed estimates. The company said on its conference call that an unfavorable premium adjustment in one of its territories was responsible for some of its loss, and most analysts agreed the company met its numbers. But FactSet and investors apparently had something else in mind.\n\nMolina said its net loss for the quarter was $9.13 million, or 20 cents a share, swinging from a gain of $25.64 million, or 55 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. The FactSet estimate called for a loss of 10 cents a share, but analysts individually said when the premium adjustment is taken into account, Molina finished on target.\n\nWhat was clear, however, is that revenue fell short of forecasts. Sales were $1.71 billion against last year\u2019s $1.58 billion, and 4% below the expected $1.78 billion.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nSmaller companies get another year to comply with Obamacare\n\nCBO chief: Obamacare will reduce \u201cincentive to work\u201d\n\nAnalyst upgrade, not data hack, drives St. Jude shares", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-02-11T13:05:11-05:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Shares of Medicaid insurer Molina Healthcare Inc. take a dive after the company reports a fourth-quarter loss, but analysts say investors' reaction may be premature.", "title": "Molina tumbles on earnings, but analysts say reaction is premature", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/11/molina-tumbles-on-earnings-but-analysts-say-reaction-is-premature/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU384_molina_MG_20140211123749.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "earnings,investor day,Molina Healthcare Inc.", "article.headline": "Molina tumbles on earnings, but analysts say reaction is premature", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "earnings,investor day,Molina Healthcare Inc.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Shares of Medicaid insurer Molina Healthcare Inc. take a dive after the company reports a fourth-quarter loss, but analysts say investors' reaction may be premature.", "article.published": "2014-02-11T13:05:11-05:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/11/molina-tumbles-on-earnings-but-analysts-say-reaction-is-premature/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Shares of Medicaid insurer Molina Healthcare Inc. take a dive after the company reports a fourth-quarter loss, but analysts say investors' reaction may be premature.", "title": "Molina tumbles on earnings, but analysts say reaction is premature", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/02/11/molina-tumbles-on-earnings-but-analysts-say-reaction-is-premature/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BU384_molina_MG_20140211123749.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2053", "article.updated": "2014-02-11T13:05:11-05:00"}, "article_summary": "Shares of Medicaid insurer Molina Healthcare Inc. took a dive Tuesday after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss, but analysts say investors\u2019 reaction may be premature.\nMolina Healthcare Logo from Molina\u2019s 2012 Investor Day programAnalysts say, though, that the real key to finding out where Molina is headed will come Thursday.\n\u201cGuidance given at investor day, not [fourth-quarter] earnings, will be the main driver on sentiment for Molina, in our view,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Sarah James said in a note to clients.\nThat\u2019s when the company holds its investor day presentations in New York and is expected to discuss its own 2014 forecast, as well as corporate strategy and business outlook.\nThe FactSet estimate called for a loss of 10 cents a share, but analysts individually said when the premium adjustment is taken into account, Molina finished on target."}
