Watson\n\nNEWS BOOK REVIEWER\n\nIn March 2013, Time magazine published a groundbreaking cover story by Steven Brill titled \u201cBitter Pill: Why Medical Bills Are Killing Us.\u201d The attention-grabbing article vividly described the dysfunction in how hospitals and doctors bill for costly procedures and argued for transparency in pricing.\n\nLater that year, Brill \u2014 the author of several books and a founder of Court TV and the magazine \u201cThe American Lawyer\u201d \u2014 told his editors he wanted to report a follow-up article on the launch of Obamacare, which he considered \u201cthe most ambitious domestic government project since Medicare.\u201d\n\nThe act remains deeply controversial today, nearly five years after it was signed into law, and it remains front-page news. The Supreme Court this month heard arguments in a case that could invalidate in most states the subsidies that lured the young and healthy into the act\u2019s insurance exchanges. And the White House scrambled to contain the damage last month when hundreds of thousands of Americans received incorrect Obamacare tax data.\n\nBack in fall 2013 and early 2014, Brill made numerous trips to Washington to watch the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act, and this reporting forms the heart of the best-selling \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill.\u201d\n\nThe book is split roughly in two, with the first half devoted to a history of healthcare financing, an assessment of today\u2019s \u201cbroken\u201d medical system and the battle to find a way to fix it.\n\nThe second half of the book picks up from the day the act became law and takes us through the opening of the exchanges and the struggle to save HealthCare.gov from the missteps of the Obama administration. Brill\u2019s account of the \u201croller-coaster story of Obamacare\u201d begins with a history lesson and some telling statistics.\n\nIn 1929, spending on healthcare was equal to 1 percent of the American economy; by 2008, it was 16 percent, and well on its way to 20 percent. The total healthcare bill in the U.S. in 2014 was $3 trillion, more than the next 10 biggest spenders combined, with health outcomes that are no better than those of our more frugal peers.\n\nThe health insurers are most often painted as the villains, but Brill writes that their profit margins are dwarfed by those of the pharmaceutical companies, medical device makers and many hospital networks.\n\nBy 2008, the stars had begun to align for reform, as pressure grew from patients, employers and policymakers. Early on, advocates focused their agenda on what Brill calls the \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d of healthcare reform: requiring insurers to accept anyone regardless of a pre-existing condition, mandating that everyone obtain insurance and subsidizing the cost of coverage for the working poor.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill\u201d devotes great detail to the painstaking work of drafting, and winning support for, the ACA. The trouble was when reformers and legislative aides talked about cutting healthcare costs, or raising taxes to pay for the cost of expanding coverage, the various interest groups wondered whose ox would be gored.\n\nOne by one, the pharma companies, insurers, hospitals, device makers and doctors met with officials to protect their profits. The backroom deal-making was far from the \u201cnegotiations televised on C-SPAN\u201d promised by President Obama.\n\nWhile the ACA early on carried the promise of bipartisan backing, its prospective Republican boosters all withdrew their support, a trend hastened by the rise of the Tea Party.\n\nThe bill passed only after Democrats made sleazy deals with recalcitrant senators from their own party \u2014 the Cornhusker Kickback, the Louisiana Purchase \u2014 and followed a legislative strategy that avoided the need to find 60 votes to break a GOP filibuster. At the 2010 bill signing, Vice President Joe Biden was caught on a hot mike saying, \u201cThis is a big f---ing deal.\u201d Indeed.\n\nHowever, Brill writes, the administration was unprepared to implement the law. Brill describes \u201cpanicked internal emails,\u201d bureaucratic infighting and an unwillingness to take responsibility for the HealthCare.gov website, saying the president and his advisers \u201csloughed off the details of governing.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even count the policy misfires, such as Obama\u2019s \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it\u201d broken promise. Throughout this section, Brill contrasts the problems in Washington with the efficient rollout of Kentucky\u2019s state exchange.\n\nMuch of the second half follows the IT team brought in to salvage the federal website; its members did noble work, but the story of their bacon-saving code-writing does not make for compelling reading.\n\nAfter the end of the first enrollment period for the exchanges, Brill credits the act with bringing coverage to millions of the uninsured. But he laments the lost opportunities to rein in skyrocketing spending, and truly affordable healthcare still remains out of reach for many.\n\nBrill begins the book in New York Presbyterian Hospital, where he underwent surgery to repair an aortic aneurysm. Later in \u201cAmerica\u2019s Bitter Pill,\u201d he returns to the not-for-profit hospital to grill the CEO about the $197,000 bill for Brill\u2019s surgery, and about the executive\u2019s $3.58 million salary.\n\nHis gratitude for the costly MRI that saved his life shows the problem: \u201cWhen you\u2019re staring up at someone from the gurney, you have no inclination to be a savvy consumer. You have no power. Only hope.\u201d\n\nFinally, he offers his own solution to the healthcare financing mess: an \u201cintegrated delivery and finance system,\u201d a fancy term for an insurance company with its own hospital, clinics, doctors and labs. It\u2019s a matter, Brill writes, of \u201caligning the interests of those who provide care with those who pay for it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one way to look at it. The other is you\u2019re creating a monopoly, which won\u2019t protect the interests of the patient .\n\nBrill does lay out some caveats: There must be two such systems in every market, a cap on operating profits, a cap on pay to non-medical employees, a patient appeals process and only licensed physicians should serve as CEOs of the companies.\n\nI\u2019ll offer some caveats of my own for his book: There are too many policy wonks, IT experts and healthcare consumers introduced to the reader; he quotes too often from less-than-scintillating policy memos; there are some minor mistakes (Kent Conrad was a senator from North Dakota, not Nebraska); and some inelegant phrasing (\u201cIt was a huge red flag waved in front of a thousand bulls\u201d).\n\nNonetheless, the book is a thoroughly researched history of what ails our medical system, with a provocative prescription for a cure, from someone who understands healthcare financing as well as any layperson.\n\nStephen T.
