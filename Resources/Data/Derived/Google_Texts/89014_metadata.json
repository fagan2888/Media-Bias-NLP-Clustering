Twentyfour Student, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nFrom a very young age, we\u2019re all taught to share. Whether it\u2019s toys, clothing, or anything else. The words, \u201csharing is caring,\u201d is something that resonates with many people. Sharing is not only a nice thing to do, it can also make you happy.\n\nIn a 2008 study by Harvard Business School, Professor Michael Norton found that spending money on someone else can make you happier than if you were to spend it on yourself. \"Intentional activities \u2014 practices in which people actively and effortfully choose to engage \u2014 may represent a promising route to lasting happiness. Supporting this premise, our work demonstrates that how people choose to spend their money is at least as important as how much money they make,\" he said.\n\nSo, in regard to being giving and caring, sharing is actually a good thing. However, when it comes to hygienic products and toiletries, you should never share these things.\n\nHere are a few of the no-share items:\n\n1. Toothbrush\n\nTo some, this might seem gross, but many couples, both married and dating have admitted to sharing their partner\u2019s toothbrush. Research from UkBathrooms.com found that British couples admitted to sharing a toothbrush: \u201c26 percent of respondents did with 70 percent of them stating that they didn\u2019t see it as \u2018unhygienic.\u2019 Plus, 56 percent claimed that they had shared the same toothbrush for more than a year.\u201d\n\nHowever, sharing a toothbrush can cause a number of issues, and it\u2019s actually quite unhygienic. According to the American Dental Association, sharing a toothbrush could result in an increase of infections. This is riskier for people who have compromised immune systems of existing infectious diseases.\n\n2. Razors\n\nThis one might not seem as obvious because you\u2019re just using it across your skin, right? Wrong. Razors can spread infections such as warts, folliculitis, or jock itch \u2014 even if there is no cut present. You\u2019ll also get a better shave if you use your own. \u201cA good rule of thumb is to replace the blade after five to 10 uses, and you'll be able to keep track more efficiently if you have a blade that's all your own,\u201d said Dr. Jeanie Chung Leddon, Boulder Valley Center for Dermatology, in a WebMD magazine feature.\n\n3. Towels\n\nTowel sharing of any kind is a big no-no, even if the towel was just used after stepping out of the shower. Bacteria such as staph infection bacteria can live on the towel for a few hours, days, or even months. This is probably longer for a towel, since it has the ability to retain moisture and other bacteria, too. Change your towels at least once a week, hang them to dry in an open space, and never share them with anyone \u2014 not even family members.\n\n4. Soap\n\nWhile bar soap does seem to be self-cleaning, the bar can still hold bacteria. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends liquid soap over bar soap, but if you love using a bar, get your own. In a 2006 study, researchers found that soap was a source of continuous reinfection in dental clinics. \u201cIt could be because bars of soap don't usually dry all the way between uses, especially on the bottom, leading to an accumulation of bacteria, fungi, and yeast that can be passed from person to person,\u201d Neal Schultz, a cosmetic dermatologist in New York City, told The Huffington Post.\n\n5. Combs/ Brushes\n\nCombs can spread a number of diseases such as head lice, scabies, and sometimes even a staph infection. Even people in families should not share hairbrushes. However, sharing hair brushes is hard not to do, especially when you visit the salon or barber, but make sure they use some sort of sanitizer before running anything though your hair. You should also clean your personal brushes, fill a bowl with anti-bacterial soap and water, and soak your brushes for about an hour or so. Rinse thoroughly and repeat this process every two weeks.\n\n6. Deodorant\n\nYuck! Why would you want someone else\u2019s perspiration on you anyway, right? Well, some couples actually share everything, including their deodorant. Sweating breaks down the sweat in your skin. There is, however, a difference between using a roll-on and a stick. According to Dr. Schulz, \u201cwith a deodorant stick, he says, you can transfer skin cells and hair, which plays to some people's lower threshold for the gross, but won't result in infection.\u201d A roll-on deodorant has the ability to transfer more bacteria because of its sticky quality.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hygiene, deodorant, combs, brushes. towels, toothbrush", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "While it's acceptable to share some bathroom products, we have a list of the ones that you should never ever borrow or lend.", "title": "Sharing Is Not Caring: 6 Personal Health Items You Should Never Share", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/when-sharing-not-caring-6-personal-health-items-you-should-never-share-and-what-happens-if-you-do", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/6120486618d898e2de55z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While it's acceptable to share some bathroom products, we have a list of the ones that you should never ever borrow or lend.", "title": "Sharing Is Not Caring: 6 Personal Health Items You Should Never Share", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/when-sharing-not-caring-6-personal-health-items-you-should-never-share-and-what-happens-if-you-do", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/6120486618d898e2de55z.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/10/6120486618d898e2de55z.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-07-11T09:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-11T12:04:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "While it's acceptable to share some bathroom products, we have a list of the ones that you should never ever borrow or lend."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf24b\"", "article_summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends liquid soap over bar soap, but if you love using a bar, get your own.\nSoapWhile bar soap does seem to be self-cleaning, the bar can still hold bacteria.\nWhile it's acceptable to share some bathroom products, we have a list of the ones that you should never ever borrow or lend.\nHowever, when it comes to hygienic products and toiletries, you should never share these things.\nToothbrushTo some, this might seem gross, but many couples, both married and dating have admitted to sharing their partner\u2019s toothbrush."}
