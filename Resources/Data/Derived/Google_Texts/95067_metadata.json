They could be out of a job on Friday with the new year.\n\n\n\nA meeting is happening within the hour with the 68 nurses and their attorney.\n\nHe tells me, he was given those work rules this morning - 94 pages \u2013 but he can\u2019t share them because they are confidential. So this is still very much, unresolved.\n\nThe 68 nurse anesthetists work 24-7 for emergency and scheduled surgeries at St. John Providence in Southfield and at Providence Park in Novi.\n\n\n\nMany have worked for the hospitals for years, some for decades.\n\n\n\nThe new outsourced company was formed by a local anesthesiologist, Dr. Dominick Lago, who told 7 Action News he had no comment on this bitter labor dispute today.\n\n\n\nThe attorney for the nurses says they would get the same base pay, but have reduced benefits and those unknown work rules.\n\n\n\nAnd to play hardball, the company has told the nurses they are not fired, but resigned, so no severance pay and they have to buy their own health care coverage.\n\n\n\nThey are getting national attention on twitter, with supporters tweeting: don\u2019t muzzle them and very sad it comes to this.\n\nThe hospital group says it is moving on with or without the holdout nurses with this statement:", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "A battle of nerves is underway for a metro Detroit hospital group and dozens of its nurses, being called courageous.", "author": "Jim Kiertzner", "og": {"site_name": "WXYZ", "description": "A battle of nerves is underway for a metro Detroit hospital group and dozens of its nurses, being called courageous.", "title": "Outsourcing dispute could cost Oakland County nurse anesthetists their jobs as early as Friday", "url": "http://www.wxyz.com/news/region/oakland-county/outsourcing-dispute-could-cost-oakland-county-nurse-anesthetists-their-jobs-as-early-as-friday", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.wxyz.com/photo/2015/12/29/Outsourcing_dispute_could_cost_nurses_th_0_29094176_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 483191925, "iphone": 487339214}}, "site": "@wxyzdetroit", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Outsourcing dispute could cost nurses their jobs", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.wxyz.com,recp.mkt32.net", "keywords": "Oakland County,News,Local News,Homepage Showcase", "fb": {"app_id": 390778121043807}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Jim Kiertzner"}, "msvalidate.01": "F33258882556C3E953931ECED98AF6A1", "google-site-verification": "YgNq0VqU8iTobD793oq4klCAi8w3qx9ROSeuR9Jlu-4", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/wxyzdetroit", "section": "Oakland County", "published_time": "2015-12-29T23:15:35+0000", "modified_time": "2015-12-29T23:15:35+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "hasVideo": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Their jobs are being outsourced and they refuse to keep working without knowing the new work rules.\nHe tells me, he was given those work rules this morning - 94 pages \u2013 but he can\u2019t share them because they are confidential.\n(WXYZ) - A battle of nerves is underway for a metro Detroit hospital group and dozens of its nurses, being called courageous.\nThe hospital group says it is moving on with or without the holdout nurses with this statement:\nThe attorney for the nurses says they would get the same base pay, but have reduced benefits and those unknown work rules."}
