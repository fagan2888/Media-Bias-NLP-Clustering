Guegan's RBI single in ninth guides Boulder past Broomfield

The situation was storybook in itself. Then Montana Guegan produced the storybook ending.

The Boulder senior chopped a single over Broomfield's drawn-in infield Saturday at Scott Carpenter Park, which plated Henry Ryan with the winning run in the host Panthers' 3-2, nine-inning win against the Eagles.

Of course, this was no ordinary Class 5A Front Range League game. Boulder coach Colt Sedbrook — who starred on the baseball diamond and on the gridiron at Broomfield — was facing his former squad for the first time.

"It was a surreal, bittersweet type of a feeling the entire game," Sedbrook said. "Making sure I was with my guys was the number one thing, not getting wrapped up in my emotions and making sure I do my job as a coach.

"Throughout the game, I thought about that transition from player to coach, where I've been and how I've gotten to where I am now."

On a pristine spring Boulder morning, this qualified as one of the season's most entertaining games. Broomfield starter Carlos Amador and Boulder's Grant Rogers were magnificent, and Boulder (6-4, 3-1) got an RBI single from Ari Barnett in the bottom of the sixth to tie it up 2-2.

Boulder reliever Isaac Parks pitched three hitless innings to keep the score even entering the bottom of the ninth.

After Ryan and Max Bajza drew successive walks for Boulder to begin the ninth, Andrew McCarthy moved the runners up with a sacrifice. Broomfield (3-7, 1-3) then intentionally walked Cam Burke to set up a force at home or a potential double-play.

Guegan followed with a chopper over the shortstop and into center field, and the Panthers gave Sedbrook his signature win in his two seasons at the helm.

"We knew it was a really important game and we wanted to come out and win it for him," Guegan said. "We came through in the end. My teammates did a great job getting on, so I was just trying to get them in."

Broomfield built a 2-0 lead when Shane Wetzel tripled and scored on a passed ball in the third and James Notary added an RBI single in the fifth. Eagles coach Garren Estes, who coached Sedbrook in high school before he moved on to Dixie State, the University of Arizona and St. Louis Cardinals organization, was opposing his former pupil for the first time.

"He coaches just like he was as a player," Estes said. "He never quits and he's got his kids believing that if they stay in a game, something's going to happen. We just didn't capitalize on the chances we had and they did."

Estes said his Eagles are nearing a breakthrough in their first season in 5A, but for now: "We're competing to stay in the game but we're not competing to win."

The contest featured plenty of tense moments, including a few collisions. Boulder outfielders Burke and Dana Sullivan collided in right-center field in the sixth, leaving Sullivan down for a few moments. Burke made the catch and doubled off a runner on the play. Sullivan remained in the game.

In the top of the ninth, Broomfield's Logan McCormick tried to score from third on a bunt and plowed into Bajza at the plate. Bajza held on for the out and, although the contact wasn't malicious, McCormick was ejected for running into the catcher.

"It was one of those games that I will forever, forever remember," Sedbrook said. "I'm very proud of the Boulder kids. They did a great job. And I'm very proud of the Broomfield kids. They played hard."
