What kind of person does that? I don\u2019t like any of our cereal. Why can\u2019t you buy the cereal we like? Move over! You\u2019re in my way!\u201d\n\nAfter school, another child slams the door as he enters the car. \u201cPlease, just go!\u201d he demands. As soon as we round the corner, he bursts into tears. \u201cIt was terrible! I totally messed up and froze on the stage, and I didn\u2019t get called back.\u201d\n\nLater, a third child leans in for a hug, her body wracked with sobs. She grieves for a friend who struggles with depression. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he is anymore! I don\u2019t know how to reach him, and I miss him.\u201d\n\nAll parents want their children to be happy. Nevertheless, we will at times be confronted with the reality of having to guide our children through turbulent emotions.\n\nWe may wish we could shield our children or bear the pain on their behalf. Our job, however, is to help them gain independence in navigating the negative feelings that are very much their own. How do we do that?\n\nOffer a consistent haven. Children need to feel safe enough to express their feelings. It may take time to find words to convey what they are feeling. Pressuring our children to talk too soon about their intense and personal emotions may backfire, so it\u2019s important to give them room to spend some time absorbing their thoughts alone.\n\nListen. Part of being a safe haven includes biting our tongues and holding our advice until we have heard the full story from the child\u2019s point of view and given them time to reach their own conclusions and possible solutions.\n\nInitiate conversations in non-threatening environments. Many parents find that car rides offer the ideal setting for meaningful conversations. While driving, parents can offer full attention without the pressure of eye contact. Others find taking a walk or participating in a joint activity can provide the best opportunity for conversations to naturally occur.\n\nOffer comfort through touch. When young children hurt, we instinctively pick them up. Even older children long for physical affection. A hug, a back rub or simply holding hands can go a long way. Older children and teenagers need us to continue the physical connections they crave.\n\nMake use of time outs \u2014 for the parents. We have deep connections to our children that may make it difficult for us to remain objective. At times our emotional interactions become a struggle for control. One way to avoid falling into the trap is to say, \u201cI have said everything I am going to say and I will not argue about this.\u201d\n\n\u2014Merete Kropp is a child development specialist.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/10/AP825202203264.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Our job, however, is to help them gain independence in navigating the negative feelings that are very much their own.\nI don\u2019t know how to reach him, and I miss him.\u201dAll parents want their children to be happy.\nNevertheless, we will at times be confronted with the reality of having to guide our children through turbulent emotions.\nOlder children and teenagers need us to continue the physical connections they crave.\nWe have deep connections to our children that may make it difficult for us to remain objective."}
