It\u2019s what checkbooks need to stay in the black. It\u2019s what the New England Patriots need to be successful on offense.\n\nAdditional Images Stevan Ridley of the New England Patriots has to be used more for the team to acquire the balanced offense it needs to succeed. The Associated Press UP NEXT WHO: Raiders (0-2) at Patriots (1-1) WHEN: 1 p.m. Sunday TV: CBS Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nWhile the NFL may be in an era of high-flying offenses, with rules favoring gun-slinging quarterbacks and speedy receivers, the New England Patriots are the perfect example of why the running game should not be ignored.\n\nWhen the Patriots lost their opener in Miami 33-20, Tom Brady threw 56 passes and the Patriots ran the ball only 20 times. In last Sunday\u2019s 30-7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings, Brady threw 22 passes and the Patriots ran the ball 37 times, with Stevan Ridley gaining 101 yards on 25 carries.\n\nThat last stat is particularly significant because since 2000 \u2013 the beginning of the Bill Belichick era \u2013 the Patriots are 38-1 when they have a running back gain at least 100 yards. They have won their last 25 games with a 100-yard rusher, the only loss coming back in 2004.\n\nRidley seemed particularly impressed when he was told about that statistic Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the type of balance we need.\u201d\n\nMaybe they need Brady to throw more than 22 times, but it\u2019s obvious they don\u2019t need him to throw 56 times. The Patriots are 1-5 in games in which Brady throws at least 55 passes. Interestingly, the last two losses have come in Miami, on Dec. 15, 2013, and two weeks ago in the season opener.\n\nWhen Brady throws the ball 50 or more times, New England is 10-7, including three overtime wins. Nine of those games have come since the start of the 2012 season.\n\nThe game has obviously changed, but it appears the Patriots need to make sure they don\u2019t neglect the run.\n\n\u201cI just think the biggest thing is for us to stay balanced,\u201d said Ridley. \u201cI just know when we have a balanced attack we\u2019re better as an offense. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re striving for. But it\u2019s so early in the season, we don\u2019t have the kinks worked out right now \u2026 we\u2019re just trying to figure it out as a team.\u201d\n\nThe offensive line still is unsettled, though it played better last week against the Vikings than it did against the Dolphins. And Ridley took that as a positive sign.\n\n\u201cFrom Miami to Minnesota, they made a drastic improvement,\u201d he noted. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep relying on each other and leaning on each other, and I think at the end of the year we\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThe Patriots\u2019 running game should be on full display Sunday against the Oakland Raiders in New England\u2019s home opener at 1 p.m. at Gillette Stadium. The Raiders are giving up 200 rushing yards per game \u2013 worst in the NFL.\n\n\u201cWe just haven\u2019t done a good enough job of stopping the run,\u201d said Raiders Coach Dennis Allen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job of that.\u201d\n\nOne of the biggest differences between the Patriots\u2019 opening loss and their win last week was the way they kept running the ball. Against Miami, New England attempted just six running plays in the second half. Against Minnesota, the Patriots ran the ball 19 times for 96 yards in the second half, with Ridley picking up 72 yards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good that they stuck with me late in the game, but really that\u2019s the coach\u2019s call,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever I get them, I just go out there and run hard.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was obvious New England\u2019s offensive line was controlling Minnesota\u2019s defensive line in the second half. \u201cWe felt good about how we were attacking them toward the end, and that\u2019s how we were moving the ball,\u201d said Ridley. \u201cSome days it\u2019s going to be through the air, some days it\u2019s going to be on the ground.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about this offense, Ridley stressed. It would be silly to simply employ one aspect of it with so many skilled players.\n\n\u201cWe showed what we can do (running the ball),\u201d he said. \u201cWe know what our quarterback can do and what our receivers can do, so we can definitely get it done through the air when we have to.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re working on this ground game right now and eventually, in these upcoming weeks, we\u2019ll have a balanced attack going into every game. That\u2019s when it makes a defense hard to stop us.\u201d\n\nWhen Belichick talks about being balanced, he doesn\u2019t mean just between running and throwing.\n\n\u201cI think offensively we could certainly stand to get a lot more balance into our attack overall, period,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have it in the run-pass ratio in Miami and we didn\u2019t really have enough of it in the passing game (against Minnesota), or really for Miami for that matter.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of good players. We have to be more effective utilizing all of them.\u201d\n\nFor instance, while Tom Brady has zeroed in on Julian Edelman (15 targets, 12 catches for 176 yards in two games) and Rob Gronkowski (17 targets, eight catches for 72 yards), he has all but ignored wide receivers Brandon LaFell (six targets \u2013 none against the Vikings \u2013 zero catches) and Danny Amendola (six targets \u2013 one against Minnesota \u2013 three catches, 15 yards). Even running back Shane Vereen, considered an impossible matchup for many defenses, only touched the ball seven times against Minnesota.\n\nBrady knows he has to look elsewhere. \u201cA big part of what we\u2019re trying to do offensively to make us hard to defend is to be able to throw the ball to everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nJosh McDaniels, the Patriots\u2019 offensive coordinator, stressed that the game plan will change week to week but that the Patriots always want to be physical.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to measure how tough you are, you certainly offensively need to be able to run the football,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s been something that has always been a goal of ours to try to be a tough, smart offense, and that really starts with your ability to run the football.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to be balanced each week, and hopefully we can maintain that as the year goes on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "New England showed a solid running game last week, and now faces an Oakland run defense that is ranked last in the NFL.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "New England showed a solid running game last week, and now faces an Oakland run defense that is ranked last in the NFL.", "title": "Patriots' offense looking for more balance against Raiders - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 794, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/506111_105932-Ridley.jpg", "height": 1000}, "updated_time": "2014-09-21T00:44:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/09/21/patriots-offense-looking-for-more-balance-against-raiders/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New England showed a solid running game last week, and now faces an Oakland run defense that is ranked last in the NFL.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/506111_105932-Ridley.jpg", "title": "Patriots' offense looking for more balance against Raiders - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "New England Patriots", "published_time": "2014-09-21T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-21T00:44:40-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf46\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s what the New England Patriots need to be successful on offense.\nThe game has obviously changed, but it appears the Patriots need to make sure they don\u2019t neglect the run.\nWhen the Patriots lost their opener in Miami 33-20, Tom Brady threw 56 passes and the Patriots ran the ball only 20 times.\nJosh McDaniels, the Patriots\u2019 offensive coordinator, stressed that the game plan will change week to week but that the Patriots always want to be physical.\nAgainst Minnesota, the Patriots ran the ball 19 times for 96 yards in the second half, with Ridley picking up 72 yards."}
