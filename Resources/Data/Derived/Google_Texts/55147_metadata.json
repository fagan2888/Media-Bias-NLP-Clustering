(WNCN) \u2013 North Carolina lawmakers could take up a bill that would help low-income people who need dialysis treatment be able to pay for health coverage.\n\nFor truck driver Craig Moore, a doctor\u2019s 2007 diagnosis of kidney failure meant he could no longer work.\n\nHe needed dialysis treatment three days a week for four hours a day.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to get a full-time job when I\u2019m married to the machine,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe American Kidney Fund stepped in and paid for his health coverage through Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nThe Fund does the same for about 1,200 other dialysis patients statewide who are insured through Blue Cross.\n\nThis past summer, Blue Cross stopped accepting third-party payments for dialysis patients.\n\nThat means for patients like Moore, the American Kidney Fund can only send them a check directly.\n\nHe and many other clients don\u2019t have bank accounts, so they need to have the checks cashed, which creates a new problem.\n\n\u201cThis change is having an enormous impact and the impact is on the patients,\u201d said Tamara Ruggiero with the American Kidney Fund. \u201cThey may choose to use that check for their food or their rent or whatever the case may be.\u201d\n\nThat means their insurance might not get paid.\n\nA Blue Cross spokesman said the reason for the change are new federal guidelines that express concern with accepting certain third-party payments. The payments ultimately could skew the insurance risk pool.\n\n\u201cWe are obligated as a regulated organization and agency to follow those guidelines,\u201d said Lew Borman with Blue Cross.\n\nWithout a way to get their payments accepted, the American Kidney Fund turned to state lawmakers.\n\nRep. Marilyn Avila (R-Wake) sponsored a bill that would require insurance companies accept third-party payments from the American Kidney Fund.\n\nRead more on HB 809\n\nThat bill is pending at the General Assembly.\n\nBut in recent days, Blue Cross said it will grandfather in dialysis patients who receive Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental insurance\n\n\u201cBy the exception we\u2019re making, we\u2019ll be able to grandfather in those who may be the most severely affected,\u201d Borman said.\n\nBut supporters of the legislation say that doesn\u2019t go far enough.\n\n\u201cIt still doesn\u2019t solve the problem for all of their insured,\u201d Avila said.\n\nMoore wants to see a different solution.\n\n\u201cI think it should go back to the way it was. If the kidney foundation pays it, let them pay it,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe American Kidney Fund said all other insurance companies in North Carolina are still accepting their payments.\n\nBlue Cross said the exception that it\u2019s now offering would cover 91 percent of their clients that the American Kidney fund helps and the remaining ones would qualify for affordable care act plans.\n\nRuggiero disputed that, saying Blue Cross would not accept AKF\u2019s payments for those plans and added that most dialysis patients need to choose Medicare as their primary insurance.\n\nThe bill has already passed the House and, when lawmakers reconvene, it will be pending in the Senate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "North Carolina lawmakers could take up a bill that would help low-income people who need dialysis treatment be able to pay for health covera\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=425414520", "og": {"site_name": "WNCN", "description": "North Carolina lawmakers could take up a bill that would help low-income people who need dialysis treatment be able to pay for health coverage.", "title": "Proposed NC bill could make Blue Cross accept third-party payments for dialysis", "url": "http://wncn.com/2015/12/21/proposed-nc-bill-could-make-blue-cross-accept-third-party-payments-for-dialysis/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/moore-dialysis.jpg", "height": 359}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "North Carolina lawmakers could take up a bill that would help low-income people who need dialysis treatment be able to pay for health coverage.", "title": "Proposed NC bill could make Blue Cross accept third-party payments for dialysis", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwncn.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/moore-dialysis.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@wncn", "site": "wncn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "dialysis, nc legislature", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_4ef95b9ddabd80873ba6a8406f5bfa55", "fb": {"pages": 69688774749}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wncn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/caee67290db345cd25db23a5a27c462f?s=16", "application-name": "WNCN", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WNCNTV", "published_time": "2015-12-21T21:06:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T01:14:57+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "JziH-ux2vlTCnig0bnUsUMzGF0B1kdNRMW7oV48jIEc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The American Kidney Fund stepped in and paid for his health coverage through Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nThis past summer, Blue Cross stopped accepting third-party payments for dialysis patients.\nRep.
