A man and woman were hospitalized Saturday morning after a fight over Christmas lights turned physical.

The 29-year-old man called police around 6:30 a.m., saying his girlfriend hit him in the head with a baseball bat. Officers arrived in the 3900 block of West 2nd Street and found the 36-year-old woman had also injured herself.

The man was hospitalized with a concussion and arrested on an unrelated warrant.

The woman was treated for a self-inflicted cut. Police said she faces a charge of aggravated battery, but she tells KAKE News she didn't hit the man with the bat and the charge has been dismissed.
