What gives? A big part of the problem is that the party lacked the unifying foil that Mitt Romney, of Bain Capital and the \"47 percent\" comments, provided in 2012. Related to this is the scattershot nature of the party\u2019s deployment of the \u201cwho\u2019s on your side\u201d argument. Some pushed it hard, like Michelle Nunn in Georgia, going after David Perdue\u2019s Bain-like behavior in business. But others, like Mark Udall in Colorado, went in an entirely different direction with overwrought attacks on \u201cpersonhood\u201d amendments and contraception. Meanwhile, even those who tried the \u201cwho\u2019s on your side\u201d argument often did so half-heartedly. Mark Pryor, in Arkansas, has resisted minimum wage hikes to allay his state\u2019s largest employer, Wal-Mart. In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes pushed the issue hard, but was notoriously ambivalent about touting another policy that has helped hundreds of thousands of low-income Kentuckians, the Affordable Care Act. In Iowa, Bruce Braley hit his opponent, Joni Ernst, on the minimum wage and outsourcing, but his self-styled prairie populism was sorely undermined by his farmer-slighting comment in a closed-door meeting with Texas trial lawyers.\n\nIn some places, the \u201cwho\u2019s on your side\u201d argument still carried the day for Democrats. In New Hampshire, Jeanne Shaheen fended off Scott Brown by arguing that he was very much not on the state\u2019s side\u2014someone with closer ties to Wall Street than the Granite State. In Connecticut, the very vulnerable governor, Dannel Malloy, was able to give the Romney treatment to his opponent, former private equity executive Tom Foley. In Michigan, Gary Peters won an open Senate seat with a classic Rust Belt populist campaign, even as Michigan\u2019s Republican governor was reelected.\n\nBut all of the other aforementioned Democrats lost, not least because of their startlingly paltry support among non-college-educated white voters, precisely those who stand to benefit most from policies like raising the minimum wage and expanded health coverage. This is causing great consternation for Democratic strategists and pollsters, who, as Washington Post blogger Greg Sargent noted on Wednesday, blame a \u201cfailure to connect with these voters\u2019 economic concerns.\u201d Democrats may have campaigned on issues like the minimum wage and pre-K education, \"but these didn\u2019t cut through people\u2019s economic anxieties, because they didn\u2019t believe government can successfully address them.\" Pollster Mark Mellman told him, \u201cPeople are deeply suspicious that government can deliver on these problems. And they are not wrong. We\u2019ve been promising that government can be a tool to improve people\u2019s economic situation for decades, and by and large, it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nPart of the problem, no doubt, is a messaging one: getting more voters to understand why some of the Democratic policies they support have not come into fruition because they have been blocked by Republicans in Congress. That the minimum wage could be $10.10 an hour, were it not for Republicans voting against it. That the infrastructure bill Democrats have intermittently been pushing, which would have paid for x or y project in the voters\u2019 district and created x or y jobs, was blocked by Republicans on this or that date. Democrats should also be taking more credit for small pocketbook gains they have secured for people, whether it\u2019s reductions in credit card fees in the credit card reform bill of 2009 or lower student loan costs as a result of the administration\u2019s reforms or the slowing growth in health premiums for many private plans under the Affordable Care Act. Some Democrats have a congenital wariness about attaching hard dollar figures to their policies and proposals, and need to get over that if they want voters to grasp what\u2019s at stake. As one former Democratic elected official put it to me this week, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to own the shit that you\u2019ve done and make [Republicans] own the stuff they haven\u2019t done.\u201d\n\nBut the problem isn\u2019t just messaging. As Harold Meyerson notes at the American Prospect, the Democrats also need to come up with a broader agenda to address voters\u2019 economic anxiety in an age of stagnant wages and soaring inequality:\n\nWhat, besides raising the minimum wage, do the Democrats propose to do about the shift in income from wages to profits, from labor to capital, from the 99 percent to the 1 percent? How do they deliver for an embattled middle class in a globalized, de-unionized, far-from-full-employment economy, where workers have lost the power they once wielded to ensure a more equitable distribution of income and wealth? What Democrat, besides Elizabeth Warren, campaigned this year to diminish the sway of the banks? Who proposed policies that would give workers the power to win more stable employment and higher incomes, not just at the level of the minimum wage but across the economic spectrum?\n\nComing up with this agenda, and pushing it in a way that voters comprehend, needs to be the overriding Democratic priority over the next two years. Not only because regaining the \u201cwho\u2019s on your side\u201d advantage is, along with higher turnout, the key to winning in 2016, but because it is what the party is supposed to stand for\u2014and because it goes to the heart of the country\u2019s current economic plight.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The day of the 2012 presidential election, while reporting on the south side of Columbus, Ohio, I came across a 50-year-old man named Matt Bimberg who was waiting for the bus.
