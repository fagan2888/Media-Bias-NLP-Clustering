After retiring more than a decade ago, they lived comfortably in a big house in small-town Maine thanks to the pension benefits their railroad jobs provided them.\n\nBut James\u2019 death earlier this year wasn\u2019t only an emotional blow for Lisa (these are not their real names), it was a financial triple-whammy. In an instant, Lisa lost two-thirds of the family\u2019s income: James\u2019 pension payments stopped coming, but so did the spousal pension benefits both of them had been receiving.\n\nAnd it all came as a surprise.\n\nLisa and James didn\u2019t prepare for retirement by purchasing supplemental insurance, and they weren\u2019t fully aware of the terms of their retirement benefits, which are regulated under the federal Railroad Retirement Act. Lisa said she hopes her story serves as a lesson to others to be prepared in retirement.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how quickly things can change,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think everything is going to go on for years and years and years, and you have nothing to worry about right now, but something horrible might happen at any moment, and you are not prepared for it. Take whatever precautions financially you need to so that if one of you is left, that that person doesn\u2019t have to go through grieving and have to worry about finances. I mean that is the last thing you want to think about.\u201d\n\nLisa is a Maine native, but she moved out of state with her family as a young adult and found work on the railroad. That\u2019s where she met James, a fellow employee.\n\n\u201cIt was a good job to have,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cGood benefits, good salary. It was a good life.\u201d\n\nAfter 20 years of service, Lisa and James, both in their 40s, retired from the railroad and moved back to Maine, buying a home with land in a small town.\n\nEach found new work, which they continued into their 50s. James retired in 2002, at 59, and began to get his railroad retirement. Lisa retired in 2004, at 55, and began receiving railroad disability benefits for some chronic health conditions with which she was coping.\n\n\u201cBecause the railroad was our majority employer, they were the administrator of our benefits,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cThe railroad took all our Social Security and put it into our pension. It is an odd situation. It is very confusing how they do it.\u201d\n\nWhen Lisa was 62 and James was 66, they started to each receive a spousal benefit \u2014 equal to half the other\u2019s pension \u2014 in addition to their regular pensions. When James died, not only did his pension end, but so did both the spousal benefits.\n\n\u201cOf course, when we had it, it was a wonderful benefit,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cLittle did we know that when he passed away, that would go.\u201d\n\nUntil five months before he died, James was healthy and strong, according to Lisa. He had Medicare, but no supplemental health insurance \u2014 an instance of them not thinking ahead.\n\n\u201cI guess we were kind of lulled into thinking that we\u2019re not that old, and that time would go on for many years more,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cSo we never even had our minds wrapped around what would happen if one of us died. James was the picture of health.\u201d\n\nSince his death, Lisa has not only dealt with her deep grief and the shock of losing her husband of 25 years, but she also is struggling with how to pay her bills on an income only one-third what it was when he was alive. And the adjustment to living alone in the country without James has been difficult.\n\n\u201cWhen my husband was here, this was our universe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was perfect for us. We loved it out here. Now it is very lonely. It is a big house \u2014 more work than I can handle and more expensive than I can handle. I\u2019m just getting by, by the skin of my teeth. I have no clue how I\u2019m going to get through the winter.\u201d\n\nLisa recently put the house up for sale but has had no offers. If she does sell the house, she plans to buy a double-wide and put it on a relative\u2019s property.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be on my family\u2019s land, so I won\u2019t have taxes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll have my utilities to pay for, and I\u2019ll be OK. I won\u2019t get rich, but I\u2019ll be comfortable. And that is pretty much all I can hope for. It will be very different. It will be easier physically and financially, but my heart will be broken. It already is.\u201d\n\nThe policy that led to her losing James\u2019s pension and both spousal benefits when he died caught her by surprise.\n\n\u201cI could understand them taking away his benefit, but they should let me keep mine,\u201d she said. \u201cHe did still work all those years on the railroad, and I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nLisa has read and reread the Railroad Retirement and Survivor Benefits booklet, but says, \u201cI guess I\u2019ve misread so many things because of the way it is worded. It is very, very confusing. Maybe they think that is layman\u2019s terms, but I was certainly very mixed up and very confused reading that. In some parts I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m entitled,\u2019 and other parts I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not included.\u2019 At first I thought I would fight for my rights, but I think it is all there in black and white, and I failed to read it.\u201d\n\nAt the time of our interview in late summer, Lisa expressed worry about unexpected bills appearing for the extensive medical care for James\u2019 illness \u2014 the multiple tests, hospital stays and surgery.\n\n\u201cI keep looking in the mailbox everyday, thinking \u2018Oh, this is where they are going to kill me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m waiting for the other shoe to drop, when they send the bills.\u201d\n\nUp to that point, none had come.\n\nBut, coincidentally, as our interview ended, Lisa checked her mail and found the first medical bill for the health care James had received more than six months before. It was for over $500 \u2014 an amount she can ill afford in this time of extreme grief and vastly reduced income.\n\nSandy Butler is professor of social work and is the graduate program coordinator in the School of Social Work at the University of Maine.
