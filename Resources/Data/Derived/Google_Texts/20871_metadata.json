Kershaw allowed two hits and struck out eight in eight innings. He walked only one.\n\n\u201cHis slider is the best pitch in the game right now,\u201d said Colorado outfielder Drew Stubbs, who went 0-for-2 but managed to draw the lone walk off Kershaw.\n\nFrom the loser\u2019s perspective, it was just another night of misery in a season that has become a nightmare. The nightmare got even worse when starting pitcher Jair Jurrjens was taken to a hospital during the game for what the Rockies called \u201cbreathing problems.\u201d It is not considered a serious situation, the Rockies said.\n\nThe loss was the Rockies\u2019 fifth straight and their 16th in their past 18 games. They have lost 14 of their past 18 at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we\u2019ve got to be tired of getting kicked around,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to do something about it. Guys show up and compete well every day, but it\u2019s time to turn it around.\u201d\n\nKershaw\u2019s latest masterpiece came 16 days after he no-hit the Rockies at Dodger Stadium on a night when he struck out 15 and came within an error of perfection.\n\nKershaw somehow found a way to tip his cap to the Rockies, who are playing without their biggest guns. Carlos Gonzalez and Michael Cuddyer are on the disabled list and Troy Tulowitzki didn\u2019t play Friday because of tightness in his right groin.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got a great team,\u201d Kershaw said. \u201cObviously, not having Tulo or CarGo or Cuddyer makes a difference. They\u2019ve got some guys who can really swing the bats over there. You really have to give credit to our team. I feel like every time I\u2019m pitching, I have a big lead. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nSimply put, Kershaw is channeling Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax.\n\nDJ LeMahieu finally got a hit off Kershaw with one out in the third inning. Colorado\u2019s other hit off Kershaw was leadoff single by Nolan Arenado in the seventh.\n\nRealistically, the Rockies never had a chance. They trotted out Jurr jens as their latest emergency starter in their injury-riddled rotation. Jurrjens was gone after 4 \u2154 innings, having given up eight runs on 12 hits, including two home runs. This was a mismatch of epic proportions. Consider that Kershaw has given up just 20 runs all season, and seven of them came in one bad start.\n\nPHOTOS: Rockies vs Dodgers\n\nKershaw, who could be on his way to winning his third National League Cy Young Award, has never been better. He\u2019s so versatile, he leaves batters\u2019 heads spinning.\n\n\u201cThe thing that makes him so good is how he mixes his pitches,\u201d said outfielder Corey Dickerson, who was the first and the last Rockies batter when Kershaw threw his no-hitter. \u201cHe throws that slow curve and gets you off-balance, and then he throws the fastball or slider. His pitches sneak up on you.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as though Kershaw had dominated the Rockies at Coors Field in the past. He came into the game with a 6-3 record and 5.02 ERA in 14 career starts at Coors Field. But he\u2019s a better pitcher than ever before.\n\nThe numbers show how Kershaw has evolved. His percentage of fastballs is a career-low 55.4 percent, while his sliders are at a career-high 30 percent. Then he drops in his confounding curveball.\n\nMore numbers to justify his greatness: Entering Friday\u2019s game, he had struck out 34.7 percent of the batters faced this season, best in the majors. He had walked only 3.6 percent, sixth in the majors and well below his career-best 5.7 percent in 2013.\n\nThe game was effectively over in the first inning when the Dodgers hit for the cycle and posted three runs against Jurrjens, the 13th different Rockies starter this season. In order, the Dodgers got a bunt single by Dee Gordon, a two-run homer to center by Yasiel Puig, a double by Hanley Ramirez and a run-scoring triple by Andre Ethier.\n\nScott Van Slyke\u2019s three-run homer to left off Jurrjens in the fifth put the Dodgers ahead 6-0. Then they added two more runs in the inning for a cushion that Kershaw would never need.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nHow does Clayton Kershaw compare?\n\nSome of the top pitchers in Los Angeles Dodgers history:\n\nSandy Koufax\n\nWins: 165\n\nERA: 2.76\n\nStrikeouts: 2,396\n\nDon Drysdale\n\nWins: 209\n\nERA: 2.95\n\nStrikeouts: 2,486\n\nDon Sutton\n\nWins: 233 (324 total)\n\nERA: 3.26 (career)\n\nStrikeouts: 2,696 with Dodgers; 3,574 total\n\nFernando Valenzuela\n\nWins: 141 (173 total)\n\nERA: 3.54 (career)\n\nStrikeouts: 1,759 with Dodgers; 2,074 total\n\nClayton Kershaw\n\nWins: 87\n\nERA: 2.55\n\nStrikeouts: 1,321\n\nSource: Baseball-Reference.com\n\nDodgers\u2019 Dan Haren (8-4, 3.57 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (8-6, 4.86), 2:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nThe Rockies might actually have an advantage in Saturday\u2019s pitching matchup vs. the Dodgers \u2014 if De La Rosa brings his best stuff. But that\u2019s been a major \u201cif\u201d during his up-and-down season. Historically, the lefty has struggled against the Dodgers, going 3-10 with a 6.17 ERA. Adrian Gonzalez has ripped De La Rosa, batting .368 (14-for-38) with three homers, three doubles and 11 RBIs. The Rockies usually match up pretty well vs. Haren, who\u2019s 7-7 with a 4.55 ERA in 16 career starts vs. Colorado.\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nSunday: Dodgers\u2019 Josh Beckett (5-5, 2.37 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Yohan Flande (0-1, 6.10), 2:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nTuesday: Padres\u2019 Tyson Ross (7-8, 2.93) at Rockies\u2019 Tyler Matzek (1-2, 4.25), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (6-9, 3.87) at Rockies\u2019 Franklin Morales (4-4, 5.51), 6:40 p.m., ROOT", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clayton Kershaw dominates Rockies again in Dodgers\u2019 victory", "title": "Clayton Kershaw dominates Rockies again in Dodgers\u2019 victory", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/04/clayton-kershaw-dominates-rockies-again-in-dodgers-victory/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704_070810_jair-jurrjens-rockies.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140704_070810_jair-jurrjens-rockies.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-04T22:16:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:57:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe262c\"", "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Rockies vs DodgersKershaw, who could be on his way to winning his third National League Cy Young Award, has never been better.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers lefty extended his scoreless innings streak to 36 innings \u2014 17 contributed by the Rockies \u2014 as the Dodgers cruised to a 9-0 victory.\nKershaw somehow found a way to tip his cap to the Rockies, who are playing without their biggest guns.\nHis pitches sneak up on you.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not as though Kershaw had dominated the Rockies at Coors Field in the past.\nThe Rockies usually match up pretty well vs. Haren, who\u2019s 7-7 with a 4.55 ERA in 16 career starts vs. Colorado."}
