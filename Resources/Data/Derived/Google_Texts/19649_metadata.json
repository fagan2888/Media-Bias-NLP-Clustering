But over the last several years, family offices have begun hiring private equity professionals so they can invest in portfolio companies directly.\n\nNot only do family offices gain more control over their investments, but they also skip the management fees previously paid to PE firms. Direct investing is expected to continue. \u201cFamily offices are staffing up their capabilities to invest directly,\u201d says Paul Carbone, managing partner, Pritzker Group. \u201cThere is evidence to suggest that this is where a number of family offices are headed.\u201d\n\nFamily offices are expected to continue investing directly. Private equity investors confide they have noticed more competition from family offices. The data backs up the trend. In 2014, 77 percent of respondents polled by McNally Capital said they preferred direct deals over going through private equity funds, up from 59 percent in 2010. And when polled in 2014, 84 percent of family offices said they planned to make a direct investment in a private company within 24 months.\n\nInvesting directly appeals to both buyers and sellers. Sellers are more likely to get a long-term partner with industry expertise, given that most family offices invest in sectors where they generated their original wealth. Family offices are more inclined to take legacy issues to heart, which often makes sellers feel more comfortable with a sale, especially if they are not exiting the company fully. Family offices increasingly like to invest directly because they have the industry expertise to do so and they don\u2019t want to lock up their money in a blind pool and pay the typical 2 percent management and 20 percent performance fees charged by traditional private equity firms. Additionally, the returns are typically better in private companies than they are in the public market.\n\n\u201cA number of families are disenchanted with the traditional PE structure and want patient capital to build long-term value,\u201d Carbone says. \u201cThey are also are comfortable with building companies on their own as many have built their wealth through company ownership so they don\u2019t need a private equity firm to invest for them.\u201d\n\nHere are four families that are making direct investments:\n\nPritzker Group\n\nWhen professionals in the industry reflect on the family office direct investing model, the Pritzker Group is at the forefront. However, the Pritzker Group does not like to be categorized as a family office. The firm feels the term is too broad and that it includes family offices that look nothing like the Pritzker Group. The firm prefers to be thought of as an investment company, and why shouldn\u2019t it be? The Chicago firm boasts a venture capital investment business, an asset management business and a private capital business, along with 21 investment and operating professionals.\n\n\u201cThe Pritzker family was at the forefront of the family investment trend when they built this business,\u201d says Carbone. \u201cI think you will see more and more families following suit.\u201d The Pritzker Group has been investing family money directly into companies for 14 years. Carbone runs the firm\u2019s private equity arm and he acknowledges that the firm actually operates like a private equity firm, but without the \u201cbad stuff.\u201d\n\nPritzker\u2019s private equity arm typically acquires middle-market companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $500 million, focusing on manufactured products, services and health care investments. Each of its deal teams has an investment professional and an operating partner.\n\nThe firm\u2019s investments have included PLZ Aeroscience Corp. and Technimark, an Asheboro, North Carolina-based provider of custom rigid plastic packaging and components. Brad Wellington, CEO of Technimark, says PLZ had many options when it was looking for a partner in 2014, but thought that a traditional private equity wasn\u2019t the right fit because PLZ was looking to finance a global expansion that would require a long-term outlook.\n\n\u201cWe purposefully pursued this partnership to build the business long-term and support Technimark\u2019s worldwide growth, and we felt our interests aligned with those of the Pritzker Group,\u201d says Wellington. Under Pritzker Group\u2019s ownership, Technimark has financed the expansion of the company\u2019s German and Chinese facilities, opened a new Mexican facility and launched a new U.S. distribution and manufacturing plant, as well as a new innovation center.\n\nIn December, Technimark announced the acquisition of CI Medical to accelerate growth in the medical injection molding market. The company is expecting to combine CI Medical\u2019s blue chip customer base and manufacturing capabilities with Technimark\u2019s global footprint and financial resources to expand delivery of the company\u2019s medical products.\n\nIn many ways, Pritzker sounds like a sector-specific private equity firm, but there are differences. \u201cWe are not compelled to deploy capital. Our capital is permanent. We can be patient and disciplined in our investing. We have three sector teams and we are happy to do a few deals a year or zero deals, depending on the marketplace. We also don\u2019t have to worry about fundraising, which has become a full-time job for many private equity firms. We can spend our time focused on finding and building great companies,\u201d says Carbone.\n\nThe Pritzker Group is led by Tony and J.B. Pritzker, who are very active in the firm. The Pritzker family is best known for creating the Hyatt hotel chain and the Marmon Group, a conglomerate of manufacturing and industrial services, which was sold to Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK.A) for $4.5 billion in 2007. \u201cHaving them is like having a wonderful tool in our toolkit which we can bring to the table. They are smart guys and they will sit down with a company to talk with them about how we can build a company together. They are skilled and are a tremendous asset to our team and our companies,\u201d says Carbone.\n\nStill, despite the success, the Pritzker Group faces the challenges many firms do in today\u2019s frothy market \u2013 competing against private equity firms and strategic acquirers. \u201cThis is a massive marketplace. Family offices aren\u2019t replacing private equity, because private equity has a proven ability to create value. PE firms will remain the majority of the marketplace. As a result, competition will remain high for great assets, and nothing says that\u2019s going to change for now. We are dealing with today\u2019s market dynamics the same as everyone else, but we have different ways to compete and win,\u201d says Carbone.\n\nCaretta Partners\n\nAfter Eric Becker\u2019s 21-year-old daughter Cara died from complications of leukemia in 2012, the man who had co-founded Sterling Partners nearly 30 years earlier felt a profound change. Continuing to work at Sterling for a couple of years, Becker recalls, \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel the same energy that I had before, and I decided to retire.\u201d He immersed himself in philanthropy, working the Karma for Cara Foundation, which his daughter had founded shortly before her death. Through the foundation, Becker bestows micro-grants to kids leading service projects. \u201cI started to feel the energy coming back when I was working with kids. I was ready to go back to work, but I wanted to do things a little differently,\u201d says Becker.\n\nBecker started looking closely at what he liked about private equity and what he didn\u2019t. The challenges of managing a larger fund included shorter hold periods and the constant fundraising. With those challenges in mind, he founded Caretta Partners, which invests Becker\u2019s capital as well as capital on behalf of his friends and family, including Sterling Partners co-founders. \u201cWe have more flexibility. We can partner with founders and own fewer companies for a longer period of time. I liked the idea of really partnering,\u201d says Becker.\n\nWhen Becker reviews his investment career, he admits that some of his partnerships were amazing others were less so. But with the hopes of investing in just three to five companies in as many years, Becker says he has an opportunity to partner with companies he\u2019s really passionate about. \u201cThink chocolate and peanut butter; just a great combination,\u201d says Becker.\n\nBecker\u2019s investment thesis is simple: the company must matter. \u201cThe company doesn\u2019t have to be curing cancer, but the customers need to be passionate about the service,\u201d says Becker. \u201cBusinesses have to be customer-centric, where the customers are at the center of everything.\u201d\n\nBecker also plans to take a long-term view on deals, with the ability to hold companies for as long as he pleases. Caretta will focus on health care, education, business services and companies involved in healthy living. The growth firm will take minority or majority positions.\n\nLastly, Becker wants to be sure he is focusing on companies that are within a two-hour plane ride from Chicago and Baltimore, where Becker spends most of his time. He wants to be active with portfolio companies without having to spend all of his time on planes.\n\nCaretta\u2019s family office model is already resonating with certain types of companies and people. \u201cIf the owners want to stay on or care about their legacy, they are interested in what Caretta is offering,\u201d says Becker. \u201cThere\u2019s stability to what we offer and a genuine caring about the leadership team. I didn\u2019t really know what it would be like to do this, but the model is validated already. There are more deals to look at than I have capacity for.\u201d\n\nBecker says the Chicago firm\u2019s deal pipeline is fairly full and he is fielding calls directly from the website daily in addition to sourcing deals from traditional sources, such as bankers and personal relationships. Caretta is also open to doing deals with fundless sponsors. \u201cFundless sponsors are an evolution in the industry that\u2019s more understood now. They are opening the doors to deals for a lot of family offices,\u201d says Becker. Caretta expects to have its first deal completed in early 2016.\n\nGrand Crossing Capital Partners\n\nIn November 2015, Grand Crossing Capital Partners LP, a self-described \u201cfamily-backed private equity firm\u201d acquired a majority stake in Everglades Marine Holdings LLC, an offshore fishing boat company founded in 1997 by Boston Whaler executive Robert Dougherty. While Dougherty has retired as CEO, he will remain an investor in the company. The remainder of the Everglades team will stay in place and be led by Tom Flocco, executive chairman and interim CEO.\n\n\u201cWe were searching for a partner to help us grow our business over the longer term,\u201d Brian Bohunicky, chief financial officer of Everglades. \u201cWith their focus on unique consumer businesses and ability to hold investments for longer periods of time without mandates or timelines, Grand Crossing was the ideal partner for our business.\u201d\n\nThe Everglades deal represents a typical transaction for Grand Crossing. The firm is funded by the family behind the Wilton Brands, a company founded in 1929 best known for decorating cakes. In 2007, Wilton Industries merged with EK Success, Dimensions Holdings LLC and K&Company, creating Wilton Brands, a large, diversified company in the craft industry owned by PE firm TowerBrook Capital Partners.\n\nGrand Crossing has a team of five and invests primarily on behalf of the Wilton family, but will also take money from other families to complete a deal if it makes sense. Like many other family offices, Grand Crossing likes the flexibility of the family office model. \u201cWe have a longer hold cycle. For example, we know we will own the boat company through a recession,\u201d says Brian Jacobsen, a managing partner with the firm.\n\n\u201cThat would preclude many private equity firms from buying this company because you wouldn\u2019t want to have to sell a boat company during a recession. But given our flexibility we were able to buy this company with much less competition.\u201d\n\nThe longer time horizon is appealing to Grand Crossing and Jacobsen, who focused on retail investing as a partner at TowerBrook Capital Partners. \u201cYou can take your time to build the company without having to show growth right away. You have time to look at a company and say, \u2018How can we build this brand and create value?\u2019 We have that luxury with our arrangement.\u201d\n\nGrand Crossing invests between $5 million and $25 million of growth capital in control and minority stakes. The firm requires that portfolio companies be profitable and generate between $2 million and $10 million of Ebitda.\n\nEverglades is Grand Crossing\u2019s third investment. In 2014, the investment firm backed Kona Deep Corp., a bottled water company. Also in 2014, Grand Crossing joined Dallimore & Co. in making a minority investment in Victor Alfaro, the designer of ready-to-wear clothes, shoes and handbags who was well-known in the 1990s and has been making a comeback since 2013. Today, Alfaro\u2019s lines are sold at Barneys New York, Net-a-Porter, Lane Crawford and the Room at Hudson\u2019s Bay.\n\nIsland Management\n\nHoward Romanow is a good example of why family offices are able to compete for deals directly. Formerly of FDG Associates, Romanow now serves as COO and CFO of Island Management LLC, a Darien, Connecticut-based firm that invests in private companies on behalf of an unnamed family that made its wealth in consumer products. Romanow likes that now he no longer has \u201cto worry about where the capital comes from.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore family offices want to go direct, but until recently many family offices didn\u2019t really understand that they could hire the right professionals to invest on their behalf,\u201d says Romanow. \u201cWhen they realized they were paying all these fees, and there were professional resources to hire, they started building up their direct investing capabilities.\u201d Romanow says the trend will increase, as the private equity industry matures, and junior partners look beyond traditional firms to further their careers.\n\nThe family behind Island Management looks to invest beyond the public markets, to operate companies and to benefit from diversification. \u201cIf something bad happens in Europe, it impacts the public markets. But if something bad happens in Europe, the private markets don\u2019t necessarily react. There\u2019s less correlation between geopolitical events and the private markets, and there is great potential for better returns,\u201d says Romanow. \u201cThe family wanted to go direct because it doesn\u2019t believe in the private equity philosophy. Private equity firms have to sell their winners to create returns for their investors and keep their losers. It\u2019s the opposite of what our people wanted to do. If there is a company that is returning appropriately they want to keep it in the portfolio.\u201d\n\nSince 2014, Island has been looking for North American companies to buy and has closed one unnamed deal. \u201cWe are really more about partnership and the sellers knowing us, and that takes time,\u201d says Romanow. \u201cWe are truly there to work with management and for the long haul. We are not thinking about how we get out in three years.\u201d\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_sponsors/pritzker-group-and-other-wealthy-families-skip-pe-firms-to-invest-directly-259547-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/eglades.jpeg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "Pritzker Group and Other Wealthy Families Skip PE Firms to Invest Directly"}}, "article_summary": "Private equity firms have to sell their winners to create returns for their investors and keep their losers.\nStill, despite the success, the Pritzker Group faces the challenges many firms do in today\u2019s frothy market \u2013 competing against private equity firms and strategic acquirers.\nFamily offices aren\u2019t replacing private equity, because private equity has a proven ability to create value.\n\u201cFamily offices are staffing up their capabilities to invest directly,\u201d says Paul Carbone, managing partner, Pritzker Group.\nWe also don\u2019t have to worry about fundraising, which has become a full-time job for many private equity firms."}
