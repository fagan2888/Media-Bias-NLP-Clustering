The deadline to file a U.S. return is on June 16, but last-minute filers racing against the clock can get an extension until Oct. 15.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that an American living abroad would actually have to pay anything to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, said Fortin. With a few exceptions, a Canadian tax bill will be higher than a U.S. one, cancelling out anything that\u2019s owed south of the border.\n\nYet, the paperwork is necessary.\n\nAnother deadline to keep in mind is June 30, when the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR, is due. It applies to any American with a total of $10,000 in foreign chequing, saving or investment accounts.\n\n\u201cThe genesis of the FBAR was really targeted at Americans trying to hide money offshore,\u201d said Craig Maurice, a tax specialist with Torys LLP in Calgary.\n\nThere are stiff penalties on the books for U.S. expats who fail to properly file their FBAR. For those who weren\u2019t aware of their obligations and made an honest mistake, the fine is $10,000 per error. But those found to be deliberately dodging the tax man face fines of up to 50 per cent of what\u2019s in their accounts, or $100,000.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s obviously a really huge stick that the IRS holds over people,\u201d said Maurice.\n\nHowever, neither Maurice nor Fortin have heard of a case in which an individual has actually been forced to pay a fine.\n\nU.S. legislation coming into effect July 1 will make it harder for foreign account holders to fly under the radar. Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, foreign financial institutions will have to report accounts held by Americans to U.S. authorities.\n\n\u201cAnyone that\u2019s been sitting on the fence, saying this really can\u2019t be an issue for me, or I\u2019ll deal with it when it becomes a problem, it\u2019s probably now getting to the stage where you should be seeking some advice and making sure that you\u2019re getting yourself up to compliance,\u201d said Maurice.\n\nThe FBAR has long been required, but awareness has been raised in the years since FACTA was announced, said Roland Sabates, a tax attorney at H&R Block who specializes in expat services.\n\n\u201cThere was just a lack of awareness that this was an obligation. It wasn\u2019t readily enforced by the IRS and the tax industry in general. It was an issue that may have been commonly overlooked,\u201d he said in an interview from Kansas City, Mo.\n\nMaking matters a little more tricky is the U.S. Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, said Sabates.\n\n\u201cExpats are deemed compliant under the Affordable Care Act legislation if they live outside for 330 days during a 12-month period or pass a bone fide residence test, which is a fact-intensive analysis looking at your connections to the foreign country and whether you plan to be there on a permanent or indefinite basis,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo if you meet one of those two tests, then you\u2019re deemed compliant and you don\u2019t have to worry about the individual mandate for health insurance coverage.\u201d\n\nTax preparation specialists at H&R Block have been \u201cextremely busy\u201d helping Americans abroad figure out their taxes in recent weeks, said Sabates.\n\n\u201cThey know they need to file, they just don\u2019t know what they need to do. We\u2019re dealing with a large portion of the expat population that is confused about their specific filing requirements.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Tax season isn\u2019t over yet for the one million Americans who call Canada home.
