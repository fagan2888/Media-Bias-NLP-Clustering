Rathgeber on Navigators PDF (185.0 KB) download\n\nUpdated, Sept. 19, 12 p.m.:\n\nBy directing the Texas Department of Insurance to enact strict regulations, Gov. Rick Perry has misappropriated the intent of the law that state legislators approved to regulate so-called navigators trained to help Texans purchase health care coverage under Obamacare, state Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, said Thursday in a press statement.\n\nIn a letter to Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber, Watson, the author of Senate Bill 1795, said the measure's intent was to make it easier, not harder, for Texans to secure health coverage. The measure allows TDI to implement additional training requirements for navigators if the federal requirements seemed insufficient.\n\n\u201cSB 1795 does not authorize the agency to place onerous restrictions on navigators that will make it harder for them to do their important work,\u201d wrote Watson. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that many of the provisions suggested by Governor Perry seem to have this intended effect.\u201d\n\nWatson said his legislation does not authorize the department to do a number of tasks that Perry requested. For example, it does not impose age restrictions on navigators, does not require arbitrary amounts of additional training or exams, and does not compel navigators to undergo background checks or to submit fingerprints to TDI. It also does not create a database of people assisted by the navigators, or set restrictions on the time, place and manner in which navigators may assist people.\n\nOriginal Story, Sept. 17:\n\nGov. Rick Perry has directed the Texas Department of Insurance to establish strict rules to regulate so-called navigators trained to help Texans purchase health coverage under \"Obamacare.\"\n\nWhile the governor says the extra regulations will ensure that people handling Texans\u2019 private financial and health information are properly trained and qualified, the rules could present a significant roadblock to organizations helping to implement the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"This is blatant attempt to add cumbersome requirements to the navigator program and deter groups from working to inform Americans about their new health insurance options and help them enroll in coverage,\u201d Fabien Levy, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email.\n\nAlong with many other provisions in President Obama\u2019s signature health reform law, the individual mandate to purchase health insurance is set to take effect on Jan. 1. Texas' Republican majority, which vehemently opposes the federal health law, declined to establish a state-based insurance marketplace. The federal government is doing it instead, launching an Orbitz-like online insurance exchange starting Oct. 1. That exchange will require individuals to input sensitive tax information, including their Social Security numbers and estimated annual income, to determine whether they qualify for tax credits to purchase coverage.\n\nTo help uninsured Texans use the complicated new system, the federal government awarded nearly $11 million in August to local organizations charged with hiring and training navigators, who will help consumers input their financial information and pick a health plan through in the exchange, must undergo 20 to 30 hours of training, pass a certification test and renew their certification annually, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFor Perry, those ground rules are not enough.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly delayed explaining how its navigators were going to be created, how they were going to operate and how they were going to be regulated,\u201d Perry wrote in a letter to Insurance Commissioner Julia Rathgeber. \u201cBecause of the nature of navigators' work and because they will be collecting confidential information, including birth dates, social security numbers and financial information, it is imperative that Texas train navigators on the collection and security of such data.\u201d\n\nIn the letter, Perry specifically directed TDI to establish rules that require navigators to complete at minimum of 40 hours of state training in addition to the federal training requirements. He also demanded that navigators pass a rigorous exam based on that training, refrain from influencing a consumer's insurance choice by recommending a specific plan or comparing benefits offered by different plans, and submit to periodic background and regulatory checks and show state identification while on the job.\n\nHe also directed TDI to maintain a database of registered navigators, including background checks and fingerprints; set limits on when and where navigators can enroll people in the exchange; charge fees to provide navigator training and registration; and establish the department\u2019s authority to suspend or revoke navigators\u2019 registration for failing to comply with state requirements.\n\n\u201cTDI agrees that the navigators in Texas have to be well trained and competent in what they\u2019re doing,\u201d said Ben Gonzalez, an agency spokesman. \u201cOur goal is for them to be accountable and be conscientious about the confidential information that they\u2019re going to be collecting.\u201d\n\nFederal officials said some of the rules Perry ordered the state insurance department to implement are forbidden under U.S. law. For example, navigators are not allowed to retain or report information on consumers who sign up for coverage through the exchange; therefore, they could not submit that information to TDI, as Perry has requested. The federal agency also emphasized that navigators are not allowed to access consumers\u2019 information after it has been submitted to the exchange.\n\nLevy said the U.S. government has similar programs already set up to help counsel people applying for Medicare, and that those have \u201cnever faced this kind of bullying from Texas.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is clearly an ideologically-driven attempt to prevent the uninsured from gaining health coverage,\u201d Levy said. \u201cBut despite the state\u2019s attempts, we are confident that navigators will still be able to help Texans enroll in quality, affordable health coverage when open enrollment begins on Oct. 1.\u201d\n\nGiven the governor\u2019s directive, the department will begin putting together the rules with some urgency, Gonzalez added. The rule-making process can take several weeks, as the state is required to hold public meetings and solicit stakeholder input before the rules are drafted. After a draft is approved, the rules must be posted on the Texas Register to receive official comment before they can be codified.\n\n\u201cIt's our expectation the rules and training be in place by Jan. 1, when insurance can be purchased through the exchange,\u201d Rich Parsons, a spokesman for the governor\u2019s office, said via email.\n\nThe federal health exchange has a six-month open enrollment period \u2014 from Oct. 1 to March 31 \u2014 in which navigators can help the uninsured find health coverage to comply with the insurance mandate. Individuals who do not purchase insurance during the open enrollment period could be subject to federal tax penalties. If the state's regulations take effect on Jan. 1, the navigators will be required to undergo additional training during the open enrollment period, which could present significant challenges.\n\nTo address the privacy concerns raised about the navigator program, some grant recipients are already requiring navigators to undergo additional training on privacy protection. United Way of Tarrant County, in collaboration with 17 other organizations, received $5.8 million, the largest federal navigator grant in Texas. Tim McKinney, the organization\u2019s chief executive officer, said the organization is requiring navigators to undergo an additional hour-and-a-half of training on how to comply with the federal privacy law HIPAA.\n\nLawmakers signed off on Perry's call for greater regulation of the navigator program in the last legislative session when they passed Senate Bill 1795, which authorizes TDI \u201cto regulate navigators if it determined that federal standards did not ensure they were qualified to perform their duties or avoid conflicts of interest,\u201d according to a legislative report. The new state law allows the department to enact rules that protect patient privacy and prohibit navigators from accepting payments from health insurance companies or posing as an insurance agent. At least 16 other states have also enacted or are considering laws to regulate navigators, according to a USA Today report.\n\nTexas Attorney General Greg Abbott and 12 other state attorneys general have also raised concerns that the federal navigator program could pose risks to patients\u2019 privacy. In a letter sent to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius in August, the attorneys general asserted that the federal government\u2019s screening process does not require uniform background or fingerprint checks, meaning convicted criminals or identity thieves could become navigators. They also expressed concerns that navigators would not undergo sufficient training.\n\nSome medical professionals and advocates have objected to the privacy concerns raised by conservatives, suggesting they are politically motivated. For example, navigators must already comply with state and federal laws governing the privacy of sensitive medical information. If they do not adhere to strict security and privacy standards, including how to handle and safeguard consumers\u2019 Social Security numbers and identifiable information, they are subject to criminal and civil penalties at both the federal and state level. The federal government imposes up to a $25,000 civil penalty for violating its privacy and security standards.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
