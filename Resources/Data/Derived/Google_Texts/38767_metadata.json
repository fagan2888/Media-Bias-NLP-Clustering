(Timmy Blupe/The O + M Company via AP)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Few performers making their Broadway debuts get a street on Broadway renamed in their honor. Michael Flatley is an exception.\n\nThe trailblazing former \u201cRiverdance\u201d star was on hand Tuesday when a section of 42nd Street was dubbed \u201cFlatley Way\u201d in honor of him and his show \u201cLord of the Dance: Dangerous Games,\u201d opening nearby at the Lyric Theatre.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic. It\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d he said on a rainy afternoon with the cheering support of his two dozen cast members in bright costumes. The renaming ceremony lasted only a few minutes, but the dapper Flatley seemed as jazzed about it as he does stepping on the 1,896-seat Lyric.\n\n\u201cAs soon as you walk out, you feel the energy of the place,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those people who live on energy. I love energy and I can feel it in the building.\u201d\n\nFlatley is starring in an eight-week engagement that began this week and will run through Jan. 3. He will appear at the encore of each evening show, dancing alongside holographic movies of his iconic dances.\n\nThe show marks his official retirement from dancing and is the first time he\u2019s graced a Broadway stage, having already performed at Radio City Music Hall and Madison Square Garden.\n\nFlatley, born into a blue-collar Irish-American family in Chicago, was catapulted to fame after co-choreographing \u201cRiverdance,\u201d which was first performed as a seven-minute interval break in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1994.\n\nHe and dancer Jean Butler helped extend it into a full-length show and it opened at Dublin\u2019s Point Theatre in 1995, at a time of renewed Irish optimism and pride surrounding the onset of the booming \u201cCeltic Tiger\u201d economy.\n\nFlatley, 57, went on to create his own shows, \u201cFeet of Flames\u201d and \u201cCeltic Tiger.\u201d His \u201cLord of the Dance\u201d premiered in 1996 and has been seen by more than 60 million people in 60 different countries, including 400,000 during a five-year residency in Las Vegas.\n\nBut years of traditional Irish step-dancing \u2014 infused with elements of ballet, tap, modern dance and world rhythms \u2014 have taken their toll. \u201cI\u2019d love to dance but my old legs, I\u2019m afraid, they won\u2019t allow me too much more,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 Written by Mark Kennedy\n\n___\n\nOnline: http://www.lordofthedance.com\n\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
