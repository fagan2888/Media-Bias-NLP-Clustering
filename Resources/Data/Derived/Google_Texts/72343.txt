A rock climber suffered non-life-threatening injuries on Monday in a fall in the Catalina Mountains.

According to Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Dep. Tracy Suitt, the 32-year-old man was climbing at Windy Point when the rock that his gear was anchored to gave way. He fell about 40 feet and landed on his back.

The accident happened at about 10 a.m.

The Sheriff's Department Search and Rescue Unit, the Southern Arizona Rescue Association, the Mount Lemmon Fire Department, the Arizona Department of Public Safety Air Rescue Unit, and Life Net responded to the incident location.

"It was just an accident," Suitt said, adding that he had the right gear, was experienced and was there with friends.

The injured climber was stabilized on scene before rescuers used ropes to move him 25 feet up the slope to a clearing. From there, he was short-hauled by the DPS helicopter 125 feet to a landing zone at Geology Point, where he was transferred to a waiting Life Net helicopter, which took him to the trauma center.
