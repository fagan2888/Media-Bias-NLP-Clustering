But if those deadlines aren\u2019t met, state officials are expected to explore alternatives, including using the federal government\u2019s HealthCare.gov exchange.\n\nVermont Lt. Gov. Phil Scott said in an interview that he and other state leaders, including Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s administration, have met with officials from Access Health CT, Connecticut\u2019s exchange. Scott said the idea came from a discussion at a lieutenant governors\u2019 meeting with Connecticut Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman, who leads the board that oversees Access Health. Scott said officials have also met with Rhode Island officials about their state\u2019s exchange.\n\nBut Lawrence Miller, Shumlin\u2019s senior health care advisor, said he\u2019s still focused on making Vermont\u2019s exchange work.\n\n\u201cIf we were to decide to go in a different direction, which is very unlikely, we would look at everything that\u2019s available on the landscape,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Vermont, the governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately. Shumlin is a Democrat, while Scott is a Republican.\n\nAccess Health has been marketing its services to other states since last year. Maryland already uses the Access Health system for its exchange, replacing the troubled system it used in 2014.\n\nAccess Health\u2019s budget for the next fiscal year anticipates raising $3 million in revenue from the division that markets services to other exchanges. CEO Jim Wadleigh said officials have been speaking to other states about sharing services and other functions.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/05/21/vermont-officials-eyeing-cts-health-insurance-exchange/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/05/21/vermont-officials-eyeing-cts-health-insurance-exchange/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Updated 2:55 p.m. Vermont officials are considering turning to Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange as an alternative to that state\u2019s struggling Obamacare marketplace.", "title": "Vermont officials eyeing CT\u2019s health insurance exchange", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/05/21/vermont-officials-eyeing-cts-health-insurance-exchange/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/03/Pedro-Lopez-2-1170x877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/05/21/vermont-officials-eyeing-cts-health-insurance-exchange/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc277\"", "article_summary": "Officials in Vermont have given the state\u2019s exchange, Vermont Health Connect, deadlines to make improvements; the first one comes at the end of this month.\nVermont officials are considering turning to Connecticut\u2019s health insurance exchange as an alternative to that state\u2019s struggling Obamacare marketplace.\nScott said officials have also met with Rhode Island officials about their state\u2019s exchange.\nPeter Shumlin\u2019s administration, have met with officials from Access Health CT, Connecticut\u2019s exchange.\nMaryland already uses the Access Health system for its exchange, replacing the troubled system it used in 2014."}
