The study showed that the decline was relatively steady over much of the past 18 years, and picked up steam during the first two full years of Obamacare, in 2014 and 2015.\n\n\u201cParticularly notable is that the uninsurance rate fell during the Great Recession years ... a time when uninsurance rates for nonelderly adults increased,\u201d the study noted. \u201cThis demonstrates the countercyclical role that Medicaid and CHIP played in offsetting the loss of private coverage for children as the economy worsened.\u201d\n\nCHIP provides low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid. In some states, CHIP covers parents and pregnant women. The 2014 cost to the Federal government was $9.2 billion, while the states kicked in $3.9 billion.\n\nRelated: GOP Promises a Plan to Replace Obamacare ... Again\n\nThe Urban Institute study was based on data from the National Health Interview Survey and other research. It showed that the federal programs helped to slash the uninsured rate by as much as 75 percent for children five years old and younger and by 61 percent for those 13 to 18 years of age.\n\nRoughly 4.4 million children lacked health care insurance in 2014, down substantially from 10.7 million in 1997. During that period, the number of uninsured children aged five and under plunged from 2.9 million to just one million, according to the findings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying health insurance coverage for decades, with a focus on kids,\u201d said Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a co-author of the study. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any other way to look at these findings than being pretty remarkable. The decline [in the uninsured rate] is large, and it is shared across different income groups.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Obamacare Is So Important to Hillary Clinton\n\nAs for the children who were still going without health insurance in 2013 and 2014, most of them were minorities or from families with parents of limited education or who were living illegally in the country. The study described them as \u201cdisproportionately likely to be uninsured\u201d and faced \u201clarge gaps in health care access, affordability, and service use compared with their insured peers.\u201d\n\nAbout 44 percent of the uninsured children were Hispanic, 39 percent were non-Hispanic whites, and 9 percent were non-Hispanic blacks. Nearly a sixth of the uninsured children were not citizens of the U.S. and a third lived in a family with at least one person who lacked citizenship. On a geographic basis, half of all the uninsured children lived in southern states, while another quarter of the children resided in the West.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Evidence continues to pile up that federal health care programs are working to reduce", "title": "19 Years and Counting, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Is a Big Winner", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/20/19-Years-and-Counting-Children-s-Health-Insurance-Big-Winner", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/04202016_Child_Health_Care.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/20/19-Years-and-Counting-Children-s-Health-Insurance-Big-Winner", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/04202016_Child_Health_Care.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Evidence continues to pile up that federal health care programs are working to reduce", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Roughly 4.4 million children lacked health care insurance in 2014, down substantially from 10.7 million in 1997.\nNearly a sixth of the uninsured children were not citizens of the U.S. and a third lived in a family with at least one person who lacked citizenship.\nOn a geographic basis, half of all the uninsured children lived in southern states, while another quarter of the children resided in the West.\nEvidence continues to pile up that federal health care programs are working to reduce dramatically the number of uninsured Americans -- especially children and low-income families.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been studying health insurance coverage for decades, with a focus on kids,\u201d said Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a co-author of the study."}
