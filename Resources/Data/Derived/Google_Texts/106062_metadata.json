Kristin Phillips-Hill, R-York, and Jim Christiana, R-Beaver, would outlaw the practice.\n\n\u201cThis measure will close a loophole that allows public school teachers to take leave from the classroom and work full-time for their union while they continue to earn salary, benefits, accrue seniority and time toward their pension,\u201d Phillips-Hill said.\n\nPhillips-Hill\u2019s office later said Watchdog\u2019s exclusive reporting on the issue \u201cwas the starting point\u201d for pursuing the legislation.\n\nAlso known as \u201crelease time\u201d or \u201cunion leave,\u201d the practice is standard among public unions around the country. Earlier this year, though, the Arizona Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association wrongfully used taxpayer money to pay union cops who stopped policing so they could work for the union.\n\n\u201cThose actors that are allowing this behavior to take place have tried to cover it up for years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we think about this concept of ghost teaching, somebody getting paid, somebody who is labeled as a teacher, yet they haven\u2019t actually taught a class in years, they\u2019re actually gaining seniority over their colleagues, yet they\u2019re not in the classroom. It\u2019s unconscionable to think that our system in 2015 would allow this to take place.\u201d\n\nThe PFT did not respond to a request for comment, but the union does reimburse the district for the wages ghost teachers earn.\n\nSince 2003, Philly ghost teachers have earned $36 million. While that money can be paid back, ghost teachers also earn seniority for performing a job some of them haven\u2019t done in decades, giving them an edge over less senior teachers who may lose their jobs under Pennsylvania\u2019s \u201clast in, first out\u201d layoff policies.\n\nIn February, the Fairness Center, on behalf of Americans for Fair Treatment, a nonprofit membership organization, filed a lawsuit in Philadelphia seeking to end the practice of union work on school time, which it argues illegally devotes public resources to a private organization.\n\nLast year, 18 Philadelphia ghost teachers earned $1.7 million working mostly as information officers for the PFT. Some ghost teachers, such as PFT President Jerry Jordan and Vice President Arlene Kempin, have been on leave from the classroom for more than 30 years.\n\nThe PFT recently held a rally urging the district to tear up its contract with Source4Teachers, the company responsible for finding substitute teachers, because of its woeful fill rate. The union also blasted the district for not filling a number of full-time teaching vacancies, yet the PFT is directly responsible for taking teachers out of schools under the ghost teachers agreement.\n\nMany Pennsylvania school districts condone the practice, too, though they allow far fewer ghost teachers than Philly does. Pittsburgh permits up to 16 district employees to work full-time for the union.\n\nMatthew Brouillette, president and CEO of the Commonwealth Foundation and a former history teacher, called the practice \u201clegalized theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know of any dedicated teachers who would ever think of taking their teaching job as a cover for union work,\u201d he said. \u201cTeachers are hired to teach students, not play union politics.\u201d\n\nWhile the ghost teachers bill is introduced, Pennsylvania heads toward a fourth month of a budget impasse that\u2019s cut state funding to public schools.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf has proposed record increases in education spending, but Christiana said before any new money is funneled to Philadelphia, which receives almost half of its budget from the state, lawmakers must take a closer look at how that money is being spent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to balance the budget with this legislation, but what we will say to the taxpayers is that we\u2019re going to institute some fairness,\u201d Christiana said. \u201cIf the state is going to throw hundreds of millions more dollars into education, we\u2019re going to at least fix some of the injustice that the system has in place.\u201d\n\nHouse Bill 1649 has been referred to the House Education Committee.\n\nOriginally published in Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two lawmakers are fighting back against the practice.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two lawmakers are fighting back against the practice.", "title": "Should Teachers Be Allowed to Ditch Their Classrooms to Work For the Union?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1023teachers.png", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Xoecja"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Two lawmakers are fighting back against the practice.", "title": "Should Teachers Be Allowed to Ditch Their Classrooms to Work For the Union?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1023teachers.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "state reforms", "published_time": "2015-10-23T16:05:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "teachers union,pennsylvania,ghost teachers,tom wolf,philadelphia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1be\"", "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA\u2014City schools are struggling to find teachers, but the district and local teachers union have an agreement that permits dozens of them to abandon their classrooms to go work for the union every year.\nLast year, 18 Philadelphia ghost teachers earned $1.7 million working mostly as information officers for the PFT.\nMany Pennsylvania school districts condone the practice, too, though they allow far fewer ghost teachers than Philly does.\nSince 2003, Philly ghost teachers have earned $36 million.\nSome ghost teachers, such as PFT President Jerry Jordan and Vice President Arlene Kempin, have been on leave from the classroom for more than 30 years."}
