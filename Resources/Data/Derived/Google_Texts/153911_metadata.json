When assessing options across the Affordable Care Act market, rate increases on existing plans as well in changes in the total number of available plans has resulted in double-digit increases in the average cost of premiums available within the 37 states using Healthcare.gov. For the unsubsidized, this increase in the average available premium will likely be met with great concern. For the subsidized, government assistance limiting the cost of premiums to a percentage of earnings will erode the significance of the 2016 premium changes.\n\nThe changes in average unsubsidized premiums available in the 2016 versus 2015 ACA market are as follows:\n\nBronze plans average premium: 11 percent increase\n\nSilver plans average premium: 10 percent increase\n\nGold plans average premium: 14 percent increase\n\nPlatinum plans average premium: 16 percent increase\n\nThe 2016 average individual and family medical deductibles are higher for bronze and silver plans as compared to 2015 but lower for gold and platinum plans.\n\nBronze plan average deductible: $5,731 individual/$11,601 family\n\nSilver plan average deductible: $3,117 individual/$6,480 family\n\nGold plan average deductible: $1,165 individual/$2,535 family\n\nPlatinum plan average deductible: $233 individual/$468 family\n\nIncreases in the average cap on annual out-of-pocket costs were also observed for bronze, silver, gold, and platinum plans.\n\nSince market options were evaluated in this study rather than consumer behavior, no weighting by enrollment was performed on health plans.
