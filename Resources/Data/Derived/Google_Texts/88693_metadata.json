Lamb says the result is that more elderly people in particular will end up in already overstretched hospitals, compounding the crisis.\n\nPre-election promises by the Tories to provide an additional \u00a38bn for the health service by 2020, on top of \u00a32bn extra pledged at the end of last year, are insufficient and too vague to reassure anyone, he argues.\n\n\u201cIf the investment is not made upfront and in the early period of this parliament, you could see serious failures in the system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe system will crash. Elderly people won\u2019t get the care they need, and it will be people with mental ill health who suffer most, because that is where the squeeze always comes.\u201d\n\nWhile the promised extra money would help, it was nowhere near enough. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the NHS believes that is enough. The government talks very vaguely about an extra \u00a38bn by 2020, but it is needed now. If it comes in 2019-20, the system will have crashed by then. I think the next two years will make or break the NHS and the care system.\u201d\n\nThe body representing more than 2,200 organisations providing home-based care, the United Kingdom Home Care Association (UKHCA), said that many of the biggest providers were considering handing back as much as half of their local authority business.\n\nLamb added that a two-tier system was in danger of developing: \u201cThe reason those companies are not going to tender any more is that they can make good money out of the private market, so we will have a complete divide between people with money who will get good care and those who have rushed visits, dreadful turnover of staff and poor care or nothing. That is the reality.\u201d\n\nIn a speech to the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth on Tuesday, Lamb will call for the future of the NHS, social and mental health care, to be addressed by a non-partisan commission, and says he is open to radical ideas on future funding, including a possible NHS tax, or a rise in national insurance contributions to fund extra spending.\n\nRichard Humphries, assistant director, policy, at the King\u2019s Fund, wrote on Friday on the organisation\u2019s website: \u201c56% of directors of adult social care report that providers are facing financial difficulties now. Three of the country\u2019s top five home care providers are planning to pull out of publicly funded home care or have already done so; many more have handed uneconomic contracts back to local authorities.\u201d\n\nA UKHCA spokesman said: \u201cThe sustained pressure on prices by cash-strapped local councils, combined with the additional costs of the national living wage [to be introduced at \u00a37.20 from April], carries serious consequences. We have already heard from large providers contemplating handing back up to half of their local authority business unless rates paid increase before next April.\u201d\n\nNHS England says the service faces a \u00a330bn annual shortfall by 2021 unless radical changes are made in how healthcare is provided, with more emphasis on keeping people out of hospital through high care at home and in the community.\n\nSir David Nicholson, NHS chief executive until April 2014, said Lamb was overstating the extent of the problems, while accepting that the situation was serious: \u201cOn Norman\u2019s warning of a crash I don\u2019t buy it, and while you will undoubtedly get parts of the country in distress I would describe the approach as \u2018managed decline\u2019. It\u2019s worth pointing out though that even with the \u00a38bn front loaded it only takes the NHS to the 2005 [level of funding relative to GDP] position.\u201d\n\nDr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association said: \u201cWe need policymakers to be honest with the public and start working with patients and healthcare professionals on a long-term plan.\u201d\n\nHunt and NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens have recently revealed key differences of opinion over exactly how much extra money the service needs. Since the election Hunt has insisted that the \u00a38bn is enough, and publicly demanded rapid progress on delivering the matching \u00a322bn of efficiency savings Stevens has promised.\n\nHowever, this month he used NHS England\u2019s annual conference to highlight that the \u00a38bn depended on two things \u2013 improved social care provision and progress in tackling public health problems \u2013 neither of which experts say has happened.\n\nQuestioned by the Commons health select committee last week, Hunt admitted that a further deterioration in social care services would intensify the pressures on the NHS. Stevens and senior colleagues believe the gap in NHS finances will become even wider than \u00a330bn unless the decline in social care help for older people and the disabled is arrested. Hunt hinted that November\u2019s comprehensive spending review might bring some extra resources for it.\n\nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cWe are investing the additional \u00a38bn that the NHS itself has said it needs to implement its own plan for the future. The NHS must deliver its side of the plan by implementing cost-control initiatives the government has brought forward, like clamping down on staffing agencies and expensive management consultants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already bringing the NHS and councils together, which is helping people to live independently at home and saving money in the long term.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Norman Lamb predicts healthcare system will crash in two years and says Tories are being dishonest over crisis", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Denis Campbell", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Norman Lamb predicts healthcare system will crash in two years and says Tories are being dishonest over crisis", "title": "NHS on brink of collapse, warns former health minister", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/nhs-collapse-former-health-minister-norman-lamb", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/9/19/1442677253556/Norman-Lamb-009.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=3fb1a1b9e89e2d4e4d575f23d46619e4", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://society/2015/sep/19/nhs-collapse-former-health-minister-norman-lamb?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/19/nhs-collapse-former-health-minister-norman-lamb", "iphone": "gnmguardian://society/2015/sep/19/nhs-collapse-former-health-minister-norman-lamb?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/9/19/1442677253556/Norman-Lamb-009.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://society/2015/sep/19/nhs-collapse-former-health-minister-norman-lamb?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "NHS,Norman Lamb,Privatisation,Health,Society,UK news,Care Quality Commission (CQC),Politics,Economic policy,Liberal Democrat conference,Liberal Democrats", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-09-19T20:00:05.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tobyhelm,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell", "section": "Society", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:57:54.000Z", "tag": "NHS,Norman Lamb,Privatisation,Health,Society,UK news,Care Quality Commission (CQC),Politics,Economic policy,Liberal Democrat conference,Liberal Democrats"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/9/19/1442677253556/Norman-Lamb-009.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=0b31f9c7d9c83184e9c55ff202c6c9ae", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NHS,Norman Lamb,Privatisation,Health,Society,UK news,Care Quality Commission (CQC),Politics,Economic policy,Liberal Democrat conference"}, "article_summary": "The government talks very vaguely about an extra \u00a38bn by 2020, but it is needed now.\nQuestioned by the Commons health select committee last week, Hunt admitted that a further deterioration in social care services would intensify the pressures on the NHS.\nThe stark assessment from Norman Lamb, minister of state at the Department of Health until May\u2019s general election, comes as fears mount among senior NHS officials, care providers and local authorities that NHS and care services are approaching breaking point.\nA Department of Health spokesperson said: \u201cWe are investing the additional \u00a38bn that the NHS itself has said it needs to implement its own plan for the future.\nStevens and senior colleagues believe the gap in NHS finances will become even wider than \u00a330bn unless the decline in social care help for older people and the disabled is arrested."}
