They might have earned money writing freelance articles or driving for Uber, delivering for WunWun or selling prints on Etsy, renting out a bedroom on Airbnb or raising funds on Kickstarter. Sometime in January or February, a 1099 form shows up in their mailbox, and they begin to freak out. However the money comes in, some of it is supposed to go out again\u2014they need to pay taxes.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOne of the second-order consequences of the gig economy is that a generation of people is getting a sink-or-swim education in tax law\u2014search out, for example, online Uber forums, and you\u2019ll find an army of self-taught tax experts, ready to offer advice on the best way to deduct mileage.\n\nIn the W-2 economy of salaried employees and their relatively simple tax returns, workers don\u2019t have to think much about their taxes, because the HR department does that work. But in the 1099 economy, companies avoid giving out that sort of assistance.\n\n\u201cIf you help contractors with taxes, they start looking a lot more like employees,\u201d said Tristan Zier, the founder of a startup called Zen99 (a play on Ten99, like the tax form). \u201cThey aren\u2019t willing to provide support services because of that risk.\u201d\n\nAnd so, on the websites of these companies, you\u2019ll find disclaimers\u2014\u201cWe can\u2019t give tax advice, but we have compiled this guide,\u201d says Kickstarter\u2014or partnerships. Most tax guidance on Etsy, for instance, comes from a separate company, Outbrain, which at one point was billed as Etsy\u2019s bookkeeping partner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in new territory as far as the way we\u2019re cobbling together our income,\u201d said Rus Garofalo, the founder of Brooklyn-based Brass Taxes, a tax preparation business that specializes in \u201cartists, freelancers and other nice people.\u201d\n\nMost of the people who come to him are in the midst of their crash education in taxes\u2014which is \u201cvery often a first-year disaster,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are millions of people going through this each year. In 2014, MBO Partners, a company that provides support services for contractors, counted 17.9 million people in America who work 15 or more hours on 1099 jobs\u2014and another 12.1 million who regularly do similar work on top of more traditional employment. There are benefits to this particular hustle\u2014working from home, not having a boss, getting to pick and choose the work you take on. But there are also costs\u2014and tax time is when \u201cindependent workers\u201d are forced to face them, often with little help.\n\nOn a 1040 form, there\u2019s no line to declare the stress saved from not having to commute or the freedom to take off an afternoon without having to justify it to anyone aside from yourself. Ultimately, tax forms count money: money in, money out, money owed. Freelancers are constantly telling and re-telling the story of their work life, but every year at tax time, they have to put down on paper a single, dollar-driven story of a year in their work life.\n\nIt is often a grim tale. This is when the monetary costs of working at gigs becomes apparent\u2014when independent workers are forced to confront the price of that freedom, in the form of extra taxes, extra expenses, and the extra responsibility of dealing with them.\n\nThe number of workers confronting these challenges, in New York and across the country, continues to grow.\n\nThe Census Bureau keep tracks of \u201cnon employers,\u201d most of which are self-employed individuals\u2014small businesses of one.\n\nIn 2012, in New York State, there were 1.6 million \u201cnon-employers,\u201d who took in $77 billion in revenue\u2014the third-highest total in the country. That\u2019s an average of about $48,000 for each business. In the New York metro area (which includes Newark and Jersey City), there were almost 1.75 million establishments, with $91 billion in revenue\u2014that\u2019s $44,000 on average.\n\nFrom the 1970s to the mid-2000s, the percentage of workers in New York City who were self-employed doubled, from 8 percent to 16 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\nWhat are the costs of the gig economy to these workers? One way to answer that question is to look at what financial responsibilities are shifted from employers to workers when they\u2019re hired as contractors.\n\nIn 2013, two Columbia University professors, Steven Cohen and William Eimicke, co-authored a management analysis of independent contracting, and laid out the costs to independent contractors: paying the whole of their Social Security and Medicare taxes (employers pay half for employees), losing out on unemployment insurance, taking on full responsibility for their retirement plans, obtaining their own health care coverage, and taking on responsibility for damages if there\u2019s an accident on the job.\n\nIt\u2019s not impossible to cobble together the same sort of compensation package that W-2 workers get.\n\n\u201cBecause of the Affordable Care Act and other tools, you can create your own total compensation package that includes deferred compensation,\u201d says Steven Cohen, who, among other roles he serves at Columbia, is a professor in the practice of public affairs.\n\nAnd organizations like the Freelancers Union are making it easier than ever: Last year, Freelancers rolled out a program of \u201ccurated benefits for independent workers.\u201d Those include not just health insurance, but disability, dental, life and liability insurance\u2014as well as retirement planning.\n\nBut it\u2019s still hard. Over a year, in Brooklyn, everything aside from health insurance will run you a minimum of about $1,000. Health insurance will be closer to $5,000.\n\nOn top of that, self-employed people are responsible for paying all their payroll taxes. (Employers pay half of Social Security and Medicare.) That\u2019s an additional 7.5 percent levy on whatever income \u201cindependent workers\u201d make.\n\nIn theory, independent workers can get paid more per hour or are meant to be accounting for these costs when they price their services. But it doesn\u2019t work out that way in practice.\n\nThough the average income for self-employed people is higher than for employees, the median is lower\u2014some people do better than if they had a salaried job, but most do worse. In its survey on independent workers, MBO Partners found that only a third expected to make more money freelancing than in a traditional full-time job. Most of the people working freelance side jobs, less than 15 hours a week, said they needed the money.\n\nFor about half of \u201cindependent workers,\u201d the intangible benefits of working outside a company might outweigh the financial costs: Half the people working 15 hours or more each week on 1099-type work told MBO that \u201cit was their choice completely\u201d to go freelance. But another third\u2014people who MBO Partners calls \u201creluctant independents\u201d\u2014didn\u2019t choose freelance work to begin with. They feel little control over their work assignments or schedules and want back into the traditional workforce.\n\nFor these people, there are few benefits to working without a net. There is only the calculation of coughing up more money for the benefits an employer usually pays for, or going without.\n\nAnother way to tally the monetary costs of the gig economy is to look at the form that independent workers have to fill out each spring: the 1040 Schedule C. There\u2019s a section there for expenses\u2014a place to list the costs of doing business.\n\nThey include paying for your own advertising, your own car, fees that companies like Uber, Airbnb, and Kickstarter charge, a work computer, office furniture, liability insurance, business travel, and business meals.\n\nYes, freelancers get to the deduct these expenses from their income. And that can be worth a substantial amount of money\u2014thousands of dollars saved in taxes. That doesn\u2019t make those expenses disappear, though. If you buy a computer for thousands of dollars and deduct that expense from your income, you might save a couple hundred dollars on taxes. But you still end up spending thousands of dollars on a computer\u2014plus, the I.R.S. requires that you spread those tax savings out over a few years.\n\nSalaried people buy computers, too, and they don\u2019t get those few hundred dollars in taxes savings, so there is some advantage. But salaried people also don\u2019t have to pay for their own office space or their own plane tickets to an important professional conference or for their ergonomically sound office chair or their desk. Every single thing that an employer usually provides, self-employed people provide for themselves\u2014or they do without.\n\nThis is part of the reason that co-working spaces and rent-by-the-hour office spaces like WeWork exist: Independent workers can\u2019t necessarily afford to rent an office with a conference room year-round. But sometimes they want or need the sort of amenities a traditional office provides. They\u2019re available a la carte in part because few independent workers could afford to buy access to that sort of space day in and day out.\n\nSome of the most confusing \u201cexpenses\u201d that the gig economy has created are the \u201cfees\u201d that companies charge for use of their platform. When Uber drivers receive their tax forms\u2014a somewhat mysterious catch-all form called a 1099-K\u2014it lists not just the money they received from Uber, but every cent their passengers paid. If drivers don\u2019t want to pay taxes on Uber\u2019s cut, they have to know to deduct those \u201cfees\u201d as expenses.\n\n\u201cUber takes a cut of everything. Kickstarter is taking a cut of everything,\u201d said Garofalo. \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but there\u2019s this impression that it\u2019s this altruistic world of dreams.\u201d\n\nThe dreams end when the tax form comes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just real life,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone made money along the way.\u201d\n\nIn this version of real life, it\u2019s the worker who\u2019s responsible not just for paying the expenses of money-making but keeping track of what\u2019s owed to the government. It\u2019s not a great system for anyone involved. Already, back in the late 2000s, before the economy crashed and the gig economy took off, the I.R.S. estimated that about a fifth of the tax gap between the taxes the government should be collecting and the taxes it actually received came from independent workers underreporting their income.\n\nThe horror story goes something like this: You graduate from college, move to New York and start making money\u2014good money\u2014in video editing. Checks come, you cash them, you spend the money. February rolls around, and mysterious forms, labeled 1099, start appearing in your mail. In April, you plug the numbers from those forms into some tax software, and it spits out a horrifying number: You owe thousands of dollars\u2014money that\u2019s long gone\u2014to the government.\n\nYou don\u2019t pay it. And maybe you don\u2019t pay it the year after that, either. Or the year after that. And, suddenly, ten years later, you have $80,000 in I.R.S. debt.\n\n\u201cIt becomes a seemingly insurmountable debt,\u201d said Garofalo, who\u2019s seen this story play out in real life. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a lot of shame on top of it. Who do you tell? When do you bring that up? Fourth date? Oh, you have student loans? I have student loans, too \u2026 and I owe $100,000 in taxes.\u201d\n\nGarofalo first started working in the freelance-tax business in 2008; before that he was a freelance performer and video editor, and he still thinks like a freelancer. For years, he worked out of his apartment, figuring that he didn\u2019t want to pass on the cost of an office rental to his clients and that, anyway, people he was helping didn\u2019t care for the pomp and circumstance. Eventually, though, he lost that apartment and expanded, to a big, open space down the block from the Brooklyn Flea, with stencils on the wall, zigzag carpeting on the floor, an old door souped up with a basketball hoop as a barrier, and plant clippings growing in glass Coke bottles in the waiting area.\n\nIt\u2019s homey, there\u2019s good music playing, and there\u2019s a surprising amount of laughter in an office where everyone\u2019s here to do their taxes.\n\nGarofalo built this business by asking himself what he\u2019d have wanted when he was working as a video editor, which is perhaps why so many people seem so relieved to have found this place. Often, the first time they come to Brass Taxes, Garofalo says, they\u2019re full of anxiety: They\u2019ve gotten a tax form in the mail\u2014maybe a 1099-K for their Airbnb income\u2014and they just have no idea what to do with it.\n\n\u201cA lot of what we do is explaining things to people so that they understand,\u201d Garofolo said. \u201cIt\u2019s all this vague mystery, and in what other place do we come in having such a poor estimate of what\u2019s about to happen?\n\n\u201cNobody wants to talk about money, because it\u2019s uncomfortable. We occasionally hear things in bars, and that\u2019s the pinnacle of our acumen. We know what we\u2019ve cobbled together based on how we were brought up and what we\u2019ve Googled or heard people say.\u201d\n\nBut for some of the weird new income that people are coming in with, there isn\u2019t a right answer. If two roommates split Airbnb profits, but the room\u2019s listed under only one of their Social Security numbers, how should that be represented on a tax form? Is money raised on Kickstarter income or is it a gift? No one really knows\u2014but for now it\u2019s up to the person who receives the money, not Airbnb or Kickstarter, to figure out the answer.\n\nZier\u2019s company, Zen99, is designed to take some of the stress out of dealing with these business responsibilities. Before starting this company, he worked at Exec, one of the companies that positions itself as a middleman between housecleaners and customers, and he saw a demand for a company that could do what \u201csharing economy\u201d companies don\u2019t want to\u2014educate the people they pay money to about the tax system.\n\nZen99 has focused particularly on drivers for companies like Uber and Lyft. In February, the company put out a guide to Uber 1099s, explaining why, for instance, the number that shows up on a driver\u2019s 1099-K is higher than the money they actually received: \u201cThe rules for a 1099-K require Uber to report all of the payments they processed on your behalf, which is the total amount the passenger paid. That means it includes things like safe ride fees and Uber\u2019s commission: costs that Uber took out before paying out to your bank account.\u201d\n\n(These are the sorts of expenses that go on a Schedule C. No one wants to pay taxes on money that went to Uber.)\n\nOne of the early features of Zen99 is a mileage tracker.\n\n\u201cReally, the goal is helping people stay organized and out of trouble,\u201d Zier said. Right now, Zen99 doesn\u2019t charge people for those services\u2014its own income comes from serving as an insurance broker.\n\nBut while start-ups like Zier\u2019s might take away some of the time and stress that independent workers expend on dealing with the money side of their one-person business, ultimately, it\u2019s still workers who are paying extra taxes and accruing expenses. For most of the year, it\u2019s easy not to think about that; at tax time, there\u2019s no avoiding it.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s part of what makes people uncomfortable,\u201d says Garofalo. \u201cThere\u2019s no spin.\u201d\n\nThis article appeared in the March edition of Capital magazine.\n\nAuthors:\n\nThis story tagged under: Uber\n\nAirbnb\n\nCity Hall\n\nTaxes", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Politico PRO", "description": "<p>In the winter months, a new ritual has emerged among the millions of workers who make all or part of their money by stringing gigs together.
