I knew he was paying since we were in Tampa. I got him in Denver (where the Avs and Lightning meet Feb. 22). I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll rack it up when we get to Denver.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon said of the game, \u201cHe plays left (wing) and I play right, so I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a cool picture of us lined up for a faceoff together at some point in the game. It\u2019s going to be fun. It\u2019s going to be a cool memory \u2026 We talked a lot about playing against each other, playing with each other in the NHL, and we get to do that at the age of 19, so it\u2019s happened very quick and pretty young, but we\u2019re both very excited (for) tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be weird, a little bit,\u201d Drouin said a little earlier, after the Lightning skate. \u201cWe\u2019re good friends off the ice, but it should be a fun thing. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not going to give me a lot of space out there and I want to do the same.\u201d\n\nIn 2012-13, Drouin had 41 goals and 64 assists in 49 games and then 12 goals in 17 playoff games with the Mooseheads. MacKinnon had 32 goals and 43 assists in 44 games, then 11 goals and 22 assists in the postseason.\n\nSo how did they so instantly develop a chemistry as linemates at Halifax?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it just clicked,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cI think we just complement each other. We\u2019re different players. he kind of slows the game down to attack and I guess they way we meshed was almost perfect, we were almost always in sync on and off the ice. We like the same things off the ice and we get along really well, and on the ice I think it translates.\u201d\n\nDrouin has 2 goals and 16 assists in 35 games for the Lightning, after recovering from a thumb injury that kept him out of much of training camp and then the first five games of the season.\n\nDrouin said of MacKinnon\u2019s strength: \u201cHis skating. He dominated skating in junior and he still does it here. He\u2019s got a step on NHL players already and he\u2019s 19. His skating\u2019s got to be the biggest part and he\u2019s a smart player to play with too. He\u2019s got a lot of things to his game, and he\u2019s a good guy too.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon was the chauffeur for his linemate a lot of the time in Halifax, MacKinnon\u2019s hometown.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say some days were good, some days were bad,\u201d he said of MacKinnon\u2019s driving. \u201cWe were 16 when he got his license and I wasn\u2019t too sure. My mom was like, \u2018Make sure he\u2019s safe.\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s getting there.'\u201d\n\nSaid MacKinnon: \u201cAny time he wanted to go anywhere, he would just text me, \u2018I want to go to the mall\u2019 or whatever. I thought it was just school and the rink, but it turned into everything.\u201d\n\nHalifax defeated the Quebec Remparts \u2014 coached by Patrick Roy \u2014 in the 2013 QMJHL final, coming back from a 3-0 deficit in the series.\n\n\u201cScoring the OT winner at the Colisee, a big rink, with 15,000 people, is a special moment for me, for Nathan and the team,\u201d Drouin said.\n\n\u201cI will remember that playoff for a long time,\u201d said Roy. \u201cWe were up 3-0 in the series and then they took charge. Actually, Drouin scored the winning goal in Game 7 in overtime. They both played really well together. Drouin\u2019s a great passer, he sees the ice really well, moves the puck really well and Nate has a lot of speed, and I thought that was a good mix for both of them.\u201d\n\nWhile MacKinnon was having a Calder Trophy season with the Avalanche a year ago, Drouin was tearing it up with the Mooseheads. He wasn\u2019s happy when the Lightning sent him back to Halifax for the extra year of seasoning, but he concedes it probably worked out for the best.\n\n\u201cLooking back, I feel more ready,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was better for my development and I matured a little bit too.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado Avalanche,Halifax Mooseheads,Jonathan Drouin,Nathan MacKinnon,Patrick Roy,Tampa Bay Lightning", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Former Halifax Mooseheads linemates Nathan MacKinnon of Colorado and Johnathan Drouin of Tampa Bay to meet tonight on the ice -- after having dinner together Friday night", "title": "Avalanche's Nathan MacKinnon to face former Halifax linemate", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/17/avalanches-nathan-mackinnon-faces-former-mooseheads-linemate-first-time-nhl/20586/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/01/Rookies2-495x319.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Former Halifax Mooseheads linemates Nathan MacKinnon of Colorado and Johnathan Drouin of Tampa Bay to meet tonight on the ice -- after having dinner together Friday night", "title": "Avalanche\u2019s Nathan MacKinnon faces former Mooseheads linemate for first time in NHL", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/01/17/avalanches-nathan-mackinnon-faces-former-mooseheads-linemate-first-time-nhl/20586/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/01/Rookies2-495x319.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Avalanche's Nathan MacKinnon to face former Halifax linemate for the first time in NHL"}, "article_summary": "My mom was like, \u2018Make sure he\u2019s safe.\u2019 I said, \u2018He\u2019s getting there.\nMacKinnon had 32 goals and 43 assists in 44 games, then 11 goals and 22 assists in the postseason.\nHe\u2019s got a lot of things to his game, and he\u2019s a good guy too.\u201dMacKinnon was the chauffeur for his linemate a lot of the time in Halifax, MacKinnon\u2019s hometown.\n\u201cWe went to a sushi place,\u201d MacKinnon said after the Avalanche morning skate in the recently renamed Amalie Arena.\n'\u201dSaid MacKinnon: \u201cAny time he wanted to go anywhere, he would just text me, \u2018I want to go to the mall\u2019 or whatever."}
