Mason Wartman, 27, is the proud owner of Rosa’s Fresh Pizza, a restaurant known not only for its pizza but for its efforts to help the city’s homeless.

Wartman told “Today” that he felt “burnt out” after spending three years in a Wall Street job. He wanted to open his own business, bringing the $1 slices of pizza he loved in New York to his hometown of Philadelphia.

Customers loved the $1 slices so much that they wanted to share them with others.

Wartman credits his customers with the idea to “pay it forward” by helping the homeless.

Customers can choose to give an additional dollar when purchasing their slices. They then leave a post-it note on the walls with messages or drawings.

Those in need can come to the restaurant, take one of the post-it notes and redeem it for a slice.

So far, Rosa’s has given away 9,000 slices of pizza, serving about 40 people in need each day.

Wartman told “Today” he hopes his restaurant is a credit to its namesake—his mother, Rose.

“She likes it a lot,” he said. “I think she’s proud.”
