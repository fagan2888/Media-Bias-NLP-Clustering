Liberals lose their minds when one business declines to offer just a few forms of birth control. But when Republicans offer to vastly expand every woman’s access to birth control by making it available over-the-counter, they’re suddenly in favor of less options for women.

Sens. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Kelly Ayotte, (R-NH) have introduced a bill asking prescription birth control companies to file for the FDA’s permission to sell over-the-counter. (This was a signature issue in Gardner’s campaign to defeat former Democratic Sen. Mark Udall.)

“Most other drugs with such a long history of safe and routine use are available for purchase over the counter, and contraception should join them,” Gardner said in a statement reported by The Huntsville Times. “Making this medication available over the counter would increase access in rural and underserved areas, save consumers money by increasing competition and availability, and save women time by increasing the ease of getting the safe contraception they need.”

“It’s time to allow women the ability to make their own decisions about safe, effective, and long-established methods of contraception.”

Planned Parenthood has already rushed to condemn the legislation, claiming that it would reduce access to birth control, since it would no longer be covered under Obamacare–even though Gardner’s bill would also repeal Obamacare’s ban on using health savings accounts for non-prescription drugs.

And other forms of birth control will remain prescription-only and covered by insurance, even should the bill move forward–including, in all likelihood, some oral contraceptives.

Jezebel lambasted the move as “a sneaky way to effectively end Obamacare’s mandatory contraception coverage.”
