As many of you have noticed, everything has grown tremendously these past few weeks with all the rain we've had. The community has noticed as well. I received a phone call from a Boulder Code Enforcement Officer today due to a complaint for an older gentleman's yard that has become very overgrown. Unfortunately, the gentleman himself has been in the hospital and is currently unable to take care of his lawn.

The story is a common one for YardBusters clients, the program I run through the local nonprofit Boulder County CareConnect (BCCC). Many seniors, especially those with disabilities, have trouble maintaining their yards, as that work is frequently physically demanding. Consequently, intrusive overgrowth arises that puts seniors at risk of receiving city fines or worse, having a serious fall.

BCCC's YardBusters program meets this need by sending groups of volunteers to seniors' homes in order to provide yard maintenance and remove intrusive overgrowth. Currently, however, we have a severe deficit of YardBusters volunteers, and some clients have been waiting for assistance with their yards for over two months.

If you can spare any time, even two hours, I hope you'll consider helping us meet this need. The YardBusters program is a great volunteer opportunity for individuals, groups, or families, and is perfect for anyone who loves working outdoors. Volunteering can be short or long term, is flexible to each volunteer's schedule, and is suitable for almost any age and skill level.
