DeMarcus Ware pulled up limping Sunday afternoon. Because it’s July, not September, the Broncos are proceeding cautiously. The star pass rusher is not practicing Monday after sitting out the second half of Sunday’s workout.

As the team ran through drills Monday, Ware stood on the sideline with a white protective sleeve on his bruised right lower leg.

He is not the only high profile player not working out. All-pro wide receiver Demaryius Thomas did not make the open of practice, though the anticipation remains that he will arrive in Denver on Monday. Thomas was excused from the team’s first four practices after arranging and attending Sunday’s funeral for the grandmother who helped raise him in Georgia.

Regardless, Thomas will not participate in Wednesday’s second open practice at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.

Per the collective bargaining agreement, Thomas must practice three times before putting the pads on. The Broncos are off Tuesday.

Other injured players not participating include: defensive end Greg Latta (knee), tight end Jameson Konz (knee sprain) and John Boyett (stiff back).

Practice began with levity. The Broncos listen to music during stretch and Monday’s opener was “Rocky Top.” Peyton Manning, Malik Jackson and Britton Colquitt, former Tennessee stars, danced to the song. When it finished Manning said, “That’s what I am talking about it. Best practice of the year.”
