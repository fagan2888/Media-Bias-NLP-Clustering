They excavated a loggerhead sea turtle nest just behind Sunrise Beach Condominiums off of Front Beach Road.\n\nThe excavation held a special surprise for volunteers and excited beachgoers. Three live loggerhead hatchlings were pulled from one of the many nests along the beach to a captive audience.\n\nLynda Yates is one of the volunteers with the Turtle Watch who helped excavate the nest. She said they examine the nests after most of the hatchlings leave to count the hatched eggs and check for stragglers.\n\nShe said this nest, Nest 3, had 145 eggs, 118 of which made it to the water. Plus three.\n\n\u201cIt's fun,you know, it's fun,\u201d Yates said. \u201cWe try and warn people because they tend to get over exuberant they wanna dive into the nest to get the picture and we just make sure that they understand that we will give them plenty of time to take pictures afterwards.\u201d\n\nYates said every morning at 5:30 teams on ATVs comb the beach, looking for fresh tracks and nests. After 60 days, marked nests are monitored at least three times a day for activity.\n\nRachel Pigue and her kids were among the group of spectators. They were with a group from Bay Beach Home School Families. She said they came out to see the excavation because the adopted the nest.\n\nIt's absolutely amazing, it's such a good opportunity just as a local to come out here,\u201d Pigue said. \u201cI mean they have so many nests and it's just so amazing to do this every year and it's such a good learning experience for the kids.\"\n\nVolunteers with Panama City Beach Turtle Watch said they do this work throughout the nesting season and the public is invited to attend.\n\nYou can check their Facebook here for upcoming excavations:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Panama-City-Beach-Turtle-Watch/125397917484930?fref=ts\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite some evening rain, volunteers with Panama City Beach Turtle Watch still made their way to the water Saturday.
