Also known as the 80/20 rule, under its provisions, issuers within both individual and small group markets spend a minimum of 80 percent of premium dollars to help improve healthcare\u2019s overall quality. Consumers are owed a refund via a lower premium or check if standards are not met.\n\nHealthcare payers have historically faced pressure regarding medical loss ratios,\u201d said Laurie Graham, Payer Operations Manager at athenahealth, to RevCycleIntelligence.com. \u201cPayers ahead of the curve are thinking about ways to streamline their administrative processes as much as possible and creating consumer engagement at the same time.\u201d\n\nHealthcare consumers reportedly saved over $1 billion in 2013 due to 2013 MLR rebates of $250 million. In 2012, the MLR and rate review provisions yielded $1.6 billion in both rebates and lower premiums.\n\n\u201cThanks to the 80/20 Rule, enrollees will receive refunds if they are charged excess premium while health insurance companies gain experience setting competitive premiums in the Marketplace,\u201d CMS said. \u201cIn this way, the 80/20 Rule, together with premium stabilization programs, ensures that consumers\u2019 premiums remain stable and proportionate to their medical costs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare consumers have received over $2.4 billion premium rebates since 2011, confirmed a press release earlier this month from CMS on MLR rates and the ACA.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-reports-2.4b-in-healthcare-consumer-aca-premium-rebates", "type": "article", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_8850806750.jpg", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "title": "CMS Reports $2.4B in Healthcare Consumer ACA Premium Rebates"}, "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare consumers have received over $2.4 billion premium rebates since 2011, confirmed a press release earlier this month from CMS on MLR rates and the ACA.", "title": "CMS Reports $2.4B in Healthcare Consumer ACA Premium Rebates", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_8850806750.jpg"}, "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Last year, over 5.5 million healthcare consumer received almost $470 million in rebates, CMS said \u2013 an average of $129 per family.\nHealthcare consumers have received over $2.4 billion premium rebates since 2011, confirmed a press release earlier this month from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\nCalifornia and Florida had the largest statewide 2014 MLR rebates of nearly $98 million and nearly $60 million, respectively.\nCMS asserted the root of these sizable savings results is the ACA, which mandates that health insurance companies spend a minimum of 80 percent of premium dollars on healthcare endeavors.\n\u201cThanks to the 80/20 Rule, enrollees will receive refunds if they are charged excess premium while health insurance companies gain experience setting competitive premiums in the Marketplace,\u201d CMS said."}
