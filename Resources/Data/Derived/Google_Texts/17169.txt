Dr. Melinda Frye will become the first woman to lead Colorado State University’s veterinary school, CSU announced Tuesday.

Frye is an associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences and will start her new duties in July, replacing Dr. Dean Hendrickson.

Hendrickson is returning to full-time teaching and equine surgery after two years at the helm of the program.

As associate dean of Professional Veterinary Medicine in the CSU College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Frye leads the third-ranked veterinary school in the county, according to U.S. News and World Report. Eighty percent of the CSU program’s 550 students are women, the school said in a press release.

“Dr. Frye has an impressive and diverse range of experiences and achievements that will benefit our students and our veterinary program,” said Dr. Mark Stetter, dean of the veterinary school.

“Beyond her admirable credentials in teaching, research and clinical service, it’s wonderful to have an accomplished woman in a role that so visibly demonstrates what our students can do in science, medicine and the veterinary industry.”

Frye has taught graduate-level physiology at CSU for seven years.

She began her medical career as a registered nurse, moving from Oregon to Fort Collins, where she worked at Poudre Valley Hospital.

She then attended veterinary school at CSU, instead of medical school, because of her love of animals, according to the university. She completed an equine medicine residency at the CSU Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Frye pursued a Ph.D. in physiology through CSU and completing her research at the Cardiovascular Pulmonary Research Laboratory at the University of Colorado.

Her expertise in cardiovascular physiology and equine medicine.

“I hope my experience gives me a well-rounded perspective on our CSU veterinary program,” Frye said in a statement.
