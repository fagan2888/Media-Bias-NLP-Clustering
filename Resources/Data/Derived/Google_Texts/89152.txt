Shares of Gilead Sciences Inc. got a 4% lift from an analyst’s glowing report and upgrade of the biotechnology firm Tuesday, as the company prepares to report fourth-quarter earnings after the close.

Gilead /quotes/zigman/72849/delayed /quotes/nls/gild GILD shares added $3 to $81.83 in recent action after Brian P. Skorney, analyst at Robert W. Baird, upgraded the Foster City, Calif.-based company to outperform from neutral.

Skorney said the outlook for sales of its new hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, is sunny. Gilead is considered now to be the frontrunner to sell the first such medication as it is farther along in getting its drug to market. AbbVie Inc. /quotes/nls/abbv ABBV is close behind with tests nearly finished on its hepatitis C drug. Further, Gilead is testing and is expected to launch an updated hepatitis C drug — a combination of substances known as sofosbuvir and ledipisvir — next year.

Headlining his report by saying Gilead’s position in the hepatitis C market means the company is “too good not to own,” Skorney said the company is seeing “overwhelmingly positive” prescription drug trends.

“Sovaldi prescriptions, to date, are outperforming our expectations by a multiple,” he said in a note to clients. “We believe current trends indicate that 2014/2015 consensus hep C sales are [less than] 50% of what Gilead will report. We think the sofosbuvir/ledipisvir combo will have higher peak sales than any historical pharma product and will do so in year one.”

Skorney says Gilead’s ventures into the HIV market are strong as well, with sales of its Atripia drug expected to help push the company past analyst forecasts on sales.
