Can there be a bigger snoozer than a book written by a Canadian scholar based in New Brunswick on the uses of government? Can we get a copy of Donald J. Savoie\u2019s \u201cWhat Is Government Good At?: A Canadian Answer\u201d onto the reading stand of every candidate for president of the United States?\n\nThe answer to all three is probably \u201cno,\u201d and in any case the book isn\u2019t even published in this country. It\u2019s produced by the McGill-Queens University Press \u2014 which, I must add, published the book with the support of the Canada Council for the Arts, chaired by a government appointee, and the Canada Book Fund, also a government program.\n\nBut the truth is that Mr. Savoie, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Public Administration and Governance at the Universite de Moncton, has written an important book that asks the ultimate question citizens should consider as they approach federal elections, ours in 2016 and Canada\u2019s next month.\n\nPut aside the question of whether books should be produced with government assistance \u2014 Canada has a bigger challenge than the United States in promoting scholarly and popular study of its culture and history \u2014 and consider whether the American elections of 1800, 1828, 1904, 1912, 1920, 1932, 1980, 1992, 2000, 2008 and 2012 were about much of anything besides the question that forms the title of Mr. Savoie\u2019s book.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, asking what government is good at is beside the point,\u201d Mr. Savoie argues. \u201cThere are things that governments must continue to do, whether or not they are good at it.\u201d\n\nAs a result, this is a question with some fixed parts and some movable parts. Some government functions \u2014 foreign affairs, international trade agreements, monetary policy, immigration \u2014 are obviously governmental. Ordinarily most people also think that national security is beyond the reach of the private sector, but the presence of private-security officers in Iraq in the last decade has proven that this is no longer taboo.\n\nChanging times and changing perspectives are changing the calculus. A generation ago nobody gave a moment\u2019s thought \u2014 indeed, people dismissed the thought with a shrug and a smirk \u2014 to privatizing prisons. The first experiments began in the mid-1980s, although, by the end of the decade, former Gov. Pierre S. DuPont of Delaware was running for president and thought out loud about a huge menu of privatizations, including prisons. You could hear the laughs of derision from Des Moines to Manchester. Today the notion is unusual, but not at all unfamiliar.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is plenty of room for disagreement on the extent to which government should intervene,\u201d Mr. Savoie says, \u201cno modern government will agree to walk away completely from key socio-economic sectors, including education, health, social services, transportation and public works.\u201d\n\nAnd he acknowledges that government has been effective in spurring innovation (development of the Internet and even the frozen french-fry industry) and in making \u201cvisionary investments\u201d (such as developing the St. Lawrence Seaway).\n\nBut the private sector has a culture of efficiency and entrepreneurship that government never has had and cannot begin to replicate. Mr. Savoie praises the Canadian experience in privatizing railroads and broad Canadian impatience with government-owned energy.\n\nMr. Savoie does not offer a defense of big government in Canada, where government is very big indeed, or in the United States, where it is bigger than conservatives would like it to be. He recognizes the limitations of government, saying that politicians and public servants \u201care good at generating blame, avoiding blame, blaming others, playing to a segment of the population to win the next election, avoiding risks, embracing and defending the status quo, adding management layers and staff, keeping [government officials] out of trouble in the media, responding to the demands of the prime minister and managing a complex, multi-objective prime ministerial-centric large organization operating in a politically volatile environment.\u201d\n\nSubstitute the word \u201cpresident\u201d and \u201cpresidential\u201d in the description above, and you have a pretty accurate view of circumstances here below the 49th parallel.\n\nEnormous attention has been paid in recent weeks to Donald Trump\u2019s critique of Megyn Kelly, to Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s defense of her use of a private email server as secretary of state and on the private cogitations of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And though Republican candidates have a natural skepticism of government, apart from Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, they have spent little time explaining how they would trim government, aside from the hardy perennial of slaying the Department of Education \u2014 an issue that for a quarter century has failed to elicit a bleat of passion \u2014 and the new crowd favorite, strangling Obamacare.\n\nAn analysis by the conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation pegs the spending cuts in Mr. Cruz\u2019s legislative agenda at an average of $169.4 billion a year. That\u2019s about $10 billion more than the spending cuts advocated by the average GOP senator, according to the group.\n\nAt the same time, Democratic candidates, especially Ms. Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have outlined several proposals that would increase rather than diminish the role of government; the National Taxpayers Union argues that Ms. Clinton proposed $226 billion in new spending while in the Senate \u2014 and that Mr. Sanders has proposed more than $1 trillion. Mr. Biden, a lifelong government employee, no doubt would add a few billion of his own, particularly if he listens to his new pal, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.\n\nMr. Savoie\u2019s book is not a prescription as much as it is a field guide to government and its performance. He\u2019s not arguing that government should get out of the way \u2014 the Republican view in this country, a legacy of Ronald Reagan \u2014 as much as he argues that government needs to burnish its performance.\n\nHis book is a warning that the platter of government responsibilities is full to overflowing, that the public sector too often fails its constituents and that, as he puts it, \u201csociety and politics have changed to the point that they have knocked public administration off its moorings.\u201d Mr. Savoie will profit if his book wins mass readership, but we\u2019d all profit if a couple of copies were passed around the debate-prep suites in Iowa and New Hampshire.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Can there be a better subject to discuss in an election season than the question of what government actually is good at?
