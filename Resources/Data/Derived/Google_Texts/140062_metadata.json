But as Hank Philippi Ryan reveals the state\u2019s system set up to help \u201cconnect\u201d people with affordable insurance is in critical condition. The result of her investigation: An apology from the state and help for viewers who contacted Hank Investigates begging for help.\n\nThe results of her eye exam were terrifying, to save her vision, she needed surgery.\n\nBut then this Pembroke resident got more frightening news from her doctor: He said she didn\u2019t have insurance.\n\nPaula: \u201cI was blindsided, literally!\u201d\n\nThis Plymouth woman got the same upsetting news after a dentist appointment: No insurance.\n\nElaine: \u201cI was totally shocked!\u201d\n\nSo Elaine couldn\u2019t get dental care. Paula\u2019s surgery was cancelled! But wait, their bank records proved they\u2019d both paid the Massachusetts Health Connector for insurance every month.\n\nYou know the Health Connector, the state agency that\u2019s supposed to help get Massachusetts residents their health insurance.\n\nBut our investigation found a massive pattern of disconnects at the Health Connector. New Executive Director Louis Gutiherrez admits it.\n\nHank: \u201cThere are some people who think they paid for insurance and don\u2019t have it because your system didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nLouis Gutierrez, Executive Director, Massachusetts Health Connector: \u201cLet\u2019s take a for instance\u2026\u201d\n\nHank: \u201cYes or no?\u201d\n\nLouis: \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why. The Health Connector\u2019s website offers online payments. But we have learned those payments sometimes went into a black hole instead of to the insurance company.\n\nPaula: \u201cThat was the most infuriating part, of course, was that I was paying all along.\u201d\n\nEven more infuriating, when Paula and Elaine called customer service in a panic they couldn\u2019t get help!\n\nElaine: \u201cI have spoken to 24 different people.\u201d\n\nPaula: \u201cI spent, literally, 36 hours on the phone.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, we found thousands of other people couldn\u2019t get help either! Earlier this year more than 13- thousand customers were stuck in a backlog. They could not get refunds, account changes, or even answers!\n\nHank: \u201cDid the call center people not know what they were doing? Did the electronic systems not work? Was your database flawed?\u201d\n\nLouis: \u201cHank, it was everything.\u201d\n\nWe got the state to fix Paula\u2019s problem and Elaine\u2019s, too.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still waiting for help, the Health Connector\u2019s new boss promises they\u2019ll soon fix your problems too.\n\nLouis: \u201cWe owe the public integrity of operations.\u201d\n\nHank: \u201cDo you owe them an apology?\u201d\n\nLouis: \u201cWe owe every single individual who\u2019s experienced extraordinary difficulty this year our regrets for that experience.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re having difficulties, the Health Connector says they\u2019ve now added a new customer service advocate program.\n\nTo contact the Health Connector\u2019s new Ombudsman Office please click here:\n\nhttps://betterhealthconnector.com/about/contact#contact-ombudsman\n\n(Copyright (c) 2016 Sunbeam Television.
