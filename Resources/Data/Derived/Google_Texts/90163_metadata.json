The answer might surprise you.\n\nSigning up for medical insurance in the health marketplace means access to network health providers. But in exchange for having that access, the network controls almost every decision that is made \u2013 from the doctor a patient can see to the hospital a patient can visit.\n\nInsurance companies operate this way in order to negotiate lower rates with network providers, which keeps costs down.\n\nBut what happens when that network has so few doctors it's almost impossible to get an appointment? Or if the closest in-network hospital is hours away?\n\nEnsuring that networks not only have the right providers, but also enough of them, is known as \"network adequacy.\" And that's a top focus of state lawmakers, who have formed a committee to look into healthcare delivery concerns here in Georgia.\n\nThe executive director of Georgians for a Healthy Future, Cindy Zeldin, was recently appointed to the study committee.\n\n\u201cWhen we sign up for health insurance we really want it to do two things,\u201d Zeldin said during an interview on \u201cA Closer Look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want it to provide some financial protection in the event that we get sick, but also it\u2019s the gateway to the healthcare system and we want it to provide access to all the healthcare providers that we may need \u2013 either for preventive services or treatment.\u201d\n\nZeldin discussed network adequacy, why some networks may be struggling to provide all the services required in an insurance policy, what it means for the patient and more on \u201cA Closer Look.\u201d\n\nApril Williams, Rose Scott, and Denis O'Hayer contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health & Science", "description": "How adequate are the services provided under health insurance plans bought through the new Obamacare healthcare marketplace and are Atlanta residents", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Closer Look with Rose Scott and Jim Burress", "og": {"url": "http://news.wabe.org/post/ga-officials-looking-access-healthcare-providers", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wabe/files/styles/medium/public/networkadequacy_healthcaremain_072715.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "How adequate are the services provided under health insurance plans bought through the new Obamacare healthcare marketplace and are Atlanta residents", "title": "Ga.
