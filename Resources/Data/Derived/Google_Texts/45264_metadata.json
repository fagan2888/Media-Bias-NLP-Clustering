For the hot-tempered, this could mean a chronically elevated risk. \"Although the risk of experiencing an acute cardiovascular event with any single outburst of anger is relatively low, the risk can accumulate for people with frequent episodes of anger,\" she said, speaking to BBC News.\n\nThe study, which is published in the European Heart Journal, reviewed data from nine previous studies involving thousands of participants. Taken together, these investigations suggest that an outburst is associated with a fivefold increase in heart attack risk that lasts for about two hours. During this time, you are also three times more likely to suffer a stroke.\n\nDoireann Maddock, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, told reporters that several biological factors may account for this surge. \"It's not clear what causes this effect,\u201d she said. \u201cIt may be linked to the physiological changes that anger causes to our bodies, but more research is needed to explore the biology behind this.\u201d\n\nWhen Emotions Kill\n\nThe current study dovetails with a number of other papers exploring the real-life consequences of powerful emotions. Another example is a St. George University study from earlier this year in which researchers show that loss, grief, and general \u201cheartbreak\u201d may double your risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke. \u201cWe often use the term a \u2018broken heart\u2019 to signify the pain of losing a loved one,\u201d co-author Dr. Sunil Shah said. \u201cOur study shows that bereavement can have a direct effect on the health of the heart.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, another research team from the University of Chicago recently found that feelings of loneliness and solitude may increase your risk of premature death. A survey of older widows and widowers showed that the risk may increase by as much as 14 percent over the months following loss. According lead author John Cacioppo and colleagues, this means that loneliness as a mortality factor is almost as strong as socioeconomic hardship, which is typically taken to correspond to a 19 percent increase in the risk of early death.\n\nWhile the biological foundation of these emotional effects remains cloudy, health experts are quick to point out that you can take steps to limit its impact \u2014 at least when it comes to anger. According to Maddock, it\u2019s all about keeping cool. \u201cLearning how to relax can help you move on from high-pressure situations,\u201d she explained. \u201cMany people find that physical activity can help to let off steam after a stressful day.\u201d\n\nSource: Mostofsky E, Penner AE, Mittleman MA.
