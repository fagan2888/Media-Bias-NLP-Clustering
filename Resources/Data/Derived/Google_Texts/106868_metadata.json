But we don\u2019t have the kind of guys in this locker room that panic.\u201d\n\nFor the Broncos, the real foe at this game\u2019s make-or-break moment \u2014 when Peyton Manning and his teammates walked to the line of scrimmage, facing third-and-20 at their 42-yard-line and a 21-10 deficit with only 51 seconds remaining in the second quarter \u2014 was not the Dolphins.\n\nThe real foe was all the balderdash being whispered about the Broncos that could create self-doubt: an old quarterback in slow decline, a lousy offensive line beyond repair, a team too soft to fight back when punched in the mouth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re professionals and we\u2019re going to get criticized, no matter what we do. If we went to the store and accidentally bought brown rice rather than white rice, somebody\u2019s going to say something about it,\u201d said C.J. Anderson, who ran for 167 yards.\n\nWhat happened when the Broncos could have folded in the face of criticism and let their season come undone was the jaw-dropping highlight of the most important drive led by Manning in 2014. Under the duress of third-and-20, receiver Emmanuel Sanders shook loose for 35-yard gain that proved to be the key play, allowing Denver to finish the first half with a touchdown drive that ignited hope a comeback would be possible.\n\nPHOTOS: Miami Dolphins vs. Denver Broncos at Mile High\n\n\u201cThese are the games you remember most: when you battle back, not blowing out a team, but when you battle back from a deficit and conquer,\u201d said Sanders, who could not have gotten more open more often if the Dolphins\u2019 secondary had stayed home in Florida.\n\nWhile a much-maligned Denver offensive line rediscovered its mojo with the return of granite-hard blocker Virgil Green and the one-cut explosiveness of Anderson, everything you needed to restore faith could be seen on the final play of the third quarter: Trailing by 11 points, and needing to pick up 2 yards at the Miami 41-yard line, what did Broncos offensive coordinator Adam Gase do on fourth down?\n\nWell, we all know what ESPN commentator and former Denver offensive lineman Mark Schlereth would have done in that same tense situation. He would have punted \u2026 on third down.\n\nInstead, Manning approached the line of scrimmage, surveyed the Miami defense and changed the call.\n\n\u201cPeyton checked into a run,\u201d insisted Anderson.\n\nWell, truth be known, it was Gase who stayed calm as the play clock wound down and relayed a running play through the speaker inside Manning\u2019s helmet. The quarterback took the snap and handed the football to Anderson, who ran for 20 yards.\n\nShortly thereafter, Manning hit Demaryius Thomas with a pass for a 5-yard touchdown play and followed up with a two-point conversion that cut Denver\u2019s deficit to 28-25. The comeback was on. But it was the trust Gase showed in Anderson and a beleaguered offensive line on fourth down that spoke louder than any roar of approval from 76,987 fans at Sports Authority Field at Mile High.\n\nAt a juncture when the Broncos could have succumbed to a crisis of confidence, they won a tough game on heart and guts. Let us count the ways:\n\nAfter never leading in a loss at St. Louis a week earlier, the Broncos came back to beat Miami, taking their first lead since Nov. 9 when Anderson scored on a 10-yard touchdown run with a tick more than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Denver overcame a short field-goal attempt clanked off the upright by kicker Brandon McManus, whose job status must certainly be in doubt. In the midst of a slump by their $17.5 million quarterback, the Broncos ran to daylight, and as the sun rises Monday, they stand alone in first place of the AFC West.\n\n\u201cIt could have been that \u2018This is not our day type of mentality,\u2019 \u201d said Manning, who reminded everyone in the NFL he can post a stellar 135.4 quarterback rating in a game when Denver\u2019s offensive balance was a pure 50/50 split of 35 runs and 35 passes.\n\nWhen the Broncos could have panicked, Manning said the key to the comeback was: \u201cWe had a real calm demeanor the entire game.\u201d\n\nKeep calm and trust No. 18.\n\nThe long, rocky road to the Super Bowl is not for wimps.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Broncos show true grit at just the right time", "title": "Kiszla: Broncos show true grit at just the right time", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/23/kiszla-broncos-show-true-grit-at-just-the-right-time/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141123__broncos-kiszlap1.jpg", "height": 454}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141123__broncos-kiszlap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-23T20:36:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T22:35:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ca0\"", "article_summary": "Well, we all know what ESPN commentator and former Denver offensive lineman Mark Schlereth would have done in that same tense situation.\nShortly thereafter, Manning hit Demaryius Thomas with a pass for a 5-yard touchdown play and followed up with a two-point conversion that cut Denver\u2019s deficit to 28-25.\nDenver overcame a short field-goal attempt clanked off the upright by kicker Brandon McManus, whose job status must certainly be in doubt.\n\u201cOne loss can ruin your NFL season if you don\u2019t handle it the right way.\nAt a juncture when the Broncos could have succumbed to a crisis of confidence, they won a tough game on heart and guts."}
