It was an audacious play by Bibi and the Republican leadership, unprecedented in our history, and that came across in the pieces. They captured the politics in Washington well.\n\nBut the story I found most illuminating was David Sanger\u2019s piece on the competing views of Obama and Netanyahu \u2014 not on the threat of a nuclear Iran, but how realistically to confront it.\n\nThe editorial and Tom Friedman\u2019s column also were useful in picking through the fog of Bibi\u2019s words and cutting to the core issues.\n\nQ.\n\nAnything on the Netanyahu speech you would like to have seen in the paper but didn\u2019t?\n\nA.\n\nI would have liked to have seen more than five paragraphs at the end of the main story on the reaction and likely political implications in Israel, where Bibi faces election in two weeks and is fighting for his political life. A later piece, posted from Israel on Wednesday morning, addressed this in greater detail.\n\nQ.\n\nThoughts on the story about Speaker John Boehner\u2019s retreat on Department of Homeland Security funding?\n\nA.\n\nThere is obviously a bigger, ongoing story here about the battle between the Republican ego and id. Boehner was taken to the brink by the most strident members of his caucus before he finally acted, with Bibi\u2019s speech to provide cover.\n\nThis ongoing battle between small-government conservatives and no-government conservatives within the G.O.P. is really the most interesting political story in Washington.\n\nQ.\n\nWhat do you think: Did The Times give the story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email the kind of display it warranted?\n\nA.\n\nI find this story hard to judge. There is an intimation that Secretary Clinton violated not just norms but rules in using only her private email for public business. But the State Department insists that no such rules or regulations were in place at the time she served, and her emails with departmental personnel would all be retrievable records. If she broke no rules, does this story deserve the play it has gotten?\n\nBut Team Clinton also has been slow in explaining why she exclusively used a private email address, which has allowed the story to fester.\n\nWhether this is a function of an operation hobbled by the fact that she is not yet a full-fledged candidate and staffed to respond, or a symptom of something larger, it bears correcting.\n\nQ.\n\nWhat story in today\u2019s paper disturbed you most?\n\nA.\n\nTwo stories in the business section about how investors, small and large, are being fleeced by oft-conflicted money managers who extract significant fees but often underperform basic index funds.\n\nQ.\n\nAs someone close to the president, what story was most difficult to read?\n\nA.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act stories, knowing how hard he fought to pass it.\n\nQ.\n\nIn the Magazine story \u201cObamacare Goes to the Supreme Court,\u201d now on the home page, Emily Bazelon and Adam Liptak discuss what is at stake. By your lights did they get it right?\n\nA.\n\nThis was really useful reading for those interested in understanding the real legal questions and potential outcomes.\n\nQ.\n\nAre there kinds of stories or articles about certain subjects that you skip entirely?\n\nA.\n\nI\u2019m not always as attentive to international stories as I should be. I sometimes skip over New York stories. The arts section is luxury I can\u2019t always afford.\n\nQ.\n\nDo you pay as much attention to the Times editorials now that you no longer work in the White House? (How much did they matter to policy makers?)\n\nA.\n\nYes. They\u2019re generally interesting and provocative. And now that I am out of the White House, what once was enraging is now just irritating.\n\nQ.\n\nFavorite section? Or one you save for last?\n\nA.\n\nIn my local paper, I read sports first, as I long ago shifted my allegiances from my native New York City teams to Chicago. In The Times, however, I save the sports for last. It\u2019s a good, fun section, but I don\u2019t have any rooting interest.\n\nQ.\n\nAnything in today\u2019s paper especially challenging to your status as a believer?\n\nA.\n\nAre you kidding? The Bibi spectacle in Congress; the prospect of the Affordable Care Act in jeopardy in Scotus due to what appears to be a drafting error \u2014 they try, but not break, my believer tenets.\n\nOn the other hand, it was encouraging that the House finally was forced to embrace responsibility on the D.H.S. budget was encouraging.\n\nQ.\n\nAnything in today\u2019s paper that made you laugh?\n\nA.\n\nThis line in Tom Friedman\u2019s column, which was both sobering \u2014 and hilarious: \u201cThere are actors in the Middle East for whom \u2018mutual assured destruction\u2019 is an invitation to a party \u2014 not a system of mutual deterrence.\u201d\u200b", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150304182132, "BN": "times-insider", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "timesinsider", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/times-insider/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 4, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/times-insider/Reading The Times With David Axelrod ( 20150304 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Susan Lehman", "SCG": "times-insider", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Susan Lehman", "byl": "Susan Lehman", "twitter": {"description": "Mr. Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, assesses coverage of the Netanyahu speech, the House vote on homeland security funding and the Supreme Court case involving the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Reading The Times With David Axelrod", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/03/04/reading-the-times-with-david-axelrod/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/04/blogs/axelrod/axelrod-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003551486, "description": "Mr. Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, assesses coverage of the Netanyahu speech, the House vote on homeland security funding and the Supreme Court case involving the Affordable Care Act.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 4, 2015", "article": {"tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1425511292, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts//index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2016-01-15T20:44:19-05:00"}, "utime": 20160115204419, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150304, "pdate": 20150304, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/04/blogs/axelrod/axelrod-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/03/04/reading-the-times-with-david-axelrod/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/04/blogs/axelrod/axelrod-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mr. Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Obama, assesses coverage of the Netanyahu speech, the House vote on homeland security funding and the Supreme Court case involving the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Reading The Times With David Axelrod"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/03/04/reading-the-times-with-david-axelrod/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Reading The Times With David Axelrod", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/04/blogs/axelrod/axelrod-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd333f\"", "article_summary": "Do you pay as much attention to the Times editorials now that you no longer work in the White House?\nAnd now that I am out of the White House, what once was enraging is now just irritating.\nAnything in today\u2019s paper especially challenging to your status as a believer?\nAnything in today\u2019s paper that made you laugh?\nWhat do you think: Did The Times give the story about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email the kind of display it warranted?"}
