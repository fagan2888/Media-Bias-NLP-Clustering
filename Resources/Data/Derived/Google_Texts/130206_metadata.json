Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office has also raised the prospect of legal action in response to the closure.\n\nThe closure was originally set for Dec. 31, and then Steward said it would be willing to keep it open up to Feb. 4, 2015.\n\n\u201cQMC must ensure adequate staffing, services and supplies remain available at levels sufficient to meet the needs of its patients throughout the closure process,\u201d Lohnes added in the letter. \u201cThe Department will continue to monitor QMC\u2019s closure, and must be notified once closure is complete.\u201d\n\nThe satellite emergency facility, which Steward plans to keep open until Dec. 31, 2015 through Carney Hospital\u2019s license, will have emergency room physicians and nurses, with CT scans and ultrasound, and pharmacy and laboratory services. Carney Hospital is also owned by Steward.\n\n\u201cWe have made clear that any efforts to close Quincy Medical Center must maintain emergency services beyond Dec. 31. This is an important step in that process and we are continuing our discussions with Steward,\u201d said Christopher Loh, a spokesman for Coakley.\n\nSteward also said a \u201ccommunity care network\u201d will include \u201curgent care, radiology and lab services\u201d Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday, at 54 Miller St. in Quincy. Radiology services will also be available at that location. Primary care physicians and specialists will be available at 54 Miller St. and 700 Congress St. in Quincy.\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of maintaining the patient-physician relationship and we have relocated all of the Quincy Medical Center physicians to nearby office locations,\u201d Girard said.\n\nA free shuttle will run between the facilities, the Quincy Center T Station, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center in Brighton and Manet Community Health Center locations.\n\nEarlier:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Local elected officials have criticized Steward for the speed with which the for-profit company has moved to close the hospital after it claimed in November that it suffered financial losses and a decreasing number of patients at the Quincy hospital.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "Local elected officials have criticized Steward for the speed with which the for-profit company has moved to close the hospital after it claimed in November that it suffered financial losses and a decreasing number of patients at the Quincy hospital.", "title": "Quincy Medical Center\u2019s Closure Set For Friday", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/12/quincy-medical-centers-closure-set-for-friday", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.wbur.org/images/podcasts/commonhealth.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/12/quincy-medical-centers-closure-set-for-friday", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws/cdn.wbur.org/images/podcasts/commonhealth.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Quincy Medical Center's Closure Set For Friday"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-24", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 07:41:07 -0500"}, "article_summary": "Quincy Medical Center\u2019s Closure Set For FridayThe Department of Public Health on Tuesday signed off on the proposed closure of Quincy Medical Center, set for midnight on Friday.\n\u201cWe understand the importance of maintaining the patient-physician relationship and we have relocated all of the Quincy Medical Center physicians to nearby office locations,\u201d Girard said.\n\u201cWe have made clear that any efforts to close Quincy Medical Center must maintain emergency services beyond Dec. 31.\nA free shuttle will run between the facilities, the Quincy Center T Station, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, St. Elizabeth\u2019s Medical Center in Brighton and Manet Community Health Center locations.\nIn a release, Steward said that Quincy Medical as of Tuesday no longer has any inpatients."}
