Tom Steyer, George and Jonathan Soros and Michael Bloomberg will be taxed at 100% -- with a 10% surtax on Bloomberg if he puts salt on his French fries, has a large sugary drink or sneaks a smoke.\n\nIf neither of these compromises work, tax pornography. There are about 1.4 trillion searches for \u201cerotic content\u201d per year on Google alone. At $5 a pop -- as it were \u2013 the national debt would be paid off in 30 months. The tax could be even higher, because what senator or representative from either party wants to go on Face the Nation and argue in favor of cheap porn?\n\nYes, the porn tax would anger male voters. But what are they going to do, Google \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d?\n\nThe same kind of cooperation could be extended to foreign policy. Republicans abjure additional sanctions and give the President a free hand in negotiating a nuclear weapons treaty with Iran. The negotiations go on and on and on while, of course, Iran secretly builds an atom bomb.\n\nIn return the President gives Congress a free hand in negotiating with Israel.\n\nBibi Netanyahu: \u201cWe intend to build three new settlements on the West Bank.\u201d\n\nCongress: \u201cHow about ten?\u201d\n\nBibi: \u201cWe want to buy 75 Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth planes capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nCongress: \u201cBuy 76 and we\u2019ll throw in a couple of dozen for free.\u201d\n\nIf Obama hosted the right kind of Cigar Night at the White House, Congress and the President could also agree on Cuba policy. Bottle after bottle of Havana Club Anejo 15 Anos Gran Reserva, box after box of Cohiba Esplendidos plus some lovely se\u00f1oritas from El Centro (and some handsome, suave se\u00f1ors to entertain the Congressional Caucus for Women\u2019s Issues).\n\nWhat a party. Around 3 a.m. the revelers commandeer the POTUS limo fleet, go back to the Capital Building, sneak in through a basement window and unanimously pass legislation trading Fidel Castro\u2019s Cuba for Puerto Rico.\n\nIn fact, bi-partisan drinking may resolve many of the issues that separate Republicans and Democrats. Such as immigration. Who do you think is waiting tables at that bar?\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Republicans won\u2019t propose immigration reform, for fear that the xenophobe nut-fudge part of the GOP dog\u2019s breakfast will explode.\n\nBut both parties know America is full of jobs no American will take. If there were more booze and cigars in that smoke-filled room, politics would be conducted the way politics used to be conducted: With a wink and nod and a secret handshake deal. Give the Border Patrol new tools \u2013 lawn-care implements. And -- whoever it is that\u2019s crossing the border -- if they can start the leaf-blower, they\u2019re in.\n\nMas mojitos frio, Jose!\n\nAfter three or ten cups of cheer, consensus could be reached about climate change as well. Here\u2019s to global warming \u2013 blow-hard wind-power in the summer! Here\u2019s to global cooling \u2013 fracking gas heat in the winter!\n\nI can hear the voices in the smoke-filled room:\n\nJohn Boehner: \u201cYou know whash\u2019s a great idea? Thish a great idea. The Keyshtone Pipeline? Letsh make it... solar.\u201d\n\nNancy Pelosi: \u201cThas good, thas good. I could vote for thish. But gotta haff a bike path.\n\nBoehner: \u201cHell, yesh. Pike bath. An, jush cause I luff you schweetheart, rightlail. Rightlail tracks all the way from Alberta to Texshus.\u201d\n\nPelosi: \u201cNother rounda white whine for the House!\u201d\n\nDrinking is also known to raise the divorce rate, which is already high among well-fixed Republican campaign donors. Opposition to Obamacare might disappear from conservative Super Pac agendas if the President threw in free cosmetic surgery for blonde third wives who are half their husbands\u2019 age or younger.\n\nOn the other hand, a ban on liberal-leaning entertainment industry breast implants, butt-lifts and Botox would free up more healthcare resources to provide Obamacare. And, since Washington is \u201cHollywood for the Ugly,\u201d the ban would apply to elected and appointed officials \u2013 thereby lessening political partisanship in America by making politics even more unattractive than it is already.\n\nAnother way to bring bipartisanship to the nation is to apply the NFL standard to \u201cruling challenges.\u201d Every time a politician introduces, votes for or signs a law that\u2019s over-turned by a federal court he or she loses a timeout and has to stay in his or her home state or district, where we will quickly come to loath him or her. In the case of the President, he has to \u2013 like Tom Brady did -- answer every snarky question at a press conference.\n\nWith reforms like these, Congress and the President might compromise on Free Community College. The GOP passes all the necessary funding bills. But the GOP gets to pick all the community college professors \u2013 who will be Ayn Rand disciples, Tea party organizers and Cleveland police officers.\n\nCongress and the President might compromise on childcare, too. The 188 Democrats in the House of Representatives don\u2019t have much to do at the moment. Drop your kids off at their congressional district offices.\n\nThere\u2019s even room for compromise on abortion. Don\u2019t make abortion legal. Don\u2019t make abortion illegal. Make it retroactive. Kid gets to be 18 and he\u2019s still a bum... whack.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "PJORourke"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201502011145, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Imagine an America where the White House and Congress got along \u2014 and all the terrible things they would do to us.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "The Horror of Bipartisan Consensus", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"The Horror of Bipartisan Consensus\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/01/the-horror-of-bipartisan-consensus.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/01/the-horror-of-bipartisan-consensus/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47426370.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/01/the-horror-of-bipartisan-consensus\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-01T11:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"P.
