A Dublin City, Georgia teacher caused a community-wide scandal when she allegedly questioned President Barack Obama’s Christianity, as well as the Christianity of anyone who supported him in front of her class. The incident, which reportedly occurred last February, was brought before a school board meeting in late March.

The teacher, identified by an NBC affiliate as Nancy Perry, said that “what has been reported is “untrue.”

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Adam Carlson reports:

In a letter to the Courier Herald following that meeting, the local chapter of the NAACP called on the board to investigate. By that point, Ledbetter said an investigation and corrective steps were already in motion, but that he appreciated the parent’s desire to present to the board. In its letter the NAACP also alleges that, in a parent-teacher conference soon after the comments were made, the teacher “presented to the parents a packet of several pages from a website that expressed her views on religion and politics” instead of adequately addressing their concerns.
