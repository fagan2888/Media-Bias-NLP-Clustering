One of the latest victims is the site archive.org, which hosts the \u201cWayback Machine.\u201d\n\nA valuable tool for journalists and researchers, the Wayback Machine is an archive of websites that preserves them as they looked on various days in their history. Among its many functions is making it difficult for governments, businesses and other entities to retroactively remove content, change data or otherwise falsify the past.\n\nRelated: In Showing Off Political Strength, Putin tries to Hide Political Weakness\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that the Roskomnadzor, Russia\u2019s de facto media censor, has blocked archive.org. Earlier this summer, the site was reportedly blocked because it archived a page that contained \u201cextremist\u201d materials. This time around, it\u2019s supposedly being blocked because it archived some videos related to a Syrian Islamist movement.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to know exactly why the site was blocked. Archive.org\u2019s store of Web page data runs to more than 400 billion pages. The odds that some of them are offensive, appalling or just generally awful is overwhelming, and picking one out of that enormous collection and using it to justify completely blocking the site seems disingenuous at best.\n\nThe Vladimir Putin-led Russian government likely has many reasons to object to content on the Wayback Machine that has little to do with protecting Russian citizens from extremist videos. For example, last week archive.org was one of the only sites that had a record of a news story that appeared on \u2013 then partially disappeared from \u2013 a Russian business website.\n\nThe piece appeared to document the extent of Russian casualties in the ongoing war in Ukraine, which the Kremlin insists Russia has no part in. The truth of the report has been questioned by both Russian and non-Russian sources, but the blocking of archive.org makes it a whole lot harder for Russian citizens to find evidence of an article challenging the government\u2019s honesty.\n\nRelated: As Putin Surfaces, Russia\u2019s Ruble Takes a Dive\n\nThe news that archive.org had been blocked comes as the Kremlin and major Internet firms, particularly social media sites, are struggling to come to agreement on how to deal with a law that has just taken effect in Russia.\n\nIt requires Internet firms with Russian users to store any personal information about them in servers that sit on Russian soil. The ostensible reason for the requirement is to protect Russian citizens from privacy invasions by foreign (read: U.S.) intelligence services. And in the years that have followed former CIA contractor Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the extent of the U.S. surveillance state, concern about data protection can be easily justified.\n\nHowever, given the Russian government\u2019s ongoing efforts to crack down on interactions between its citizens and groups representing international non-governmental organizations and civil society groups, there is understandable concern that the actual intention of the Putin government is not to protect Russian citizens but to control them by limiting their access to information and identifying individuals who might challenge the Putin regime.\n\nThere is also considerable symbolism in the Putin regime denying its citizens access to a record of the past, since the practice has a long and sordid history in Moscow.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s government has blocked Russian Internet users from accessing a popular archive of web pages, a move freighted with symbolism in Russia because of the long and sordid history of trying to alter the records of the past.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Censorship Regime Now Reaches into the Past", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/02/Putin-s-Censorship-Regime-Now-Reaches-Past", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T121806Z_2_CBRE8BJ0U9X00_RTROPTP_2_RUSSIA-PUTIN.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/02/Putin-s-Censorship-Regime-Now-Reaches-Past", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/wpid-2012-12-20T121806Z_2_CBRE8BJ0U9X00_RTROPTP_2_RUSSIA-PUTIN.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Vladimir Putin\u2019s government has blocked Russian Internet users from accessing a popular archive of web pages, a move freighted with symbolism in Russia because of the long and sordid history of trying to alter the records of the past.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe24a5\"", "article_summary": "The ostensible reason for the requirement is to protect Russian citizens from privacy invasions by foreign (read: U.S.) intelligence services.\nRelated: In Showing Off Political Strength, Putin tries to Hide Political WeaknessIt\u2019s not the first time that the Roskomnadzor, Russia\u2019s de facto media censor, has blocked archive.org.\nThere is also considerable symbolism in the Putin regime denying its citizens access to a record of the past, since the practice has a long and sordid history in Moscow.\nAmong its many functions is making it difficult for governments, businesses and other entities to retroactively remove content, change data or otherwise falsify the past.\nThe Vladimir Putin-led Russian government likely has many reasons to object to content on the Wayback Machine that has little to do with protecting Russian citizens from extremist videos."}
