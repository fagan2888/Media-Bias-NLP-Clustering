But as the new Colorado State coach, all Bobo needs to do is whip CU, fill a new $220 million stadium and land the football program an invitation to a power five conference.\n\nNo problem. No pressure. Right?\n\nColorado State president Tony Frank has pushed all his chips to the middle of the table with a commitment to build an on-campus stadium scheduled to open in 2017.\n\nFor the Rams, is it admission to a power five conference or bust?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that,\u201d Frank told me. But after a long exhale to contemplate the challenge facing CSU football, he revealed his plan: The Rams must emulate Boise State\u2019s on-field success and then gamble the college football playoff will expand from four teams to eight sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cI tend to believe there are a few slots outside those big five conferences, where you follow the Boise State model and you can say: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re competitive. We\u2019re knocking on the window, winning eight or nine games a year. Remember us out here.\u2019 We\u2019ll scrap with a big-flash program whenever we get a chance,\u201d Frank said.\n\n\u201cI think it will be real interesting to see what happens in the college football playoff. The odds that it stays at four teams? I just don\u2019t see it. So, with eight teams in the playoff, you go with the five conference champions, the best of the rest and then you\u2019ve got two at-large spots.\u201d\n\nThe dream the Rams are chasing is to become Cinderella in green and gold. Be the best of the rest in major-college football. Explaining why CSU ultimately decided to give thumbs-up to a stadium that faced heated opposition within Fort Collins, Frank joked, \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t see an exit ramp when you\u2019d like to.\u201d\n\nIt is now Bobo\u2019s job to justify the controversial stadium decision. His background as a slow, undersized quarterback for Georgia from 1994-97, however, indicates Bobo is unafraid to deliver under pressure.\n\n\u201cEverybody always told me: \u2018Hey, Mike Bobo, you\u2019re tough. You stand in there as a quarterback.\u2019 Well, No. 1, I couldn\u2019t move, so I couldn\u2019t get away. I had to stand in there and take the lick,\u201d said Bobo, who threw for 38 touchdowns and more than 6,000 yards while leading the Bulldogs to a top-10 finish in the national polls as a senior.\n\nBut he couldn\u2019t beat Manning as a starting quarterback, losing to Tennessee by scores of 29-17 and 38-13.\n\n\u201cMy history against Peyton Manning was \u2026 oh-fer,\u201d Bobo said.\n\nAt his introductory news conference, Bobo stood in front of CSU boosters, and in a Southern drawl as sweet and syrupy as a Georgia peach, he declared, \u201cI am Colorado State.\u201d\n\nNow, if somebody could pour Bobo a frosty glass of 90 Shilling Ale and hand him a map, he might be able to find the Lory Student Center.\n\nA man who has spent 39 of the first 40 years of his life with feet firmly planted in the red Georgia clay looked CSU athletic boosters in the eye and declared, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t a dream job.\u201d Moments later, some irreverent knucklehead had to ask Bobo:\n\nSo when was the first time you visited Fort Collins?\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Bobo said.\n\nHe took the job sight unseen? That\u2019s nuts.\n\nThe Rams hired an offensive coordinator from the mighty Southeastern Conference and spared no expense, signing Bobo to a five-year, $7.75 million contract.\n\nHey, it worked with Jim McElwain.\n\nMcElwain coaxed 10 victories from the Colorado State football program for the first time since 2002, whipped CU and earned the Rams a well-deserved bowl bid. Then McElwain skedaddled out of town, paying $2 million for the steppingstone that took him to Florida.\n\nBut there\u2019s reason to think Bobo might be in this job for more than a minute. In a profession that attracts nomads always in search of the next championship ring, Bobo served as an assistant coach at the University of Georgia since 2001. Bobo does more than talk loyalty. He has lived it.\n\nThe main challenge for a Georgia native who admittedly knows almost nothing about CSU or the Rocky Mountain West except for what he has read? Now Bobo must convincingly sell what he doesn\u2019t know to a blue-chip recruit and his mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting comfortable with being uncomfortable,\u201d Bobo said.\n\nIf Bobo wants to immediately feel welcome and at home in Fort Fun, here are three simple words of advice: Beat the Buffs.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Mike Bobo\u2019s loyalty could mean great things for CSU", "title": "Kiszla: Mike Bobo\u2019s loyalty could mean great things for CSU", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/23/kiszla-mike-bobos-loyalty-could-mean-great-things-for-csu/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__mike-bobo-csu-presserp1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__mike-bobo-csu-presserp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-23T15:48:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:51:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f5f\"", "article_summary": "McElwain coaxed 10 victories from the Colorado State football program for the first time since 2002, whipped CU and earned the Rams a well-deserved bowl bid.\nHis background as a slow, undersized quarterback for Georgia from 1994-97, however, indicates Bobo is unafraid to deliver under pressure.\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 As a college quarterback, Mike Bobo couldn\u2019t beat Peyton Manning.\nThe main challenge for a Georgia native who admittedly knows almost nothing about CSU or the Rocky Mountain West except for what he has read?\nRemember us out here.\u2019 We\u2019ll scrap with a big-flash program whenever we get a chance,\u201d Frank said."}
