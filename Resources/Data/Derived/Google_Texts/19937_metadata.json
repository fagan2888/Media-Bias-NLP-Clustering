Whereas the rate was 4.8 percent of median revenue in 2013, the preliminary estimate for 2014 was 3.7 percent.\n\nAmong states that didn\u2019t expand eligibility, bad debt as a percentage of revenue declined at a more modest pace, according to Moody\u2019s.\n\n\u201cFollowing the first year of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, bad debt and charity care are trending downward for the first time in years, with a significantly larger drop in states that expanded Medicaid,\u201d the report states.\n\nMinnesota was an outlier, Steingart said, because bad debt at hospitals in the state was either flat or up slightly in 2014. But the absolute rate of bad debt at Minnesota hospitals remained significantly lower than in most other states, he added.\n\nA Star Tribune analysis of audited financials for 19 health systems operating in Minnesota showed a similar pattern.\n\nIn fiscal 2013, health systems here reported about $687 million in bad debt, which was about 2.5 percent of the health systems\u2019 combined revenue of $27.7 billion. For fiscal 2014, the Star Tribune analysis found bad debt grew to $766 million, a larger tally that grew faster than overall revenue. Some of the systems operate on the \u00adcalendar year, and some end fiscal years on June 30.\n\nPreliminary figures from the Minnesota Hospital Association show a roughly 3.2 percent increase in bad debt for state hospitals last year, as well as a nearly 10 percent decline in charity care. The net effect is that uncompensated care costs held roughly steady last year, according to the hospital association.\n\nMinnesota is different for several reasons.\n\nThe state did a partial expansion of Medicaid under the federal health law back in 2011, said Matt Anderson of the Minnesota Hospital Association, so the 2014 impact was less dramatic. Plus, many people who gained coverage through the health law in Minnesota previously were covered by state public health insurance programs, Anderson said, so the effect on bad debt totals was muted.\n\nFinally, high rates of employer-sponsored coverage means the state for decades has had a very low rate of people lacking coverage, and therefore low bad debt totals.\n\n\u201cWe were not anticipating as significant of a decrease in uncompensated care,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWe had a very low uninsured rate to begin with.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changing is that a greater share of hospital bad debt is coming from unpaid bills among people who have health insurance, Anderson said. Outside of Medicaid changes, coverage expansion driven by the health law has featured many people opting for commercial policies that have low premiums but high deductibles.\n\n\u201cYou used to have uncompensated care that the person was uninsured, and it was just a question of whether or not you knew that up front and called it charity care, or you didn\u2019t find out until after you billed them and you called it bad debt,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nIn the first year of major insurance reforms under the health law, Minnesota\u2019s uninsured rate fell from about 8 percent to roughly 5 percent. The shift means a hospital\u2019s per-person risk of unpaid bills is more routinely limited by a deductible.\n\n\u201cYou may have a larger portion of the population that has a level of medical debt, or medical financial obligation,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cBut the raw dollar amount of their obligation may be lower.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "In other states, Medicaid expansion shrinks bad debt.", "title": "Unpaid hospital bills still growing in outlier Minnesota", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/unpaid-hospital-bills-still-growing-in-minnesota/306704981/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "In other states, Medicaid expansion shrinks bad debt.", "title": "Unpaid hospital bills still growing in outlier Minnesota", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/unpaid-hospital-bills-still-growing-in-minnesota/306704981/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In other states, Medicaid expansion shrinks bad debt."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca88e\"", "article_summary": "But the absolute rate of bad debt at Minnesota hospitals remained significantly lower than in most other states, he added.\nMinnesota was an outlier, Steingart said, because bad debt at hospitals in the state was either flat or up slightly in 2014.\nA Star Tribune analysis of audited financials for 19 health systems operating in Minnesota showed a similar pattern.\nIn fiscal 2013, health systems here reported about $687 million in bad debt, which was about 2.5 percent of the health systems\u2019 combined revenue of $27.7 billion.\n\u201cWe were not anticipating as significant of a decrease in uncompensated care,\u201d Anderson said."}
