We should expect that from every single elected official.\u201d\n\nAnd telling the truth as he sees it from a consistently conservative point of view, sometimes loudly and always clearly, is precisely what Sen. Ted Cruz has done since arriving in Washington in 2012, in the first wave of a new generation of conservative leaders he calls the \u201cchildren of Reagan.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Time for Truth\u201d traces his life and career from Texas high-school debater, through Princeton and Harvard Law School, to a Supreme Court clerkship. He played a key role in settling the 2000 Florida recount in George W. Bush\u2019s favor, served as solicitor general of Texas, and won his Senate seat with a remarkable grass-roots campaign that now provides a model for his run for the presidency.\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Cruz claims a potential constituency made up of conservatives of all stripes \u2014 evangelical Christians, with whom his father has close ties; family values voters (his energetic and attractive wife plays a central role in the campaign, as she did in his Senate race, and as do his photogenic children); traditional Republicans, anti-big government voters and small business people; and disillusioned Democrats and working people, many of them union members.\n\nIt\u2019s Sen. Cruz\u2019s intention to remobilize these voters, in much the way Richard Nixon gave voice to the silent majority in 1972 and Ronald Reagan would later make it roar. \u201cThe only way to win in 2016 is to bring back the conservatives who are staying home,\u201d Mr. Cruz writes. \u201cWe must reassemble the Reagan coalition.\u201d\n\nOn the Democratic side, in a party increasingly dominated by the children of McGovern, and despite the endless talk about \u201cdiversity,\u201d the two major candidates are both aging white people, within striking distance of nursing home eligibility, one a socialist with an ideological playbook from the 1930s and no new ideas since, the other the co-designer of a failed foreign policy that through weakness and vacillation \u201cinvites more aggression and escalates the chances of military conflict.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the Republican field is remarkably diverse, including as it does an articulate woman, a black surgeon, and two Cuban Americans, both in their 40s, and both with the best chances of winning the nomination \u2014 that is, if and when, as the pundits and politicos have been predicting weekly for months, Donald Trump finally fades away.\n\nWhen Sen. Cruz ran for the Senate, he singled out \u201cbig-government Republican politicians,\u201d establishment Republicans who \u201clied to us over and over again by mouthing conservative platitudes that they don\u2019t really believe or would never fight for.\u201d\n\nThis is a recurring theme that has marked his tenure in the Senate and now provides a basic rationale for his presidential campaign: \u201cRepublicans win the White House whenever we nominate a candidate who runs as a strong, principled conservative . We lose whenever we nominate the \u2018more electable\u2019 candidate who runs as a mushy establishment moderate.\u201d\n\n(Interestingly, as the contest sharpens and the \u201cestablishment\u201d begins to make its hoped-for post-Trump choices, Sen. Rubio, identified at the time of the book\u2019s writing as \u201ca good friend,\u201d may be shifting into Mr. Cruz\u2019s \u201cestablishment moderate\u201d category.)\n\nBut no matter how the primaries play out, Mr. Cruz is in for the duration. And there\u2019s no doubt that he has thought through his conservative convictions, as demonstrated in this full and strongly written, if at times overly-detailed, recounting of his life, career and positions on the issues.\n\nHe\u2019s a formidable candidate. As anyone who follows the primary debates knows, Mr. Cruz has presence, with a theatric sense of timing and a remarkable ability to extemporize at just right moment. He is a master debater, with years of training, and a strong, convincing speaker and orator, whether assailing the ideological foundations of Obamacare or, during his Senate filibuster, reading from \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps most remarkable among his political strengths is his ability to smile and radiate good cheer, even as he throws rhetorical bombs. And that\u2019s no small gift.\n\n\u2022 John R. Coyne Jr., a former White House speechwriter, is co-author of \u201cStrictly Right: William F.
