(AP) \u2014 The Confederate flag has no place on South Carolina Statehouse grounds, and it\u2019s past time to remove the symbol of hatred, a Republican state lawmaker said Saturday, three days after the shooting massacre at a black church 100 miles away.\n\nRep. Doug Brannon, first elected in 2010, said he\u2019s thought for years that the flag should come down, but it wasn\u2019t until Wednesday\u2019s deaths of nine parishioners in Charleston that he decided he could do something about.\n\n\u201cI just didn\u2019t have the balls for five years to do it. But when my friend was assassinated for being nothing more than a black man, I decided it was time for that thing to be off the Statehouse grounds,\u201d Brannon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a symbol of hate, it\u2019s actually a symbol of pride in one\u2019s hatred.\u201d\n\nDylann Storm Roof, the 21-year-old jailed on nine murder charges for the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church, briefly escaped in a car bearing Confederate insignia and can be seen in photos on social media with the flag. The nine shooting victims included the church\u2019s beloved pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney.\n\nOn Saturday evening, a large crowd rallied outside the Statehouse against the flag\u2019s presence, calling it a symbol of hatred, not heritage.\n\nPolice wouldn\u2019t give an estimate for attendance, but there appeared to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people. They chanted \u201ctake it down\u201d and ended the rally by singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d The rally lasted more than an hour and had several speakers.\n\n\u201cWe must put that flag in its place as a part of history,\u201d said Sarah Leverette, a 95-year-old civil rights activist. Bringing it down, she added, means the Charleston victims did not die in vain.\n\nIn December, Brannon said, he will introduce a bill to move the flag and pole to the state\u2019s Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum. December is the first opportunity for bills to be pre-filed for the legislative session that resumes in January.\n\nBrannon said several Republican House members have called him and offered to co-sponsor the bill, but he told them not to. While he\u2019s certain a lot of Republicans will vote for his bill, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not willing to risk somebody else\u2019s political career.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "South Carolina legislator: Take down Confederate flag", "author": "Seanna Adcox", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "South Carolina legislator: Take down Confederate flag", "title": "South Carolina legislator: Take down Confederate flag", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/21/south_carolina_legislator_take_down_confederate_flag/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/charleston-shooting-confederate-flag.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Carolina legislator: Take down Confederate flag", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/charleston-shooting-confederate-flag.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "South Carolina legislator: Take down Confederate flag", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "South Carolina legislator: Take down Confederate flag", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In December, Brannon said, he will introduce a bill to move the flag and pole to the state\u2019s Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum.\nThe nine shooting victims included the church\u2019s beloved pastor, state Sen.
