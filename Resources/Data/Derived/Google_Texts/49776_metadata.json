According to the Foleys, they shared emails detailing ISIS demands for the release of their son with agents of our government.\n\nThe photographer\u2019s parents should not have done that. Since it is the policy of the U.S. not to negotiate with terrorists, the government said, the parents would be subject to prosecution and possible prison sentences if they were to accede to the ISIS demands.\n\nNever mind that President Obama conducted illegal, clandestine talks at roughly the same time, that culminated in the trade of five terrorist masters for an American enlisted man.\n\nBut the feds are butting in. It may be American policy, porous as it is, but the federal government has to stand law on its head to keep parents from working to save their son\u2019s life. Giving money to a terrorist group is contrary to the interests of the United States, but as many have pointed out, ISIS is already benefitting from American largesse in the form of American weapons. The ransom, compared to this huge transfer, is a drop in the bucket.\n\nSpeaking of liquids, ISIS is selling millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil on the black market daily. This low-priced oil cannot be traced; it may be filling Americans\u2019 gas tanks as we speak. At the very least, low-priced black market oil competes with legitimately-sourced oil, forcing down the price overall. Maybe, using this logic, we should be thanking ISIS rather than fighting them?\n\nBut back to our government\u2019s threats against the Foleys. John Foley voiced his frustration, based on his inability to help his son. \u201cI\u2019d rather be in a prison here, than have my son in a prison over there,\u201d he told Fox News host Greta Van Sustern. He never got that chance, though just what other threats he received aren\u2019t yet public.\n\nWhat kind of government twists its policies so far to intimidate its citizens, when it cannot protect its citizens by following those policies? And what kind of government throws its own policies out the window when it\u2019s politically expedient? Did the FBI threaten President Obama with prosecution if the president went contrary to policy? The president faced no action when he publicly and proudly broke the law. He faces no sanctions for trading U.S. assets without following explicit law that required him to inform Congress. Why is the president above the law, and why can he break laws, overtly and clearly, when citizens are threatened for maybe brushing up against an interpretation of the law?\n\nBecause, when we have a lawless president, no law applies to him. That is the very definition of a dictator.\n\nThe president disclosed our failed mission to the world because, a Pentagon spokesman said, \u201ccircumstances dictated that we do so.\u201d\n\nCertainly, no tactical circumstances dictated that disclosure. It was only the president\u2019s feeling that he needed to say we had tried to \u201cdo something.\u201d Now, we hear that ISIS has split up hostages among several groups, in different locations, further complicating any future rescue attempts.\n\nPolitics, as always with this administration, trumps the national interest and even the lives of Americans.\n\nSo, Obama is not just a political and personal narcissist. He\u2019s a dictator; worse, he\u2019s a stupid dictator. That\u2019s trouble for America, and it\u2019s proving fatal for Americans, from Border Patrol agents to photographers and journalists.\n\nWhen will the law apply to President Obama? Can we wait until January of 2017, or will the people put pressure on the House to impeach, and on the Senate to remove this criminal from office?\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "James Foley's parents wanted to raise his ransom, and were told by the government they would be subject to prosecution, prison if they acceded to ISIS demands.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Tim Kern", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "James Foley parents wanted to raise his ransom, and was told by the govt. they would be subject to prosecution, prison if they were to accede to the ISIS demands.", "title": "Obama bumbles James Foley: Fear the White House over ISIS", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/obama-bumbles-james-foley-fear-the-white-house-over-isis-25843/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/president-obama.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "James Foley's parents wanted to raise his ransom, and were told by the government they would be subject to prosecution, prison if they acceded to ISIS demands.", "title": "Obama bumbles James Foley: Fear the White House over ISIS", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/president-obama-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "president obama,isis,james foley,ransom,politics,democratic politics", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-13T19:12:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T19:12:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Democratic Politics, Isis, James Foley, politics, President Obama, ransom"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd53a\"", "article_summary": "Did the FBI threaten President Obama with prosecution if the president went contrary to policy?\nWhen will the law apply to President Obama?\nNever mind that President Obama conducted illegal, clandestine talks at roughly the same time, that culminated in the trade of five terrorist masters for an American enlisted man.\nAccording to the Foleys, they shared emails detailing ISIS demands for the release of their son with agents of our government.\nSpeaking of liquids, ISIS is selling millions of dollars\u2019 worth of oil on the black market daily."}
