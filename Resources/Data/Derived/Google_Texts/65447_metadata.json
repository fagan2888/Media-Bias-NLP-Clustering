On Sunday, he disavowed his highly controversial proposal to replace Obamacare and Medicare with health savings accounts to cover the lion\u2019s share of Americans\u2019 annual health care needs.\n\nRelated: Trump Knocks Carson as a Seventh Day Adventist as Iowa Polls Shift\n\nAs recently as May, Carson was singing the praises of his plan in an interview with John Harwood of CNBC. Asked whether he thought that his proposal was politically feasible given the popularity of Medicare health coverage for seniors, Carson replied: \u201cWhen people are able to see how much more freedom they will have, and how much more flexibility they will have, and how much more choice they would have, I think it's going to be a no-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reason that I've come up with the health savings account system, utilizing the same monies that we use to pay for health now, [it] provides a very different paradigm,\u201d Carson added.\n\nBut when Chris Wallace of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d asked Carson over the weekend to defend his plan for supplanting Medicare, Carson responded as if Wallace hadn\u2019t received the memo: \u201cNo, that\u2019s completely false. And that\u2019s a narrative that somebody\u2019s putting out there to scare people.\u201d\n\nWhen Wallace pressed him on his previous statements that sounded suspiciously like a plan to replace Medicare with personalized health savings accounts financed with federal contributions, Carson replied: \u201cNo, that \u2013 that\u2019s the old plan. That\u2019s been gone for several months now.\u201d\n\nRelated: Carson steals lead from Trump in key state of Iowa: survey\n\nCarson told Wallace that the savings accounts would be an \"alternative\" to the popular Medicare program.\n\nCarson has been promoting his health care funding scheme for more than two years and has spurred interest among conservative audiences even as he has baffled experts on precisely how it would work and how it would be funded. While federal tax law currently encourages employees to supplement their health care coverage by contributing pre-tax dollars to health savings accounts, the idea of using health savings accounts in place of health insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act or Medicare coverage for seniors seems far-fetched at best.\n\nCarson\u2019s campaign website offers only the sketchiest description of his proposal. But as he has said in the past, \u201cWhen a person is born, give him a birth certificate, an electronic medical record, and a health-savings account to which money can be contributed \u2013 pretax\u2014from the time you\u2019re born till the time you die. If you die, you can pass it on to your family members.\u201d\n\nUnder this approach, the federal government would contribute a minimum of $2,000 to each individual\u2019s tax-free account on an annual basis. About a third of those funds would go for purchasing insurance to cover severe medical incidents.\n\nRelated: The Media Finally Wakes Up to the Ben Carson Phenomenon\n\nWealthier individuals and employers could contribute additional pre-tax funds to the accounts if they choose, and money left over could be shared among family members. His main argument was that his plan would eliminate the government \u201cmiddleman\u201d \u2013 Medicare and Medicaid -- and give individuals far more control over their health care spending. In the process, he argues, it would help to bring down the overall cost of the U.S. health system by encouraging Americans to find the least expensive coverage.\n\nAt one point last year, Carson estimated that his plan would cost the federal government $630 billion a year to provide a $2,000 contribution to an estimated 315 million Americans. He said in an April 2014 video that the total is \u201cnot a whole lot compared to what we\u2019re spending now, and everybody would have healthcare.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Politico reported recently, Carson\u2019s estimate doesn\u2019t take into account growth in population, inflation and administrative costs. Nor does that total cover a continuation of Medicare and Medicaid-style government programs \u2013 as he described them -- to cover the treatment of an estimated five percent of patients \u201cwith complex pre-existing or acquired maladies.\u201d\n\nWith so many years of experience as a nationally renowned surgeon and health care expert, you would think Carson would know better. But even under the best of circumstances \u2013 with savings compounding for younger Americans with few health problems -- Carson\u2019s medical savings accounts would barely begin to cover the overall health care costs of individuals. The government estimates that U.S. per capita spending for health care costs more than $9,000 a year, while the figure exceeds $11,000 a year for elderly patients.\n\nRelated: GOP Presidential Campaign Rapidly Turning into a Two-Man Race\n\nCarson's call for replacing Medicare for many Americans runs counter to the GOP national platform and is highly risky in Iowa, where polls show he currently draws a quarter of the senior vote, or more than twice as many as any other GOP candidate except Donald Trump, according to Politico. Trump said over the weekend that he was \u201cokay\u201d with medical savings accounts, but he has said before that he doesn\u2019t favor tampering with Medicare or Social Security, two of the most politically sensitive programs.\n\nDuring his appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Carson bobbed and weaved in attempting to recast his medical savings account plan as one that empowers average Americans while still allowing them to remain with Medicare or Obamacare if they choose.\n\n\u201cWhat the program that I have outlined using health savings accounts starting from the time you are born until the time you die, largely eliminates the need for people to be dependent on government programs like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I would never get rid of the programs. I would provide people with an alternative.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ben Carson has long prided himself as a political outsider who delivers unvarnished tr", "title": "Abolish Medicare?
