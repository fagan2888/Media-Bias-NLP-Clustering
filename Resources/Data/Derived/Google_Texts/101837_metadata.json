The subtle jab resulted in an interesting reaction from CNN anchor Carol Costello that has several media outlets speculating.\n\nThe White House has set up an online voting website where Americans can vote on which turkey, Caramel or Popcorn, will be pardoned this Thanksgiving.\n\n\u201cThe people will decide whether Popcorn or Caramel gets the glory this year,\u201d Moos narrated. \u201cAt least this government website is working. It\u2019s no turkey.\u201d\n\nAt hearing the joke, Costello let out a loud sigh and responded with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that bolstered your argument, Jeanne, but hey, Happy Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nOf course, no one can know for sure if she took offense to the Obamacare joke or if was simply unamused by the somewhat cheesy pun.\n\nAs Mediaite\u2019s Tommy Christopher puts it, \u201cCostello\u2019s reaction is interesting in that it can act as a sort of Rorschach test for CNN viewers, who can decide whether she was taking offense at a gratuitous shot at Obamacare, or making a comment on the trivialization of such a serious issue, or simply making an affectionate nod to the joke\u2019s cheese factor.\u201d\n\nWatch the segment via CNN below:\n\nDo you think people are reading too much into the sigh?\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 1, "twitter": {"description": "During a light-hearted Thanksgiving segment on the annual White House tradition of pardoning a turkey, correspondent Jeanne Moos concluded with a harmless joke aimed at the horrendous Obamacare website.
