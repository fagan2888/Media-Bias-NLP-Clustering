Bill Haslam\u2019s proposal to expand Medicaid in Tennessee under Obamacare, known as Insure Tennessee, effectively killing it.\n\nBut throughout the debate THA officials made claims about their finances, which may not measure up when weighed against several Internal Revenue Service documents.\n\nTennessee Watchdog\u2019s review of IRS statements from several THA-affiliated hospitals\u2019 reveal some of their top officials made rather generous salaries, well over the reported national average, at least as recently as 2013.\n\nThose IRS statements are available on the Economic Research Institute\u2019s website.\n\nTHA officials did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nAs reported, if the plan had gone through hospitals would have covered the state\u2019s share of rising Medicaid costs through a provider tax, meaning hospitals would have received their tax dollars back in the form of additional Medicaid spending.\n\nBut, President Craig Becker said on the organization\u2019s website, extending health-care coverage would have led to a smaller amount of unreimbursed care.\n\nIn Memphis, now former Baptist Memorial Hospital CEO Stephen Reynolds made $2.5 million in 2012, a $1 million increase over what he made in 2007, according to IRS 990 statements\n\nIn Knoxville, Fort Sanders Regional Hospital CEO Anthony L. Spezia made $1.5 million in 2012.\n\nThe national average salary for a hospital CEO is $386,000, according to a New York Times story last year.\n\nMemorial Health Care CEO James Hobson, meanwhile, made $644,738 in 2012 in Chattanooga, according to IRS statements.\n\nBaptist Memorial spokeswoman Ayoka Pond said Reynolds presided over an organization that included 15 hospitals, not just one.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to say that the THA\u2019s support on Insure Tennessee has anything to do with the CEO\u2019s salary, then I\u2019d say that\u2019s incorrect,\u201d Pond said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe information you are looking at is two years old.\u201d\n\nCorporate welfare\n\nLindsay Boyd, policy director of the free market think tank Beacon Center of Tennessee, which opposes Medicaid expansion, called the situation with the THA \u201ccorporate welfare at its worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe take no issue with upper management of private organizations paying their members according to what they believe is proper and what might be in line with their performance,\u201d Boyd said Wednesday morning, before the bill was killed.\n\n\u201cWhat we take issue with is that the same organization misrepresented their finances to the state of Tennessee, calling for an expansion of an entitlement program to help them supposedly keep their doors open and to supposedly address razor thin margins that, if anything, don\u2019t actually exist.\u201d\n\nTaxpayers, Boyd said, have no business bailing out hospitals that officials claim are financially troubled yet still pay their CEOs higher-than-average salaries.\n\n\u201cAll of these instances suggest they are in a much different circumstance than they are representing, more concerned about corporate welfare than patient welfare,\u201d Boyd said.\n\nErlanger Health System, a THA-affiliated hospital, received $19 million in federal money, the Chattanooga Times Free Press said last year.\n\nErlanger officials, while still warning of a financial crisis, then awarded their top management officials with huge bonuses \u2014 while freezing other employees\u2019 vacation time.\n\nErlanger officials did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nThe same IRS statements show the CEO for the THA-affiliated Mountain States Health Alliance, based in Johnson City, made $3.1 million in 2012.\n\nFive years earlier, that same CEO, Dennis Vonderfech, who\u2019s in the same position, made significantly less \u2014 $774,697.\n\nAccording to its website, MSHA oversees 12 different hospitals.\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org\n\nFollow Tennessee Watchdog and receive regular updates through Facebook and Twitter\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
