All they say is they can\u2019t. They can\u2019t defund planned parenthood, they can\u2019t stop amnesty, they can\u2019t stop obamacare, they can\u2019t stop this bad Iran deal.\n\nHe added that it\u2019s both that Congressional Republicans can\u2019t and won\u2019t do the aforementioned agenda items, and \u201cthey need a back bone transplant. I mean, I don\u2019t like what [Representative Nancy] Pelosi (D-CA) and [Senator Harry] Reid (D-NV) are doing to our country, but at least they fight for their principles. I\u2019m proud of this lawsuit [against his defunding of Planned Parenthood], quite frankly. Look, the Obama attorneys might as well get comfortable in Baton Rouge, we\u2019re not backing down from this fight. We\u2019re going to fight to protect innocent human life. Look, I know there are a lot of Republicans in DC that like to talk, it\u2019s time for them to act, including a lot of these Republicans running for president. A lot of the senators, whether it\u2019s Cruz, or Rubio, Graham, or Paul. We need folks to actually act on the front lines. I hope every governor will defund Planned Parenthood. They can\u2019t sue us all. They can\u2019t come after us all.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jindal: Cruz, Rubio, Graham, and Rand Need to 'Act,' Every Governor Should Defund PP", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Jindal: Cruz, Rubio, Graham, and Rand Need to 'Act,' Every Governor Should Defund PP", "title": "Jindal: Cruz, Rubio, Graham, and Rand Need to 'Act,' Every Governor Should Defund PP - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Jindal-1019-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/19/jindal-cruz-rubio-graham-and-rand-need-to-act-every-governor-should-defund-pp/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jindal: Cruz, Rubio, Graham, and Rand Need to 'Act,' Every Governor Should Defund PP", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Jindal-1019-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Jindal: Cruz, Rubio, Graham, and Rand Need to 'Act,' Every Governor Should Defund PP - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bobby Jindal, Planned Parenthood,2016 Presidential Race, Abortion, Breitbart TV,Jindal", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Planned Parenthood", "published_time": "2015-10-19T21:07:33-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Abortion"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0c1\"", "article_summary": "They can\u2019t defund planned parenthood, they can\u2019t stop amnesty, they can\u2019t stop obamacare, they can\u2019t stop this bad Iran deal.\nHe added that it\u2019s both that Congressional Republicans can\u2019t and won\u2019t do the aforementioned agenda items, and \u201cthey need a back bone transplant.\nI hope every governor will defund Planned Parenthood.\nI\u2019m proud of this lawsuit [against his defunding of Planned Parenthood], quite frankly.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERJindal said, \u201cThe Republicans in d.c. have become the surrender caucus."}
