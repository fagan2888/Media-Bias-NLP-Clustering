For the magician referenced by Colin Firth\u2019s \u201cStanley Crawford\u201d is not Harry Houdini\u2014or, not Houdini only\u2014but (also) Chung Ling Soo, n\u00e9e Billy Robinson. And Robinson is far more interesting than this representation of him, especially on the subject of spiritualism.\n\nBy way of review: In Magic in the Moonlight, Stanley Crawford accepts a challenge to expose the presumably fraudulent, gold-digging machinations of psychic medium \u201cSophie Baker\u201d (played by Emma Stone). In time, Sophie\u2019s psychic powers have Stanley second-guessing his secularist assumptions, and\u2014after much miscommunication and many allusions to the erotics of exposure\u2014the (seemingly) cynical Stanley and the (seemingly) credulous Sophie meet somewhere in the middle.\n\nBy minute 90, the audience has been transitioned too, through Allen\u2019s own sleights of script, from Stanley\u2019s once-strict Nietzscheanism (\u201cI think Nietzsche has disposed of the God matter rather convincingly\u201d) to Sophie\u2019s less nihilistic take (\u201cwe need our illusions to live\u201d).\n\nAll of this makes for dramatic (if predictable) storytelling, cinematic synthesis and the like. And historians of stage magic, spiritualism, and Nietzsche will find much to applaud and critique here. But I\u2019d like to focus briefly on the life of Billy Robinson and how it points to the ambiguities inherent in most professional magic careers of the time. To wit: there are very few \u201cpure types\u201d of the sort represented by Stanley. Even the most vociferously anti-spiritualist magicians encouraged with one hand what they squashed with the other.\n\nBorn to an Irish-American family in New York in 1861, Robinson came to prominence as a Chinese magician in London around the turn of the century where, in 1905, he waged stage-war with\u2014and won the title \u201cThe Original Chinese Conjurer\u201d from\u2014Ching Ling Foo, the native Chinese magician from whom Robinson had actually stolen his Chung Ling Soo act.\n\nIn 1898, before leaving the U.S., Robinson had published, under his own name, an anti-spiritualist expos\u00e9, the material for which he had gathered during an earlier stint working at a spiritualist parlor in Chicago, and through continued communication with ex-colleagues there. Robinson died in 1918 after a rigged gun fired a real bullet during the Chung Ling Soo trick \u201cCondemned to Death by the Boxers.\u201d\n\nLegend has it that, upon being shot, Robinson cried out in English, thus shattering the longstanding impression that Chung Ling Soo was, in fact, Chinese (though contemporary reports belie that notion).*\n\nIt\u2019s all rather fascinating: from the Chicago spookhouse to the Yellowface act to the fights over, and oversights of, \u201cauthenticity.\u201d Not least is the fact of Robinson\u2019s flip-flopping career as a sometime spiritualist sometime anti-spiritualist.\n\nThat magicians and spiritualists did battle is no surprise. Their turf-wars over the meaning, mechanics, and professional locus of \u201cphenomena\u201d are the stuff of familiar history: on the big screen, on TV, on the stage, in the academy, in court, and otherwise. Moreover we know that some anti-spiritualist magicians cut their teeth\u2014or paid their bills\u2014early in their careers as physical mediums. (Houdini is among these, and his so-called \u201credemption\u201d has been narrated in terms of guilt, morality, undercover research, and/or American acculturation.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Billy Robinson, the grifter-magician who inspired \"Wei Ling Soo,\" deserves a better movie than this tepid rom-com", "author": "David Walker", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Billy Robinson, the grifter-magician who inspired \"Wei Ling Soo,\" deserves a better movie than this tepid rom-com", "title": "The real (and more interesting) story behind Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cMagic in the Moonlight\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/27/the_real_and_more_interesting_story_behind_woody_allens_magic_in_the_moonlight_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/MV5BMTQzNjM5Njk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ1MzIxMjE@._V1__SX1249_SY643_.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Billy Robinson, the grifter-magician who inspired \"Wei Ling Soo,\" deserves a better movie than this tepid rom-com", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/MV5BMTQzNjM5Njk0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ1MzIxMjE@._V1__SX1249_SY643_.jpg", "title": "The real (and more interesting) story behind Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cMagic in the Moonlight\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The real (and more interesting) story behind Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cMagic in the Moonlight\u201d", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Chung Ling Soo, Magic, Magic in the Moonlight, Religion Dispatches, Woody Allen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa30\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Chung Ling Soo, Magic, Magic in the Moonlight, Religion Dispatches, Woody Allen, Entertainment NewsThis article originally appeared on Religion DispatchesIt struck me, when reading Brook Wilensky-Lanford\u2019s review of Magic in the Moonlight\u2014in which she notes that Woody Allen\u2019s film is \u201cbased on a story that\u2019s almost too good to be true\u201d\u2014that attention to Allen\u2019s true historical referents only complicates things for the better.\nMoreover we know that some anti-spiritualist magicians cut their teeth\u2014or paid their bills\u2014early in their careers as physical mediums.\nEven the most vociferously anti-spiritualist magicians encouraged with one hand what they squashed with the other.\nFor the magician referenced by Colin Firth\u2019s \u201cStanley Crawford\u201d is not Harry Houdini\u2014or, not Houdini only\u2014but (also) Chung Ling Soo, n\u00e9e Billy Robinson.\nAnd Robinson is far more interesting than this representation of him, especially on the subject of spiritualism."}
