Twice the Supreme Court has upheld it. Yet here we are still being told about this wonderful replacement that has never materialized. No details what-so-ever to be able to compare the opposition\u2019s proposal to the current policy. No efforts in the past six years to improve, modify, alter or otherwise make the ACA more effective. Just opposition and empty rhetoric about some elusive plan.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Jim Lee: \u201cBilly throws a lot of numbers out in this piece but no supporting documentation as to the source of those numbers. He makes the statement \u2018This law is just getting started, and already plans are lacking affordability and quality.\u2019 Huh? Give me some examples, I haven\u2019t found this to be the case.\u201d\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation is the authority on the topic and provides a very different picture than Long\u2019s \u201cas many of us feared, government-run health care is an industry that benefits a few through overwhelming cost and treatment quality sacrifices of many.\u201d\n\nThey conclude: \u201cEven with these new requirements, most market fundamentals have stayed consistent with prior trends, suggesting that the implementation has not caused significant disruption for most market participants. Premiums for single and family coverage increased by 4 percent in 2015, continuing a fairly long period (2005 to 2015) where annual premium growth has averaged about 5 percent (http://kff.org/health-costs/).\n\nFurther, the National Restaurant Association, which represents the restaurant industry, were once strong opponents of Obamacare. Now their stance is to improve and make the ACA easier to work with rather than fight it.\n\nThey are simply being constructive.\n\nWhy can\u2019t Mr. Long and his colleagues in Congress?\n\nTim Straus is the Co-Founder & President of The Turover Straus Group, a Food Innovation and Product Development company headquartered in Springfield.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://sgfnow.co/1LcBGn1", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letter: Tim Straus presents opposing information to refute Billy Long\u2019s assertions on Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Springfield News-Leader", "description": "Letter: Tim Straus presents opposing information to refute Billy Long\u2019s assertions on Obamacare.", "title": "Letter: Facts refute Long\u2019s assertions on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.news-leader.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/10/04/letter-facts-refute-longs-assertions-obamacare/73350492/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-leader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letter: Tim Straus presents opposing information to refute Billy Long\u2019s assertions on Obamacare.", "title": "Letter: Facts refute Long\u2019s assertions on Obamacare", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9acce8fb3c56538a946644d8fb0f1aecb237b36e/c=0-204-1368-1572&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/04/Springfield/B9319106300Z.1_20151004184050_000_GOKC47J0J.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@springfieldNL", "site": "@springfieldNL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805766992", "fb": {"app_id": 164654783578465}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Representative Long\u2019s recent opinion (Sept. 30) regarding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is terribly misleading.\nFurther, the National Restaurant Association, which represents the restaurant industry, were once strong opponents of Obamacare.\nTim Straus is the Co-Founder & President of The Turover Straus Group, a Food Innovation and Product Development company headquartered in Springfield.\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it, please read the comments made on-line by News-Leader readers and real authorities on the subject.\nHe makes the statement \u2018This law is just getting started, and already plans are lacking affordability and quality.\u2019 Huh?"}
