She dreamed of becoming a nurse but worked in the corporate world until she was laid off in 2011. That's when she decided to pursue her passion. She graduated from East Tennessee State University with a degree in nursing and began working full-time on the orthopedic surgical floor, with the goal of moving to labor and delivery. However, a few months into the job, she was diagnosed with cancer and has spent most of the past two years in treatment. She recently began volunteering at a private nursing facility, where she eventually plans to work full-time. But, as Denny told Cosmopolitan.com, a conversation with an instructor in nursing school made her completely rethink her views on abortion.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nI was born and raised in this little town in Johnson City, Tennessee. I am an only child. My dad had a successful career as an attorney, and my mom was a homemaker. I remember saying, \"When I grow up, I want to be a secretary.\" And when I think of that now, I just cringe. My parents are very, very traditional in what they think of as gender roles. We were always compared to the Cleavers from Leave It to Beaver. We were a close-knit family, wholesome I guess. You go to Sunday school and church every week, and that's what you do here in the South. You don't have sex before you get married, homosexuality is wrong, abortion is murder, friends are good, God is great. That was normal. I didn't know I was sheltered. I never questioned it, because that was all I had really been exposed to. It took me moving four hours away when I first went to college to even know that there were people who even thought differently.\n\nMost Popular\n\nI believe it was Thanksgiving break of our freshman year of college [when my friend] told me she thought she was pregnant. We went to the store and got a pregnancy test, and she took it in the bathroom, and when it turned positive, she panicked. She didn't know what she was going to do. And I remember telling her how I would support her and she needed to have the baby and you can't abort this baby because it's a life. I was very, very, very pro-life at that point. When she finally told her parents a couple days later, it was not up for discussion. She would have an abortion.\n\nIn this area in the South, [having an abortion] doesn't say anything good [about the woman] \u2014 at least it didn't at that time. It was, \"Clearly she's a tramp. Clearly she makes poor choices.\" There is so much judgment. Even for people who don't have abortions, just unwed mothers. At the time, I felt that she was forced into it against her will and I thought that she maybe should've been stronger; if she wanted the baby, that she should've fought for that. And so we just stopped talking for a while.\n\nI had always wanted to be a nurse. I had worked toward that in high school but then went to college the first time around, didn't think I had to study, so I didn't pass the required science. So I picked an easier major, education. Went through, worked in corporate America, ended up getting a master's degree in organizational management in 2002. I worked in human resources and I was in operations management for 15 years, but the desire to help people and be involved in science and make a difference and help birth babies never left. In 2011, my job in corporate America was eliminated and I panicked. Three days later, I was enrolled in a certified nursing assistant course, found a job in the hospital the next month, and finished nursing school two years later. I graduated when I was 38.\n\nMy teacher's story in nursing school was really the very thing that made me realize that I needed to reevaluate my line in the sand. We had an assignment on biases that we would be encountering in nursing and one of the questions was: \"How would you treat somebody who had just had or contemplated abortion?\" and I was just full of myself and said, \"Oh, I would never be in that situation because I don't believe in it.\" That was very naive. [My teacher] put a note on my assignment to talk to her about her experience.\n\n[When] she was a new nurse herself, very pro-life, she was working at a pediatric in-patient psychiatric hospital and she had a 15-year-old girl who was admitted for suicidal ideation. [The patient] wanted to kill herself because her parents had gotten a court order to make her terminate her pregnancy, which blows my mind. My instructor said that this girl was stressed because not only had her parents gotten a court order, they also disowned her. They were not going to be there to support her through this. They just wanted their good name cleared before they tossed her out on the street. So everybody in this girl's life had abandoned her and they were taking her baby. My psych teacher was in the position of \"Do I go with my patient \u2014 who has to have a nurse with her to this procedure \u2014 and support her, or do I become one more adult in her life who turns their back, potentially triggering her actions on these suicidal thoughts?\" She made the decision. She said, \"I have to go support my patient.\" She rode with her in the ambulance, she sat at her bedside while they did the procedure, took her back to the facility, and nursed her for two days and got her through it.\n\nAnd the level of compassion that I saw in my nursing teacher's face as tears fell down her cheeks was, I don't know, it just drove home the point that you can never judge somebody for their circumstances because you don't know what got them there. Your only job as a nurse is to be supportive and to heal. You cannot judge, because it wasn't this girl's fault at all. If this girl had had her way, she wouldn't have had an abortion, but it was forced on her. And you know what? There are going be patients that do choose to have an abortion that still need you to be there for them, because abortion, it's never an easy decision, I don't think, but it's a legal one. It's absolutely a right that women have and you need to be prepared to give them the emotional support that they need.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/160x160/square-1458173574-prochoice.jpg", "description": "Carrie Denny was pro-life her entire life, until she became a nurse.", "title": "From Pro-Life to Pro Choice -- How Becoming a Nurse Changed My Views on Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "description": "\"Here in the South, it takes a lot of courage to say that you're pro-choice.\"", "title": "I Was Pro-Life Until I Became a Nurse", "url": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a55344/pro-life-abortion-nurse/", "image": {"url": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/1600x800/landscape-1458173574-prochoice.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/1600x800/landscape-1458173574-prochoice.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "image": {"src": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/1458173574-prochoice.jpg"}, "description": "\"Here in the South, it takes a lot of courage to say that you're pro-choice.\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "I Was Pro-Life Until I Became a Nurse"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-17T09:27:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "I Was Pro-Life Until I Became a Nurse", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951817550, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteCosmo&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "Politics, Carrie Denny, nursing,Obamacare,abortion,pro-life,pro-choice,anti-choice", "keywords": "carrie denny, nurse, nursing, midwife, Obamacare, OB/GYN, abortion, pro-life, pro-choice, anti-abortion, anti-choice, Republican, GOP, Tennessee,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "section": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-03-17 01:27:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-17 19:48:32"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/16/11/768x384/landscape-1458173574-prochoice.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "But, as Denny told Cosmopolitan.com, a conversation with an instructor in nursing school made her completely rethink her views on abortion.\nMy teacher's story in nursing school was really the very thing that made me realize that I needed to reevaluate my line in the sand.\nShe dreamed of becoming a nurse but worked in the corporate world until she was laid off in 2011.\nI didn't know I was sheltered.\nThree days later, I was enrolled in a certified nursing assistant course, found a job in the hospital the next month, and finished nursing school two years later."}
