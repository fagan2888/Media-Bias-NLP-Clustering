Park City Mountain Resort was served an eviction notice Aug. 28 demanding it get off the land and leave chair lifts and ski lodges behind.\n\nOn Friday, 3rd District Judge Ryan Harris ordered Park City Mountain Resort to turn over 22 confidential emails it traded with attorneys that could explain why or how the resort backdated a letter trying to renew the lease. Harris said he will review the emails first to determine which, if any, Vail and Talisker can use to press their case for eviction.\n\nThe dispute escalated last week when a former Vail Resorts\u2019 lawyer, acting for Talisker Land Holdings LLC, accused Park City Mountain Resort of backdating the letter to make it appear it had renewed its lease for 29 years.\n\nUnder that lease, Park City Mountain Resort pays just $155,000 a year for its ski terrain.\n\nCanyons officials have said they pay $3 million a year to lease much of their ski area from independent landowners. And Vail says it\u2019s paying $25 million a year for rights to operate Canyons, Utah\u2019s largest ski area. With that, Vail is taking up the fight against Park City Mountain Resort.\n\nVail said last week it wasn\u2019t trying to \u201ctake any action that would prevent PCMR\u2019s ability to operate their resort during the upcoming 2013-2014 ski season.\u201d\n\nVail chief Rob Katz told investors in May the possibility of taking over Park City Mountain Resort \u201ccould add significant value to our opportunity.\u201d The Colorado-based company is entering the Utah ski market for the first time.\n\nAn escalating lease dispute could damage Park City\u2019s economy, a major tourist hub, if it forces Park City Mountain Resort to shut down this winter or next, said Alan Sullivan, an attorney for the ski area\u2019s corporate entities.\n\nPark City has three ski areas, including independently owned Deer Valley. For Park City Mountain Resort, the dispute could depress season-pass sales.\n\nSullivan said a shutdown would undercut local business, depress condo rentals and furlough 1,200 employees. Park City Mountain Resort says it owns its base area, parking lots and water-rights for snowmaking outright, making it difficult for Vail to operate the resort on its own.\n\n\u201cWe think the court needs to understand the consequences of shutting down the resort,\u201d Sullivan said.\n\nThe case began in March 2012 when the parent company for Park City Mountain Resort sought a court declaration that it properly renewed the lease and can\u2019t be evicted.\n\nThe recent eviction notice was \u201cobviously intended to interfere with our business,\u201d said Jenni Smith, president and general manager of Park City Mountain Resort. Vail and Talisker have rejected \u201cour reasonable offers\u201d to settle the matter, she said Friday.\n\nVail Resorts operates 10 ski areas, including four in Colorado.\n\nPark City Mountain Resort is owned by Powdr Corp., which operates seven major U.S. ski areas, from Vermont\u2019s Killington to Oregon\u2019s Mt.
