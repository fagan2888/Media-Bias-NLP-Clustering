Bobby Jindal's overhaul of a public hospital system that serves the poor and uninsured while providing medical training to future doctors has a high-risk financial structure that could leave the state with significant financial liabilities within five years.\n\n\"The new safety net might not be financial feasible in the later years,\" according to a report on Louisiana's \"charity hospitals\" released Friday (Dec. 20) by the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana , a nonpartisan organization that reviews public policy.\n\nThe Jindal administration, touting the move as a way to save the state money while improving patient outcomes, last spring began turning operational responsibility of LSU's statewide network of public hospitals and clinics over to private providers. In addition to saying the state would net more than $100 million in savings in year one alone, administration officials have also said privatization will allow some hospitals and clinics to offer a wider variety of medical services while reducing wait times for appointments\n\n\"It looks to me that in the short-term, the [private hospital] partnerships are adequately financed.\" said Don Gregory, the former Louisiana Medicaid director who was the primary author of the report. \"But I would guess the storm clouds start to form in 2018. The state's real obligations won't be known until some time in the future.\"\n\nWhile the short-term outlook is positive, the long-term financial picture is less rosy, according to PAR's analysis. Should that prove to be the case, then financial challenges could lead to a decline in hospital services.\n\nThe federal government, beginning in 2015, will start to cut funding levels for hospitals to treat people with little or no insurance coverage. The Jindal administration is relying on this federal money to help pay private providers overseeing the old \"charity hospital\" services for the poor and uninsured.\n\nThe looming federal cuts could mean a loss of approximately $350 million to hospital providers from 2018 to 2020, money that the state will somehow have to make up, according to Gregory.\n\nFollowing passage of the Affordable Care Act, federal officials assumed most people would have comprehensive health insurance in a few years and that hospitals wouldn't have to so heavily rely on federal reimbursements for uninsured care.\n\nBut that assumption has been undercut by Jindal's refusal to accept the expansion of Medicaid in Louisiana. Consequently, it's likely that fewer Louisiana citizens will have access to government-run health insurance than the federal government initially envisioned.\n\nStill, this is a problem the state would have faced regardless of whether the state hospital system had been privatized. The old public system, run by LSU, relied on the same federal funding and would have faced the same cuts, said Jerry Phillips, undersecretary of the Department of Health and Hospitals.\n\nLouisiana, according to the report, is also unlikely to see the full bill for services from the private providers overseeing care of the poor until two or three years from now, when Jindal is out of office.\n\nMoreover, the state has agreed to reimburse its partners beyond the meager payment initially provided for Medicaid services, but these bills can take several years to settle. This means full cost of care that hospitals are currently providing to patients the state has to help cover won,'t be known for two or three years, said Gregory.\n\nWhen these bills are paid off, the private providers are likely to get a larger amount of reimbursement than LSU did when it ran the charity hospital system. The new partners are offering a wider range of services than LSU had been able to cover the past few years, he said.\n\nPhillips said the higher payments were anticipated, especially since the private providers are offering more services than the LSU system had been. The extra expense has already been built into the contracts and budgets for the private providers.\n\n\"It is something that was expected,\" he said, adding that the increases in services meant more benefits for the people being served.\n\nThe report did mention at least one area in which the privatization of hospitals has benefited the state financially. The arrangement has relieved the state of some expenses for facility renovations and new buildings.\n\nPAR also dinged the administration for the opaque process surrounding the hospital systems transition from private to public.\n\n\"Long-term, multi-million dollar decisions were made without a publicly competitive process and with evasions to hand over public documents,\" said the report, who reflected that the deal was conducted with an \"old-style Louisiana approach to government contracting and transparency.\"\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bobby jindal, br-frontpage, br-homepage, br-news, br-politics, health care, homepage, hospitals, news, politics", "title": "Jindal's hospital overhaul is financially risky in the long term, report says", "og": {"site_name": "NOLA.com", "description": "Gov.
