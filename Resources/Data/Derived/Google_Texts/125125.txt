First healthy eating, now healthy drinking. First lady Michelle Obama has teamed up with Hollywood star — and potato-chip promoter — Eva Longoria to push Americans to drink more water.

The pair is set to kick off the water-drinking push at a high school in the aptly named Watertown, Wisc., community on Thursday, The Hill reported. It’s the next step in Mrs. Obama’s “Let’s Move!” campaign to fight obesity rates around the nation and especially among America’s youth.

Ms. Longoria has been one of the Obamas’ loudest supporters. She spoke at the Democratic National Convention and urged liberals to donate generously to the president, during his re-election bid. As an interesting note — given the partnership with Mrs. Obama for the healthy eating initiative — Ms. Longoria has also done paid advertising spots to help sell Lay’s potato chips.

Just this past May, the actress lent her celebrity status to the chip company’s announcement of three finalists for a Lay’s contest to name a new flavor.

In a press release from Pepsico, the company that owns the chip brand, Ms. Longoria said: “As a cookbook author and restaurateur, I’ve come to really appreciate delicious and unique flavors — so it has been so fun to see the creative ideas fans submitted to the Lay’s ‘Do Us A Flavor’ contest. Simply put, America is going to love the three finalist flavors. I can’t wait to see which one they select as the winner.”
