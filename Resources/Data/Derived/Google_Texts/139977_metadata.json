Take public transit!\n\nWith the USA Pro Challenge cycling race rolling into town, a food festival on the 16th Street Mall, and the Colorado Rockies ending their three-game series against the Marlins, there will be street closures throughout the day, and parking will be more difficult than usual.\n\nThe Rockies game is scheduled for a 2:10 p.m. start, which is close to the time cyclists are expected to be rolling into Denver along Speer Boulevard.\n\nThe 16th Street Food Festival will be on the mall until 7 p.m.\n\nIt is the last leg of the race, with cyclists riding down Highway 93 from Boulder to end at Civic Center Park.\n\nMost closures in Denver will be from 2 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nBetween Sherman and Steele streets, 17th Avenue will be closed sometime between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. \u201cIt all depends on when the riders get in,\u201d Bob Wilson, Colorado Department of Transportation spokesman said.\n\nInterstate 25 off-ramps at Speer Boulevard will close at about 2:30 p.m., and so will Colfax Avenue from Glenarm Place to Sherman Street.\n\nNo parking is allowed along the route starting at 6 a.m. Sunday, and by 12:30 p.m. illegally parked vehicles had already been towed.\n\n\u201cOnce they get outside Boulder, it\u2019s a rolling closure, anytime you get behind the cyclists it will be slow going,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nRTD is encouraging people to take the bus and light rail.\n\nTom McGhee: 303-954-1671, tmcghee@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dpmcghee", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Cycling race, food festival, street closures will slow Denver traffic", "title": "Cycling race, food festival, street closures will slow Denver traffic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/24/cycling-race-food-festival-street-closures-will-slow-denver-traffic/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__pro-challenge-delaysp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140824__pro-challenge-delaysp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T13:01:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:11:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5ad0\"", "article_summary": "Interstate 25 off-ramps at Speer Boulevard will close at about 2:30 p.m., and so will Colfax Avenue from Glenarm Place to Sherman Street.\nIt is the last leg of the race, with cyclists riding down Highway 93 from Boulder to end at Civic Center Park.\nWith the USA Pro Challenge cycling race rolling into town, a food festival on the 16th Street Mall, and the Colorado Rockies ending their three-game series against the Marlins, there will be street closures throughout the day, and parking will be more difficult than usual.\nThe 16th Street Food Festival will be on the mall until 7 p.m.\n\u201cOnce they get outside Boulder, it\u2019s a rolling closure, anytime you get behind the cyclists it will be slow going,\u201d Wilson said."}
