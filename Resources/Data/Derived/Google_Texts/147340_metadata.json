After making up that deficit, the Blue Jackets found themselves trailing again with just under 11 minutes remaining.\n\n\n\nEarlier this season, Columbus might have quit. Much has changed since then.\n\n\n\nNick Foligno scored a power-play goal at 4:41 of overtime, Sergei Bobrovsky had 39 saves, and the Blue Jackets beat Washington 3-2 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory.\n\n\n\nWith Jason Chimera in the penalty box for interference, Foligno put a slap shot from the right circle past goalie Braden Holtby to give Columbus its only lead.\n\n\n\nIt was Foligno\u2019s second goal of the game and team-high 13th of the season. Kevin Connauton also scored for Columbus.\n\n\n\nThe Blue Jackets are still only 11-15-2, but coach Todd Richards has noticed a vast improvement in their play \u2014 and attitude \u2014 recently.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen things weren\u2019t going well for us, we didn\u2019t respond the right way,\u201d Richards said. \u201cSo a positive sign about tonight is that despite being down 1-0 and 2-1, the guys stuck with it. We got some saves when we needed it, but the guys stuck with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nWashington finished with a 41-23 advantage in shots, but Bobrovsky was the equalizer.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge when a goalie is playing that well. It gives us an opportunity to win hockey games,\u201d Connauton said. \u201cIt\u2019s motivating, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nBobrovsky kept the Capitals at bay until Foligno lined up the decisive goal in overtime.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fortunate to get a power play in OT and you want to make the most of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe play just kind of developed itself and I was able to get a good shot off.\u201d\n\n\n\nEric Fehr and Troy Brouwer had goals for the Capitals, whose three-game winning streak ended. Alex Ovechkin took nine shots on goal, but Bobrovsky snuffed every one.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of shots Ovie took, and those are goals most nights,\u201d coach Barry Trotz said. \u201cAgainst the best in the business, Bobrovsky, they weren\u2019t. He was pretty tight tonight.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter Brouwer deflected a shot by Matt Niskanen to put Washington up 2-1 at 9:20 of the third period, Columbus pulled even at 10:59 on a goal by Connauton.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the period, Holtby kept the game tied when he snapped his glove shut around a close-in shot by Cam Atkinson.\n\n\n\nThe score was knotted at 1 in the second when Blue Jackets defenseman James Wisniewski was called for slashing and roughing after using his stick to floor Washington\u2019s Tom Wilson in front of the Columbus net.\n\n\n\nGiven four minutes with the extra man, the NHL\u2019s second-ranked, power-play unit took seven shots on goal but couldn\u2019t break the deadlock.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were in the zone for over two minutes before a whistle went,\u201d Brouwer said. \u201cI think our execution was good. Bobrovsky was just playing really well.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Capitals outshot Columbus 28-10 over the first two periods, but at that point each team scored only once.\n\n\n\nWashington went up 1-0 when Fehr deflected a shot by John Carlson past Bobrovsky for a power-play goal at 3:19 of the first period. It was the fourth straight game in which the Capitals scored in the opening four minutes, and the first time in five games Columbus failed to strike first.\n\n\n\nThe Blue Jackets managed only one shot over the first 15 minutes, but their third \u2014 a wrist shot by Foligno at 15:36 \u2014 found the back of the net.\n\n\n\nWashington went 14 minutes without a shot before Ovechkin tapped a weak attempt toward Bobrovsky at 9:17 of the second period.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Foligno scored his second goal of the night at 4:41 of overtime, Sergei Bobrovsky had 39 saves, and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Washington Capitals 3-2 on Thursday for their fifth consecutive victory.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Foligno scored his second goal of the night at 4:41 of overtime, Sergei Bobrovsky had 39 saves, and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Washington Capitals 3-2 on Thursday for their fifth consecutive victory.", "title": "Nick Foligno\u2019s overtime power play goal leads Blue Jackets over Capitals", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/11/blue-jackets-beat-capitals-3-2-in-overtime/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/c28f783ab91ff830670f6a706700992b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/11/c28f783ab91ff830670f6a706700992b.jpg", "description": "Foligno scored his second goal of the night at 4:41 of overtime, Sergei Bobrovsky had 39 saves, and the Columbus Blue Jackets beat the Washington Capitals 3-2 on Thursday for their fifth consecutive v", "card": "summary", "title": "Nick Foligno\u2019s overtime power play goal leads Blue Jackets over"}, "Author": "David Ginsburg", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sergei Bobrovsky, Columbus, Washington, Washington Capitals"}, "article_summary": "The Blue Jackets are still only 11-15-2, but coach Todd Richards has noticed a vast improvement in their play \u2014 and attitude \u2014 recently.\nAfter making up that deficit, the Blue Jackets found themselves trailing again with just under 11 minutes remaining.\nNick Foligno scored a power-play goal at 4:41 of overtime, Sergei Bobrovsky had 39 saves, and the Blue Jackets beat Washington 3-2 on Thursday night for their fifth straight victory.\nThe Blue Jackets managed only one shot over the first 15 minutes, but their third \u2014 a wrist shot by Foligno at 15:36 \u2014 found the back of the net.\n\u201cIt\u2019s motivating, too.\u201dBobrovsky kept the Capitals at bay until Foligno lined up the decisive goal in overtime."}
