It\u2019s a true black box, with only 65 seats. It\u2019s located in a community whose 12 square miles has the lowest population density of any part of Los Angeles.\n\nBut this little theatre company isn\u2019t allowing such limitations to minimize its vision for 2016, as the Little Fish Theatre will stage nine full-length plays, along with a pair of collections of shorts that will bookend its busy year.\n\nOpening 2016 will be a Little Fish tradition, \u201cPick of the Vine,\u201d the company\u2019s annual selection of short plays. Culled from over 650 submissions received from multiple countries, patrons will be treated to 10 very short plays (between seven and 15 minutes each) that the company promises will answer some of life\u2019s rarely-asked, fascinating questions, such as: How far will we go to make sure our children have every advantage in life? What is the kindest way to handle road-kill? How to cope if one simply can\u2019t engage in small talk?\n\nThe season\u2019s first full-length offering will be the West Coast premiere of Rich Orloff\u2019s Domestic Tranquility, a comedy about a nice, normal suburban, 1950s family whose lives are turned upside down by three escaped convicts with bad table manners. Think Desperate Hours, but funny. And while you\u2019re thinking about film (which you are if you\u2019ve seen the Humphrey Bogart film just referenced), next up is Sleuth, Anthony Shaffer\u2019s 1971 Tony Award-winner that a year later was adapted into the Michael Caine/Laurence Olivier whodunit you\u2019ve inevitably stumbled across on TV sometime in the last quarter-century.\n\nSpeaking of the Tonys, then comes Table Manners, one-third of the tripartite farce about \u201caristocrats behaving badly\u201d during an ill-planned adulterous weekend at a country house whose 2008 Broadway adaptation won the Tony for Best Revival of a Play. And the Tony-winners keep coming with The 39 Steps, which captured two Tonys for its Monty Pythonesque adaptation of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s classic thriller.\n\nOkay, so Sarah Ruhl\u2019s The Clean House didn\u2019t win a Tony. All this comedy about an aspiring comedian from Brazil more interested in coming up with the perfect joke than in house-cleaning for two married doctors (a story the New York Times calls, \u201cFresh, funny [and] imbued with a melancholy but somehow comforting philosophy\u201d) did was become Pulitzer finalist. Then comes another Pulitzer finalist, Gina Gionfriddo\u2019s Rapture, Blister, Burn, a 2012 play about two women who covet each other\u2019s live that the New York Times says \u201cilluminates how hard it can be to forge both a satisfying career and a fulfilling personal life in an era that seems to demand superhuman achievement from everyone.\u201d\n\nThen comes The How and the Why, another play focusing on a pair of women, in this case two brilliant, driven biologists confronting issues of womanhood in science and in nature. The How and the Why is written Sarah Treem, an Emmy-nominated writer/producer of House of Cards and The Affair.\n\nLittle Fish kicks fall off by staging Peter Shaffer\u2019s Amadeus, a brilliant reimagining of the lives and careers of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and fellow composer Antonio Salieri, a less gifted contemporary driven to destroy Mozart as a way to strike out at God for bestowing such genius on a man so boorishly undeserving. Three years before Amadeus won eight Oscars, including Best Picture, it won the Tony for Best Play. But you\u2019ve never seen it on stage, right?\n\nOnetime Academy Award nominee Michael Weller\u2019s What the Night Is For, about a pair of ex-lovers meeting for dinner after 11 years, caps off the full-length plays for the season, but Little Fish closes out the year with A Very Special Holiday Special, a comedic collection of holiday shorts by Mark Harvey Levine, whose work has been chosen for several \u201cPick of the Vines,\u201d including among those slated for 2016.\n\nAssociate Artistic Director Suzanne Dean says the season is heavy on comedy because that\u2019s what Little Fish patrons tend to prefer, but that all of this season\u2019s offerings explore \u201cour common humanity and provide the opportunity to see ourselves in new light.\u201d She also notes that, as a pendulum swing from a male-dominated 2015 season, the 2016 season features three full-length plays written by women and driven by female characters, while additional works have women as central characters. Dean says the season also \u201ctaps into stories that embrace the perspectives of multiple generations.\u201d\n\nThe Little Fish Theatre is located at 777 Centre St., San Pedro, CA 90731.
