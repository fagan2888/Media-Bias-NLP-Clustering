(On Gay Pride Weekend yet!)\n\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS ON FACEBOOK. CLICK HERE TO \"LIKE.\"\n\nThis terrific blow to his ego came just a day after the Supremes had decided that Obamacare was legal once and for all.\n\nIt was all enough to make Justice Scalia want to go hunt down heretics in his St. Thomas More hat. (That insane bonnet he wears was a gift from the Thomas More Society and, ironically, the Inquisition itself was known as \u201cthe Council of the Supreme.\u201d)\n\nBut instead of hunting sodomites (his word), hoping we all pray the gay away or calling for gay celibacy as his son the priest suggests, Scalia maintained the dignity of office, relying on the letter of the law and Legal English to make himself clear and concise on the gay marriage decision.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201clegalistic argle-bargle!\u201d he declared. And then reverting to the original Nazi German, he declared it, \u201cJudicial Putsch\u201d (as in the Nazi uprising).\n\nWhat a Putsch putz!\n\nScalia actually does sound like Holly Madison on Hef more than a Justice on the Supreme Court. Where\u2019s the legal Viagra when you need it? (Jesse Grant/Getty Images)\n\nIn what might be his most profoundly incoherent and showy sentence, however, he declared, \u201cthe opinion\u2019s showy profundities are often profoundly incoherent.\u201d What?\n\nThen, equally incoherently, he wrote, \u201cWho ever thought that intimacy and spirituality (whatever that means) were freedoms?\u201d\n\nI do, and would figure most everyone else does too, except maybe ISIS.\n\nThen he added, \u201cAnd if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage.\u201d Right. What?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what the hell that means, he suggests, \u201cAsk the nearest hippie!\u201d\n\nToo bad the nearest hippie is still in Woodstock contemplating the millenium and how Y2K is going to destroy all the capitalists.\n\nHappily, the fool on the hill didn\u2019t restrict his brilliant legal opinions to same-sex marriage, calling Thursday\u2019s decision on Obamacare, \u201cPure applesauce,\u201d and \u201cJiggery-pokery.\u201d\n\nFinally, in a true Holly Madison-turncoat moment, Scalia added, about the Supreme Court itself: \u201cA system of government that makes the People subordinate to a committee of nine unelected lawyers does not deserve to be called a democracy.\u201d\n\nSo if he thinks the Supreme Court is a kangaroo court out to destroy democracy, what the hell is he still doing there?\n\nFinally, \u201c...with each decision that is unabashedly based not on law, but on the \u2018reasoned judgment\u2019 of a bare majority of this Court \u2014 we move one step closer to being reminded of our impotence.\u201d\n\nJiggery-Pokery? Impotence? Here Antonin Scalia actually does sound like Holly Madison on Hef more than a Justice on the Supreme Court. Where\u2019s the legal Viagra when you need it?\n\nN.J. Gov. Chris Christie IS in fact running for President. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nCHRISTIE RUNNING IN PLACE\n\nChris Christie announced on Thursday that he\u2019s not announcing. And then turned around and put up his campaign website on Saturday.\n\nDespite leaks that he\u2019d jump aboard the overcrowded Republican clown car on Tuesday, he snarled on his radio program, \u201cWhen I decide, I\u2019ll let everybody know.\u201d\n\nChristie said he was too busy now working on the state budget, which he signed on Friday.\n\n\u201cMy team, over the course of time has proven themselves to be rather nimble at being able to do things in public.\u201d No kidding. \u201cIf I told them tomorrow that I wanted to do something on Monday, they\u2019d have it ready. They\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nHey, it took them no time to get lanes closed on the GWB. Must have made the website in 45 minutes then.\n\nKinda makes you feel like a dope for believing anything any pol says. Ever.\n\nPAINTED INTO A CORNER\n\nNo one will ever be able to trade power tools for an original Hacksaw Matt ever again. Convicted killer/escaped convict/prison worker-sex god/artist-in-incarceration Matt, who was shot to death by a cop as he approached the Canadian border, was simply indulging his passions \u2014 border jumping and meat.\n\nOn the lam for 20 days, he had tools smuggled inside a big hunk of chopped meat by the jail\u2019s hot-to-trot Tillie the tailor, which was, in turn, handed off to a guard who had collected Matt\u2019s prison Oprah paintings. Must be hard to find good art in Dannemora.\n\nAnyway, Matt was jailed in the first place for killing his boss before eating a pepperoni and heading south of the border to Mexico.\n\nHacksaw was likely headed north of the border this time when he was shot dead.\n\nCo-prisoner sex god/escapee David Sweat is still on the loose.\n\nDEMOGRAPHIC DUNCE\n\nMayor de Blasio jumped again into international politics, condemning the entire Dominican Republic, a third-world nation, as racist. Why? Because the DR gave undocumented Haitians a deadline to register to remain past the deadline or face deportation.\n\nDe Blaz said, \u201cIt\u2019s happening because these people are black. And it cannot be accepted.\u201d What?\n\nAs a yearly visitor to the Dominican Republic for 25 years and now a homeowner there, I find his remarks offensive and unfounded. Truth: 73% of Dominicans are of mixed race, 16% white and 11% black. Does that sound like a country of racists? Maybe he should stick to the plight of undocumented immigrants here. Two million undocumented immigrants were deported from the U.S. last year alone. Or doesn\u2019t that count?\n\nSTINKS ON THE LINKS\n\nDonald Trump proved how presidential a reality host can be by banning Univision execs from playing on his golf course after they refused to air his beauty pageant. Why? Because of his derogatory remarks about Mexican immigrants at his presidential kickoff. He said that Mexicans are bringing in rapists, drug dealers and \u201cI assume some good people.\u201d You think?\n\nCOWARDLY CREW\n\nTo the terrorists who wreaked havoc in France, Tunisia and Kuwait on Friday:\n\nYou think you are doing what God wants by gunning down unarmed people who were merely going about their lives. You think that God, who created humans, wants you to decapitate his creations, kill them at worship or shoot them on a beach?\n\nYou want to know what God wants, geniuses? No matter which God you worship, everybody\u2019s God detests your kind and venerates humans like Welshman Matthew James, who used his body as a shield to protect his fianc\u00e9e in Tunisia, and who, in the face of unimaginable horror, said, \u201cI love you babe. But just go \u2014 tell our children that their daddy loves them.\u201d\n\nJames is what God calls brave and righteous.\n\nGod only knows what he calls you.\n\nFollow Linda Stasi on Facebook here.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "sailthru.author": "Linda Stasi", "twitter": {"description": "Antonin Scalia is the Holly Madison of the Supreme Court.", "title": "One Supreme Court justice is 'hoppin' mad", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/supreme-court-justice-hoppin-mad-article-1.2273952", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2273944.1435471332!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi28n-10-web.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "supreme court, antonin scalia, same-sex marriage, chris christie, holly madison, bill de blasio, donald trump,", "parsely-author": "Linda Stasi", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.tags": "supreme court, antonin scalia, same-sex marriage, chris christie, holly madison, bill de blasio, donald trump,", "nydn_tags": "supreme court, antonin scalia, same-sex marriage, chris christie, holly madison, bill de blasio, donald trump", "news_keywords": "supreme court, antonin scalia, same-sex marriage, chris christie, holly madison, bill de blasio, donald trump,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/supreme-court-justice-hoppin-mad-article-1.2273952", "parsely-title": "One Supreme Court justice is 'hoppin' mad", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-28T02:21:21-0400", "sailthru.title": "One Supreme Court justice is 'hoppin' mad", "nydn_section": "Gossip", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-28T06:21:21", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2273944.1435471332!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi28n-10-web.jpg", "description": "Antonin Scalia is the Holly Madison of the Supreme Court.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Antonin Scalia is the Holly Madison of the Supreme Court.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Gossip", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Antonin Scalia is the Holly Madison of the Supreme Court.", "title": "One Supreme Court justice is 'hoppin' mad", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/supreme-court-justice-hoppin-mad-article-1.2273952", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2273944.1435471332!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi28n-10-web.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "supreme court, antonin scalia, same-sex marriage, chris christie, holly madison, bill de blasio, donald trump", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Linda Stasi", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2273944.1435471332!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/stasi28n-10-web.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Here Antonin Scalia actually does sound like Holly Madison on Hef more than a Justice on the Supreme Court.\nScalia actually does sound like Holly Madison on Hef more than a Justice on the Supreme Court.\nAntonin Scalia is the Holly Madison of the Supreme Court.\nOn Friday, Scalia nearly blew his Inquisitor\u2019s hat after he was outgunned, outmanned and outwitted when his colleagues on the Supreme Court decided that same-sex marriage must be recognized in every state.\nIt was all enough to make Justice Scalia want to go hunt down heretics in his St. Thomas More hat."}
