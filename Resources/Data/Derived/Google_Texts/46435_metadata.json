Dallas-based Teladoc, the nation\u2019s largest telehealth provider, has proven that telemedicine is an exceptional way to deliver high-quality, cost effective care.\n\nUnderscoring its industry leadership, Teladoc CEO Jason Gorevic today announced the addition of two preeminent health care leaders to the company\u2019s board of directors: former U.S. Senator William Frist, M.D. and former Medco Health Solutions chairman and CEO David B. Snow. http://DigitalNewsRelease.com/?q=Teladoc_NewBoardMembers\n\n\u201cSenator Frist and David Snow are ideal Teladoc board members. These men have successfully navigated the complexities of Wall Street and the halls of Congress. Their commitment to Teladoc brings an added level of experience and success that will be invaluable to us as we continue our explosive growth and navigate the changing landscape of health care,\u201d said Gorevic. \u201cBoth Senator Frist and Dave Snow have numerous opportunities to sit on boards and they chose Teladoc. Their joining our board is not only an endorsement of Teladoc, but also of the telehealth industry.\u201d\n\nSenator Frist is a world-renowned cardiothoracic transplant surgeon and a leading authority on health care policy. During his tenure on Capitol Hill, he served on both the Health and Finance Committees, where he was instrumental in passing health care reform legislation and ultimately served as Senate Majority Leader. Senator Frist brings to Teladoc decades of experience in providing top quality patient care, driving health care policy and reform, and a reputation for championing innovations that deliver improved health care outcomes.\n\n\u201cThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act has infused an additional 8 million patients into the health care system, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The increased demand will further tax our already overburdened primary care system, resulting in even longer patient wait times,\u201d said Senator Frist. \u201cTeladoc is an innovative and effective solution for addressing the current access barriers to primary care. The Teladoc model has shown what we have believed to be true: that many of the everyday health care needs of patients can safely and efficiently be addressed remotely using technology. It is exactly the type of progressive and forward-thinking company we need in the health care industry today. As a Teladoc board member, I want to ensure our country\u2019s legislative groups understand the benefits Teladoc can bring to the health care system as a whole, but most specifically, the need it fills for the patients it serves.\u201d\n\nDavid B. Snow, Jr., is a health care industry veteran, innovator and entrepreneur who has created and implemented solutions to manage the rising costs of health care. Most recently, he served as the chairman and chief executive officer of Medco Health Solutions, one of the nation\u2019s largest pharmacy benefit managers. Under his leadership, Medco\u2019s revenue grew from $34 billion to more than $70 billion. Prior to joining Medco, he served as president and chief operating officer at Empire BlueCross BlueShield. Currently, Snow serves as the chairman and CEO of Cedar Gate Technologies, a health care information technology data analytics company.\n\n\u201cThere is a clear need in our country to create greater access to physicians. Teladoc is a change agent for the way consumers want to access primary care,\u201d said Snow. \u201cAs more and more companies look for efficient and cost-effective means for providing health care to their employees, telehealth - and Teladoc - are critical to fixing what is broken within our health care system today. Teladoc\u2019s outstanding technology, scalable business model and phenomenal year-over-year growth is evidence of the value it brings to its members and clients. The company\u2019s growth continues to be strong and I look forward to helping Teladoc accelerate its growth trajectory.\u201d\n\nTeladoc recently announced it secured $50 million in funding, one of the single largest investments in a telehealth company. \u201cTeladoc is in a significant position of strength; we have outstanding growth momentum, stellar leadership and we are financially strong. The combination of the infusion of capital and addition of these industry icons to our board of directors will accelerate our growth strategy and further cement our foothold as the dominant leader in telehealth,\u201d added Gorevic.\n\nAbout Teladoc\n\nFounded in 2002, Teladoc is the nation\u2019s leading telehealth provider with 8 million members and more than 250,000 consults annually.
