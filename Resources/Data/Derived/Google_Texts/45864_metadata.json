Our Common Ground staff and board members have appealed to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors to continue funding its substance abuse programs that provide residential treatment and support to dozens of individuals a year. Less than a year after converting its former adolescent facility to a longer term adult residential building, OCG needs the county to commit about $340,000 to fund 25 of its 38 beds or it will face having to sell the building, said Our Common Ground Executive Director Orville Roache. The county is funding 18 beds at its Redwood City center through the end of this month. While some providers were hoping to receive supervisors\u2019 approval Monday, awarding funds has been postponed until a countywide analysis is conducted, said Steven Kaplan, director of the county\u2019s Behavioral Health and Recovery Services. It\u2019s a troubling move for Our Common Ground officials as they fear they\u2019ll be forced to close their Redwood City center due to insufficient funding \u2014 resulting in 15 percent of the county\u2019s available treatment beds disappearing, Roache said. Losing the site would have broader countywide effects and postponing treatment can be detrimental to those seeking help, Roache said. \u201cThere\u2019s very few things you can name that has so many collateral impacts. A person who\u2019s suffering from substance abuse and is an addict, they\u2019re affecting the health system because they go to the emergency room, if they commit crimes they\u2019re affecting the criminal justice system because they go to jail, some of them are homeless so there\u2019s a broader quality of life issue. All these areas are impacted when treatment is not available for someone who needs it,\u201d Roache said. While Our Common Ground has sufficient funding through the end of the month, having the supervisors delay a decision could force nearly 30 clients back on the street, Roache said. For the first time, county staff recommended a more comprehensive countywide analysis of each provider\u2019s financial solvency and properties before the Board of Supervisors makes a final determination of what funding to allot to rehab services, Kaplan said. \u201cWe want to take a look at each property to see what the current situation is related to the financing. For the ones that own [their property,] try to understand what the risks are for the provider to be able to maintain that property. And, whether they have an ongoing structural deficit that puts their operation in jeopardy,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe are going to work through this in a way that hopefully helps [providers] out.\u201d Our Common Ground\u2019s Board of Directors has already loaned the agency nearly $400,000 and while the Woodside Road building is worth millions of dollars, Roache said he\u2019d prefer to provide services to those in need. Without a firm commitment from the county, Our Common Ground will struggle to demonstrate solvency to potential lenders, Roache said. Typically, the Board of Supervisors allots funding as part of its annual budgetary process, which is slated to be finalized at the end of the month. Kaplan said he wasn\u2019t sure if the study would be done in time for the board to approve funding by the next fiscal year. However, supporting residential rehabilitation services is a priority, Kaplan said. \u201cOur Common Ground, along with the other providers, are all important parts of our continuum of care. We, and the board, have valued those providers and their services for a long time in our community and we believe we have a strong partnership with them. That\u2019s why the board has directed us to try and solve this problem,\u201d Kaplan said. Our Common Ground, which also maintains a residential facility in East Palo Alto, is not the only provider currently suffering financial trials and at risk of closing some of its facilities. Project 90 is facing the loss of its longtime intake and residential facility called the O\u2019Toole Center on Ninth Avenue in San Mateo as the property owners are preparing to redevelop the site. Roache said his organization is one of the county\u2019s only Medi-Cal certified drug rehabilitation sites and is only seeking funding for the costly residential portion of treatment \u2014 even with the Affordable Care Act, Medi-Cal will never fund living arrangements for substance abuse treatment clients, Roache said. With Proposition 47 reducing many felony drug crimes to misdemeanors, Roache said it\u2019s as critical as ever to ensure those who seek assistance have options. With the cost of living in the Bay Area at an all-time high, Roache said losing housing options for those working to get clean could mean losing individuals to addiction. \u201cWhen someone is ready, that\u2019s when you want to get them,\u201d Roache said. \u201cBecause if you turn them away and say \u2018hey, we\u2019ll put you on a waiting list,\u2019 and that motivation slowly dissipates, than you\u2019ve lost them. Unless they\u2019re in custody or another facility while they\u2019re waiting, if they\u2019re on the street, you\u2019ve lost them.\u201d Visit www.ocgworks.org for more information about Our Common Ground. samantha@smdailyjournal.com (650) 344-5200 ext. 106", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Rehab center fears closure: Our Common Ground may sell residential building if county doesn\u2019t commit funds -", "title": "Rehab center fears closure: Our Common Ground may sell residential building if county doesn\u2019t commit funds - San Mateo Daily Journal", "url": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2015-06-20/rehab-center-fears-closure-our-common-ground-may-sell-residential-building-if-county-doesnt-commit-funds/1776425145387.html", "image": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/adv_image/smdj-large.jpg", "ttl": 2592000, "type": "website"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000103315106, "app_id": 484828421538257}, "GENERATOR": "San Mateo Daily Journal"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf69\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOur Common Ground, along with the other providers, are all important parts of our continuum of care.\nWithout a firm commitment from the county, Our Common Ground will struggle to demonstrate solvency to potential lenders, Roache said.\nUnless they\u2019re in custody or another facility while they\u2019re waiting, if they\u2019re on the street, you\u2019ve lost them.\u201d Visit www.ocgworks.org for more information about Our Common Ground.\nThe county is funding 18 beds at its Redwood City center through the end of this month.\nOur Common Ground staff and board members have appealed to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors to continue funding its substance abuse programs that provide residential treatment and support to dozens of individuals a year."}
