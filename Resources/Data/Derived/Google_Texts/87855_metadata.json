But parenting?\n\n\u201cShut up. I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said with aw-shucks charm before adding: \u201cI told my daughters when I was raising them, I love my daughters [Amelia and Lizzy], \u2018I can provide you with clothing, a place to live, nourishment, emotional stability and be really great, OR if you mess with me, in two seconds I can become THIS GUY. You can choose at any given time who you want to talk to.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe no-nonsense look that appeared on Mulkey\u2019s famous face emphasized how unpleasant THIS GUY could be. THIS GUY doesn\u2019t smile much. Mulkey was all THAT GUY with me.\n\nTHIS GUY and THAT GUY have made countless TV appearances \u2014 he booked a recurring role on NBC\u2019s \u201cGrimm\u201d Friday while I was on the phone with his wife \u2014 and \u201cprobably over 70\u201d movies, most recently \u201cCaptain Phillips\u201d with Tom Hanks and Twin Cities actors who played the Somali pirates. \u201cLots of people count \u2019em,\u201d Mulkey said of movie roles. \u201cI just do them one at a time.\u201d\n\nHe and his actor wife, Karen Landry, are also regulars on the Twin Cities and Los Angeles theater circuits. Landry is currently playing the religious grandma in \u201cFalling\u201d at Rogue Machine Theatre in L.A.\n\nThey let me crash one of their daily trips to an Anytime Fitness last month when they were in St. Paul, which is apparently their favorite place, although they also keep a house in Venice, Calif. They have been married \u201c32\u00bd years,\u201d he proudly said. The three simple keys to that lasting love are provided by Landry, whom I had to bleep in my star\u00adtribune.com/video.\n\nActor Chris Mulkey arrives at the special screening of the feature film \"Captain Phillips\" at The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Monday, Sept. 30, 2013 in Beverly Hills, Calif.

I get to play a lot of different parts.\n\nQ Which do you like better, acting or playing music?\n\nA Oooh, that\u2019s not fair. On any given night in the club, music. I play down in Louisiana, Nashville, Texas, Los Angeles House of Blues. I have a band in Los Angeles, Chris Mulkey and Deluxe, which centers around music that I write and Marcelliano, an amazing keyboardist. But I also have a band in Louisiana. I play with Sean Vidrine and Eddie Bodin. Play Mardi Gras, oh yeah.\n\nQ What kinds of music do you play?\n\nA I play blues and America alternative. Mixture between John Lee Hooker and Los Lobos, Stevie Ray Vaughan, a little Bob Dylan. But I funkisize him up.\n\nQ Name an actor whose voice you were surprised to hear on the other end of a phone call.\n\nA Jon Voight. That was after he hit me with a decanter and we were doing a \u201c24\u201d and he cut my face. I had known Jon for about 25 years. Jon goes, Mulkey, it\u2019s Voight. I\u2019m sorry I hit you. Do you still love me? I said, \u201cI still love you but I said a lot of bad things about you.\u201d\n\nQ In \u201cCaptain Phillips,\u201d you spoke the prescient lines: \u201cCaptain, they\u2019re coming back. They are not paying me enough to fight pirates.\u201d What\u2019s your price if the job is fighting pirates?\n\nA Boy, they\u2019d have to pay me a lot of money. Then I\u2019d take that money and hire somebody to really fight them and I\u2019d go on vacation.\n\nQ Why aren\u2019t some crew members on those ships marksmen, whose job it is to sit there, especially in daylight, and pick off those pirates or shoot holes in their boats?\n\nA There\u2019s a whole thing we get from television and movies about what we would do in dangerous situations. And it\u2019s all kind of Rambo\u2019d up and Jackie Chan. And you wouldn\u2019t do that. It\u2019s not as easy as you think. I think the best thing to do in situations like that is go the other way. Don\u2019t get involved unless you have to, and then you really have to commit.\n\nQ That movie left me wondering who has a bigger bladder, the real Captain Phillips or Tom Hanks, who did not indicate the need to urinate until about 2:53 p.m. in the 1 p.m. movie I saw.\n\nA C.J., no one goes to the bathroom in movies. In \u201cGone With The Wind,\u201d who went to the bathroom? They went to the powder room.\n\nQ Would you shoot these tense scenes with the pirates and then have dinner with them?\n\nA We were all from Minnesota so we hung a little bit.\n\nQ If Hollywood could learn one thing from the Midwest community where you grew up, what would it be?\n\nA Loyalty. Sticking up for your guys.\n\nInterviews are edited (and in this case, bleeped).
