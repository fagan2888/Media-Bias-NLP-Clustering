Her focus was Mr. Trump\u2019s rationale for his professed support of Obamacare. \u201cI don\u2019t want people dying on the streets,\u201d he said.\n\nThat was a boast. Mr. Trump later added that he also did not want people \u201cdying on the sidewalks.\u201d Ms. Collins rightly noted that this was yet another new low.\n\nIt was not, however, entirely without precedent in Republican circles.\n\nWhen Pope Francis was new to the pontificate and rocking the establishment with his 2013 critique of capitalism, Newt Gingrich professed support for the pope\u2019s view and urged other Republicans to support it as well. What the pope was saying, according to Mr. Gingrich, is that \u201cyou do not want to live on a planet with billionaires and people who do not have any food.\u201d\n\nEffective misdirection always incorporates elements of truth. I agree with Mr. Trump on one thing: I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets and sidewalks. I agree with Mr. Gingrich on one thing: I don\u2019t want people to go without food.\n\nBut according to Mr. Trump, the point of health care for the masses is to keep the sidewalks clear of dead bodies. Similarly, per Mr. Gingrich, the point of food for the masses is to keep the world safe for billionaires.\n\nWorse, for all their talk, they are not really motivated to help. Mr. Trump\u2019s health plan \u2014 as the campaign explained it to Ms. Collins \u2014 is nothing like Obamacare, but relies on tired old Republican ideas for tax deductions, Medicaid block grants and private health savings accounts. Mr. Gingrich, for his part, made deriding food stamps a centerpiece of his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.\n\nThe Trump phenomenon is appalling. But it did not come out of the blue.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160226164340, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/takingnote/post", "per": "Francis;Gingrich, Newt;Trump, Donald J", "org": "Republican Party;Roman Catholic Church", "keywords": "Francis,Gingrich Newt,Trump Donald J,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Presidential Election of 2012,Presidential Election of 2016,Sidewalks,Republican Party,Roman Catholic Church,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/Before There Was Trump, There Was Gingrich ( 20160226 )", "news_keywords": "Pope Francis,Sidewalk", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Teresa Tritch", "SCG": "takingnote", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Teresa Tritch", "byl": "Teresa Tritch", "twitter": {"url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/before-there-was-trump-there-was-gingrich/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/26/opinion/26tritchWEB/26tritchWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Mr. Trump\u2019s comment that he did not want people \u201cdying on the sidewalks\u201d was not without precedent in Republican circles.", "card": "summary", "title": "Before There Was Trump, There Was Gingrich"}, "blogpostid": 100000004236787, "description": "Mr. Trump\u2019s comment that he did not want people \u201cdying on the sidewalks\u201d was not without precedent in Republican circles.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 26, 2016", "article": {"tag": "Featured Posts", "published_time": 1456523020, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2016-02-26T22:04:33-05:00"}, "utime": 20160226220433, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20160226, "pdate": 20160226, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care;Presidential Election of 2012;Presidential Election of 2016;Sidewalks", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/26/opinion/26tritchWEB/26tritchWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Taking Note", "description": "Mr. Trump\u2019s comment that he did not want people \u201cdying on the sidewalks\u201d was not without precedent in Republican circles.", "title": "Before There Was Trump, There Was Gingrich", "url": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/before-there-was-trump-there-was-gingrich/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/26/opinion/26tritchWEB/26tritchWEB-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/before-there-was-trump-there-was-gingrich/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Before There Was Trump, There Was Gingrich", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/02/26/opinion/26tritchWEB/26tritchWEB-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 26, 2016"}, "article_summary": "Similarly, per Mr. Gingrich, the point of food for the masses is to keep the world safe for billionaires.\nMr. Gingrich, for his part, made deriding food stamps a centerpiece of his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.\nI agree with Mr. Gingrich on one thing: I don\u2019t want people to go without food.\nBut according to Mr. Trump, the point of health care for the masses is to keep the sidewalks clear of dead bodies.\nI agree with Mr. Trump on one thing: I don\u2019t want people dying on the streets and sidewalks."}
