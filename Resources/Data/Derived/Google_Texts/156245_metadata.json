I watch everyone. He watches a lot of golf. He has so much time. He played 16 events \u2014 what does he do with his time? He\u2019d be aware of me. He\u2019d be saying, \u2018Here\u2019s another kid coming up.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt was a slow climb.\n\nNow 27, Day idolized Woods\u2018 work ethic when he was growing up in Australia and honed that powerful swing under Colin Swatton, his current caddie. No one ever questioned his ability, only the trophies. It took him three years to win his first PGA Tour event at the Byron Nelson Championship, and four more years before he picked up another title at the Match Play Championship.\n\nAlong the way were more nagging injuries than he cares to remember, along with whispers that he was an underachiever.\n\nAll that has been put to rest.\n\nThis is a new Day, who has matured into one of the top three players in the world and figures to stay there.\n\n\u201cAs long as I am healthy, I feel like I\u2019m going to be there a long time,\u201d Day said. \u201cI still want to accomplish that No. 1 goal of mine, which is to be the best player in the world. I\u2019m still motivated and still very hungry for that, even after this win. Stuff like this is just the icing on top of the cake when you work so hard, and being able to achieve something like this.\u201d\n\nNot much in life has come easily for Day.\n\nHis father died of cancer when he was 12, and if not for the sacrifices of his mother to get him to a golf academy, and the nurturing of Swatton, there\u2019s no telling where he would be now. Day once shopped for used clothes at a store where, for $5, he could stuff as much as he could into a bag.\n\n\u201cI remember not having a hot water tank, so we had to use a kettle for hot showers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would put the kettle on and go have a shower, and then my mom would come bring three or four kettles in, just to heat them up. And it would take five, 10 minutes for every kettle to heat up.\u201d\n\nHe had every reason to expect a hard road along the rugged terrain of Whistling Straits on Sunday afternoon.\n\nDay had a share of the 54-hole lead at the U.S. Open, where he showed remarkable strength to even finish while coping with symptoms of vertigo. He faded to a 74. A month later, he shared another 54-hole at St. Andrews and missed the playoff at the British Open by one shot when he left a 30-foot birdie attempt a foot short.\n\nThis time, he had least had a two-shot margin, along with pressure not to let another chance get away. He feared there would be emotional scars if he didn\u2019t finish this one. And, if that wasn\u2019t enough, he was paired with Masters and U.S. Open champion Jordan Spieth, the new No. 1 player in golf.\n\nUltimately, that\u2019s what made it so special. Spieth\u2019s plan was to catch Day somewhere along the front nine, though he could tell early that Day was smashing the driver and would be tough to beat. Day really put Spieth in a hole by making a 50-foot birdie putt on No. 7.\n\nNo one got closer than two shots to Day the entire round.\n\n\u201cHe played like he had won seven or eight majors before,\u201d Spieth said.\n\nThe highest praise for Day came in the scoring trailer, when he said Spieth told him, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I could do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling when someone like Jordan, who is playing phenomenal golf right now, says that,\u201d Day said. \u201cBecause it means that he left everything out there on the golf course and my play this week was just so much better \u2014 well, better than everyone else. And, that feels good to me, because I was the last man standing.\u201d\n\nThe Wanamaker Trophy was all he wanted. Only after it was over did Day realize he had broken a major championship record by finishing at 20 under par. The previous mark belonged to Woods, who was 19 under when he won the British Open at St. Andrews in 2000.\n\nWoods watched him do it Sunday.\n\nHe saw a mature, married man with a son and another child due in November, and someone now with six PGA Tour wins that include a major.\n\nHe\u2019s not just another kid coming up.
