Non-procreative sex in particular. How else would you explain the trap that we\u2019re laying for poor people who deign to get it on?\u201d\n\nRampell argues that if only poor people in America could get free birth control and more comprehensive sex education, have \u201ceasy access\u201d to abortions in unregulated clinics, and receive more government-sponsored childcare by expanding the welfare state, then unwanted pregnancies would be a thing of the past and Americans would live happily ever after.\n\nOh, the joy of a liberal utopia.\n\nRampell doesn\u2019t pause to consider other factors that have seriously contributed to the disparity between the rich and poor on out-of-wedlock births. Instead of looking at the issue in terms of personal choice regarding marriage and childbirth, as well as personal responsibility, and respecting all people as rational human beings capable of self-government, she concludes that a \u201ctrap\u201d is being laid; someone must be doing something to these women or not enough for them. Neither is truly the case.\n\nTaxpayers Sponsor Gobs of Sex-Related Items for Poor Women Let\u2019s take these issues one at a time. First, access to free birth control and family planning services: Low-income women already have access to free birth control through Title X, which Rampell says has been \u201cgutted.\u201d But this isn\u2019t true. According to the most recent Title X Family Planning Annual Report, \u201cbetween 1999 and 2012, inflation-adjusted (constant 2012 dollars) total revenue increased 3%, from $1.2 billion in 1999 to almost $1.3 billion in 2012.\u201d\n\nWhile some sources of revenue for Title X decreased (including a relatively slight decrease in appropriated funds), revenue from Medicaid for family planning services \u201cmore than tripled from $166.2 million in 1999 to $499.2 million in 2012.\u201d There were also increases from other sources, \u201cincluding an 85% increase in private and other third-party reimbursements, an 18% increase in local government revenue, and a 12% increase in \u2018other sources.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to taking care of single women after they have babies out of wedlock, the federal government operates more than \u201c70 means-tested welfare programs that provide cash, food, housing, medical care, and targeted social services to poor and low-income persons,\u201d Robert Rector writes at the Heritage Foundation in a report on child poverty. \u201cIn fiscal year 2010, federal and state governments spent over $400 billion on means-tested welfare for low-income families with children. Roughly three-quarters of this welfare assistance, or $300 billion, went to single-parent families. Most non-marital births are currently paid for by the taxpayers through the Medicaid system, and a wide variety of welfare assistance will continue to be given to the mother and child for nearly two decades after the child is born.\u201d While we don\u2019t live in a perfect world where everyone\u2019s needs are taken care of, the accusation that Americans don\u2019t care about poor unwed mothers is a severe mischaracterization.\n\nAs for opposition to the contraception mandate in Obamacare, the Hobby Lobby case was not about denying women their rights to contraception as has been popularly and erroneously claimed; it was about removing pills that cause abortions from the list of insured drugs. That left 16 out of the 20 approved forms of contraception that insurance would cover, including condoms, diaphragms, sponges, cervical caps, combined pills, the mini pill, extended/continuous-use birth control pills, patches, rings, injections, rods, vasectomies, and sterilization surgeries. This hardly counts as denying women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nAccording to a national report on intended and unintended births, American women who are fertile, sexually active, but not currently using a method of modern contraception give many reasons for not using birth control\u2014\u201cmost of which have little to do with affordability or physical access.\u201d Most of the women surveyed didn\u2019t use contraception because they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get pregnant (it\u2019s not clear whether this is a lack of knowledge or simply denial). Others didn\u2019t want to deal with the side effects of birth control and chose to risk getting pregnant. Still others simply didn\u2019t expect to have sex when they did. They weren\u2019t on birth control and evidently didn\u2019t have a condom, but they chose to have sex anyway.\n\nThe \u2018Unintended Pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018Uneducated Girls\u2019 Myths The government report interprets these findings as women simply not having enough sex education. Women, the report says, are misinformed about side effects, and they need to be better aware of all options available as well as how birth control actually works. Kathryn Edin, professor of public policy at Harvard, is the nation\u2019s most distinguished researcher on low-income single mothers, and, Rector notes, \u201cher findings overturn much conventional wisdom about \u2018unintended\u2019 pregnancy, out-of-wedlock childbearing, and low-income single parents.\u201d Edin says the popular perception that nonmarital childbirth is the result of accidental pregnancies among teenage girls who don\u2019t have enough or proper information about birth control isn\u2019t true.\n\n\u201cEdin explains that children born out of wedlock are \u2018seldom conceived by explicit design, yet are rarely a pure accident either,\u2019\u201d Rector writes. \u201cYoung single mothers typically \u2018describe their pregnancies as \u201cnot exactly planned\u201d yet \u201cnot exactly avoided\u201d.\u2026 Only a few were using any form of contraception at all when their \u201cunplanned\u201d child was conceived.\u2019 But this lack of contraceptive use was not due to a lack of knowledge about or access to contraceptives.\u201d It was a matter of choice.\n\nRampell and others would disagree. They see the root problem as a sex-ed gap between the rich and the poor. If only there were more sex education, poor people would stop having babies.\n\nWhen it comes to sex education, studies are all over the place about what is effective. Every state in the nation is involved in some form of sex education for public school children. According to the Guttmacher Institute, most teens receive formal education about sexually transmitted diseases and abstinence. However, about one-third of teens haven\u2019t received any formal instruction about contraception. While this isn\u2019t as high as the 84% who are taught abstinence, it\u2019s still pretty high.\n\nGuttmacher observes that one factor that contributes to high-risk sexual behavior is \u201cexposure to high levels of sexual content on television,\u201d which is \u201cassociated with an increased risk of initiating sexual activity, as well as a greater likelihood of involvement in teen pregnancy.\u201d Interestingly, Rampell makes no mention of high levels of sexual content on television as a contributing factor to unintended pregnancies, neither do those who suggest that the best solution to low-income nonmarital births is to encourage young poor women to use effective birth control devices such as IUDs, IUSs, implants, and injections and increase awareness of these devices through state-run social marketing campaigns.\n\nPushing IUDs Based on Poor Assumptions While a report from the Brookings Institution mentions that IUDs can cause perforation and infection, it says the devices are generally safe for adolescents, which is consistent with recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics. However, thousands of women (more than 70,000 since 2000) have issued complaints about some IUDs, such as Mirena, manufactured by Bayer Pharmaceuticals. While the IUDs of today are better than those of the past, they still come with risks, and many women are choosing not to use them.\n\nThe push for IUD use as a solution to unintended pregnancies is tied to the belief, based on some findings, that abstinence education doesn\u2019t work. As Rampell says, people are going to have sex no matter what, so you might as well prepare them for it\u2014even it that means using risky forms of birth control (no matter how small that risk might be). Yet Guttmacher makes a brief, but significant, observation about abstinence education: \u201cAlthough there is no evidence indicating that federally-funded abstinence-only-until-marriage education is effective, a recent randomized controlled trial found that in specific cases, abstinence-only education programs that are specifically tailored to the local community and do not criticize contraceptives nor advocate abstinence until marriage can be effective in delaying sexual debut among younger teens.\u201d\n\nGuttmacher doesn\u2019t expand, but there is some indication that in local environments, this kind of balanced education works. It is reasonable to conclude that these \u201clocal environments\u201d include parental and maybe religious-based involvement. According to Rector, parental involvement and children growing up in a home where their mother and father are present is essential to reducing nonmarital births. Many studies conclude that girls are at an increased risk of becoming pregnant out of wedlock when they are raised only by one parent, especially when the father is the absent one.\n\n\u201cCompared to girls raised in similar married families, girls from single-parent homes are more than twice as likely to have a child without being married, thereby repeating the negative cycle for another generation,\u201d Rector writes. One of the differences between low-income girls getting pregnant compared to their high-income counterparts isn\u2019t money, but the fact that more high-income girls come from two-parent homes where they have the benefit of their father\u2019s attention, guidance, and nurture. The father in the home is not just beneficial because of economic reasons, but because of the irreplaceable influence he has on his children.\n\nFather Absence Increases Subsequent Generations\u2019 Unwed Childbearing Unfortunately, more and more children are being raised without their fathers. Marriage has declined for all Americans, rich and poor, but it has seen a greater decline among the poor. Marital childbearing used to be the norm in the United States. \u201cWhen President Lyndon Johnson launched the War on Poverty in 1964,\u201d Rector writes, \u201c93 percent of children born in the United States were born to married parents.\u201d In 2007, only 59 percent of all births occurred to married couples. The decline in marriage has fallen by approximately 50 percent since the 1970s:\n\nToday, one in three children are being raised without a father, and nearly half of those live below the poverty line. In 1960, only 11 percent of American children lived without their fathers. Before that, there were hardly any out-of-wedlock births compared to today, as seen in the chart below from the Centers for Disease Control. Note, however, that there has been a recent downturn in the birth rate. After increasing between 2002 and 2007, birth rates for unmarried women in all race groups were lower in 2012 than in 2007. It is speculated that the reason for this is a bad economy, and we don\u2019t know if these numbers will hold or if the nonmarital birth rate will once again rise.\n\nNotice that, in 1940, there were very few nonmarital births. Yet Rampell tells us that those who advocate marriage and abstinence suffer from a \u201cright-wing delusion,\u201d that they rely on a \u201cfundamental miscalculation about human nature\u201d because you can\u2019t control people\u2019s libidos. People are going to have out-of-wedlock sex because that\u2019s who they are as humans and that desire can\u2019t be denied; it must simply be managed with a really good form of birth control.\n\nWhile you certainly can\u2019t \u201clegislate away libido,\u201d obviously we know from history that people have the ability to exercise self-control. If having casual sex is a matter of human nature and a tyrannical libido that simply can\u2019t be denied or governed, then there would have been just as many nonmarital births in 1940 as today, if not more (because of less birth control availability). So what is the difference between the women in 1940 and the women today? Has human nature magically changed? Did the women in 1940 not have libidos?\n\nWith all due respect to Rampell, her chiding of the right-wing moralists is based on faulty logic at best. Human nature hasn\u2019t changed. Women in 1940 were no different than women today\u2014libido and all. What has changed are the social norms and morals that help people keep their libido in check, that encourage self-government and self-control. The value of marriage, which is a strong bulwark against sexual promiscuity as well as poverty, has been rejected as important and vital to a flourishing society.\n\nYes, Women Can Choose to Not Have Sex Today, we throw up our hands and say people are going to have causal sex so we might as well just deal with it and get them sterilized\u2014it\u2019s human nature, after all, and we\u2019re powerless before it. But this is a lie. We don\u2019t have to be enslaved to our base desires; we can choose not to have sex. We can choose to wait to have children until after we\u2019re married. We can choose to raise children in a two-parent home, which is best for them. The problem is, as individuals and as a society, we don\u2019t want to make that choice, and we\u2019ve abandoned all the traditional mechanisms that help us do what\u2019s best for ourselves and our children.\n\nRampell says data shows just how hard it is \u201cto keep those unmarried libidos in check.\u201d Do we really need data to tell us that? And doing so is even more difficult if we have abandoned the restraints that help us\u2014the values that keep us from having sex until marriage and the external social restraints that both inform us that marriage is best and that birthing children out of wedlock is immoral and unhealthy. Yes, I do know how shocking those words sound as they echo in a world empty of morality and real, sacrificial love.\n\nSadly, we have loosened those restraints, and now our libidos are truly running wild\u2014encouraged by sexualized messaging in music, pop culture, and entertainment. Sex education is a weak effort at restraining those impulses, and in some ways it encourages them, especially when casual sex is presented not only as inevitable but good.\n\nSex education is not completely effective because it offers only biological instruction with no moral or familial framework or traditional values that have historically played a major role in checking our libidos. At a time when few promote marriage and traditional values on sex, sex education and prevention efforts have been in full force. And yet, STDs, which are prominently discussed in sex education classes across the nation, have been on the rise (even among those who are over 50 years old and have a penchant for reading the popular erotica novel \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d\u2014I know, strange, but there are British medical reports about the correlation).\n\nWhere Are the Premarital Sex Warning Campaigns? One thing is for sure, while there are a lot of messaging campaigns about a variety of issues, one can hear only crickets chirping when it comes to promoting marriage and traditional values about sex. Regarding this social silence, Rector makes an insightful analogy between having a child outside of marriage and dropping out of school, both of which are economically detrimental:\n\n[D]ropping out of school and having a child outside of marriage have one crucial difference. Everyone in our society is told incessantly from childhood on that dropping out of school will harm one\u2019s future; despite this constant refrain, a great many still drop out each year. In bold contrast, young people in low-income communities are never told that having a child outside of marriage will have negative consequences. They are never told that marriage has beneficial effects. The schools, the welfare system, the health care system, public authorities, and the media all remain scrupulously silent on the subject. In the face of this pervasive social silence, it should be no surprise that out-of-wedlock childbearing has become the norm in so many communities.\n\n\n\nImagine how high the school dropout rate might be if, for 50 years, lower-income youth were never told that failing to finish school would harm their future.\n\nThe following chart shows how out-of-wedlock childbearing has increased over the years:\n\nMost of these nonmarital births occur to women who are struggling to make ends meet. \u201cMore than two-thirds of births to women who were high school dropouts occurred outside of marriage. . . . By contrast, among women with at least a college degree, only 8 percent of births were out of wedlock.\u201d Rampell says the reason for this disparity is that low-income women aren\u2019t getting the sex education they need. While it\u2019s certainly true that increased contraception use and abortion lower birth rates, sex education isn\u2019t the only solution. Again, back in 1940 when we didn\u2019t have this problem, there wasn\u2019t any government-funded birth control or sex education. Also, nonmarital birth rates have continued to go up despite increased sex education and access to birth control. There has been a leveling off of births among teens, but nonmarital births among older low-income women continue to rise.\n\n\u201cThe decline in marriage and growth of out-of-wedlock birth is not a teenage issue,\u201d Rector writes, \u201cit is the result of a breakdown in relationships between young adult men and women.\u201d\n\nMany Poor Women Choose Children Before Marriage As Edin said, the increase of nonmarital births among low-income women is not simply because they aren\u2019t educated about contraception or because they don\u2019t have free access to birth control (which they do), it\u2019s because they are choosing to have children before marriage despite the difficulties that come with it. According to Edin in her book, \u201cPromises I Can Keep,\u201d \u201cMost low-income non-married mothers see children not merely as desirable, but as a \u2018necessity.\u2019 Without children, their lives are hollow and chaotic; having children is a \u2018heroic\u2019 choice that rescues them from emptiness. For many, parenthood is the point \u2018at which they can really start living.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCritically, almost none of the lower-income women who have a child out of wedlock feel that it is important to be married before having children,\u201d Rector writes. \u201cAlthough roughly half of non-married mothers were cohabiting with the father at the time of birth (nearly 75 percent were in some sort of romantic relationship with the father), these relationships are usually of short duration and unstable. Mutual understanding and commitment are lacking, and although the couples usually think and speak favorably about marriage, most tend to drift apart after the child is born.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the strong desire for women to have children coupled with the now-common belief that marriage isn\u2019t necessary for having children explains the increase of nonmarital births in low-income communities. \u201cWhile most non-marital pregnancies are not deliberately planned, they are also not seriously avoided,\u201d Rector writes. This bears out in polls in which 17.3 percent of women say they didn\u2019t use contraception because they didn\u2019t care if they got pregnant. This isn\u2019t a matter of education; this is a matter of choice.\n\nRector says this choice is not thrust on most of the women making it because of a lack of marriageable men. More than 40 percent of children are now born outside of marriage. Does this mean 40 percent of young adult men in America are non-marriageable? \u201cIn reality, while some of the fathers are not suitable marriage partners, most would be. Three-quarters of non-married fathers are still romantically involved with the mother at the time of birth. Among these men, alcohol, drug, and physical abuse are infrequent.\u201d\n\nRampell makes one other point besides the need for more sex education and access to birth control. She says there needs to be more \u201ceasy access\u201d to abortions. The term itself is misleading because access is not the issue, safety is. We\u2019ve seen results of unregulated clinics and the horrific consequences for low-income women in the Kermit Gosnell case in which infants were beheaded, severed baby feet were kept in jars, an infant was left screaming after it was delivered alive during an abortion, and an adult patient, Karnamaya Mongar, died of a heart attack and in severe pain after getting an abortion. Is the push for regulated clinics where women will be safe really that unreasonable?\n\nTry Some Pro-Woman and Pro-Child Solutions for Once When it comes to finding solutions that will help low-income single mothers, we need to do more than just dish out contraceptives (which will be ineffective for those who are actually choosing to have babies out of wedlock), herd them into unregulated abortion clinics, give them \u201ccomprehensive\u201d sex education that fails to factor in the spiritual and moral dimension of human beings, and then continue their dependence on government and the cycle of poverty by increasing welfare programs.\n\nAre these really pro-woman or pro-child solutions? Why don\u2019t we try something we know actually works in reducing poverty, making our children\u2019s lives better, and stabilizing our communities? Why don\u2019t we endorse marriage and traditional values about sex? Rein in the sexualized culture by promoting the dignity of women (and men) instead of degrading them through sexualization and talking about them as if they have no ability to control their own libidos, as if they\u2019re just a bunch of mindless, soulless lust bunnies incapable of saying \u201cno\u201d to themselves.\n\nI can just hear the mockery now and the hysterical screams of \u201cDon\u2019t stigmatize my choice to have sex!\u201d But no one is stigmatizing sex, let alone your choice to have it. What\u2019s being stigmatized in our culture is marriage and the choice not to have sex. What I\u2019m saying is that we need to turn that trend around, not because sex isn\u2019t fun, but because sex within marriage is much better\u2014and it\u2019s definitely better for the children who are products of it.\n\nSo, how about trying something new? How about communicating a pro-marriage message and strengthen marriage in low-income communities, as Rector recommends?\n\n\u201cEncourage public advertising campaigns on the importance of marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cProvide marriage education programs in high schools and with a high proportion of at-risk youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrengthen federal abstinence education programs that provide critical information on the value of marriage to adults, children, and society.\u201d And if you think comprehensive sex education is better, then at least make it truly comprehensive and add information about the importance of marriage.\n\n\u201cMake voluntary marriage education widely available to interested couples in low-income communities. Provide marriage education materials and referrals in Title X birth control clinics.\u201d\n\nFinally, reduce the penalties against marriage in the welfare system. People like Rampell can scoff at these suggestions and say they won\u2019t work because people are enslaved to their libidos, but some of us have a higher view of women\u2014that they don\u2019t have to be controlled by their base desires, by poverty, by fear, by dependency\u2014all of which drive us to more constricted and unhappy lives.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 07:19:10 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Catherine Rampell can keep thinking humans are enslaved to their libidos, but some of us have a higher view of women.", "title": "Washington Elitists Don\u2019t Understand How Poor Women Think About Sex", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10597303795_6c554cb888_h.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-23T07:14:51+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/10/21/washington-elitists-dont-understand-how-poor-women-think-about-sex/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Catherine Rampell can keep thinking humans are enslaved to their libidos, but some of us have a higher view of women.", "creator": "@McAllisterDen", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10597303795_6c554cb888_h.jpg"}, "title": "Washington Elitists Don\u2019t Understand How Poor Women Think About Sex", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "The Sexes", "tag": "Catherine Rampell,contraceptives,Heritage Foundation,intrauterine devices,IUDs,poor women,premarital sex,Robert Rector,sex,unmarried pregnancy,unwed motherhood,Washington Post", "published_time": "2014-10-21T07:19:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-23T07:14:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Catherine Rampell can keep thinking humans are enslaved to their libidos, but some of us have a higher view of women."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1077\"", "article_summary": "At a time when few promote marriage and traditional values on sex, sex education and prevention efforts have been in full force.\nIf only there were more sex education, poor people would stop having babies.\nTaxpayers Sponsor Gobs of Sex-Related Items for Poor Women Let\u2019s take these issues one at a time.\nThe \u2018Unintended Pregnancy\u2019 and \u2018Uneducated Girls\u2019 Myths The government report interprets these findings as women simply not having enough sex education.\nAgain, back in 1940 when we didn\u2019t have this problem, there wasn\u2019t any government-funded birth control or sex education."}
