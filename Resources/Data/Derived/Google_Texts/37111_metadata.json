That it took a display of actual World War II Nazi propaganda for her to act is appalling.\n\nAnti-Semites are running wild on US campuses, with far too little blowback. The situation at Vassar College, once a respected elite campus, is so dire that the New York Daily News had editorialized\n\nPresident Catharine Hill slammed the anti-Israel Students for Justice in Palestine after the group attempted to tar pro-Israel advocates by displaying on the Internet a poster created in 1944 to sow anti-American feeling among the Dutch under German rule.\n\nThe cartoon image, under the heading \u201cLiberators,\u201d shows a monster stomping on a European city while wearing a Star of David, holding a money bag clutched by a long-nosed man, bearing a U.S. flag and cloaked in a Ku Klux Klan hood.\n\nHere is a cropped image of the poster in question:\n\nIn the lead exposing the anti-Semites at Vassar has been Cornell University clinical* law professor William Jacobson, the publisher of Legal Insurrection, and before he started his own site, a contributor to American Thinker. Jacobson stood up to the Jew haters at Vassar, who include a substantial number of faculty members. The American professoriate has been deeply corrupted by leftists who put politics above all. The Daily News continues:\n\nThirty-nine professors protested after Hill properly said in January that Vassar would not join the American Studies Association\u2019s anti-Semitism-tinged call for boycotting Israeli universities. The 39 backed the boycott, with some asserting that Hill\u2019s action \u201csilenced discourse on campus,\u201d as one put it. Duh, they claim they want dialogue while supporting a boycott against dialogue. Then it turned out that the 39 lacked the courage of their convictions. When Cornell University Law School professor Bill Jacobson challenged the entire group to debate the merits of boycotting Israel, they all ducked. So on May 5, Jacobson spoke \u2014 without fee \u2014 on campus at the invitation of the Vassar Conservative Libertarian Union, which is headed by a Muslim student. The libertarian union had sought co-sponsorships for Jacobson\u2019s talk from numerous student groups and academic departments. All refused, a fact that demonstrates how strongly anti-Israel sentiment holds sway at Vassar, perhaps inducing a climate of fear among those who feel otherwise. Consider that five days before Jacobson\u2019s visit, Israel-bashers Ali Abunimah and Max Blumenthal stopped at Vassar on a national road show selling separate books calling for Israel\u2019s destruction. Paid for by student activity fees and departmental funds, their event was sponsored not only by SJP but by Vassar\u2019s departments of religion, political science, sociology, English and geography.\n\nSo at Vassar, student funds are used to pay for anti-Semites, but those who speak against them must appear gratis. It is good that the president is finally acting, but this has taken far too long. Higher education in America has fallen into barbarian hands in too many instances.\n\n*corrected from adjunct", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/05/vile_at_vassar.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-05/192423_5_.png", "title": "Blog: 'Vile at Vassar'"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc261\"", "article_summary": "So at Vassar, student funds are used to pay for anti-Semites, but those who speak against them must appear gratis.\nAfter allowing an anti-Semitic, anti-Israel infection to fester for months, the president of Vassar College has finally taken a stand for academic freedom and decency.\nJacobson stood up to the Jew haters at Vassar, who include a substantial number of faculty members.\nSo on May 5, Jacobson spoke \u2014 without fee \u2014 on campus at the invitation of the Vassar Conservative Libertarian Union, which is headed by a Muslim student.\nAll refused, a fact that demonstrates how strongly anti-Israel sentiment holds sway at Vassar, perhaps inducing a climate of fear among those who feel otherwise."}
