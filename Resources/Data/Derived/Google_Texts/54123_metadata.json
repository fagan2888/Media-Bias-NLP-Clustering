Paul Ryan came to Congress as a 28-year-old policy wonk who had already established his chops in Washington, D.C. Working as a speechwriter for the late Rep. Jack Kemp and serving as a legislative director on Capitol Hill gave Ryan a perspective on the policy battles that play out in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nOver the course of his 16 years in the House, he led the Budget Committee and currently serves as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He was also tapped to be Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate in 2012. During his time in Congress, he\u2019s accumulated a lifetime average of 63 percent on the Heritage Action scorecard and an 83 percent lifetime score from the Club for Growth.\n\nNow, as he considers a run for House speaker\u2014a job he\u2019ll only do if all factions of the GOP stand behind him\u2014The Daily Signal takes a look at some of the key issues that have shaped Ryan\u2019s career.\n\n1) Abortion: Ryan has supported pro-life legislation and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. According to Politico, Ryan said: \u201cI support the rights of the unborn child. Personally, I believe that life begins at conception, and it is for that reason that I feel we need to protect that life as we would protect other children.\u201d\n\n2) Budget: Ryan has spearheaded several budget proposals during his time at the House Budget Committee. Ryan\u2019s 2014 proposal sought to \u201cbalance the budget within 10 years by cutting spending, reforming poverty programs, and importantly, reforming the health care entitlements,\u201d according to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Romina Boccia. However, conservatives haven\u2019t always approved. One of his plans, the 2013 Ryan-Murray spending deal, was criticized for including a backdoor tax increase in the form of \u201cuser fees.\u201d\n\n3) Education: Ryan voted for No Child Left Behind in 2001 before supporting the A-PLUS Act to give more control over funding to local communities. \u201cMany educators and parents have expressed frustration with the numerous federal requirements that have come with NCLB funding,\u201d Ryan said in a 2012 statement. \u201cThe A-PLUS Act allows local school districts to implement their own, individual education plans.\u201d\n\n4) Energy: Ryan opposed President Barack Obama\u2019s cap-and-trade initiative. In the 2012 Path to Prosperity proposal, Ryan wrote that the \u201cheavy-handed regulations circumvent accountability to voters and leave decisions in the hands of a bureaucratic infrastructure \u2026 [tying] the hands of small businesses and create a hostile and uncertain business environment.\u201d\n\n5) Financial Bailout: In 2008, Ryan voted for the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. He argued the vote was consistent with his free-market philosophy. \u201cI\u2019m going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles,\u201d Ryan said in a floor speech, \u201cin order to preserve this free-enterprise system.\u201d\n\n6) Gun Rights: Ryan has been a strong proponent of gun rights, voting numerous times against background checks and in favor of pro-gun legislation. A bow hunter, Ryan is also a member of the Congressional Sportsmen\u2019s Caucus.\n\n7) Health Care: Ryan has opposed Obamacare since its passage and recently helped spearhead partial repeal by means of the budgetary tool known as reconciliation. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix a fundamentally broken law; you\u2019ve got to replace it,\u201d he wrote in USA Today.\n\n8) International: Ryan wanted to lift the Cuban embargo before supporting it. In 2002, he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that \u201cif we think engagement works well with China, well, it ought to work well with Cuba.\u201d After \u201clearning from friendships just how brutal the Castro regime is,\u201d Ryan has changed his position, The New York Times reported.\n\n9) Immigration: Ryan has supported immigration reform bills that included amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants. Last summer, he outlined a vision that included a pathway to citizenship, bolstered border security, and a fast-track to legal status for the children of illegal immigrants. \u201cPeople say, \u2018amnesty!\u2019 No, it\u2019s taking a problem that\u2019s intractable, that\u2019s been around forever, and trying to fix it in a way that as best guarantees as you can that we\u2019re not going to be in the same [situation] 10 years from now,\u201d he told Hillsdale College students, according to National Review.\n\n10) Labor Unions: Ryan remains unwavering in his support of federally mandated, prevailing wages. Opposed by national labor groups like the AFL-CIO, Ryan has enjoyed the support of local Wisconsin unions for his backing of the Davis-Bacon Act. \u201cHe\u2019s supported us on every Davis-Bacon vote that\u2019s been held,\u201d Wisconsin State Council of Carpenters Executive Director Mark Reihl told Mother Jones.\n\n11) Marriage: Ryan voted in 2006 in favor of the Marriage Protection Act, a constitutional amendment that defined marriage as being between a man and a woman. In 2007, though, he supported legislation that would ban workplace discrimination against gays and lesbians. Defending his vote, he told reporters, it wasn\u2019t as if employees \u201c[roll] out of bed one morning and choose to be gay. That\u2019s who they are.\u201d\n\n12) National Security: Ryan voted to go to war in both Afghanistan and Iraq, later opposing an early military withdrawal. \u201cI believe that the continued engagement in Afghanistan is necessary, and demands careful consideration for the safety of both our armed forces and citizens,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n13) School Choice: Ryan has supported increasing school choice options for families. \u201cSending your child to a great school should not be a privilege of the well-to-do,\u201d Ryan said in a 2012 speech. \u201cI believe that choice should be available to every parent in our country, wherever they live. Education reform is urgent, and freedom is the key.\u201d In 2011, Ryan voted to reauthorize the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, legislation that increased school choice opportunities for families inside the District of Columbia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looking at his long history of House votes.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Looking at his long history of House votes.", "title": "Here Is Where Paul Ryan Stands on 13 Key Policy Issues", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151021_PaulRyan1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-26T14:13:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NV9vM3"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Looking at his long history of House votes.", "title": "Here Is Where Paul Ryan Stands on 13 Key Policy Issues", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151021_PaulRyan1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House", "published_time": "2015-10-21T21:56:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-26T14:13:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "paul ryan, immigration,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb8f\"", "article_summary": "13) School Choice: Ryan has supported increasing school choice options for families.\nEducation reform is urgent, and freedom is the key.\u201d In 2011, Ryan voted to reauthorize the D.C.\nRep.
