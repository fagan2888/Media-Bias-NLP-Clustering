Her goal was to address \u201cmisconceptions\u201d. She left out the truth.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, performing (and profiting from) one out of every three abortions in the U.S. In 2009, abortion was a \u201cservice\u201d that Planned Parenthood provided to 12 percent of its patients overall, and to 97.6 percent of its patients who reported themselves pregnant. It performed 332,278 abortions in that one year alone. That is an average of 910 abortions each and every day.\n\nSince the average cost of an early surgical abortion was $451, abortion accounted for approximately 37 percent of Planned Parenthood\u2019s health-care-center income that year. And that figure \u2014 nearly $150 million in revenue from abortion \u2014 is a low estimate, considering that PP also performs later and more expensive abortions.\n\nPP 2012-2013 annual report states 327,000 ABORTIONS and $540.6 Million in TAX DOLLARS which came in the form of Federal Grants.\n\nThis coming from the same government that swears they are not using taxpayer funds to pay for abortions. Now PP has moved on to teaching our children some of the rather nasty and dark side of sex.\n\nOver the past 2010-2012 reported years PP performed 990,575 abortions. That is 149 abortions to every adoption referral.\n\n\u2022 Planned Parenthood increases its abortion numbers with each passing year, bucking the nearly 20-year national trend of a decreasing abortion rate. At the time of the 2009 article, PP was performing nearly double the number of abortions it did in the 10 years prior. Over the last 12 years, taxpayer funding also doubled and it reduced their other pregnancy related services:\n\n1. Only 997 adoptions in 2009 in contrast to the 2,999 referrals it made in 1999\n\n2. PP\u2019s clients for prenatal care dropped from 18,878 to only 7,021.\n\nWhistleblower Abby Johnson, the former director of Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinic in Bryan, Texas states: her superiors gave her \u201cthe clear and distinct understanding that she was to get her priorities straight, that abortion was where her priorities needed to be because that\u2019s where the revenue was.\u201d\n\nPP set itself up for a goal by 2013 to have Skype to dispense abortion-inducing drugs and its mandate that all affiliates provide abortion services also indicates that the organization wants its abortion-increasing trend to continue.\n\nAffiliates of PP have failed to be good stewards of taxpayer funds. A CA audit report showed that in one year alone PP of San Diego and Riverside Counties received $5 million more than it should have because of improper billing practices.\n\nContrary to Ms. Coleman\u2019s claim, PP does have sources of money other than the government dole. In fact, for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2009, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) and its affiliates reported receiving $308.2 million in \u201cPrivate Contributions and Bequests.\u201d It also made $404.9 million in \u201cHealth Center Income.\u201d Though individual affiliates have recorded losses, PP overall reported an \u201cexcess of revenue over expenses\u201d of $63.4 million in 2009.\n\nWith George Soros\u2019 son Jonathan\u2019s wife Jennifer Allan Soros sitting on the PP Board of Directors, Open Society has over the years given over $2.5M to PP.\n\n\u2022 Planned Parenthood fights reasonable laws to protect women and girls because such laws might undermine its ability to make money. Their big fight is to consistently stop legislation making the reporting of sexual abuse mandatory.\n\n\u2022 Planned Parenthood partners with those who sexually abuse and exploit women and girls. PP has shown itself to be a perfect partner to the pimp, sex trafficker, or child abuser. They hide his crimes through its willful failure to report suspected sexual abuse of children to authorities and its refusal to comply with parental-involvement laws.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is a non-profit/for-profit of which donated to the Obama campaign so far through various PAC\u2019s of over $6M of YOUR money from which it receives over 50% of its annual budget from you \u2013 the taxpayer.\n\nJust who is Cecile Richards, the President of Planned Parenthood who is paid in excess of $500,000 a year for being the one and only CEO of LEGALIZED MURDER? Well, she is now 57 years old and has been a hell-raiser since high school: a student protester in her teens; in her 20s, an itinerant union organizer; in her 30s, a campaign strategist for her mother, late Texas Gov. Ann Richards; a foe of the religious right in her 40s; in her 50s, a leading abortion rights advocate who earns over $500,000 a year.\n\nRichards, the former deputy chief of staff to Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), fondly describes her journey from being a young girl working on political campaigns to being at the helm of Planned Parenthood as having her life \u201ccome full circle.\u201d In 2008, Ms. Richards declared, \u201cWe aim to be the largest kick-butt political organization.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is not only political, it\u2019s increasingly partisan. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME), a pro-choice Republican who was endorsed and supported by Planned Parenthood Action Fund until she voted in favor of Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s confirmation to the U.S, Supreme Court ruling, has observed, \u201cWhy should I try to make their case (PP) in the Republican caucus? I can\u2019t answer my colleagues when they say to me that Planned Parenthood is just a political party, because it is true.\u201d\n\nWomen and men alike who love children have to wonder how Richards, who is a symbol of \u201cradical feminism,\u201d can support abortion having three children of her own.\n\nSince Richards says she doesn\u2019t believe life begins until the moment of birth, I would like the opportunity to ask her just what is happening within her belly when she feels the movement of the baby. So this isn\u2019t human? Not a living being?\n\nAt 3 weeks a full set of DNA; 4 weeks embryo; 5 weeks heart beats; 6 weeks eyes and nose forming; arm & leg buds; 8 weeks arms & legs growing; along with nose and upper lip; 9 weeks eyes have developed though the eyelids are still shut; 10 weeks embryo now a fetus w/all vital organs functioning \u2013 fingernails & toenails; 11 weeks almost totally formed, bones hardening, genitalia developing, the baby can hiccup; 12 weeks you can hear the heartbeat. [Link]\n\nHow, as a mother, she can justify helping facilitate the dismemberment of an unborn child, which is exactly what happens during an abortion, piece by piece, is beyond me.\n\nRichards states her main concern is a woman being able to control their own bodies and make their own decisions. That child or woman that is raped certainly had no control over her body and by offering abortion versus adoption of that baby; they have created a double sense of guilt for that woman.\n\nWhat Richards isn\u2019t telling you is that she cares more about the MONEY, POWER & CONTROL abortion brings to her world.\n\nA life-long \u201ccommunity organizer and activist\u201d, Richards is married to Kirk Adams, who has also been a lifelong labor union organizer and has risen to executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU.\n\nFor our children in school -\n\nNational Sexuality Education Standards format:\n\n\u2022 By the end of 2nd grade children are to be able to identify all parts of the body to include the genitals of both males and females\n\n\u2022 Explain that all living things reproduce\n\n\u2022 Identify the different types of family structures: mom and dad, 2 moms; 2 dads\n\n\u2022 By 3rd grade they are to be able to make models of reproductive organs using Ping-Pong balls, straws and other objects.\n\n\u2022 By the end of the 5th grade to explain the changes that occur during puberty and how it ready\u2019s the human body for reproduction along with identifying sexual orientation\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Teachings:\n\nThey have produced a sexuality education course aimed at children age 4 through 7 titled STRAIGHT TALK. Here are some quotes from the book:\n\n\u2022 \"It's perfectly normal for children of about the same age to engage in sex play with members of the same or opposite sex.\" page 34\n\n\u2022 \"Masturbation is perfectly normal and not harmful.... a child should not be made to feel guilty about her interest in her body.\" page 35\n\n\u2022 \"When discussing masturbation with an older child (age 7) it may be appropriate to say that girls and women also masturbate.\" page 24\n\nFor Teenagers:\n\n\u2022 Through Twitter and Facebook they answered the question \u201cIs promiscuity a bad thing?\u201d and Alex the \u201cexpert,\u201d pronounced through Planned Parenthood\u2019s Tumbler, FB and Twitter: \u201cSince the number of sexual partners you\u2019ve had doesn\u2019t say anything about your character, your morals, or your personality \u2013 or about anything at all really\u2013there\u2019s nothing bad or unhealthy about having a big number of sexual partners.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Teaching teenagers about bondage, sadism, encouraging violence in bed, pornography, gagging, whipping and asphyxiation\n\n\u2022 PP employees ignoring reports of rape, encouraging abortions and promiscuity\n\n\u2022 In these and forthcoming videos, Planned Parenthood counselors encourage undercover investigators posing as 15 and 16-year-old teens, to engage in the sadomasochistic practices, telling the underage teens \u201cif it\u2019s consensual, it\u2019s OK\u2026 it\u2019s totally OK.\u201d\n\n\u2022 PP employee explains to the investigator, several sexually deviant concepts, such as role-play and the use of whips and handcuffs to inflict pain on a sexual partner. \u201cYou could be a dominatrix-type of person,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere you dress in all leather, with the whips and the handcuffs.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt just depends what type of pain you can take.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sex selection in America Pt. 1, SEXED: Dangerous Sex Advice for Kids, and SEXED: Dangerous Sex Advice for Kids No. 2, Specific Planned Parenthood Sex Education Programs.\n\nIf you have teenagers you might want to check out this site overseen by teenagers and college kids answering sex questions for kids www.SexOutLoud.com.

Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, YWCA and Nationwide Ins.\n\nAnd the very latest Indoctrination by Planned Parenthood \u2013 GENDERBREAD PERSON!\n\nI remember when I was in high school and we got touches of sex education. You are right \u2013 back then we didn\u2019t get a lot of any kind of sex education from our parents or anyone else. We learned along with our mate. We had a great deal less of out of wedlock pregnancy and the things mentioned here.\n\nNow we have the schools and Planned Parenthood giving our kids a sex education they aren\u2019t ready for to include indoctrination and recruitment of high school children into the ranks of the LGBT movement. How dare they overstep their position into the personal lives of our children?\n\nWho\u2019s afraid of the Genderbread Person? If you care about children, especially if you are a parent, you had better be! Did anyone ask your permission for your child to be involved in this? I would advise you check with his or her school.\n\nGender identity is the theme of today\u2019s sexual indoctrination and Planned Parenthood and your school system wants to make your child as confused as they can in the hopes they will begin to question who they really are. The point \u2013 since gays cannot reproduce PP is forced to recruit to expand their ranks. Failing that, they want all the heterosexual children to start having as much sex as possible because abortion operations are what pay the bills.\n\nWithin the walls of our schools today, it is a spiritual battleground especially in trying to turn our children against any and all Christian upbringing or beliefs. They are even using this method on children around the country as young as 10 with fairs passing out literature, giving demonstrations and the ACLU publishing a \u201cKnow Your Rights: A Guide for Public School Students in Washington. The ACLU is basically telling your child what his rights are, ages 14-18. Page 27 is a good place to see what this state supports.\n\nParents, are you sure you believe this?\n\n\" We are a trusted health care provider, an informed educator, a passionate advocate, and a global partner helping similar organizations around the world. Planned Parenthood delivers vital reproductive health care, sex education, and information to millions of women, men, and young people worldwide.\"\n\nGuard your babies as they are the target for everything from indoctrination in the schools to the hands of human trafficker\u2019s.
