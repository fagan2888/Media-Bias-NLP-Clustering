His most-recent act of foolishness is signing himself up for Obamacare \u2014 while snapping shots to the press \u2014 in order to get the last laugh at how expensive and complicated the ordeal is. Maybe that sounded like a good idea to him in theory, but like many of his past attempts at mocking President Barack Obama, reality smacked him upside the head.\n\nSpeaker Boehner\u2019s spokesman, Michael Steel, has confirmed to CNN that the Republican leader will take thousands of dollars in government support to help with the costs of the new healthcare program. But, but, but\u2026what about the nanny state? Government sugar daddy? All those pestering poor folks looking for \u201cgovernment handouts?\u201d\n\nSteel told CNN that \u201cWashington Democrats chose not to make that change.\u201d However, as the news organization points out there are \u201cseveral other members of Congress who chose to return their premium support to the Treasury.\u201d So why not you, Mr. Speaker?\n\nNonetheless, Boehner described the process as \u201cpretty frustrating,\u201d but all and all he got a better deal for an individual plan that mirrored the Blue Cross Blue Shield one he currently has as a part of the federal employees health package.\n\nOn the differences:\n\nThe current cost for Boehner and his wife? They \u201cpay a monthly premium of $433,\u201d said Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck. The new plan for the two of them? It \u201cwould cost $802 per month in premiums,\u201d Buck said. That is an 85 percent leap. But, Boehner\u2019s wife is about to go on Medicare, so he will get an individual plan. That cost? $449 a month. Boehner\u2019s office notes he will now be paying more for one person in the Obamacare exchange than he was for two people in the federal employees plan. Deductibles for the Boehners will jump from $700 to about $2,000.\n\nBoehner\u2019s age along with being a smoker is being cited as a reason for the higher costs, though there\u2019s more than meets the eye when it comes to his jump in premium.\n\nSalon\u2019s Brian Beutler writes that \u201cthese numbers actually prove the law is working very well in Washington, D.C. \u2014 but that reality is obscured by the fact that Boehner has been benefiting from a hidden, expiring government entitlement for the past several years.\u201d\n\nBoehner does not provide intel on what plan he chose on the site, but Beutler did a generic profile based on his age and income (without noting he was a smoker) and found that Boehner was eligible for a \u201cbronze\u201d plan with a $6,000 annual deductible for $372.14 a month. That is, as the Los Angeles Times\u2018 Michael Hiltzik notes, only 2 percent of Boehner\u2019s wages. Moreover, \u201dA gold-level plan including dental coverage and no deductible would set Boehner back about $700 a month, or 3.8 percent of Boehner\u2019s wages.\u201d\n\nHiltzik goes on to make the important note:\n\nObamacare rules typically allow for a premium to cost no more than 9.5 percent of household income for lesser \u201csilver\u201d plans. That limit comes from premium subsidies granted to households earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line. In other words, Boehner would be way ahead of most Americans.\n\nSo Boehner is not getting a bad deal in the least, and if anything, only further proves that he and his fellow Republicans share a large share of the blame of their own \u201cnightmares\u201d about the program. After all, it\u2019s Senate GOP members that called on legislators and their staffs get their insurance from the individual exchanges in the first place. The move was an attempt to undermine passage of the Affordable Health Care Act. It didn\u2019t work, and now the end result is Boehner is going from one great health care plan to another\u2026with subsidies.\n\nAs for those website headaches Boehner complained about, again, look at your party. Those are the people responsible for purposely sabotaging the rollout of the site. It\u2019s not their entire fault, but they were a huge impediment all the same.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve gotten another publicity stunt out of the way, can we finally move to something more substantive, Mr. Speaker?\n\nMichael Arceneaux is a Houston-bred, Howard-educated writer.
