Nationwide, across all product lines, the average rating was a 3.5.\n\nLocally, for the private plans, Buffalo-based HealthNow New York, which operates locally as BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York, received 4.5 out of five.\n\n\u201cThe most recent NCQA rankings reflect that our commitment to quality, even in the midst of implementing ACA mandates, will not waver,\u201d Julie Snyder, a HealthNow spokeswoman, said in a statement, referring to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIndependent Health of Amherst also received a 4.5 rating for its health maintenance organization, or HMO, and its point of service, or POS, plans, while the committee reported partial data for Independent Health\u2019s preferred provider organization, or PPO.\n\n\u201cThe NCQA ratings serve as a valuable tool for consumers to assess plan performance,\u201d Dr. Michael W. Cropp, president and CEO of Independent Health, said in a statement.\n\nUnivera Healthcare of Amherst, part of Rochester\u2019s Excellus BlueCross BlueShield, earned a rating of 4.0.\n\nFor the insurers\u2019 Medicare plans, HealthNow\u2019s HMO and PPO both earned 4.5; Independent Health\u2019s HMO earned 4.5 and its PPO, which enrolls far fewer members, earned 3.5; and Univera\u2019s HMO earned 4.5 while the company does not have a Medicare PPO plan.\n\n\u201cOur star ratings are similar to other upstate plans, which reinforces the value of nonprofit plans since nonprofit plans scored higher than most for-profit plans,\u201d Peter Kates, a Univera spokesman, said in an email.\n\nAnd for their Medicaid plans, HealthNow received a 4.0 rating and Independent Health received 4.0 for its Medicaid HMO plan. A plan operated in partnership by Univera Healthcare and Monroe Plan of Rochester, Univera Community Health, received a 3.0 rating from the committee. Univera Healthcare has since withdrawn from the partnership, and Monroe Plan has changed the name of the plan to YourCare Health Plan.\n\nThe National Committee for Quality Assurance has changed from the ranking system it previously published each fall, in partnership with U.S. News & World Report and Consumer Reports, to a rating plan that closely follows the star-rating system used by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to evaluate Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nThe committee is continuing to work with Consumer Reports, which will mention the ratings on its website and in the November edition of its magazine.
