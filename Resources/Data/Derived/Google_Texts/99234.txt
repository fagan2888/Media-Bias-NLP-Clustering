Twelve Hub Territory wrestlers will compete for championships today after semi-final wins on Friday.

Kearney Catholic has two in Class C, Amherst has two in Class D and Pleasanton has two in Class D.

It’s a first for Pleasanton, which is “getting to be” a wrestling town, according to coach Dan Fisher.

Last year, the Bulldogs produced their first-ever state champion, Colton Lammers. This year, freshman Tyler Pawloski at 120 pounds and senior Trey Keaschall at 285 pounds.

“We brought 2 down and they’re both in the finals,” Fischer said.
