Jim Himes:\n\nWestport resident Ann Chrisman, a self-employed single mother with breast cancer, was one of 10 Americans to meet with President Obama today to discuss how the Affordable Care Act has improved their lives.\n\nIn a floor statement, Congressman Jim Himes (CT-4) opposed the House Republicans\u2019 latest attempt to take health coverage away from Chrisman and millions of other Americans who have gained insurance under the law. His remarks can be watched here.\n\nIn July 2014, Chrisman, a 51-year-old mother of three and licensed massage therapist, wrote a letter to President Obama saying that she could not afford health insurance. But when the Health Insurance Marketplace opened, Chrisman learned that she qualified for Medicaid in Connecticut. That coverage finally gave her the chance to see a doctor \u2013 and catch her breast cancer early.\n\nIn her letter to the President, Chrisman wrote, \u201cThe cancer has been detected at a very early stage, which, with a 98 percent survival rate, has saved my life! Moreover, the cost of this screening and minor procedure will be far less than the cost of treating a more developed cancer. Thank you, Mr. President, for assuring the passage of this critical legislation. You have profoundly improved the quality of my life.\u201d\n\nHimes said, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has helped millions of Americans gain health insurance coverage while reducing Connecticut\u2019s uninsured rate by half. It means that Ann Chrisman, a 51-year-old single mother who couldn\u2019t afford health care before, now has coverage. She went to a doctor and her breast cancer was diagnosed early, giving her a 98 percent chance to survive.\n\n\u201cToday, House Republicans made their 56th attempt to take health insurance away from Ann and millions of other families that now have health security for the first time. Instead of continuing their partisan attacks on health reform, Republicans should be working with Democrats to make sure more middle-class and low-income Americans feel the benefits of our economic recovery.\u201d\n\nSince the launch of Access Health CT, Connecticut\u2019s uninsured rate has been cut in half. During this year\u2019s enrollment period, which ends Feb. 15, 95,244 residents statewide have enrolled in private insurance plans, including 29,388 new enrollees. In addition, 400,707 Connecticut residents have enrolled in Medicaid through Access Health since October 2013.\n\nAbout 10 million Americans gained health insurance in 2014 because of the Affordable Care Act, according to the White House. In the first two months of 2015 open enrollment, 9.5 million Americans have selected or were automatically reenrolled in coverage through marketplaces while others obtained coverage through Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nSince the launch of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s first open enrollment period, more than 10.1 million Americans have enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP, according to the Obama administration.\n\nPhoto: President Barack Obama hugs one of the letter writers in the Oval Office after an Affordable Care Act roundtable meeting with them in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Feb. 3, 2015.
