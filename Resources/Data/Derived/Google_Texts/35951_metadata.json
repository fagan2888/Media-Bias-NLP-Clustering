The rate of parents opting out by filing what\u2019s called a \u201cpersonal belief exemption,\u201d or PBE, doubled over seven years.\n\nParents check a school\u2019s test scores in advance. Why not vaccine rates?\n\nEarlier this month, State of Health published a chart where people could look up any elementary school in California and see the PBE rate at their children\u2019s schools.\n\nHours after we published, Cosmo Garvin of Sacramento sent me a tweet. \u201cReally nice work,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cBut just found out PBE rate at my kid\u2019s school is 32 percent. Should I freak out?\u201d\n\nThirty-two percent. That means one in three kids is not vaccinated.\n\nAssessing Risk to Your Own Child\n\nGarvin\u2019s son is 9 years old and just transferred into a new school in Sacramento, a public school with a private school name: Alice Birney Waldorf-Inspired K-8. Our chart includes data over a seven-year period, from the 2007-2008 school year to the 2013-2014 school year, the most recent for which data are available. The PBE rate at Alice Birney during that stretch has ranged from 24 to 33 percent, meaning in the best year, only about three-fourths of children are vaccinated.\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a preferred vaccination rate is, officials would love to see it as close to 100 percent as possible.\n\nGarvin said he and his wife made a conscious decision to go to this school, but \u201cit never occurred to me to check the vaccination rate,\u201d he told me.\n\nHis major question was what the low vaccination rate at the school meant to the health of his son. The state\u2019s own tool to assess vulnerability of a school showed that Alice Birney\u2019s low vaccination rate put it in the \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d category. If a disease is introduced into a community with such a low vaccination rate, there is danger it would spread \u2014 and fast.\n\nSo what should Garvin do? He says both his children, his 9-year-old and an older son in high school, are up to date for all recommended vaccines. He also said they are healthy, with no chronic conditions.\n\nGil Chavez, state epidemiologist with the California Department of Public Health, was reassuring. \u201cAs long as children are up to date on vaccines,\u201d he said, \u201cthey should be protected against vaccine-preventable diseases.\u201d\n\nBut for those kids who are not vaccinated, the risks are great. California saw a measles outbreak earlier this year and a high percentage of the cases occurred in people who were intentionally unvaccinated. In 2010, a whooping cough epidemic swept across California. Ten infants died. Babies cannot be vaccinated against whooping cough until they are 2 months old and are reliant on the blanket of protection from all the rest of us being vaccinated. Later research showed that vaccine refusal fueled the epidemic.\n\nIn the event of an outbreak, the first thing health officials do is determine who is vaccinated and who is not. Dr. Olivia Kasirye, health officer for Sacramento County, says the county health department is aware of the handful of schools with low vaccination rates.\n\n\u201cParents need to be aware that if there is a situation with an outbreak, that they can be required to keep their child out of school until the outbreak is over,\u201d Kasirye said. That could be two weeks, perhaps more, depending on the disease.\n\nGabe Ross, spokesman for the Sacramento City Unified School District, said that it\u2019s the district\u2019s goal to have \u201ca 100 percent immunization rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe work hard at the schools with higher op-out rates to make sure that parents truly understand the issue, truly understand the risk with their kids and are making informed decisions,\u201d he said.\n\nConsidering Opt-Out Rates in Advance\n\nNow let\u2019s take it back a step. What about parents who have school choice and are looking at schools? \u201cA lot of people want to know the test scores before they (select a school),\u201d Garvin said. \u201cI feel like (the PBE rate) is something you should know before you go.\u201d\n\nOf particular note are parents of children who do have a chronic health issue. How much should a school\u2019s PBE rate matter to them? \u201cIt\u2019s hard to give a blanket answer in a situation like that,\u201d Kasirye told me, \u201cbut definitely one thing would be to talk to a health care provider and say \u2018I\u2019m considering this school and this is what I\u2019ve found out, what are your thoughts.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBerkeley pediatrician Olivia Lang has faced that exact issue. Her practice no longer accepts families that refuse all vaccinations for their children. She stressed that she could not make school decision for parents, but did share her medical opinion. \u201cI\u2019ve had parents worry about a school with a 35 percent opt-out rate,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say, \u2018Does this pose a risk to my child?\u2019 And I\u2019ve said, \u2018Yes, it does.\u2019 I\u2019ve had families who\u2019ve chosen not to attend a certain school because of that.\u201d\n\nSince the state publishes these data, it\u2019s become easier for families to take the opt-out rate into account. Dr. James Watt, chief of the communicable disease branch at the California Department of Public Health, said he hopes that greater awareness of high opt-out rates will \u201cspark a discussion\u201d at the school level.\n\nMedical vs. Personal Belief Exemption\n\nOne final note: There are two types of exemptions from vaccines.\n\nSome children have medical conditions, and vaccines may be detrimental to their health. In California, these children may receive a medical exemption from their physician. In 2013-2014, 0.19 percent of children had permanent medical exemptions.\n\nBut a personal belief exemption, or PBE, is different. This is a signed statement from a parent indicating that vaccines are against his or her personal beliefs. Last year in California, 3.15 percent of children had such an exemption.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sacramento father had used KQED's chart to look up the vaccine rate at his son's school.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Vaccine Opt-Out Rate at Son's School is 32% -- 'Should I Freak Out?'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/09\\/26\\/vaccine-opt-out-rate-at-sons-school-is-32-percent-should-i-freak-out\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-26 11:09:28\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-27 20:28:55\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21751,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Children's Health\",\"Science\",\"Vaccine\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Living Healthy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2012\\/05\\/Vaccination-Large-Jeff-J-Mitchell-Getty-e1411754682989.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Sacramento father had used KQED's chart to look up the vaccine rate at his son's school.", "title": "Vaccine Opt-Out Rate at Son\u2019s School is 32% \u2014 \u2018Should I Freak Out?\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/09/26/vaccine-opt-out-rate-at-sons-school-is-32-percent-should-i-freak-out/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2012/05/Vaccination-Large-Jeff-J-Mitchell-Getty-620x398.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "children\\'s health,science,vaccine", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda99b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut just found out PBE rate at my kid\u2019s school is 32 percent.\nIf you\u2019re wondering what a preferred vaccination rate is, officials would love to see it as close to 100 percent as possible.\nIf a disease is introduced into a community with such a low vaccination rate, there is danger it would spread \u2014 and fast.\nHow much should a school\u2019s PBE rate matter to them?\nHis major question was what the low vaccination rate at the school meant to the health of his son."}
