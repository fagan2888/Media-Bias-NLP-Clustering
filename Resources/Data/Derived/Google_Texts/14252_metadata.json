We aren\u2019t a bank, we don\u2019t take deposits and we don\u2019t have branches. We just make loans to Tulsa-area entrepreneurs. We are all about economic development and job creation.\n\nTEDC has been instrumental in retaining or creating 313 jobs during the past five years and is expected to grow that number by 24 percent over the next 12 months.\n\nI have been on the board for many years and the reason I stay is simple: I believe in the mission of TEDC and am convinced that the work we do not only improves the lives of our clients but improves Tulsa as well. We receive our funding through private donations, partnerships with local banks, federal loans and grants, and fee income we generate through operations.\n\nOur primary source of funding is through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, which are federal dollars administered by local municipalities, in our case the city of Tulsa. Many high-quality nonprofit organizations apply for this funding every year for programs that directly address social needs in the Tulsa community, and our tireless city council does a great job of making funding recommendations to the mayor.\n\nThese dollars are by definition a grant and are typically \u201cone direction\u201d in that they fund a program (a food bank, a building, quality child-care) and must be replenished next year. At TEDC, we take those grant dollars and put them into the community in the form of a loan. When that loan is paid back, we put the funds back into the community in the form of another loan. This allows us to use our funding over and over again.\n\nSince the dollars are grant funding and not investment capital, (as a bank might have) we can loan to businesses that might not fit at a \u201ctraditional\u201d bank. This is the type of funding that TEDC used to help finance the Save-A-Lot in partnership with Honor Capital LLC, Save-A-Lot and other community partners. Honor Capital is a veteran-owned and operated small business that has a mission to build community and create jobs by providing affordable, fresh food to underserved neighborhoods.\n\nIn this case, our CDBG-funded loan allowed us to be more flexible on underwriting and other loan terms than the store was able to secure with its current bank. Food deserts are a problem that affect thousands of members in a community, and TEDC felt very strongly about making this project happen. As a result we employed almost all of our 2015 allocation to make it happen. We are obviously excited about it.\n\nIn addition to our CDBG-funded loans, we have several other loan programs that allow us to assist small business owners in almost every aspect. We collaborate with the Small Business Administration to help businesses secure long-term funding for owner-occupied commercial real estate through SBA\u2019s 504 Program. We also work with the SBA on micro lending and local banks using the SBA\u2019s 7A program which is great for working capital and other needs.\n\nWe partnered with the George Kaiser Family Foundation and the Bank of Oklahoma to utilize New Market Tax Credits to construct the Matthews Warehouse project in the Brady District. We are, in fact, using many different programs to inject capital into Tulsa-area businesses and to help make entrepreneurs\u2019 dreams a reality.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "affordable housing,small business administration,community development block grant,casey stowe,tulsa economic development corporation,tulsa oklahoma,small business,honor capital llc,save-a-lot,george kaiser family foundation,bank of oklahoma,forward to many more worthwhile investments,food deserts,mayor,board member,heavy machinery,food bank,fresh food,brady district,finance,owner-occupied commercial real estate,city council,entrepreneur,bank,bank lending guidelines,businessviewpoint", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The Tulsa Economic Development Corporation is the most impactful economic development organization that you have (probably) never heard of.", "title": "Business Viewpoint with Casey Stowe: TEDC fosters small businesses to create lasting economic development", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/businessviewpoint/business-viewpoint-with-casey-stowe-tedc-fosters-small-businesses-to/article_35487a44-550b-58fc-93fe-a20e57ac77cb.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/75/c75f4c61-54cf-538a-b146-002bcc0d7dde/565501c1b2f8c.image.jpg?resize=451%2C630", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "affordable housing,small business administration,community development block grant,casey stowe,tulsa economic development corporation,tulsa oklahoma,small business,honor capital llc,save-a-lot,george kaiser family foundation,bank of oklahoma,forward to many more worthwhile investments,food deserts,mayor,board member,heavy machinery,food bank,fresh food,brady district,finance,owner-occupied commercial real estate,city council,entrepreneur,bank,bank lending guidelines,businessviewpoint", "description": "The Tulsa Economic Development Corporation is the most impactful economic development organization that you have (probably) never heard of."}, "article_summary": "With more than $50 million currently invested in the Tulsa small business community across businesses in fields ranging from heavy machinery to hospice, TEDC \u2014 a 501(c)3 organization \u2014 is putting its funding where it matters: in small businesses.\nThe organization makes loans to small businesses just outside traditional bank lending guidelines.\nThe Tulsa Economic Development Corporation is the most impactful economic development organization that you have (probably) never heard of.\nWe collaborate with the Small Business Administration to help businesses secure long-term funding for owner-occupied commercial real estate through SBA\u2019s 504 Program.\nWe are, in fact, using many different programs to inject capital into Tulsa-area businesses and to help make entrepreneurs\u2019 dreams a reality."}
