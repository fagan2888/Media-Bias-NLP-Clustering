This blunt declaration makes it increasingly difficult for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government to maintain the claim that the Kremlin has no involvement in the ongoing conflict on its border.\n\n\u201cRussian leaders are less and less able to conceal the fact that Russian soldiers are fighting \u2013 and dying \u2013 in large numbers in eastern Ukraine,\u201d Alexander Vershbow said at a conference in Latvia on Thursday, adding that NATO believes the deaths are making the conflict increasingly unpopular among Russians.\n\nRelated: Why Congress Thinks Obama Isn\u2019t a War President\n\nThe fighting in the eastern part of Ukraine, which began last year after Russian troops invaded the country\u2019s Crimean peninsula, has dropped off dramatically since a ceasefire agreement as reached last month. Yet skirmishing continues, particularly in the area between rebel-controlled territory and the city of Mariupol, widely seen as the next target of the Russia-backed rebels.\n\nIn recent days, evidence has been accumulating that the Russian people are starting to question their government\u2019s claim that any Russian soldier fighting in Ukraine is doing so as a volunteer \u2013 and while on vacation from standard duty.\n\nIn a powerful story published on Tuesday, Vice media reporter Lucy Kafanov interviewed the parents of Russian soldiers whose dead bodies, with wounds that could only have been sustained in combat, were returned to their hometowns. Certificates accompanying the soldiers\u2019 bodies claimed the men had been killed at a \u201cpoint of temporary dislocation.\u201d\n\nRussian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, one of the few independent Russian news outlets still in operation, published an interview earlier this week with a Russian soldier \u2013 a tanker \u2013 who suffered grisly wounds after his unit was deployed to fight in Ukraine, he said.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Delays Push Ukraine to Look Elsewhere for Arms\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that continued efforts by Russia to prevent Ukraine from maintaining control over its sovereign territory \u2013 particularly its border with Russia \u2013 would result in an increase in the financial sanctions that Western countries have imposed on Moscow over the past year.\n\nThe restoration of Kiev\u2019s control over the border is critical, Blinken said. \u201cUnless that happens and until that happens, Russia will always have, and President Putin will always have, the possibility to turn up the dial any time he wants,\u201d said Blinken, \u201csending weapons in, sending men in, materiel in, and reigniting the conflict.\u201d\n\nBlinken said that failure to allow Ukraine to control its own borders would prevent any lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Russia by the U.S. \u201cThe choice is clear, and it\u2019s up to President Putin,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nRelated: Putin Always Had a Plan for Ukraine \u2013 Just Not This One\n\nThe Kremlin, for its part, remains defiant. The U.S. recently announced it would be sending a few hundred troops to Western Ukraine, far from the fighting, to help train Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nKremlin officials on Thursday condemned the move as a \u201cprovocation\u201d that could further inflame the situation in Ukraine. Alexander Lukashevich, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Thursday that the U.S. trainers threaten Russia\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cKiev authorities and all the Ukrainian people should think about the possible consequences of such steps,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is evident that they are not trying to bring peace to the country,\u201d Lukashevich concluded.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As NATO estimates that thousands of Russians troops are serving in Ukraine and are dying there in \u201clarge\u201d numbers, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ability to keep pretending Russia has no involvement in the conflict becomes increasingly difficult.", "title": "Putin\u2019s Dead Soldiers Are Evidence of His Deceit", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/06/Putin-s-Dead-Soldiers-Are-Evidence-His-Deceit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/06/Putin-s-Dead-Soldiers-Are-Evidence-His-Deceit", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07212014_Putin_European_Union.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As NATO estimates that thousands of Russians troops are serving in Ukraine and are dying there in \u201clarge\u201d numbers, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s ability to keep pretending Russia has no involvement in the conflict becomes increasingly difficult.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Many Russian soldiers are dying in the fighting in Ukraine, according to the deputy secretary general of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\nThis blunt declaration makes it increasingly difficult for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government to maintain the claim that the Kremlin has no involvement in the ongoing conflict on its border.\nIn a powerful story published on Tuesday, Vice media reporter Lucy Kafanov interviewed the parents of Russian soldiers whose dead bodies, with wounds that could only have been sustained in combat, were returned to their hometowns.\nThe U.S. recently announced it would be sending a few hundred troops to Western Ukraine, far from the fighting, to help train Ukrainian soldiers.\nRelated: Putin Always Had a Plan for Ukraine \u2013 Just Not This OneThe Kremlin, for its part, remains defiant."}
