This development is cutting out health care companies and profiting middlemen, who exclude certain patients and impose administrative barriers, he explained.\n\nTotal spending on health care in the United States exceeds spending within the entire French economy, reflecting both steadily rising prices and overall inefficiency, Emanuel said. He noted that even though prices are going up, demand in the health industry continues to be for very low prices, and demand for high-quality hospitals lags further behind.\n\n\u201cIf that doesn\u2019t make a CEO of a hospital nervous and an insomniac, I\u2019m not sure what I can do,\u201d Emanuel said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed by President Obama in 2010, provides effective cost-control measures for medical insurance, simplifies claim processing and improves overall quality by implementing penalties and controls, Emanuel said. He also added that he predicts the system will integrate the use of insurance vouchers for employees so they can shop for the best deals online.\n\n\u201cIt needs to behave like it\u2019s running a business, not like it\u2019s running a program,\u201d he said of the United States government. However, he said there is no chance of the United States adopting a single-payer program.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see health care for all,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cjust not an American value.\u201d\n\nHe said he predicts that a number of hospitals will have to close following a more efficient restructuring of the health care system. When asked about job loss concerns, Emanuel explained that jobs would be shifted and redeployed in different capacities, not eliminated.\n\n\u201cHospitals are a grossly inefficient way of providing jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need 5,000 hospitals.\u201d\n\nACOs compete aggressively to provide care at lower prices and offer referrals to highly ranked centers for serious diseases like cancer, he said.\n\n\u201cThey have to figure out how to deliver more efficient aid in a coordinated way,\u201d he said of ACOs. \u201cThe one thing they lack to be listed on the [health care exchange market] is the financial risk management of insurance companies. But that can be bought.\u201d\n\nAs a result, insurance companies will have to either move into risk management or transform into integrated delivery systems by merging with a provider, Emanuel explained.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the health insurance companies that we all love to hate are going away,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this is the wave of the future.\u201d\n\nAlthough he acknowledged that there would be \u201cgrowing pains,\u201d Emanuel said most Americans will be better off after the system changes.\n\nEmanuel also discussed the future of academic medical centers, which he said are in peril because research and training do not bring in revenue and are subject to major budget cuts. Although patient care is their main form of income, they often overcharge consumers and could not compete with accountable care organizations unless they adapted, he said.\n\n\u201cThe dirty little secret is that most of what they do is commodity care,\u201d he said of university clinics, noting the triple cost of a colonoscopy at NYU medical center as compared to a community hospital.\n\nEmanuel recommended that academic institutions implement \u201clean production practices,\u201d which operate on five efficiency principles, to prevent their dissipation. These principles promote the use of the entire work force, decrease errors and miscommunications and increase efficiency while spurring constant improvement, he said.\n\nHe cited the University of Denver as an example, noting that it saved $159 million over six years and increased its clinical productivity by 20 percent without laying off any employees after implementing the production practices.\n\nAnother productive solution for medical schools, Emanuel said, is to transform the medical education system, which has not undergone significant reform since 1910. The current system puts little emphasis on health systems or policy and provides almost no clinical training outside of the hospital. The current system does not address issues of team work and integration, he added.\n\n\u201c[Students] are not prepared for the future,\u201d Emanuel said, adding that \u201cthey can barely talk with a patient.\u201d\n\nHe said that medical schools could solve this problem by shortening residencies and fellowships from four to three years and providing more practical experiences beyond the hospital.\n\nEzekiel Emanuel is a bioethicist and fellow at the Hastings Center, a nonprofit bioethics research institute. He has taught at the University of Pennsylvania since 2011, and holds a joint appointment at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and the Wharton School. Emanuel based his lecture on two of the \u201cmegatrends\u201d outlined in his new book \u201cReinventing American Healthcare.\u201d\n\nEmanuel\u2019s lecture, \u201cMegatrends in Healthcare,\u201d took place in Dodds Auditorium in Robertson Hall at 4:30 p.m. on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.6.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9dc9\"", "article_summary": "This development is cutting out health care companies and profiting middlemen, who exclude certain patients and impose administrative barriers, he explained.\n\u201cI do believe that the health insurance companies that we all love to hate are going away,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t see health care for all,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cjust not an American value.\u201dHe said he predicts that a number of hospitals will have to close following a more efficient restructuring of the health care system.\n\u201cThe one thing they lack to be listed on the [health care exchange market] is the financial risk management of insurance companies.\nTraditional health insurance companies will be replaced with Accountable Care Organizations by 2025, Ezekiel \u201cZeke\u201d Emanuel, chair of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania said to a packed lecture hall on Monday."}
