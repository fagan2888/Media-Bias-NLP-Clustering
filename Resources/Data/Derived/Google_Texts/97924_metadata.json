But let\u2019s start with a Fair and Balanced attack on Bill O\u2019Reilly, a disgrace to even the slimiest of carbon-based lifeforms.\n\nThere is a lot for which to criticize Loofah Lad. Feel free to take your pick of any of these headlines from the last 168 hours:\n\nIn fact, the Falafel King was feeling so good this week, he spiked the football. Watch as O\u2019Reilly Teases Jon Stewart over Departure: Where\u2019s He Gonna Mock Fox Now?\n\nNo one needs Comedy Central to make O\u2019Reilly look foolish, petty, and downright ugly. In a long, storied career with enough low points to challenge the Marianas Trench, The Spin-Like-A-Top-Zone hit a new low this week during a Watters\u2019 World segment.\n\nThis reporter has called Watters\u2019 World the laziest form of journalism, and/or comedy, both of which Jesse Watters tries to achieve simultaneously with his cute little Man on the Street movies. It\u2019s easy to make \u2018Merkins appear dumb: Stick a camera in their face, ask a few questions, and only use those answers that fulfill the reason you\u2019ve taken a camera crew out on location in the first place. Wash, rinse, repeat.\n\nHowever, This Bill O\u2019Reilly piece on homeless people might be the worst Fox News segment ever. Watch O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Shameful, Dehumanizing Segment On New York City\u2019s Homeless Population:\n\n\n\nThis segment of Jesse Watters\u2019 heartlessness and poor-shaming was noticed all across the Blogosphere: Addicting Info said, Fox News Reaches New Heights Of Racism By Shaming Homeless Black People In New York, while NewsHounds notes O\u2019Reilly\u2019s \u2018Investigation\u2019 Into NYC Homeless Is A Disgraceful Hit Job On The Poor And Mayor de Blasio:\n\nThere were no experts interviewed, no police officers, no city officials, no Penn Station managers. Watters didn\u2019t even cite any statistics or studies. Instead, he relied on a series of selectively edited, \u201cman on the street\u201d type interviews. For example, Watters asked a Caucasian woman, \u201cDoes it affect you psychologically when you see homeless people in and out of this area?\u201d An African American homeless person just happened to be in the background of the shot. A Caucasian man told Watters, \u201cI see the upswing. I see a lot more people basically living here. \u2026In the stairwells, in the back areas.\u201d A young African American girl told Watters, \u201cIt\u2019s kinda heartbreaking to see other people who don\u2019t have houses. They don\u2019t have money to buy food and it\u2019s a possibility they could die from that.\u201d Later, the same girl admitted the homeless scare her \u201cbecause you never know what they could do.\u201d\n\nWatch the original video. Virtually every shot is framed to show a homeless person in the background, unless they\u2019re front and center in the foreground. There is absolutely nothing in this entire segment that would fall under the rubric of Fair & Balanced, which I\u2019m sure was the point.\n\nThe Young Turks Destroy O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Attempt To Blame Homeless On De Blasio, while \u2014 inadvertently \u2014 Fox Legal Eagle Arthur Aidala\u2019s little nephew destroys Jesse Watters. Check out how this kid proves that any untrained chimp can do a Watters\u2019 World segment. Also note how much more refreshing it is without Watters\u2019 self-satisfied smirk.

Fox News Rallies To Defend Donald Trump After NBC Announces Split, as even \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 Defends Donald Trump After NBC Cuts Ties.\n\nMeanwhile, Megyn Kelly Uses Ann Coulter\u2019s Book To Defend Donald Trump\u2019s Comments About Immigrants because Megyn Kelly Thinks Donald Trump Has A Point About Those Bad Mexicans. As a Fox News Contributor Instructs GOP Presidential Candidates To Follow Trump\u2019s Lead On Immigration, Fox\u2019s Eric Bolling [says]: People Calling For Boycotts Of Trump Products Are \u201cEconomic Terrorists.\u201d\n\nFar more instructive is Fox News vs. Fox News Latino: NBC Dumps Trump Edition. As MMfA\u2019s Rachel Calvert writes:\n\nFox News Latino highlighted how Hispanic advocates pressured NBC to end its relationship with Trump, writing that \u201cLatino media advocacy leaders say NBC\u2019s decision Monday \u2026 marked a watershed moment for Latinos.\u201d In particular, Fox News Latino profiled the efforts of the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, whose chairman and co-founder published an op-ed encouraging the network to \u201cdump Trump.\u201d By contrast, Fox News hosts rallied to defend Trump, praising his reluctance to apologize for his offensive remarks and suggesting the backlash unfairly minimized his well-taken points about a so-called border-problem.\n\nFox \u201cNews\u201d and Fox \u201cNews\u201d Latino: Diametrically opposed views and never the twain shall meet.\n\nFLAG FLAP: Many years ago Bill O\u2019Reilly dubbed himself a Cultural Warrior and Fox \u201cNews\u201d was happy to follow the Falafel King into glorious battle. However, they always seems to be on the wrong side of history during these skirmishes. This week \u2014 as the civilized world woke up to the fact that the Confederate flag has always been a symbol of Racism, not to mention traitors \u2014 Fox \u201cNews\u201d went in another direction.\n\nConsequently, NewsHounds had the courage to ask Is Fox News Dylann Roof\u2019s Soulmate Of Hate? This as Steve Doocy, Allen West [say]: Confederate Flag \u201cHad Nothing To Do With The Murders\u201d So Why All The Fuss? There were numerous segments during the week decrying political correctness, culminating in crocodile tears that the Dukes of Hazzard was removed from the boob tubery.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing less PC than a good old fashioned flag burning. When anarchists vowed they would burn a U.S. flag along with a Confederate flag, that prompted Mediaite\u2019s Evan McMurray to note Fox Is Losing Its Damn Mind over Scheduled Brooklyn Flag Burning. Don\u2019t deprive yourself of one of the most unhinged and demented editorials broadcast on tee vee in very a long time. READ & WATCH:\n\nMeanwhile, legal analyst Peter Johnson Jr. linked the scheduled burning to Roof himself, who appeared in a photo burning the American flag, though for somewhat different reasons: \u201cThese folks are, in my view, the cultural cousins, cultural brothers and sisters of that maniac murderer in Charleston who decided he was going to burn the flag and show it on social media. There\u2019s little difference between what they do and what he did. They\u2019re on different ends of the same continuum of behavior.\u201d\n\nYet, Roof\u2019s manifesto read more like the blathering of a typical Fox \u201cNews\u201d viewer at a family gathering.\n\nStephen Colbert famously noted that Peter Johnson, Jr., is named for 3 euphemisms for penis. Personally, I think he\u2019s a dick.\n\nSTARNES STAIN: Channeling his inner snake-handler, Todd Starnes Suggests Record-Breaking Floods Are Response To Gay Marriage Ruling.\n\nTUCKER WITH AN \u201cF\u201d: To remind readers: Tucker Carlson occupies a unique role on the Fox \u201cNews\u201d Channel. There\u2019s his hosting duties of Fox & Friends Weekends, where he craps all over the Curvy Couch. He also turns up on the network around the clock, taking the Con side in all of those (not very) Fair & Balanced debates on the network. But wait! That\u2019s not all!!! He\u2019s also owner and Big Cheese at The Daily Caller, a hard Right, Obama-bashing web site, that Fox \u201cNews\u201d quotes to makes its own bull-manure smell sweeter.\n\nDaily Caller Headline: \u201cBarack Obama, Wife Beater\u201d\n\nSPOILER ALERT: It\u2019s about his undershirt.\n\nFOX BYTES: Satanist takes Megyn Kelly to law school \u2022 Franklin Graham Warns Christians About Gay Marriage Ruling: Prepare For Persecution \u2022 Kendrick Lamar Responds To Fox\u2019s Geraldo Rivera\u2019s Criticism Of His Music As Harmful To Blacks \u2022 Fox Host Criticizes Women\u2019s World Cup Players For Being Too \u201cEmotional\u201d On The Field \u2022 Fox Hosts Smear Obama\u2019s Overtime Proposal To Help Workers: \u201cIt\u2019s Too Much Government\u201d \u2022 Fox\u2019s Gasparino: Obama Administration Has Been On A \u201cJihad Against Business\u201d \u2022 \u201cGreece On Steroids\u201d: Fox\u2019s Cavuto Attacks New Overtime Rules That Will Help Millions Of Workers \u2022 Worried About Terrorism On July 4th?
