Smith on Thursday was appointed the White House's new Chief Technology Officer. Sascha Baumann/Getty Images\n\nThe White House on Thursday named former Google executive Megan Smith America\u2019s new Chief Technology Officer.\n\nSmith, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and former vice president of Google\u2019s experimental technology branch Google X, replaces former tech officer Todd Park, who resigned last week to serve as an Obama administration tech adviser based in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cMegan has spent her career leading talented teams and taking cutting-edge technology and innovation initiatives from concept to design to deployment,\u201d President Barack Obama said in a statement Thursday, according to USA Today.\n\nThe CTO position was created in 2009 to advise White House officials on government tech policy, according to Vox Media\u2019s The Verge. Smith will be the country\u2019s third CTO in five years.\n\nAlexander Macgillivray, a former attorney for Twitter and Google, was appointed Smith\u2019s deputy. Smith and Macgillivray are reportedly a change of pace from CTO predecessors Park and Aneesh Chopra, whose backgrounds were heavy in health care technology, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.\n\nBut the duo strengthen White House ties to tech innovation in Silicon Valley, in conjunction with Park\u2019s capacity as a tech and recruiting adviser who will \u201censure that the administration has an on-the-ground sense of how technology is evolving,\u201d according to the White House statement.\n\nMacgillivray was once a front-runner in Twitter\u2019s battle with government data collection requests, according to Politico. And Smith was the CEO of an online LGBT community before joining Google, according to the Post.\n\nThe pair will fill two of the most prominent roles in government tech policy in the aftermath of the series of technological glitches that have plagued the Obama administration\u2019s Healthcare.gov, said Clay Johnson, CEO of nonprofit Department of Better Technology and an interviewee for the CTO job, according to CNBC\u2019s Re/code.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "newsgram/articles", "keyword": "Featured: Collections: Newsgram", "title": "Former Google Executive Megan Smith Named U.S. Chief Technology Officer", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Former Google executive Megan Smith was appointed Thursday.", "title": "White House Names New Chief Tech Officer", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/newsgram/articles/2014/09/04/former-google-executive-megan-smith-named-us-chief-technology-officer", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/92/43/685c386a4e8a867796a9382cdcbf/140904-smithgoogle-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Former Google executive Megan Smith was appointed Thursday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Former Google Executive Megan Smith Named U.S. Chief Technology Officer"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Andrew Soergel,technology,White House,Obama, Barack,Google,Pulse,picks,Collections: Newsgram,Featured: Collections: Newsgram", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Former Google executive Megan Smith was appointed Thursday."}, "article_summary": "Sascha Baumann/Getty ImagesThe White House on Thursday named former Google executive Megan Smith America\u2019s new Chief Technology Officer.\nAnd Smith was the CEO of an online LGBT community before joining Google, according to the Post.\nMegan Smith, a former Google executive, speaks at a conference June 30, 2011, in Munich, Germany.\nSmith on Thursday was appointed the White House's new Chief Technology Officer.\nSmith and Macgillivray are reportedly a change of pace from CTO predecessors Park and Aneesh Chopra, whose backgrounds were heavy in health care technology, according to Bloomberg Businessweek."}
