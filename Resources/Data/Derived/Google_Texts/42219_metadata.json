Jim Bridenstine (R-OK) says he will not vote for House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s reelection as speaker.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI Will Not Vote for John Boehner,\u201d reads the subject line of a news release the congressman\u2019s office posted Friday.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, the Oklahoma lawmaker laid out some of his issues with Boehner\u2019s current tenure. He specifically cites the \u201cCromnibus,\u201d the government-funding measure that passed before lawmakers ended the 113th Congress in December.\n\nBridenstine notes that, despite huge wins by Republicans in the midterm elections and with Democrats in melt-down mode, Boehner worked with Obama and surrendered Republican\u2019s best chance at retaining control in Congress.\n\n\u201cTogether they crafted the CR/Omnibus, a $1.1 trillion spending bill which funded the government for 10 months and blocked our newest elected Republicans from advancing conservative policy and delivering on campaign promises,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cWith this vote, Republicans gave away the best tool available to rein in our liberal activist President: the power of the purse. The power of the purse is Congress\u2019 Constitutional strength.\u201d\n\nBridenstine argued that passing the cromnibus provided Obama and liberals a huge victory by funding Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis is unconscionable after watching the campaign rhetoric that won such decisive victories for the GOP,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd went on to predict that when funding for Department of Homeland Security (DHS) runs out in February that Republicans will not be able to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody believe that President Obama is concerned about Republicans not funding DHS?\u201d Bridenstine asked. \u201cImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents have already sued the Administration for not allowing them to enforce the law.\u201d\n\nBridenstine, who is no stranger to bucking Boehner \u2014 notably voting for then-Rep. Eric Cantor (R-VA) for Speaker in 2013 \u2014 stressed that in failing to fight against Obama\u2019s refusal to faithfully executive America\u2019s laws, House Republicans share some blame for going astray from the Constitution.\n\n\u201cWhen our Constitution is under assault and House Republicans give away our Constitutional power of the purse, they share the guilt of abandoning our founding principles,\u201d he said.\n\nHe concluded by pointing to the cromnibus as the primary reason he will vote against Boehner as speaker.\n\n\u201cThe CR/Omnibus legislation sufficiently undermines the checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution that it warrants my pending vote against the Speaker,\u201d Bridenstine said. \u201cSpeaker Boehner went too far when he teamed with Obama to advance this legislation. He relinquished the power of the purse, and with it he lost my vote.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative Rep: \u2018I Will Not Vote for John Boehner\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Conservative Rep: \u2018I Will Not Vote for John Boehner\u2019", "title": "Conservative Rep: \u2018I Will Not Vote for John Boehner\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/jim-bridenstein-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-02T10:51:44-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/02/conservative-rep-i-will-not-vote-for-john-boehner/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservative Rep: \u2018I Will Not Vote for John Boehner\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/jim-bridenstein-AP.jpg", "title": "Conservative Rep: \u2018I Will Not Vote for John Boehner\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jim Bridenstine, John Boehner,Big Government,john boehner", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-02T09:27:12-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T10:51:44-07:00", "tag": "John Boehner", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9d2\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRep.
