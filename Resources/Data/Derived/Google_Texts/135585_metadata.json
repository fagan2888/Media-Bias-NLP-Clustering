People with diabetes often check their blood sugar one or more times a day. The test strips that users fit into a monitor list at a dollar each, for some of the larger brands. The strips for the new device will run 25 cents each. The device itself is $16.95.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably more of a known secret in the marketplace that the real margins is within the strips,\u201d Adam Lin, president of iHealth Labs told MobiHealthNews. \u201cWe (wanted) to pass on all that savings to the end users. It\u2019s got to be simple to understand. You don\u2019t have to go through all these issues for reimbursement. We brought it down to pretty much co-pay.\u201d\n\nThe new glucose monitor is just bigger than a quarter, and it plugs into a phone\u2019s headphone jack. It can be used with either Apple or Android phones. It displays and stores readings using iHealth\u2019s app.\n\nMore from mobihealthnews:\n\nLin thinks the lower cost will bring iHealth more market share, and it will be hard for the bigger players with larger overheads to follow suit. When users take their blood glucose with either of iHealth\u2019s devices, they first scan the QR code on the box of test strips, which allows the app to track how many strips are left. iHealth is developing a feature by which users will be able to auto-reorder their strips based on that data, but right now the app simply reminds the user if strips are running low or about to expire. iHealth\u2019s Wireless Smart Gluco-Monitoring System was featured briefly at Apple\u2019s WWDC event as an example of a smartphone-connected glucometer. Lin said that iHealth has plans to integrate all of its devices with HealthKit.\n\nThe product will be available next month, first from iHealth\u2019s website and later from Walgreens.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The company -- iHealth Labs -- says its test strips are a quarter of what many brand-name strips cost.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"New Device Brings Price Drop in Diabetes Test Strips\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/12\\/new-device-brings-price-drop-in-diabetes-test-strips\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-12 13:34:15\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-02-08 08:14:01\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19497,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Diabetes\",\"Science\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/06\\/Picture-iHealth-Align-Device-with-iPhone.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The company -- iHealth Labs -- says its test strips are a quarter of what many brand-name strips cost.", "title": "New Device Brings Price Drop in Diabetes Test Strips", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/12/new-device-brings-price-drop-in-diabetes-test-strips/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/06/Picture-iHealth-Align-Device-with-iPhone-640x719.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "diabetes,science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But for people with diabetes, the bigger news is likely to be the cost of the test strips that the device will use.\nThe test strips that users fit into a monitor list at a dollar each, for some of the larger brands.\nWhen users take their blood glucose with either of iHealth\u2019s devices, they first scan the QR code on the box of test strips, which allows the app to track how many strips are left.\niHealth Labs, a Mountain View company focused on mobile, personal, health technology has received FDA approval for what the company says is the world\u2019s smallest mobile blood glucose monitor, called iHealth Align.\nWe brought it down to pretty much co-pay.\u201dThe new glucose monitor is just bigger than a quarter, and it plugs into a phone\u2019s headphone jack."}
