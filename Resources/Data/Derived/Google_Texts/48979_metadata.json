The company has said that it planned to give layoff notices to employees before Jan. 30 as its severance package would be reduced after that date.\n\nSprint subscribers are increasingly using the Sprint Zone app and going online for their customer care needs and the jobs cuts were made in response to that trend, Boyd said.\n\nSprint said in November 2014 that it would fire 2,000 employees. In October 2014, the company launched a previous round of layoffs and shed about 1,700 jobs.\n\nBoyd declined to comment on whether the company plans to slash more jobs in coming weeks.\n\nThe Kansas City Star first reported news of the job cuts on Monday.\n\nShares in Sprint, which have fallen about 21 percent this year, were down about 10 percent at $2.59 in afternoon trading.\n\n(Reporting by Malathi Nayak in New York and Abhirup Roy in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Alistair Bell and Meredith Mazzilli)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - Sprint Corp has axed at least 2,500 jobs across six customer care centers", "title": "Sprint slashes 2,500 jobs to cut costs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/25/Sprint-cuts-2500-jobs-mostly-call-centers-report", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/sprint-results_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/25/Sprint-cuts-2500-jobs-mostly-call-centers-report", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/sprint-results_2.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - Sprint Corp has axed at least 2,500 jobs across six customer care centers", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The job cuts, mostly in customer service, also include 574 positions at Sprint's headquarters at Overland Park, Kansas, Sprint spokeswoman Michelle Boyd said.\n(Reuters) - Sprint Corp has axed at least 2,500 jobs across six customer care centers and its Kansas headquarters as part of its plan to cut $2.5 billion in costs, a company spokeswoman said on Monday.\nSprint notified employees last week about the job cuts and severance benefits through email, Boyd said.\nSprint subscribers are increasingly using the Sprint Zone app and going online for their customer care needs and the jobs cuts were made in response to that trend, Boyd said.\nSprint, the fourth-largest U.S wireless carrier, has shut down call centers in Virginia, New Mexico, Tennessee and Texas and cut back jobs at its Colorado and Overland Park call centers, Boyd added."}
