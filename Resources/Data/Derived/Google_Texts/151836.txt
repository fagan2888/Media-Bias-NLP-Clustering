I was in Texas—god help me, but somebody had to go—I've done Houston and Dallas and Austin—well, Austin isn't really Texas, really, but nevermind—and I was saying to this educated, seemingly successful woman, and I said 'well, you realize Texas pssed a 72-hour waiting period between the exam and the ultrasound and a woman being able to have the procedure,' and she said 'no, no, no, that's just silly.' I said 'No, your state did this. It's now law.' And she said 'No.' 'Well, it's a fact,' and she said 'Well, why don't I know.' Well, now that's a question we should be asking. Here's an educated, capable woman who obviously makes her own choices, and has for a while, and she's unaware of the laws of her state, which is not that unusual, unfortunately.
