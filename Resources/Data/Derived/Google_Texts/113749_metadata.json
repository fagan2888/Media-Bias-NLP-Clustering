Two people died elsewhere in the city.\n\nRescue work has focused on the wreckage of the 17-storey building, where more than 100 people are listed as missing and are suspected to be buried deep under the rubble.\n\nNo survivors have been brought out since Monday evening.\n\nQuestions have been raised about the building's construction quality, especially materials used to build it.\n\nLawyers for the three detained men were not immediately available to comment.\n\nHsiao Po-jen, director of the legal affairs department of the Tainan city government, told Reuters that Lin had been arrested on Monday evening.\n\nReuters witnesses at the scene of the collapse have seen large rectangular, commercial cans of cooking-oil packed inside wall cavities exposed by the damage, apparently having been used as building material.\n\nTaiwan media has also reported the presence of polystyrene in supporting beams, mixed in with concrete.\n\nThe Wei-guan, completed in 1994, was the only major high-rise building in the city of two million people to have completely collapsed.\n\nIts lower storeys, filled with arcades of shops, pancaked on top of each other before the entire U-shaped complex toppled in on itself.\n\nDeputy Tainan Mayor Tseng Shu-cheng told family members that 103 people were still missing in the rubble.\n\n(Reporting by J.R.
