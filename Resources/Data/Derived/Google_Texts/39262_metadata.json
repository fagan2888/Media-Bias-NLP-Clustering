She was 88.\n\nMrs. Broz died of heart failure at Belgrade\u2019s emergency hospital, where she had been receiving care since August, said Zlatibor Loncar, its director.\n\n\u201cWith Broz\u2019s death, we are left without one of the last most reliable witnesses of our former country\u2019s history,\u201d Prime Minister Ivica Dacic of Serbia said in a message of condolence.\n\nTito led the Communist Partisan resistance movement that fought the Nazi occupiers of Yugoslavia during World War II. He first met his wife when she fought in the first female brigade of the guerrilla group.\n\nAfter the war, Tito, an ethnic Croat, took power and ruled the multiethnic federation of Yugoslavia with a heavy hand. But he also kept close relations with the West and gave Yugoslavia\u2019s citizens liberties such as free travel that were not allowed in other communist nations at the time.\n\nAfter Tito came to power, Mrs. Broz, an ethnic Serb, was assigned to work with the Communist leader. They began a relationship and married in 1952. Over the next two decades, Mrs. Broz accompanied Tito during his many international trips and at meetings with foreign leaders and celebrities, including British royals, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon and Hollywood stars.\n\nThe couple started having problems and drifted apart in the 1970s.\n\nTito died in 1980, and the six-member federation fell apart in early 1990s in a series of ethnic conflicts. Seven independent nations emerged after warfare that left about 100,000 people dead and millions homeless.\n\nFollowing Tito\u2019s death, his successors accused Mrs. Broz of ambitions to take over the country and placed her under house arrest. Mrs. Broz said she was kicked out of her residence, which was ransacked, and her personal belongings were impounded. Later, as Tito\u2019s personality cult crumbled and his once-glorified role in Yugoslavia\u2019s history came under scrutiny, Mrs. Broz mostly remained in isolation.\n\nIn a rare interview in 2001, she told the Blic newspaper that she lived in a Belgrade house without heating and often no electricity, and that she had no income or property to support herself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally deprived of any rights,\u201d Mrs. Broz said at the time.\n\nShe did not hold valid Serbian identity documents until 2009, when a pro-democracy Serbian government moved to improve her status.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Dacic said in his message that \u201cunfortunately the historic injustice has just started to be undone at the end of her life.\u201d He said his government supports burying Mrs. Broz at the same complex where Tito\u2019s tomb is located in a residential area of Belgrade.\n\nThe couple did not have children.\n\nMrs. Broz\u2018s funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jovanka Broz, who was married to Yugoslavian dictator Josip Broz Tito for nearly 30 years but lived in isolation as the federation he built broke apart, died Sunday.
