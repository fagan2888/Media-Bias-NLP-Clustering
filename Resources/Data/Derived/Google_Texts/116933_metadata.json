Dave Brat on Why the Defense Funding Bill Shouldn\u2019t Allow Illegal Immigrants to Enlist in the Military\n\nNDAA, annual legislation funding the Department of Defense, is expected to be voted on next week in the House.\n\nRep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., who introduced the amendment, said in a statement it \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a controversial issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe secretary of defense has the authority to deem what is in the national interest of the United States, and all we are asking is for him to consider allowing DACA recipients who meet the criteria and want to serve, into our military for that same reason,\u201d said Gallego.\n\nGallego, a veteran of the Iraq War, added that \u201cthis amendment is about defense and what is in the best interest of our nation and our military.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat matters is the quality and commitment of the people you serve with, not their immigration status,\u201d he said.\n\nIn a statement, Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, criticized the provision as \u201can amnesty amendment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe amendment encourages the secretary of defense to find ways to enlist illegal immigrants granted amnesty under the president\u2019s illegal and unconstitutional Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals into the armed services,\u201d said King. \u201cThis policy would provide a fast track to citizenship for those accepted into a program Congress has voted to defund three times.\u201d\n\nKing added that it is \u201cdisappointing\u201d that \u201ca bill designed to keep this nation safe from its enemies at a time of war\u201d is being used to give \u201ccitizenship to illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the wrong policy on the wrong bill at the worst time,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid Inserra, a research assistant at The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a recent op-ed that the provision \u201cbuilds on Obama\u2019s lawless actions and accepts illegal immigrants into the military at a time when thousands of American citizens are being cut from the military because of harmful defense budget cuts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe National Defense Authorization Act should be focused on restoring funding for the U.S. military so that it can face the real and growing threats in the world today. The NDAA and military are the wrong places to toy around with social and immigration experiments\u2014and it also poor policy,\u201d wrote Inserra.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The provision asks the defense secretary to consider making those who were approved for deferred deportation eligible for military service.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The provision asks the defense secretary to consider making those who were approved for deferred deportation eligible for military service.", "title": "House Bill Encourages Illegal Immigrants to Serve in Military", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150513_AshtonCarter.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-13T16:56:32+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1A0Iotp"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The provision asks the defense secretary to consider making those who were approved for deferred deportation eligible for military service.", "title": "House Bill Encourages Illegal Immigrants to Serve in Military", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150513_AshtonCarter.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-05-13T16:31:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-13T16:56:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Illegal immigration, illegal immigrants, NDAA, National Defense Authorization Act, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, Obama, Ruben Gallego, Steve King"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd474\"", "article_summary": "The National Defense Authorization Act, currently making its way through the Republican-controlled U.S. House, includes language encouraging the secretary of defense to allow immigrants who are in the country illegally to serve in the military.\n>>> Commentary: Rep.
