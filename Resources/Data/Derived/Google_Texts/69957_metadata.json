Rick Scott wants to \u201ckeep working\u201d past January 2018. That\u2019s when our next governor gets inaugurated. But that doesn\u2019t mean the term-limited Scott wants to give us a break.\n\n\n\n\n\nThink you\u2019ll need some Scott-free psychic space where you can look back in anger and heal the wounds his administration inflicted on you and so many others for eight long years? Looks like you\u2019ll have to move back to NYC, Chicago, Philly or wherever, bury your regrets under a snowdrift.\n\nBecause judging from this week\u2019s new policy flip-flop and OpEd penned by Gov. Scott in the Washington Examiner, arguably (OK, I\u2019m being polite) the worst and most unpopular governor in Florida history will run for the U.S. Senate in 2018. If so and he wins the Republican nomination, he\u2019ll presumably challenge longtime incumbent and moderate Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nWe all know the governor\u2019s top goal since before even running for governor\u2026right? No, it\u2019s not job creation. It\u2019s defeating Obamacare and leaving health reform entirely up to private health insurance executives. You know, corporate CEOs like he used to be at Columbia/HCA, before it got nailed in the biggest Medicare fraud case ever, before he jumped ship and saved his butt by taking the fifth 75 times in an FBI deposition.\n\nAfter launching that 2014 reelection makeover by announcing (and getting a free pass from many in the media) his credibility-busting 2013 conversion to supposedly supporting Obamacare Medicaid expansion\u2026the smoke is now clearing. With what may well be a full-fledged anti-reform conspiracy either unraveling or coming to fruition (still hard to say) in this final month of the legislative session, Scott has made national news again by reversing that 2013 claim, doubling back down on his anti-Obama, conservative extremist creds.\n\nConsider that about-face and the new OpEd as warning signs the governor\u2019s already in \u201cBack to Base-ics\u201d training, preparing for his next makeover and political campaign.\n\nFilled with now-customary half-truths and mind-numbing rhetoric, Scott\u2019s OpEd admonishes the president \u201cto take note\u201d of how he\u2019s balancing budgets, creating jobs and demonstrating \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d here in Florida. No references to national economic recovery and deficit reduction on the president\u2019s watch.\n\nAlso unmentioned? The millions of working poor and middle class Florida families who can\u2019t get ahead because Scott & Co. balanced budgets on our backs, to offset billions in carefully engineered corporate handouts and expanded profiteering opportunities in the public sector.\n\nLast November, conservative politicos speculated about Scott\u2019s presidential ambitions after he\u2019d won another tough, tight statewide election. Instead of running as the crimson-red, corporations-first, conservative extremist that earned him such negative approval and popularity ratings in the first place, he\u2019d posed as a mainstream moderate conservative, ready to pour money back into public schools and protect Florida\u2019s precious water and other environmental resources.\n\nThat makeover campaign \u2013 plus unlimited truckloads of his and other very rich, conservative people\u2019s money \u2013 barely managed to win him reelection by a 1 percent margin. We have him to kick us around again until 2018 thanks to the highly motivated white, conservative, evangelical 15 percent sliver of Floridians who voted for him.\n\nGo ask the Florida Democratic Party why they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t effectively motivate working poor and middle class people, people of color, women and young people statewide to join forces and vote against Scott and a Republican legislative majority that had done demonstrable harm to their families and futures. I\u2019ve asked. Now I\u2019m waiting for the FDP\u2019s post-mortem \u201cLEAD\u201d task force report to come out. We\u2019ll see whether it answers that core question effectively, or not.\n\nIn the meantime, we\u2019re left with Scott\u2019s ruthless ambitions, and the assorted legislative puppets, enablers and co-dependents combining to help him achieve as many of them as possible.\n\nDaniel Tilson has a Boca Raton-based communications firm called Full Cup Media, specializing in online video and written content for non-profits, political candidates and organizations, and small businesses.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scott in an OpEd lectured Obama on how he\u2019s balancing budgets, creating jobs and demonstrating \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d here in Florida.
