Rudolph the Unemployed Reindeer? The Grinch Who Lost her Emails? Frosty, the (cigarette smoking, wine swilling) Speaker of the House? Auditing St. Nick?

Scenes from a dystopian War on Christmas?

No, it's the Ted Cruz's Christmas video — a self-deprecating spoof that has garnered almost 1.5 million views on YouTube since its launch on Friday.

The ad, "Cruz Christmas Classics," could itself become a classic of political advertising, winning kudos for its playful humor from both right and left. Playing off Cruz's 2013 "Green Eggs and Ham" government shutdown filibuster, the ad shows Cruz (a college actor) along with his wife Heidi reading faux Christmas stories to their two ultra-cute daughters.

Featuring classics like, How Obamacare Stole Christmas, the ad will run in the crucial Iowa market during this weekend's "Saturday Night Live" show. Poking bipartisan fun at Hillary Clinton and John Boehner, it's not a bad way to get free media 44 days before the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses.

The ad's kickers should probably come with a trigger alert for Cruz critics: "If you are not completely satisfied with this collection of Cruz Christmas Classics, you probably hate Christmas — and America."
