The momentum continues, as we give a nod to several more.\n\nA position paper issued by the American College of Physicians (ACP) and published in the November 5 Annals of Internal Medicine referenced pharmacists in a positive light. The ACP paper included clinical pharmacists in its definition of a clinical care team, and clinical pharmacists were mentioned throughout the paper. It\u2019s great to see that our colleagues in medicine see us as part of the team.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) is drafting a National Action Plan for Adverse Drug Event Prevention. The draft focuses on the prevention of adverse drug events (ADEs) related to anticoagulants, diabetes agents, and opioids. The plan recognizes the value of pharmacist services in preventing and reducing ADEs and improving overall patient health outcomes. In comments on the draft plan, the American Health Quality Association had nothing but praise for pharmacists\u2019 services and repeatedly noted that pharmacists are integral to providing the highest quality care to patients.\n\nIn the November 2013 issue of Health Affairs, Marie Smith, PharmD, and colleagues published a paper about how pharmacists belong in accountable care organizations (ACOs) and on integrated care teams. In the same issue of Health Affairs, Lucinda L. Maine, PhD, and colleagues wrote an article on how pharmacists and technicians will be able to enhance patient care even more once national policies, practices, and priorities are aligned.\n\nLast month, APhA President Steven T. Simenson, BSPharm, FAPhA, FACA, FACVP, spoke to several groups at Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) Pharmaceuticals about provider status, pharmacy accreditation, and quality measures. One of the groups Simenson met with was Pharmacists Across BI, which was started in 2013 to advocate for the profession of pharmacy, educate stakeholders on the value of pharmacists, and serve as a networking group for both pharmacists and nonpharmacists at BI. I\u2019m very excited that a pharmaceutical company is stepping forward to promote the role of the pharmacist.\n\nAs 2013 comes to a close, I encourage all of you to keep up the momentum! Spread the word about how pharmacists as members of multidisciplinary care teams, ACOs, and participants in national initiatives can make a difference in patient care.\n\nThomas E. Menighan, BSPharm, MBA, ScD (Hon), Executive Vice President and CEO\n\nMedia vibe\n\nDuring the month of October, APhA External Communications Department and Media Advisors responded to 12 media inquiries, including the following:\n\nThe Houston Chronicle: APhA\u2019s ethical stance on pharmacist involvement in lethal injection\n\nWisconsin Reporter: Cost of prescription drugs under the Affordable Care Act\n\nInside Health Policy: Hydrocodone rescheduling\n\nFitness: Medications/products that can cause fatigue\n\n90%\n\nThe percentage of influenza-related deaths that occur in people 65 years or older.

Welch, PharmD, MBA, BCACP\n\nAssociate Professor Pharmacy Practice\n\nSchool of Pharmacy, Wilkes University, Wilkes-Barre, PA\n\nAPhA member since 1999\n\nI joined APhA because\u2026 they provide the most helpful resources to support practicing pharmacists in taking care of their patients.\n\nMy most memorable APhA experiences\u2026 always come when I attend the Annual Meetings and catch up with people whom I may not have seen in a year. The Annual Meetings are also a time to get recharged and excited about the direction our profession is heading.\n\nProfessionally I want to\u2026 see community pharmacists actively engaged as meaningful contributors to health care beyond what we typically contribute. I think community pharmacists are the largest underutilized resource in the health care system.\n\nIf I could have dinner with anyone, living or dead, I\u2019d choose\u2026 President Lyndon Johnson so we could write pharmacists into the Social Security Act as Medicare providers from the beginning. For dessert, I would go out for pie with Jack Welch and Mike Ditka!\n\nAre you on social media?\n\nChances are that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d A survey done in 2012 found that 56% of Americans have a profile on a social networking site and 22% use social media several times per day. A Pew study conducted earlier this year revealed that of Americans who use the Internet, a whopping 72% use social media sites. The most commonly used social media site is Facebook, followed by Twitter and LinkedIn. Currently, the fastest growing social media site is Pinterest.\n\nAPhA has many social media sites, so regardless of which platform is your favorite, you are bound to find an APhA site that will interest you.

APhA\u2019s Allison Gross, Communications Associate for Federal Contracts and Grants, recently sat down with Jennifer Clark, BSPharm, Director of Pharmacy Services at Health Partners of Western Ohio, to discuss the benefits of the Peer-to-Peer and 340B Drug Pricing programs.\n\nJennifer Clark\n\nAPhA: Can you briefly describe your facility and why you applied to the Peer-to-Peer program?\n\nJC: Health Partners of Western Ohio is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC). We operate five FQHCs in Western Ohio and serve about 18,500 patients. We worked hard to develop our 340B program and wanted to share what we learned with other entities that might be struggling to bring up similar comprehensive programs. We are in our second term with Peer-to-Peer.\n\nAPhA: What are some of the advantages of being in the Peer-to-Peer program?\n\nJC: Networking and support are great advantages. We have been developing our comprehensive program in a silo since 2006. It is critical to get out and meet other people working in similar environments and those who have developed entirely different models of care to meet their needs. We have been able to develop our program even more through networking with our peers.\n\nAPhA: Do you have any advice to others who are thinking of joining the Peer-to-Peer program?\n\nA: My number one piece of advice is not to be afraid. Don\u2019t think that your program won\u2019t measure up. Make sure that your program is well designed, that you stay on top of changes, and that you maintain a high integrity level. You need to commit to continual learning and continued improvements.\n\nAPhA: Do you have any advice to other 340B entities?\n\nJC: The program is designed to help the entity stretch resources and improve services for their patients. Entities must be diligent in following regulations and adhering to the guidelines of the program. The benefits of the program far outweigh the commitment required from an entity to make sure the program is operating correctly. Take the time to develop a comprehensive pharmacy program. Medication access is just one piece of a comprehensive pharmacy program that also includes medication therapy management, disease management, preventive care services, medication reconciliation, patient education, provider education, provider consultation, and retrospective drug utilization review.\n\nAPhA: Why is 340B important in your community?\n\nJC: Last year, we saved our patients about $1.6 million on medication costs by using our 340B in-house pharmacy program. We combine 340B with other medication access programs to spread our dollars even further. Patients have cried because they can finally afford their medications and have an environment to learn about safe medication use and managing their disease, not just taking a pill and hoping for the best. Our community is getting healthier because of the 340B program. Our organization is part of the Patient Safety and Clinical Pharmacy Services Collaborative. In 2012, we worked with Ohio KePro (Ohio\u2019s CMS Quality Improvement Organization) and showed a 67% relative improvement in admissions and a 100% relative improvement in readmissions for a targeted high risk population.\n\nAPhA: What are some major benefits of using the 340B program?\n\nJC: We use an integrated care model where primary care providers, behavior specialists, and clinical pharmacists work together with the patient. Among 575 high-risk patients last year, our clinical pharmacists prevented 900 potential adverse drug events and stopped 63 existing adverse drug events.\n\nShowcasing high-performing 340B entities\n\nThe 340B Peer-to-Peer Program was developed by APhA with the Health Resources and Services Administration Office of Pharmacy Affairs to showcase high-performing 340B entities in order to provide practical examples of excellence in 340B integrity and quality that will serve as a resource for other 340B entities. APhA is seeking 340B entities of all sizes and types to apply for this prestigious status as a 340B Peer-to-Peer Leading Practice Site.

A PEP regimen of three or more antiretroviral agents should be taken for 4 weeks when occupational exposure to HIV occurs.\n\nFiner points\n\nRisk of HIV transmission after occupational exposure is low. However, if exposure occurs, appropriate response and risk management are essential.\n\nThe USPHS recently updated its guidelines for managing occupational exposure to HIV and recommended PEP treatment regimens, which were last revised in 2005. Recommendations were compiled by a USPHS working group comprising members of CDC, FDA, Health Resources and Services Administration, and National Institutes of Health. The members considered literature published since the 2005 guidelines, challenges with implementation, surveillance data, and new medications.\n\nSelected guideline recommendations in the event of an occupational exposure to HIV include the following:\n\nHIV status of exposure source (SP) should be determined to guide treatment; PEP is recommended for all occupational exposures to HIV.\n\nPEP medications should be started as soon as possible and continued for 4 weeks but can be stopped if SP tests HIV negative.\n\nPEP medication regimens should contain three or more antiretroviral agents.\n\nRaltegravir (Isentress\u2014Merck) should be administered 400 mg twice daily in combination with emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir 300 mg (Truvada\u2014Gilead) once daily as first-line therapy.\n\nGuidance for when expert consultation is warranted and recommendations for postexposure counseling, follow-up testing, and monitoring also were provided.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nIn addition to providing recommendations for testing and treatment, guideline authors reaffirmed treatment principles and approaches recommended in previous versions of the guidelines. In cases of occupational exposure, pharmacists have an opportunity to reinforce the importance of adherence, even to fellow health care providers. \u201cExposed [health care professionals] who choose to take PEP should be advised of the importance of completing the prescribed regimen,\u201d wrote guideline authors.\n\nThis includes discussions about adverse effects and strategies to avoid them, potential drug interactions, laboratory monitoring, and alarm symptoms such as rash or yellowing of the skin or eyes, noted the authors. Expert PEP consultation can be obtained by calling the PEPline at (888) 448-4911.\n\nWhat your patients need to know\n\nThe USPHS recently updated guidelines for managing occupational exposure to HIV and recommendations for PEP. Risk of HIV transmission after occupational exposure is low. However, adherence to recommended PEP treatment regimens is essential to further minimize this risk.\n\nSource\n\nKuhar DT et al.
