Hillcrest formally opened on Herring Avenue in 1920, moving to State Highway 6 and Interstate 35 the same year Scott & White announced its plans to merge.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "WacoTrib.com", "description": "With a drum roll and a countdown by board chairman Drayton McLane, a blue cloth fell Tuesday afternoon to expose a sign proclaiming the hospital at Interstate 35 and West Loop 340 as Baylor Scott & White Medical Center-Hillcrest, part of the largest nonprofit health system in Texas.", "title": "First Baylor Scott & White Health hospital unveiled in Waco", "url": "http://www.wacotrib.com/news/business/first-baylor-scott-white-health-hospital-unveiled-in-waco/article_cf027eb8-1353-5ea6-9c5f-5a88e319b0fb.html", "image": {"width": 887, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/wacotrib.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/04/f04a38ce-aa50-5553-bdaf-c5f5cfab072c/5393fcb4124ce.preview-960.jpg?resize=887%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wacotrib", "card": "summary"}, "description": "With a drum roll and a countdown by board chairman Drayton McLane, a blue cloth fell Tuesday afternoon to expose a sign proclaiming the hospital at Interstate 35 and West Loop 340 as Baylor Scott &amp; White Medical Center-Hillcrest, part of the largest nonprofit health system in Texas.", "fb": {"admins": 100003972382224, "app_id": 109882439169884}, "google-site-verification": "50pYtHR6CCFTzZ71kPh9VblWnhVFzTMInJ8Z9e0QKbw", "keywords": "business,health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wacotrib"}, "news_keywords": "business,health"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5a1\"", "article_summary": "The entity reflects the merger of Baylor Health Care System and Scott & White Healthcare.\nBaylor Scott & White has more than $8 billion in combined assets and about $6 billion in annual revenue.\n\u201cThese two entities had a common mission and common values, that being the Christian ministry of healing,\u201d said Joel Allison, CEO of Baylor Scott & White Health.\nGlenn Robinson, president of Baylor Scott & White Hillcrest Medical Center, said the \u201csize, scope and strength\u201d of the new organization should well serve patients in North Texas, home of Dallas-based Baylor Health Care System, and those in Central Texas familiar with Temple-based Scott & White.\nHillcrest formally opened on Herring Avenue in 1920, moving to State Highway 6 and Interstate 35 the same year Scott & White announced its plans to merge."}
