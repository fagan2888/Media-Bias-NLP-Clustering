The clinics offer free WiFi and are usually in a retail setting near grocery stores and mini-malls. The Optum Clinics suggest that United sees a major market for both low- and high-end retail health services, for everyone from low- and middle-income families on high deductible plans to higher earners who also want convenience and a good deal.\n\nIncreasingly, Americans \u201cwant on-demand healthcare,\" Tseng told the Houston Chronicle last year. \"They want to be able to get in when they are not feeling very well. This is a need we are trying to address.\"\n\n[Also: Tracking 2015 mergers and acquisitions]\n\nThe first of the Optum Clinics opened last year in Houston \u2014 one of several major metropolitan areas around the country that has seen a boom in urgent care centers, sometimes to the chagrin of local health systems and medical practices who are losing their low-acuity business.\n\nThe Optum Clinics, staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners and open from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends, offer the typical array of basic primary care, with physicals, well-woman exams, weight loss help, lab and x-rays, and care for back pain, fractures and sprains, as well as diseases like asthma or hypertension.\n\nAnd they also offer cosmetic services: wrinkle relaxers, chemical peels, facials, volume enhancers, clay masques and microdermabrasion.\n\nThe Optum Clinics take insurance, including from UHG\u2019s competitors, but some other walk-in clinic chains they\u2019re also offering membership options: for instance, $19 a year for unlimited blood pressure checks, immunization screenings, annual head-to-toe skin checks and hearing tests with a discount on hearing aids. For $39 there is the \u201cOptum Beauty membership\u201d with an annual \u201cskin and aesthetic consultation for the face and neck,\u201d a \u201cVIP invitation to medical spa events and skin care seminars,\u201d and discounts on cosmetic and skin treatments.\n\nFor UHG and Optum, the acquisition of MedExpress could be a way to scale that kind of hybrid convenient care model, and give it a key differentiator among the 1,500 or so 1,500 walk-in clinics around the country at CVS stores, Walmarts, Walgreens and free-standing strip mall locations operated by regional and national chains as well as some local hospital systems.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nIncorporating MedExpress into Optum creates an opportunity to \u201cintegrate Optum care management and clinical programs with MedExpress\u2019 services, simplifying patient access to health resources and treatment options in their community,\u201d the company said. UnitedHealthcare\u2019s membership is the largest in the country, at some 40 million, with 2 million of them in Medicaid plans and more than 500,000 in new exchange plans across 23 states\u2014including several with MedExpress clinics, among them Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\nFor health systems and medical practices, the new competition may raise concerns, but it is not too late, said Lisa Bielamowicz, MD, the chief medical officer at the Advisory Board Company.\n\n\u201cThe game and competitive factors by which you win primary care business are starting to change. Health systems and physician groups have to understand that. If there\u2019s a Walmart clinic open 15 hours a day, that\u2019s the standard you may have to meet,\u201d Bielamowicz said in an interview last fall. \u201cNo doubt that consumers of any income level want convenience and availability for basic care, and these factors can trump doctor-patient relationships, especially for younger patients.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @AnthonyBrino", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/unitedhealths-optum-digs-retail-health-market", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctors-office-feature.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Recent purchase of MedExpress gives major boost to insurer's business for walk-in, low-acuity treatments and well as health and wellness services.", "title": "UnitedHealth's Optum digs in to retail health market"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/doctors-office-feature.png"}, "description": "Recent purchase of MedExpress gives major boost to insurer's business for walk-in, low-acuity treatments and well as health and wellness services.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UnitedHealth's Optum digs in to retail health market"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "UnitedHealth Group,the nation\u2019s largest insurer, is investing in retail health clinics, seeing a big opportunity to bring basic primary and urgent care to the masses with value-added services.&#13; For starters, UnitedHealth is buying MedExpress, a national retail clinic chain with 140 locations across 11 states, for an undisclosed sum.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "UnitedHealth Group,the nation\u2019s largest insurer, is investing in retail health clinics, seeing a big opportunity to bring basic primary and urgent care to the masses with value-added services.\nThe Optum Clinics suggest that United sees a major market for both low- and high-end retail health services, for everyone from low- and middle-income families on high deductible plans to higher earners who also want convenience and a good deal.\nIncorporating MedExpress into Optum creates an opportunity to \u201cintegrate Optum care management and clinical programs with MedExpress\u2019 services, simplifying patient access to health resources and treatment options in their community,\u201d the company said.\nFor starters, UnitedHealth is buying MedExpress, a national retail clinic chain with 140 locations across 11 states, for an undisclosed sum.\nRecent purchase of MedExpress gives major boost to insurer's business for walk-in, low-acuity treatments and well as health and wellness services."}
