The idea was that non-profits would have lower costs and be able to charge lower premiums.\n\n\"So they gave them a bunch of money in federal loans,\" Feyman recalls.\n\nFeyman\n\nIn fact, those eight, now-failed co-ops alone have received $900 million in federal tax dollars.\n\nThe Daily Signal reports that 22 of 23 co-ops lost money in 2014 \u2013 when their non-profit existence was meant to help them survive.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that health cooperatives are collapsing at such a rapid pace that co-ops and small insurers are forming a coalition to consider legal action to change health-law provisions they blame for their financial distress.\n\nFeyman says there are non-profit insurers around the country that already exist and some of them do better than others.\n\n\"Others do worse. It varies,\" says Feyman. \"But just being a non-profit doesn't mean you're going to do any better job than a for-profit insurer.\"\n\nHe adds that the idea of giving the taxpayer's money to make them work better is \"pretty much baseless.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://onenewsnow.com/business/2015/10/21/obamacare-co-ops-keeling-over-with-our-tax-dollars", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://onenewsnow.com/media/5692331/emergency_lights_800x500.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "So-called health co-ops continue to have problems in ObamaCare, leading one analyst to suggest they were a mistake to create.", "title": "ObamaCare co-ops keeling over with our tax dollars"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://onenewsnow.com/media/5692331/emergency_lights_800x500.jpg", "description": "So-called health co-ops continue to have problems in ObamaCare, leading one analyst to suggest they were a mistake to create.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ObamaCare co-ops keeling over with our tax dollars"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "So-called health co-ops continue to have problems in ObamaCare, leading one analyst to suggest they were a mistake to create."}, "article_summary": "So-called health co-ops continue to have problems in ObamaCare, leading one analyst to suggest they were a mistake to create.\nFeymanIn fact, those eight, now-failed co-ops alone have received $900 million in federal tax dollars.\nFeyman says there are non-profit insurers around the country that already exist and some of them do better than others.\nThe co-ops, after they're formed, offer insurance through the \"Marketplace\" created by ObamaCare.\nYevgeniy Feyman of the Manhattan Institute says the co-ops were created after plans for the so-called public-option was tossed out."}
