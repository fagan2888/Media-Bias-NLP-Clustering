The initials on a plank of the coffin were formed with metal tacks imbedded into the wood.\n\nThe bones of at least 10 people were found inside the niche containing the broken wooden planks of the coffin, though some of the remains belonged to children, said forensic anthropologist Francisco Etxeberria, who participated in the autopsy that confirmed the suicide of former Chilean president Salvador Allende.\n\nEtxeberria and others will now start examining the bones to try to determine whether Cervantes' are among them. Cervantes was 69 when he died and investigators have solid clues to work with as they conduct their probe.\n\nThe investigation will refer to the author's portraits and his own stories, in which he relates that shortly before dying he only had six teeth.\n\nBut the most obvious marks will be the battle wounds that Cervantes sustained.\n\nIn 1571, the writer was wounded in the Battle of Lepanto, which pitted Ottoman Turkish forces against the Holy League, led by Spain. Aboard the ship La Marquesa, Cervantes was hit with three musket shots, two in the chest and one in his hand.\n\nHe spent several months in a hospital in Sicily, but managed to recover.\n\nCervantes is a towering figure in Spanish culture. His novel \"The Adventures of the Ingenious Nobleman Don Quixote of La Mancha\" changed Spanish literature.\n\nThe \"Don Quixote\" author was buried in 1616 at Convent of the Barefoot Trinitarians in Madrid's historic Barrio de las Letras, or Literary Quarter. But the exact whereabouts of his grave within the convent chapel were unknown.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spain: Cervantes searchers find casket with his initials - AP News: MADRID (AP) \u2014 Experts searching for the remains of Miguel .05/26/2016 18:09:12PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "MADRID (AP) \u2014 Experts searching for the remains of Miguel de Cervantes said Monday that", "title": "AP News - Spain: Cervantes searchers find casket with his initials", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/01/26/spain-cervantes-searchers-find-casket-with-his-initials-n1948217", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\26\\4795f530-0e05-42ed-b87a-0d546f974ad1.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "MADRID (AP) \u2014 Experts searching for the remains of Miguel de Cervantes said Monday that", "title": "AP News - Spain: Cervantes searchers find casket with his initials", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/01/26/spain-cervantes-searchers-find-casket-with-his-initials-n1948217", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/26/4795f530-0e05-42ed-b87a-0d546f974ad1.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Spain: Cervantes searchers find casket with his initials, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "MADRID (AP) \u2014 Experts searching for the remains of Miguel de Cervantes said Monday that they found wooden fragments of a casket bearing the initials \"M.C.\"\nArcheologists made the find over the weekend during excavations to solve the centuries-old mystery of where the famed Spanish writer was laid to rest.\nAboard the ship La Marquesa, Cervantes was hit with three musket shots, two in the chest and one in his hand.\nEtxeberria and others will now start examining the bones to try to determine whether Cervantes' are among them.\nCervantes was 69 when he died and investigators have solid clues to work with as they conduct their probe."}
