(Jim Rydbom / The Greeley Tribune)\n\nDenver \u2014 A Christmas snowstorm brought over 2 feet of snow to the mountains of southwestern Colorado through Friday.\n\nSnow was expected to keep falling in the mountains and the Eastern Plains until the evening.\n\nWolf Creek ski resort says it got 28 inches. Accumulations of 16 inches were reported both at Beaver Creek and Grand Mesa, while Eldorado Springs near Boulder got nearly 15 inches of snow. Denver got 3.4 inches of snow on Christmas, with some additional dusting on Friday.\n\nDespite light snow, flights at Denver International Airport were delayed by an average of an hour because of de-icing and the extra holiday traffic. About 163,000 passengers were expected to pass through the airport, nearly 20,000 more than on an average day.\n\nConditions on Interstate 70 were so bad in the morning that the chain law for passenger vehicles was in effect for about four hours between Golden and Idaho Springs for the first time this winter season, Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman Amy Ford said. While the law is in effect, drivers must have an eighth of an inch of tread on their tires or use chains for added traction.\n\nThe law has been in existence for years but CDOT is trying to raise awareness about it now to help cut down on accidents due to bald tires, which can back up traffic on I-70 during ski season. To test tires, CDOT recommends drivers take the \"George Washington test\" by putting a quarter in their tire's tread, head first. If the tip of Washington's head or more is covered, their tires meet the law's requirements, Ford said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, drivers aren't being targeted for breaking the law, but if they get involved in an accident, they could get a citation with a fine around $200.\n\nBy early next week, another band of snow is expected to move into Colorado, along with single-digit high temperatures across much of the state.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27212377/southwest-colorado-mountains-get-2-feet-snow", "modificationDate": "2014-12-27T07:59:56-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1226/20141226__27DRSNOW~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2024-12-26T20:35:38-0700", "description": "Denver  \u2014 A Christmas snowstorm brought over 2 feet of snow to the mountains of southwestern Colorado through Friday.", "ag": {"canon": "CanonCityDailyRecord:article:27212377:view"}, "startDate": "2014-12-27T07:59:14-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27212377/southwest-colorado-mountains-get-2-feet-snow", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1226/20141226__27DRSNOW~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Denver  \u2014 A Christmas snowstorm brought over 2 feet of snow to the mountains of southwestern Colorado through Friday.", "title": "Southwest Colorado mountains get 2 feet of snow"}, "twitter": {"domain": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "description": "Denver  \u2014 A Christmas snowstorm brought over 2 feet of snow to the mountains of southwestern Colorado through Friday.", "title": "Southwest Colorado mountains get 2 feet of snow", "url": "http://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/ci_27212377/southwest-colorado-mountains-get-2-feet-snow", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1226/20141226__27DRSNOW~1.jpg", "site": "@CCDR_news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-27T07:59:14-0700", "sailthru.site": "canoncitydailyrecord.com", "sailthru.title": "Southwest Colorado mountains get 2 feet of snow", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Canon City Breaking News, Sports, Weather, Traffic", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "oCjqPZ-ii-IZW-fBJ0mmX5dmH5aafePG3FLx_kSYFiA", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site49/2014/1226/20141226__27DRSNOW~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2014-12-27T08:00:16-0700", "news_keywords": "Canon City news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Canon City Daily Record"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03bd\"", "article_summary": "(Jim Rydbom / The Greeley Tribune)Denver \u2014 A Christmas snowstorm brought over 2 feet of snow to the mountains of southwestern Colorado through Friday.\nTo test tires, CDOT recommends drivers take the \"George Washington test\" by putting a quarter in their tire's tread, head first.\nSnow was expected to keep falling in the mountains and the Eastern Plains until the evening.\nBy early next week, another band of snow is expected to move into Colorado, along with single-digit high temperatures across much of the state.\nAccumulations of 16 inches were reported both at Beaver Creek and Grand Mesa, while Eldorado Springs near Boulder got nearly 15 inches of snow."}
