ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Human remains found along an Alaska trail may be connected to the disappearance of a family of four missing since May, Kenai Police said Sunday.

The family’s disappearance prompted massive searches led by Kenai police with help from the FBI. The searches turned up no clues.

Relatives said at the time it appeared the family had left without packing. Their two vehicles remained parked outside their apartment and their rent for June had not been paid.

On Saturday, a person driving down a west Kenai trail spotted clothing and what appeared to be human remains, police said in a statement. Responding officers found remains and items reported missing from the home of Rebecca Adams, 23, and her boyfriend, Brandon Jividen, 38. They were last seen May 27, the day after Memorial Day.

Also missing were Adams’ children, Michelle Hundley, 6, and Jaracca Hundley, 3. The family dog also disappeared. Police said it would take time to positively identify the remains and complete the investigation at the scene.

The remains were found less than two miles from the family’s home.

FBI officials Sunday were traveling to Kenai. The department plans a briefing on the case at noon on Monday.

Kenai is a city of 7,100 about 65 miles southwest of Anchorage at the mouth of the Kenai River, Alaska’s most popular sport fishing attraction.
