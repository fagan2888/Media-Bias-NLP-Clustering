The 32-year old mother\u2019s performance has O\u2019Reilly befuddled.\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly sent singer Beyonce a message via Def Jam Record co-founder Russell Simmons this week. After the Fox News host got wind of what Time magazine described as \u201c Bey\u2019s properly XXX \u201d video \u201cPartition,\u201d O\u2019Reilly told the performer to \u201cknock it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would Beyonc\u00e9 do that?\u201d O\u2019Reilly asks Simmons. \u201cI think Beyonc\u00e9, what she has done here, is inexplicable. So I am asking you here, Russell Simmons, to explain it to me.\u201d\n\nSimmons goes on to defend Beyonc\u00e9 as an artist, which O\u2019Reilly gets really mad about.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s art?\u201d he spits back. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 in a back of a limo having sex and referencing Monica Lewinsky is art?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it is actually,\u201d Russell replies calmly. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is a brilliant artist.\u201d\n\nThe Obamas love her too. The First Couple have not only held her up as a fine role model for their girls, Mrs. Obama hired the barely literate, sexed-up singer to shake her stuff in front of middle school children as part of the $10 billion Let\u2019s Move campaign.\n\nPretty soon, there's a good chance that these same kids will be hit with a disproportionate number of STD\u2019s and abortions in their communities, but that doesn\u2019t faze the Obamas or Beyonce. The Affordable Care Act will provide all the antibiotics, contraceptives and abortifacients necessary to keep her fans from paying for having indiscriminate sex. STD\u2019s alone cost the health care system $16 billion a year, but chances are Obamacare panels won\u2019t be cutting costs in this area.\n\nBesides, bumping and grinding by herself or with her husband Jay Z at the Grammys in prime time is good, clean fun. That crowd thinks all those preachy prudes and uptight so-cons are judgmental hypocrites who think sex is dirty. And the Carters are married, which makes their public sex displays a novelty for the 70% of kids in black communities being raised by a single mother and different partners.\n\nBeyonce is not responsible for the nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections that occur every year in this country; half among young people ages 15\u201324. Sex sells and she\u2019s a brilliant artist adored by President Obama and his wife.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/03/beyonce_sex_video_may_help_push_std_rates_even_higher.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Beyonce sex video may help push STD rates even higher"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd010b\"", "article_summary": "That crowd thinks all those preachy prudes and uptight so-cons are judgmental hypocrites who think sex is dirty.\nBill O\u2019Reilly sent singer Beyonce a message via Def Jam Record co-founder Russell Simmons this week.\n\u201cI think Beyonc\u00e9, what she has done here, is inexplicable.\nThe steamy track , which features a striptease on a piano, pole dancing and oral sex in a limo, is streaming out to Beyonce fans everywhere.\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 in a back of a limo having sex and referencing Monica Lewinsky is art?\u201d\u201cYeah, it is actually,\u201d Russell replies calmly."}
