Some members spend the time in their home districts, reconnecting with constituents and raising funds. Others travel throughout the country or overseas to learn more first-hand about the policy issues they most care about, returning to Capitol Hill armed with fresh knowledge and new perspective.\n\n\u201cIn a general, travel can be an important part of fulfilling their oversight role,\u201d said Joshua Sewell, a senior policy analyst for Taxpayers for Common Sense.\n\nRelated: A Revolutionary Budget Proposal for Congress: Do Your Work on Time!\n\nEven foreign trips can educate members about how an initiative is \u201cactually working on the ground. The danger comes in when the trips start to move away from being about business and more about pleasure,\u201d he said, recalling a 2012 trek to Israel where Rep. Kevin Yoder (R-KS) went skinny-dipping.\n\nCalculations by congressional tracking website LegiStorm show that more than $5 million was spent on trips in 2014, down by more than $1 million from the previous year. A partial analysis of 2015 states that more than $3 million has been doled out on travel.\n\nThat amount might sound like a lot in penny-pinching Washington but \u201cspending a few dollars to check on how you\u2019re spending a few billion? It\u2019s worth it,\u201d according to former Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA), who traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen and parts of Africa over the course of his 20-year congressional career.\n\nRelated: U.S. Could Lose Out on 1.4 Million Jobs if Congress Refuses to Make a Budget Deal\n\nTrips aboard are most often conducted via an official, taxpayer-funded congressional delegation (CODEL). The travel is usually approved by the House Speaker or the relevant committee chair and then worked out with federal agencies like the State, Defense and Treasury departments.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA) led the most high-profile CODEL of the 2015 recess thus far, taking a contingent of her fellow Democrats on a trip through Italy, where members received briefings from military officials in Naples and visited Milan Expo 2015. They next stopped in Ukraine to meet with government leaders and discuss the fragile security situation in that country.\n\nBefore leaving for the recess, Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) said he and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) would lead a trip to facilities in Sweden and Norway.\n\nWhile Whitehouse will likely use the sojourn to focus on his pet issue of global warming, McCain hopes the trip will add to an ongoing Armed Services debate about the future of U.S. military strategy in the Arctic.\n\nRelated: Cornyn Says Budget Deal Inevitable to Avert a Government Shutdown\n\nMore trips are likely to be announced before lawmakers reconvene in September, though many, especially those centered around national security, will only be learned about after the have concluded.\n\nIraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are frequent stops for lawmakers but the visits are only publicized afterward out of security concerns.\n\nIn addition to an old-fashioned CODEL there are privately-sponsored trips, which are paid for by foreign governments and trade groups.\n\nLast week 58 House members \u2014 22 Democrats and 36 Republicans \u2014 made a biennial trip to Israel. The trip was paid for by the American Israel Education Foundation, the charitable arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and took place roughly a month before Congress is set to consider the controversial Iran nuclear deal.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) chaperoned the Democratic contingent to the country and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) led the Republican delegation.\n\nThe duo put out a joint statement saying they toured a battery of the Iron Dome missile defense system, which the U.S. helped create.\n\n\u201cAs we visited the towns of Ashkelon and Sderot near Gaza, we saw firsthand that without the Iron Dome, many more people would have lost their lives. Congress stands united with Israel, not only in support of its Iron Dome defenses, but also in preserving Israel\u2019s security and ensuring the safety of its people,\u201d they said.\n\nLegistorm said when the trip last took place in 2013 with 60 members, the price tag was about $1 million, or roughly $18,000 per lawmaker.\n\nSuch trips aren\u2019t without risk. The House Ethics Committee recently closed an investigation into 10 lawmakers and 32 congressional aides after it found they did not \u201cknowingly\u201d break any law or rule when they accepted airfare and gifts that were funded, secretly, by Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil company.\n\nCloser to home, Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA), who chairs a House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee subpanel, took a bipartisan delegation on a \u201ctour\u201d of the region around Bakken, ND.\n\n\u201cThis weekend\u2019s tour gave us a firsthand look at the many elements of crude oil transportation,\u201d he said in a statement after the trip, which will likely be paid for out of the committee\u2019s coffers.\n\nChambliss, who said \u201c98 percent\u201d of his trips were on the government\u2019s dime, said members must be \u201cjudicious\u201d in deciding what trips they want to take, especially a CODELs that come with more scrutiny.\n\nStill, he cited an old adage by former Sen. Sam Nunn (D-GA) who urged colleagues to travel as much as they can so they could build relations with their contemporaries in other countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better if you have a personal relationships than if you don\u2019t,\u201d Chambliss said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "An annual rite of summer, Congress recesses for five weeks every August to give members a break from legislative sausage-making and allow them to spend an extended period of time back in the home states or districts to reconnect with constituents and fundraise.", "title": "Where in the World Is Congress Spending Its Summer Vacation?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Where-World-Congress-Spending-Its-Summer-Vacation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122012_Congress_Zoom_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Where-World-Congress-Spending-Its-Summer-Vacation", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03122012_Congress_Zoom_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "An annual rite of summer, Congress recesses for five weeks every August to give members a break from legislative sausage-making and allow them to spend an extended period of time back in the home states or districts to reconnect with constituents and fundraise.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2993\"", "article_summary": "An annual rite of summer, Congress takes a recess for five weeks every August.\nLast week 58 House members \u2014 22 Democrats and 36 Republicans \u2014 made a biennial trip to Israel.\nThat amount might sound like a lot in penny-pinching Washington but \u201cspending a few dollars to check on how you\u2019re spending a few billion?\nEven foreign trips can educate members about how an initiative is \u201cactually working on the ground.\nRelated: A Revolutionary Budget Proposal for Congress: Do Your Work on Time!"}
