(AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump released a plan on Saturday aimed at overhauling the Department of Veterans Affairs and improving veterans' health care and employment services.\n\nUnder Trump's plan, eligible veterans would be able to bring their veterans' identification cards to any private doctor or facility that accepts Medicare and be able to receive immediate treatment. The change, he said, would help improve wait times and services by adding competition.\n\nSEE MORE ELECTION COVERAGE AT AOL.COM\n\n\"The plan will ensure our veterans get the care they need whenever and wherever they need it,\" said Trump, who previewed the plan during a rally that drew thousands in front of the battleship USS Wisconsin in Norfolk, Virginia, That's the same city where 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney chose to announce Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential pick.\n\nFor more on Donald Trump on the campaign trail, scroll through the gallery below:\n\nTrump releases plan aimed at improving veterans' care Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures while speaking at a town hall meeting at the Atkinson Country Club in Atkinson, N.H., Monday, Oct. 26, 2015.

Trump also focused on providing better support for female veterans, including improved health services.\n\n\"Politicians in Washington have tried to fix the VA by holding hearings and blindly throwing money at the problem. None of it has worked,\" according to the plan. \"It's time we stop trusting Washington politicians to fix the problems and empower our veterans to vote with their feet.\"\n\nTrump's plan, however, does not include any details about how much it would cost to implement or how he would pay for it. He said in Virginia that the changes he'd propose would cost less than the system now in place because he would stamp out waste. A campaign spokeswoman did not respond to a request for additional details.\n\nTrump has made a point of criticizing the way veterans in the country are treated ever since he faced criticism early in his campaign for questioning Sen. John McCain's status as a war hero after being a prisoner of war in North Vietnam.\n\nPete Hegseth, who heads the group Concerned Veterans for America, which criticized Trump's comments then, said in a statement that the plan was disappointing in its lack of detail.\n\n\"While Donald Trump rightly proposes more health care choices for veterans and long-overdue accountability for bad VA employees, his 'plan' is painfully thin on specifics about how he would implement those principles,\" he said, adding that the proposals offered \"are very similar to the same old song and dance of dumping more money into the VA to build more clinics and expand VA mandates -- something that has been tried repeatedly and failed.\"\n\nHe noted that the Veterans Choice program, a centerpiece of the VA overhaul approved last year, already provides veterans access to federally paid medical care from local, non-VA doctors.\n\nTrump has also released policy papers on immigration, the Second Amendment and tax reform.\n\nVeterans groups have criticized another Republican presidential contender, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, for proposing to eliminate the Department of Veterans Affairs entirely.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign has said she intends to lay out plans in November for VA improvements.\n\nTo see all the presidential candidates for 2016, scroll through the gallery below:\n\nTrump releases plan aimed at improving veterans' care Business mogul Donald Trump (R) (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont (D) (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Neurosurgeon Ben Carson of Maryland (R) (Photo/Paul Sancya) Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush (R) (AP Photo/Phelan M.
