Zeppos said during a Nashville Community Health Forum attended by state legislators and other stakeholders.\n\n\u201cMore than 220,000 Tennesseans do not qualify for TennCare and they work for employers that \u2026 have a hard time making their business offer health care benefits,\u201d Zeppos said. \u201cAt the same time, these employees are a vital part of our workforce. And a well employee is a good employee.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must improve our health overall to improve our workforce,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than 400 people attended the standing-room-only forum Jan. 14 at Vanderbilt\u2019s Student Life Center. They heard from a full slate of state health care experts, including Tennessee Health Commissioner John Dreyzehner; Dr. Mike Schatzlein, president and CEO of Saint Thomas Health; Rick Johnson, CEO of the Governor\u2019s Foundation for Health and Wellness; Dr. Fred Ralston of Fayetteville Medical Associates; Melinda Buntin, chair of the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt; Ralph Schulz, president and CEO of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce; and Joseph Webb, CEO of Metro Nashville General Hospital.\n\nThe event was moderated by Dr. Jeff Balser, vice chancellor for health affairs at Vanderbilt. He said the agenda was to better understand Insure Tennessee, Gov. Bill Hasam\u2019s proposed two-year pilot program to provide health care coverage to Tennesseans who don\u2019t have access to health insurance or have limited options.\n\n\u201cWe want to understand Gov. Haslam\u2019s plan and how it would lead to healthier lives,\u201d Balser said. \u201cAnd we really want to understand the impact of this plan on the economy of the state.\u201d\n\nSome sobering statistics were offered by Johnson, including that Tennessee ranks in the bottom 10 states in the country in overall health care outcomes.\n\n\u201cThere really is a health care crisis in this state,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou need to know that almost 70 percent of the people in Tennessee are classified as overweight or obese,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe have near epidemic rates of hypertension and stroke, very high rates of cardiovascular disease.\u201d\n\nFour factors\u2014tobacco addiction, obesity, physical inactivity and substance abuse\u2014are the main reasons for poor health in Tennessee, Dreyzehner said.\n\n\u201cThese are stubborn facts,\u201d Dreyzehner said. \u201cThat means we are all in the same boat, and the boat is in rough waters. Too many of us don\u2019t have life jackets.\u201d\n\nA series of maps shown by Buntin illustrated the potential of Insure Tennessee to vastly improve the number of Tennesseans with health insurance. Tennessee\u2019s least insured county, Sevier, could improve from 30 percent to 10 percent uninsured under Insure Tennessee, she said.\n\nIf Insure Tennessee became law and 200,000 Tennesseans signed up for insurance, more than $1 billion in federal money would be injected into the state, said Matt Murray of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee.\n\n\u201cThis means a lot of additional purchasing power flowing through the health care system,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt means about 15,000 new jobs for Tennesseans. It means over $900 million in income for Tennesseans.\u201d\n\nLegislators opposed to the Affordable Care Act would not contradict themselves by voting for Insure Tennessee, Schatzlein said.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a unique-to-Tennessee program. \u2026 It is a way to get billions of dollars of taxes that Tennesseans are paying that is going into less-effectively designed programs in other states and bring it back here in a way that\u2019s purely Tennessee.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tennessee must improve the health of its citizens if it wants to offer an attractive workforce to businesses, Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas S.
