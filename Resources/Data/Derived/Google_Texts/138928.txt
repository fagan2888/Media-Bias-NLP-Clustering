Much has been made about new “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon’s supposed liberal inclinations, but Wednesday night he had no problem ripping Obamacare and needling President Obama over his handling of Ukraine.

Fallon’s humorous assault took the form of a fictional phone call between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“Look, don’t you see what you’re doing though? You’re forcing people to accept something that the majority of them don’t even want,” the actor playing Obama tells Putin, referring to Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine.

“Yes,” responds Fallon, playing Putin. “In Russia we have word for this: Obamacare.”

Fallon also needled Obama’s impotent handling of the Ukraine situation more broadly.

“So look, Vlad, just to recap our call, no progress was made here, right?” the Obama character says at the end of the skit.

“None at all,” Fallon’s Putin responds.

“Okay. Take care,” the faux Obama says before hanging up.

In real life, over the past month President Obama has spent over four hours on the phone with Putin discussing the situation in Ukraine. So far, those phone calls do not seem to have yielded any substantive accomplishments.
