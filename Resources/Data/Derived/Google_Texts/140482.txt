The Internal Revenue Service has issued proposed regulations on reporting requirements under the Affordable Care Act. The regulations, released on Sept. 9, address two separate ACA reporting requirements: one relating to the individual mandate and the other relating to the employer mandate. Failure to comply could result in tax penalties unless the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.

Each of these requirements has been delayed one year. The government is encouraging voluntary compliance for reports due in 2015 (for the 2014 calendar year), but the first mandatory reports are not due until 2016 (for the 2015 calendar year).
