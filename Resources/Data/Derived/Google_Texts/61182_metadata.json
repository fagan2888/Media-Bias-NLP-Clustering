And Hudgens is an example of that, too.\n\nFirst, a bit of background from Bloomberg:\n\nRepublicans seeking to unseat the U.S. Senate incumbent in North Carolina have cut in half the portion of their top issue ads citing Obamacare, a sign that the party\u2019s favorite attack against Democrats is losing its punch. The shift \u2014 also taking place in competitive states such as Arkansas and Louisiana \u2014 shows Republicans are easing off their strategy of criticizing Democrats over the Affordable Care Act now that many Americans are benefiting from the law and the measure is unlikely to be repealed.\n\nNow, as for Hudgens. The state insurance commissioner told our AJC colleague Nicholas Fouriezos on Wednesday that he just got caught up in the heat of the moment last August:\n\n\u201cI spoke to a Republican group in Rome, Ga., and I said I was going to be an obstructionist, but I can\u2019t be. I mean, I was talking to a Republican group and I was throwing them some red meat. \u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work. But there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. \u201c\n\nPerhaps more important, Hudgens said four insurance agencies that are expected to join the Georgia health insurance market place, bringing the number up to nine. The new four: UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Assurant and Coventry \u2013 did so after waiting to see what would happen in the first year of the ACA\u2019s implementation.\n\n\u201cThey know what the prices are, they know what the experience is, so they took a wait and see attitude and now they\u2019ve come in,\u201d said Hudgens, who faces Democrat Liz Johnson in a November general election.\n\nHudgens said the additions will give consumers more choices, at least, on paper. The new companies could also bring down the cost. \u201cThe consumer in Georgia is going to be able to choose between nine companies, but really they\u2019re choosing the same product,\u201d Hudgens said. \u201cThe pricing is not going to be the same but the coverage is.\u201d\n\nHowever, Hudgens said still didn\u2019t see the benefits for most Georgia citizens. \u201cThe only reason I see for an individual to go into that federally facilitated exchange and buy a product is if they are eligible for a federal subsidy. There is a real question in that federal district court ruled strict compliance with the language of the ACA says that if it\u2019s a federal exchange (like in Georgia), no subsidies are available.\u201d\n\nA separate court ruling found exactly otherwise \u2014 so the point remains in dispute.\n\n***\n\nThree of the four top Democratic and Republican candidates will be on a stage in Macon this afternoon.\n\nThe Georgia Chamber of Commerce annual luncheon, with a sold-out audience of 1,100, will feature a debate/forum/comparison shopping opportunity featuring two of the three candidates for U.S. Senate. Libertarian Amanda Swafford was not invited.\n\nYou may watch the noon confrontation between Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue by clicking here, courtesy of 13MAZ. If you miss it, C-SPAN plans a delayed broadcast.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal will have the stage in a preliminary greeting \u2013 but Democratic rival Jason Carter will be working the crowd, we were told this morning. It wouldn\u2019t suprise us if former U.S. senator Sam Nunn and former Gov. Sonny Perdue are in the audience, too. This is their home turf.\n\nUpdate at 11:06 a.m.: The Democratic campaign of Jason Carter sends word that the gubernatorial candidate will not be at this afternoon\u2019s gathering.\n\n***\n\nThe New York Times now gives Perdue an 88 percent chance of victory.\n\nA series of polls showing Perdue ahead has the race tipping in the Republican\u2019s favor \u2014 resulting, in the paper\u2019s \u201cLeo\u201d forecasting model, in an increase in Republican hopes to take over the Senate in January.\n\n***\n\nThe conservative-leaning Washington Times is needling Democrat Jason Carter over his support for gay marriage.\n\nThe piece calls on Gov. Nathan Deal to pressure the Democrat to say \u201cunequivocally whether he would be prepared as governor to fully defend Georgia\u2019s state constitutional amendment, enacted by the people, that defines traditional marriage.\u201d\n\nResponding to pressure from gay media organizations this month, Carter\u2019s campaign said he supports \u201ccivil marriage equality,\u201d a position roundly criticized by the Times. You can read the full piece here.\n\n***\n\nRepublicans are planning an event on Friday for a controversial Texas Republican.\n\nDemocratic allies sent us word of the BBQ featuring Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert, an outspoken proponent of the \u201c\u2018birther\u201d movement who once compared homosexuality to bestiality.\n\nThe Franklin County GOP is hosting the dinner with Gohmert and Rep. Doug Collins on Friday, and Gov. Nathan Deal is set to appear at a separate event there on Saturday \u2013 not with Gohmert.\n\nElizabeth Bettis, a grassroots organizing specialist who once worked for the Deal campaign but now works for the state party, is listed as a contact. We\u2019re told Deal has no connection to the event, and that Bettis hasn\u2019t worked for the campaign since the primary.\n\n***\n\nRepublicans are telling Bloomberg News they feel bullish about expanding their majority in the U.S. House. Except for that pesky last white Democrat in the Deep South who\u2019s still polling strong. From Bloomberg\u2019s Al Hunt:\n\nIn the House, Republicans are confident they will add five to 10 seats to their majority, even while losing a handful of seats they now hold. One top strategist notes that in the party\u2019s polling of the two dozen Democratic-held seats they\u2019re targeting, there\u2019s only one where the Democratic candidate tops 50 percent. That\u2019s John Barrow of Georgia, who has held on to a Republican-leaning district for a decade with a conservative voting record and shrewd political campaigning.\n\nAnd today Barrow dropped a new ad shot at the Port of Savannah, touting how when the Obama administration did not include any port deepening money in its budget \u201cI took \u2019em on.\u201d He adds, \u201cand this year, we finally got it done.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that while Congress did authorize the project to begin with state money, the administration has yet to cough up the dough.\n\nThe American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons is also weighing in on the race with $56,000 for a three-week pro-Barrow radio ad buy. The group tends to give more to Republicans than Democrats.\n\n***\n\nRep. Austin Scott, R-Tifton, who serves on the Armed Forces Committee, has a template for how U.S. forces should approach ISIL in Iraq and Syria: Colombia\u2019s FARC revolutionaries, who are now engaged in peace talks with the government.\n\nThis is what Scott told constituents in Forsyth on Wednesday, via the Macon Telegraph, after saying we must change course in Iraq:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/08/21/ralph-hudgens-i-cant-be-an-obamacare-obstructionist/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/electphoto-1103-cc171.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "Last year, when Georgia Insurance Commissioner Ralph Hudgens said he would do \"everything in our power to be an obstructionist\" when it came to Obamacare, he became the national example -- as far as Democrats were concerned -- of red-state hard-headedness to the law.\r\n\r\nBut there are signs that Republicans have begun...", "title": "Ralph Hudgens: No longer an Obamacare \u2018obstructionist\u2019 | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
