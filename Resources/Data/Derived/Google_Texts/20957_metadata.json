Savings can be considerably higher depending on specific applications, selection of the tube coverage and if various third party items are included in the contract.\n\nThe price ranges below are sound values to use for budgetary consideration, but not for negotiation. For example, looking at the 16-20 slice CT deals included, the average savings identified is $92,400, for the 64-80 slice CT, the average savings identified can be $168,245 and the savings identified for the premium high end CT scanner (128 \u2013 360) is $380,000. Values vary by vendor, model, clinical application and variables related to how the quote is configured and the purchase situation.\n\nKeys to finding savings include creating a strong, united team approach and deciding on what coverage is best for the particular CT scanner, starting with its applications and reviewing its previous maintenance reports (installed base). From there keep a unified approach to the price of the system as well as the service contract on the back end for new system purchases.\n\n16 \u2013 20 Slice CT Scanners\n\nSystem Purchase Prices\n\nLow High Average Price\n\n$421,808 $711,868 $519,090\n\nSystem Service Support Prices\n\nLow High Average Price\n\n$82,378 $126,675 $106,440\n\n64 \u2013 80 Slice CT Scanners\n\nSystem Purchase Prices\n\nLow High Average Price\n\n$560,000 $1,283,500 $778,900\n\nSystem Service Support Prices\n\nLow High Average Price\n\n$89,000 $148,800 $120,000\n\nPremium High-End 128 \u2013 640 to Dual Source CT Scanners\n\nSystem Purchase Prices\n\nLow High Average Price\n\n$905,000 $2,500,000 $1,407,808\n\nSystem Service Support Prices\n\nLow High Average Price\n\n$100,600 $236,225 $154,000\n\nFor service contracts, prices are highly variable, depending on the level of coverage. Most vendors offer a \u201cmenu\u201d for service and support that allow facilities to choose various options of service coverage (comprehensive, multi-level and contract term) to meet the needs and applications of the CT scanner. The facility should choose the service type and coverage, uptime guarantee, hours of coverage, etc., according to their specific caseload or patient volume.\n\nContracts can include transitional coverage from full service and in-house support over the contract term. All CT vendors offer real-time monitoring with remote diagnostics. Obtaining bids at different levels of service and possibly assuming more risk will lower the price of the service contract.\n\nWhen it comes to service contracts, third party options are often much less expensive as compared to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). For example, savings on CT injectors are around $1,200 on average for third party maintenance as compared to the OEM.\n\nData source: MD Buyline (Please note these numbers have been adjusted to exclude special deals, outliers and unique circumstances.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/purchasing-insight-ct-scanners", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Radiology reimbursement continues to drop, but healthcare providers often can achieve significant savings off the quoted vendor price for CT systems.
