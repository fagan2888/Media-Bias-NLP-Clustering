Who needs to do that? Fund-raising? Can\u2019t be bothered. Parse your words? Fuhgetabout it.\n\nDonald Trump took the rules of modern politics, trashed them and became the last man standing for the Republican nomination anyway.\n\nEight ways Trump did it his way:\n\nSay anything\n\nIt\u2019s what Trump\u2019s supporters love about him: He blurts out whatever pops into his head. He rejects \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d He insults rivals and critics. He has fun. After one particularly salty salvo, Trump explained: \u201cThat\u2019s what I mean about being politically correct, every once in a while you can have a little fun, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Plenty of candidates may think it, but Trump said it: \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d he said of one protester. To listen to a Trump speech from start to finish is to enter an alternate grammatical universe. Sentences veer off in unexpected directions as Trump has a new thought. When he interjects his trademark \u201cby the way,\u201d there\u2019s no telling where he\u2019s headed next.\n\nCheapskate\n\nThe billionaire is proud to campaign on the cheap, milking free media in a way that other candidates could only envy. He functioned through most of the primaries with a bare-bones staff. He has no national finance chairman. He never set up a traditional fundraising operation. Sure, he has \u201cdonate\u201d buttons on his website, and raises millions hawking hats and other gear. But forget the chicken dinner circuit. Or charging donors $1,000 for a grip-and-grin photo. Or asking supporters to \u201cbundle\u201d contributions from friends and neighbors. Early on, Trump tweeted: \u201cSo, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!\u201d\n\nNo polling\n\nThe poll-obsessed candidate doesn\u2019t have a pollster. Other candidates spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on surveys to poll-test their words and messages, and track their standings in primary states. Trump goes with his gut and mines public polls for intel.\n\nConsistency\n\nMost candidates recoil from the dreaded \u201cflip-flopper\u201d label. Trump unabashedly changes his mind \u2014 not just week to week or day to day, but sometimes even within the same speech. He frames it as an asset. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a successful person who wasn\u2019t flexible,\u201d Trump said at one GOP debate.\n\nPolicy gaps\n\nCandidates love to trot out five-point plans and lofty position papers \u2014 some more detailed than others. Trump, not so much. His outline for replacing Obamacare is more aspirational than detailed. His recent \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy speech was a broad-brush endeavor. Trump makes a virtue of leaving enemies guessing about U.S. intentions. \u201cWe have to be unpredictable, starting now,\u201d he says.\n\nPotty mouth\n\nTrump salts his speeches with vulgarities \u2014 although he\u2019s dialed it back a bit after a scolding from Melania. Lots of politicians use profanities, of course, but typically not in public. Trump has publicly lip-synced the F-bomb, blurted out the S-word and hurled an offensive term at rival Ted Cruz.\n\nDissing super PACs\n\nIt\u2019s become routine for candidates to rely on independent super PACs stocked with former aides and allies to play a strong supporting role for their campaigns, spending millions on political ads. Trump didn\u2019t go that route in the primary, and was proud to proclaim he didn\u2019t have a super PAC, although a few have sprung up to back him anyway.\n\nGreed is good\n\nRemember how 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney was tarred by critics as a ruthless corporate fat cat? Trump has turned greed into a campaign asset. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been greedy, greedy, greedy,\u201d he said at a rally in Iowa. \u201cI grabbed all the money I can get. I\u2019m so greedy. But now I want to be greedy for the United States. I want to grab all that money. I\u2019m going to be greedy for the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://www.trivalleycentral.com/casa_grande_dispatch/national_news/how-trump-broke-the-rules-of-modern-politics-and-won/article_08bd6a38-12de-11e6-85e9-f7f97165b57d.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "trivalleycentral.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Polling?
