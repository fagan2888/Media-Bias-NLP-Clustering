Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” political commentator Michael Eric Dyson and former major of New York Rudy Giuliani got into a heated debate about American law enforcement’s attitude towards African Americans which quickly devolved to a shouting match that ended with Dyson accusing Giuliani of having a “white supremacy” mindset.

When Giuliani brought up the “black on black crime” and murder rates, Dyson proclaimed, “White people who are policeman who kill black people do not go to jail.”

Screaming over each other for several minutes the pair continued to argue with Dyson wrapping up his comments by saying to Giuliani, “Look at this defense mechanism of white supremacy at work in your mind.”
