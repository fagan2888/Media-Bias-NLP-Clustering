By contrast, the best option available to men (short of sterilization) has an annual pregnancy rate of about 1 in 6 and has to be rolled onto an erect penis during each sexual encounter. A new generation of researchers would like to change that \u2014 but change takes money.\n\nWhy the Neglect?\n\nDuring the last 70 years, billions of dollars have gone into research on female contraception. While pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to invest in innovation, public health dollars and private philanthropists have funded research at university medical schools or nonprofits like the Population Council to fill the gap. As a consequence, family planning options and outcomes have improved, sometimes dramatically. Pills contain less hormones, IUDs now protect against disorders like endometriosis and several methods offer lighter, less frequent periods or other bonus health benefits.\n\nBut during the same time, research into male-controlled methods received paltry attention, largely because funders believed men weren\u2019t interested. That may have been true 70 years ago. But many men today say they are perfectly willing to share the responsibility of family planning and in fact want the means to manage their own fertility.\n\nYoung Men Feel It\n\nIn the 1970s the typical man was about 21 years old when his first child was born. Since then, that age has shifted by almost a decade \u2014 10 years in which many young men prefer to focus on education and launching a career before launching into parenthood. The more a young man cares about being a good partner and father (someday), and the more he cares about his own future, the more he is likely to feel stressed about the potential for unwanted pregnancy. Consider some of the following comments:\n\nBeing self-reliant is important to me. Condoms are pretty much awful, and it\u2019s just not good enough for me to have to trust a partner to consistently & effectively address the birth-control question. I know of too many firsthand accounts of instances in which doing so just didn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s time for men to have reliable options like women do. \u2013Adam\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely terrible to have no other option as a male. I\u2019m just 17, and thinking that I\u2019ll have to spend 50 years using the condom with no other possibility? That would be awful. I want something new! \u2013Samuel\n\nI\u2019d like something with the convenience and reliability of The Pill. Pop one in and don\u2019t worry about it. The key word here is choice and being free of worry. \u2013Alan\n\nI simply want to be able to take control into my own hands instead of relying on my partner who doesn\u2019t like having synthetic hormones coursing through her.\u2014Adam\n\nI\u2019ve been active in discussing and promoting the legalization of abortions, and it\u2019s a real pain to see the dismissal of male reproductive rights from the very same people who fight for women. It saddens me to hear the very same arguments the antiabortion camp uses against women. Like \u201cIf they\u2019re afraid of having unwanted kids, men should get vasectomies,\u201d or \u201cJust keep it in your pants.\u201d \u2013Facundo Cesa\n\nMales put their financial future in their hands as we have to pay child support for any pregnancy we father, no matter the circumstance. \u2013Gustavo\n\nNormally a man just can\u2019t know, and he doesn\u2019t even have a right to know what\u2019s the fertility status of a woman he has sex with. He doesn\u2019t know when she had her last period, if she\u2019s on the pill, if she has been taking it regularly, if she had antibiotics that might interfere, if she\u2019s on some other kind of birth control, if she had a hysterectomy, if she\u2019s trans and what\u2019s her stance on abortion, or even the morning-after pill (she\u2019s under no obligation to tell him ANY of that). That being the case, he just can\u2019t make an informed decision when he has sex. \u2013Facundo Cesa\n\nI want reliable control over my fertility, so I can control the timing and spacing when I have children. At this time in human history, it is a basic right. \u2013Derek\n\n\n\nGender Injustice\n\n\n\nDerek\u2019s comment about family planning as a basic human right strikes home for many. And yet, an upcoming (and much welcome) conference on the Human Right to Family Planning has not a single session devoted to better birth control for men.\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, every child would be created with the mutual consent of both biological parents. State of the art \u201cset-and-forget\u201d contraceptives coupled with safe abortion make that future a reality for the female half of the human population, at least for those privileged females who have access to the best money can buy. But guys who have sex (that\u2019s most of them) are still rolling the dice. A woman today may be using a method with a high failure rate. She may not be using contraception consistently enough. She may lie. And if a pregnancy occurs, she has the final say in whether to carry it forward.\n\n\n\nBetter birth control for men is a moral imperative and a matter of gender justice, as well as making good practical sense. We don\u2019t often talk about it this way, primarily because we\u2019re accustomed to females being the underdogs in the justice equation. For millennia, girls and women had little right to decline either sex or pregnancy, and in much of the world that is still the case. And yet, a young man\u2019s dreams, hopes, and family plans can be shattered by a surprise pregnancy. For those who care deeply about being good fathers, an ill-conceived pregnancy can be devastating. If we are going to help young men become loving, engaged parents, we need to ensure that they father a child only when they feel ready for partnership and nurturing.\n\nThe Male Contraception Initiative\n\nFrustrated by the lack of progress on male birth control, attorney Aaron Hamlin founded the Male Contraception Initiative at the beginning of 2015. The mission of MCI is to inform and mobilize the public and secure funding in order to accelerate better birth control for men. The MCI website features and follows a wide range of birth control methods in various phases of research. \u201cWe have to cast a wide net,\u201d says Hamlin. Even so, almost immediately, the MCI board and staff got excited about the molecular research of a small biotechnology company, Spacefill Discovery, which became the focus of their first, exploratory crowd-funding campaign. After raising $12,000 from 200 donors this summer, MCI has been working with Spacefill Discovery to secure additional grant and venture funding.\n\nInnovation Depends on Small Biotech\n\nEarly stage contraceptive research is a wide funnel, meaning many projects need to be funded for one to achieve success. In the past, a pharmaceutical company might have invested hundreds of millions of dollars over literally decades \u2014 mostly in dead ends \u2014 before taking a new drug to market. One male contraceptive, a bimonthly hormone injection, got as far as international clinical trials before being canceled abruptly in 2011 due to mood changes, depression and increased libido in some trial participants. Long lead times, high financial risks, complex regulations and liability make R & D of this type unattractive to the institutional investor and big pharma. Consequently, contraceptive innovation has largely been abandoned by established pharmaceutical companies, which mostly opt instead to make minor tweaks in existing lucrative franchises in order to extend patent protections. Today, 14 products drive 80 percent of revenue in the female contraceptive market, all of them using hormone formulations that were identified and synthesized a generation ago.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A majority of men want more birth control options for themselves.
