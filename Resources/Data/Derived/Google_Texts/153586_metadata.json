It\u2019s a proposal that then-Sen. Clinton did not support.\n\nHillary Clinton, the front runner, has sought to showcase a clear difference with Bernie Sanders, her chief rival in the party\u2019s 2016 primary.\n\nThe three candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination don't disagree on much - except, perhaps, on gun control.\n\n\u201cI think he has been consistently confusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability,\u201d she said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nThe Dec. 2 massacre in San Bernardino and other recent mass shootings have brought gun violence back into the public spotlight, and renewed the debate over whether federal gun laws should be strengthened.\n\nIn a tearful speech at the White House last week, President Obama announced an executive action that calls for law enforcement officials to essentially warn private gun sellers that they may be vulnerable to prosecution if they don\u2019t conduct background checks on gun buyers.\n\nNational polls have repeatedly shown that Americans support background checks on gun sales to help weed out felons and the mentally ill.\n\nSanders has said his vote on the 2005 measure was \u201ccomplicated\u201d and has said he\u2019s open to revisiting the issue.\n\n\u201cIf you have a small gun shop owner in northern Vermont who sells a gun legally to somebody and then, you know, something happens to that guy, he goes nuts or something, and he kills somebody, should the gun shop owner be held liable? I think not,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nBut if a manufacturer is sending guns \u201cinto an area and really knows that those guns are not being used or bought by the people in that area \u2026 should we hold that manufacturer liable? Absolutely,\u201d he added.\n\nOn Sunday, seeking to bolster her standing among gun-control supporters, Clinton announced the endorsement of former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona. Giffords was injured in a 2011 shooting outside a Tucson grocery store and ever since the incident she has been a staunch advocate of stricter gun-control reforms.\n\n\"Most of the people running for president talk a lot about how tough they are,\" Giffords wrote in her endorsement of Clinton. \"But most of them have shown they aren\u2019t tough enough to stand up to the gun lobbyists.\"\n\n\n\nUPDATE: 4:05 p.m. This post was updated with information about Gabby Giffords' endorsement of Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "If Donald Trump loses Iowa, he's not backing down", "Description": "More from Trail Guide Jan. 11 Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina bounced off the main GOP debate stage Jan. 8 Martin O'Malley in the next Democratic debate unless he stumbles in Iowa Jan. 7 Hillary Clinton receives endorsement from Planned Parenthood Jan. 6 Donald Trump questions Ted Cruz's presidential...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "More from Trail Guide Jan. 11 Rand Paul, Carly Fiorina bounced off the main GOP debate stage Jan. 8 Martin O'Malley in the next Democratic debate unless he stumbles in Iowa Jan. 7 Hillary Clinton receives endorsement from Planned Parenthood Jan. 6 Donald Trump questions Ted Cruz's presidential...", "title": "If Donald Trump loses Iowa, he's not backing down", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-01102016-htmlstory.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fd643a/turbine/la-l-a-times-logo-20160331/600", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-01-10", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "This post was updated with information about Gabby Giffords' endorsement of Clinton.\n\"Most of the people running for president talk a lot about how tough they are,\" Giffords wrote in her endorsement of Clinton.\nOn Sunday, seeking to bolster her standing among gun-control supporters, Clinton announced the endorsement of former Rep.
