Some fear that descriptions of anomalous loan balances accrued on loans provided by the federal government will lead to the institution of underwriting student loans\u2014thereby limiting access to poor students or students who want to study in non-lucrative fields that provide a tangible (think social work) or intangible (think English) benefit in the labor force. For others, that would be a feature and not a bug.\n\nBut my takeaway from the article wasn\u2019t that we should be underwriting student loans, but rather how weak and complex the backend protections are for people who do fall behind on their debts when life gets in the way.\n\nKelley, the article\u2019s protagonist, managed to accumulate student debt from her undergraduate education at a private college, followed by a stint in law school and a graduate teaching program (including a brief time in a Ph.D. program), and finally through Parent PLUS loans after her children had maxed out their federal loan eligibility. Like anyone else who has been frustrated by high-interest private or graduate school loans, Kelley found her balance had spiraled upward due to hundreds of thousands of dollars in accrued interest. But she also faced some debilitating luck \u2013 including a rare medical condition, concentrated effects from the Great Recession, and a divorce \u2013 that left her unable to make a dent in her loan payments and forced her to cash out her pension fund.\n\nThere\u2019s recourse available to people who find themselves in cycles of unpayable debt; it\u2019s called bankruptcy. Unfortunately for student debtors, education loans are exceedingly difficult to discharge in bankruptcy, which makes little sense in an era where college is unattainable for most without student loans, and where student debt is the highest form of non-mortgage debt in the economy. We argue this in a new brief released last week that goes through the legal and policy history behind the treatment of student debt in bankruptcy.\n\nThe case against allowing student loans to be discharged mostly rests on fears of moral hazard\u2014that an army of young people will get rich quick by racking up debt, discharging it upon graduation and spending the next few decades rebuilding their credit while federal taxpayers pick up the tab. A non-partisan commission debunked this theory in the late 1990s, finding that \u201cavailable evidence does not support the notion that the bankruptcy system was systematically abused when student loans were more easily dischargeable.\u201d In essence, these were phantom fears, but this didn\u2019t stop Congress from making it far more difficult to discharge both federal and private student loans over the course of four decades.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America is still reeling from its worst recession in decades.
