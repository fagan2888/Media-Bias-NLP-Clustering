Congratulations on the milestone, and by the way, no more writing those hefty checks to the preschool every month.\n\nIt\u2019s like getting a raise, right?\n\nSurprise, surprise.\n\nThe euphoria over transitioning from day care to school often obscures the fact that there will be plenty of new costs \u2014 including many unexpected ones \u2014 pinging your checking account and wiping out whatever savings you thought you had coming.\n\nWhile many families start planning early for how they\u2019ll pay for the college years, there\u2019s not a lot of conversation about covering the costs associated with the early school years, particularly among parents experiencing this for the first time, said financial counselor Jason Armstrong.\n\n\u201cYou are so focused on getting your child off to a good start in school that you don\u2019t realize all the costs,\u201d said Armstrong, who works with customers on household budgeting and other financial issues as a branch manager for CommunityAmerica Credit Union in suburban Kansas City.\n\nFor some families, the biggest school item hitting the household budget will be the charge for all-day kindergarten. While policies vary, many school districts now charge $200 and up each month. And keep in mind that the fee likely won\u2019t cover care before and after school, in case you need it.\n\nThe charge for attending kindergarten, of course, will not be the only check you\u2019ll be writing. You\u2019ll also be paying for school supplies for the first time, and clothing expenses for your young one will likely go up to match growth spurts.\n\nYour grocery list might get longer to cover more snacks and lunches that get packed up for school. And during the dinner hour, more time-saving trips to the fast-food drive-through lane may be in store.\n\nThen there are the extracurricular activities that kick in during the first year of school \u2014 everything from youth soccer and other sports to dance to Scouting. Now you\u2019re paying for league fees, uniform and equipment costs and membership dues.\n\nAs many parents know all too well, medical costs also tend to kick up once the little ones start kindergarten. Germs run rampant, which may also take a toll on your health.\n\nAdd it all up, and you may well have reached the tipping point on your checking account.\n\nBut don\u2019t panic. There are many ways to manage and prepare for all the new costs associated with kindergarten, said Armstrong, who speaks from personal experience as the father of four school-age children.\n\nRun the numbers. Don\u2019t do it just in your head: Get out a piece of paper and on one column put down the dollar amount you had been spending on preschool and other child care. Then put potential school-related expenses in another column. Put some dollar amounts with each line item so you\u2019ll know what you\u2019re working with.\n\nShop around. School supply lists are easy to come by, so you can quickly scan the retail ads and put together a shopping list. While dollar stores and other discount retailers are great for school supply items most of the year, during August and September, office supply and drugstores often offer better back-to-school deals, said Armstrong.\n\nScrounge. Take inventory of cabinets and drawers for supplies. Ask friends and neighbors with older children if they\u2019d be willing to part with any gently used or unused clothing.\n\nDon\u2019t get trendy with backpacks, lunch boxes and technology. \u201cAt this age, kids don\u2019t really know what\u2019s new and hot,\u201d said Armstrong. He also recommends avoiding gender-specific gear that could limit reusing to the next child in the family.\n\nMonitor the socializing. Many parents feel the need to invite every child in the kindergarten class to a birthday party. But buying 21 gifts during the year \u2014 even at $5 or $10 a pop \u2014 can take a toll. If you want your child to go to all of them, then make birthday gifts a budget item, said Armstrong. If not, just say no.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see the numbers working for you, don\u2019t despair: It\u2019s always hard with the first one. But, on the bright side, you\u2019ll be better prepared for the next go-around.\n\nSteve Rosen,\n\nThe Kansas City Star", "article_metadata": {"description": "The euphoria over transitioning from daycare to school often obscures the fact that there will be plenty of new costs.", "og": {"description": "The euphoria over transitioning from daycare to school often obscures the fact that there will be plenty of new costs.", "title": "Thrifty is nifty for kindergarten parents", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140817-thrifty-is-nifty-for-kindergarten-parents.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140817-20001201_kindergarten.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/20001201_KINDERGARTEN.jpg", "height": 502}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-18T01:06:04Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-18T00:54:45Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Thrifty is nifty for kindergarten parents\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140817-thrifty-is-nifty-for-kindergarten-parents.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140817-20001201_kindergarten.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/20001201_KINDERGARTEN.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1864733\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-18T00:54:45Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"From wire reports\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140817-20001201_kindergarten.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/20001201_KINDERGARTEN.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-18T00:54:45Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1aa2\"", "article_summary": "As many parents know all too well, medical costs also tend to kick up once the little ones start kindergarten.\nSchool supply lists are easy to come by, so you can quickly scan the retail ads and put together a shopping list.\nMany parents feel the need to invite every child in the kindergarten class to a birthday party.\nFor some families, the biggest school item hitting the household budget will be the charge for all-day kindergarten.\nYour first-born is moving up from day care to kindergarten."}
