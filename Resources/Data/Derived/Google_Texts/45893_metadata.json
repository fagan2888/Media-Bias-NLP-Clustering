It hopes that by 2018, more than half of all payments will be tied to the quality of care doctors provide.\n\nCurrently, the majority of traditional Medicare payments are based on the traditional fee-for-service model, where doctors are paid for every surgery, physical exam and CT scan they perform, regardless of patients\u2019 outcomes. But alternative payment methods are gaining traction in the health community based on the quality of care, doctors\u2019 performances, patient outcomes, readmission rates and patient experience to determine how much providers should be paid.\n\nRelated: Medicare by the Numbers\n\nFor years, lawmakers, industry leaders and health policy wonks have agreed that the U.S. health care system should eventually ditch the current fee-for-service payment model and move toward alternative payment models tied to the quality of care. They say the current model incentivizes health providers to administer more services than are sometimes necessary, which has contributed to the ballooning costs of health care. Last year, Medicare\u2019s budget for fee-for-service payments was a whopping $362 billion.\n\nDoctors, of course, want to know how one decides \u201cthe quality of care\u201d short of negligence, and who will make those decisions. The greatest fear some patients have is that big city doctors \u2013 especially top surgeons and specialists \u2013 will drop out of Medicare altogether, which has already started to happen.\n\nSteven Brill, author of America's Bitter Pill: Money, Politics, Back-Room Deals, and the Fight to Fix Our Broken Healthcare System, said, \u201cIt would certainly be more likely that doctors would agree to a regime like this if there was tort reform, if doctors wouldn\u2019t suffer the consequences of being sued for using the kind of cost-effective procedures that the new Medicare payment reform proposes.\u201d\n\nMany policy makers and health providers have pushed for ways to emphasize the quality of care over the quantity.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act included several provisions that set up such alternative payment plans, including Accountable Care Organizations, Patient-Centered Medical Homes, bundled payments and other pay-for-performance programs. Currently 20 percent of traditional payments go through these programs.\n\nRelated: Major Changes to Medicare Coming for Senior Health Care\n\nNow the administration\u2019s plan is to expand participation in these payment models\u2014by 2016, they expect 30 percent, then 50 percent by 2018.\n\nSo, what will that mean for the patient? In theory, better care at a lower cost, though there is limited information about how successful some of the pilot initiatives have been, including Accountable Care Organizations or ACOs.\n\nWhile the shift away from fee-for-service would significantly transform the payment model, experts say the patients\u2019 experience really won\u2019t change all that much.\n\nRelated: Historic Medicare Data Dump Blows Lid Off Doc Pay\n\n\u201cThere are no specific patient-care requirements that are different from regular fee-for-service Medicare. It is difficult to say if or how a move away from fee-for-service will change care for patients,\u201d Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Cristina Boccuti said.\n\nThe real change will be with how care is coordinated.\n\nAccountable Care Organizations\n\nTake ACOs, for example, which are just one of a handful of alternative payment programs. Under this setup, primary care physicians, hospitals and specialty doctors form networks to care for a population of patients. The entire network is then responsible for the cost and care of these patients. If it performs well on a number of metrics including patient outcomes, readmission rates, patient experience, etc., providers are rewarded with bonuses.\n\nIf a patient\u2019s primary care physician joins an ACO, that patient now belongs to that network of doctors. The patient can seek care outside of that network, but it\u2019s unlikely Medicare will pay for that service. The whole idea is intended to make it easier to coordinate treatment. It\u2019s set up like a team, where the doctors can easily share patients\u2019 information with each other and stay updated on a patient\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cThe theory is that because multiple providers within a given ACO share accountability for a given patient\u2019s care, coordination of services between the providers will improve,\u201d Boccuti said.\n\nEllen Pryga, director for policy at the American Hospital Association explains why this model is more beneficial than the traditional payment model.\n\n\u201cFee for service medicine has inherent inefficiencies \u2013 repeated tests, inefficiency transfer medicine \u2013 when you\u2019re in a coordinated care setting, they\u2019re able to avoid those things,\u201d said Ellen Pryga, director for policy at the American Hospital Association. \u201cWhen you have an integrated group of providers that are coordinating your care, you basically have a team, so it reduces some of the hassle factor of having lots of different clinicians involved.\u201d\n\nStill, some are concerned that ACO\u2019s are the new version of the reviled HMO\u2019s of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. The healthcare teams earn bonuses by saving Medicare money\u2014as much as 50 percent of what they save.\n\nTwo top doctors from the City University of NY School of Public Health who support Medicare reform \u2013 David U. Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler \u2013 wrote a blistering essay against Affordable Care Organizations in The Journal of General Internal Medicine in early January. In it, they accuse ACOs of being a new version of the reviled HMOs of the 70s and 80s: Their assessment was\n\nPhysicians were pressured to withhold care, and to hide that pressure from patients; bonuses of up to $150,000 annually were offered to doctors who minimized specialty referrals, inpatient care, etc. Our protest of those incentives, and a contract provision forbidding their disclosure (a 55 \u201cgag clause\u201d) led to \u201cdelisting.\u201d Award-winning physicians\u2014who often attract unprofitably sick 57 patients\u2014were also delisted. An academic leader admonished physicians: \u201c[We can] no longer tolerate having complex and expensive-to-treat patients encouraged to transfer to our group.\u201d In the end, Americans concluded that fee-for-NON-service was even worse than fee-for service.\n\nHarvard\u2019s health economist David Cutler and others argue that HMO\u2019s were insurers who dictated to doctors the kind of care they could provide regardless of patients\u2019 needs. They claim that because ACO\u2019s are providers that good care will be mandated \u2013 and that will be evident in the doctor and hospital evaluation outcomes.\n\nThe Cost Curve Keeps Rising\n\nThe abuses of overcharging for every service, every pill, every box of Kleenex for hospital patients is well documented by Brill and others who have found non-profit hospitals to be some of the most profitable \u201cbusinesses\u201d in the country.\n\nAlthough most industry leaders are on board with some kind of reform, many are treading cautiously until more details are released \u2013 especially with regard to the incentives they will receive for participating, and if they will be enough to offset any potential financial risks. Another concern is how quality should be measured, as some have expressed frustration with the current way the pay-for-performance and accountable care models measure quality.\n\nRelated: Why the Medicare Cost Problem is Still Unsolved?\n\nThe administration is still hammering out the details on how it plans to encourage providers to participate in these programs. So far, there is limited evidence to suggest the programs are yielding sufficient results and savings. Of course, that\u2019s partly because they\u2019re new; more time will yield greater information.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to learning more from HHS on how these new goals will be phased in,\u201d president of the American Hospital Association, Rick Pollack, said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, we encourage the administration to fully evaluate and improve on the delivery system reforms currently in place to ensure that we are learning from the pilot and demonstration projects to best meet patient needs.\u201d\n\nPilot Programs Yield Mixed Outcomes\n\nSo far, gathering intel on how well the pilot programs are doing has been tricky, and though the information is limited, what is available isn\u2019t all that great.\n\nRelated: If You Don\u2019t Take Your Meds, Should Your MD Be Punished?\n\nFor example, in December, the Health and Human Services Department reported to Congress that it didn\u2019t have results to determine if the bundled payment programs had saved Medicare money or affected the quality of care. What\u2019s more, only 220 of the 6,690 organizations approved to participate in the program actually went forward with the new payment model.\n\nMeanwhile, results for ACOs have been mixed. The quality measures have improved, but savings results are mixed. As Avalere Health noted, the ACOs\u2019 results demonstrate savings to Medicare and minimal savings to individual organizations or providers.\n\nOverall, Medicare saved $417 million through the first 220 accountable care contracts in its first year.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake: the results to date on the performance of APMs (alternative payment methods) do not support the administration\u2019s enthusiasm,\u201d John O\u2019 Shea, visiting fellow at the Center for Health Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in a blog post.\n\n\u201cGranted, fee-for-service may have its flaws, but before blindly pushing Medicare doctors and other medical professionals out of fee-for-service and over the cliff, the Obama administration should be sure they have a safe place to land.\u201d\n\nStill, experts caution it\u2019s too early to evaluate the programs. So now the big question is, will providers flock to the programs like the administration hopes? Or, will it be difficult to reach the 50 percent target by 2018?\n\n\u201cProviders will embrace these payment approaches more readily if they believe the approaches are fair,\u201d Kaiser\u2019s Boccuti said, adding that industry leaders are at the table with the administration discussing how best to meet the goal. \u201cIf the providers share at least a small part of the risks and the benefits of proving better care with lower spending, then targets can be met.\u201d\n\nThe administration\u2019s plan to shift away from single payer is meant to go beyond Medicare. During Monday\u2019s announcement, HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said the goals are meant to drive transformative change. As Peter Orszag notes in Bloomberg View, \u201cMedicare, the gorilla of health care, is the place to send that message; it's large enough to set norms throughout the sector.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration set a bold goal this week to change the way the government pa", "title": "How the New Medicare Proposal Could Affect You", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/02/How-New-Medicare-Proposal-Could-Affect-You", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_medicare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/02/How-New-Medicare-Proposal-Could-Affect-You", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_medicare_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Obama administration set a bold goal this week to change the way the government pa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb86b\"", "article_summary": "The Obama administration set a bold goal this week to change the way the government pays Medicare doctors.\nRelated: Historic Medicare Data Dump Blows Lid Off Doc Pay\u201cThere are no specific patient-care requirements that are different from regular fee-for-service Medicare.\nThey say the current model incentivizes health providers to administer more services than are sometimes necessary, which has contributed to the ballooning costs of health care.\nIt hopes that by 2018, more than half of all payments will be tied to the quality of care doctors provide.\nThe patient can seek care outside of that network, but it\u2019s unlikely Medicare will pay for that service."}
