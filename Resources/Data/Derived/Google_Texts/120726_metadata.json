An Obamacare \u201cvictim\u201d tells the panel how horrible Obama is because it makes her drink too much so she stabbed her boss and now she can\u2019t keep her doctor, thus proving what a lying liar Obama is.\n\nWatch here:\n\n\u201cNow that the deadline has passed, the White House is claiming that they\u2019ve met their goal. But look at our Fox News chart,\u201d they tell us.\n\nA graphic showing 7.1 million as smaller than 7 million appears.\n\nThe Fox math whizzes explain, \u201cAs you can see, Obama needed to get 7 million new subscribers and he only got 7.1 million. Not anywhere close.\u201d\n\nTo poison the well for any of their viewers who are bothering to do their own math, a breathlessly hurt \u201cvictim\u201d of Obamacare tells Fox and Friends a \u201cpersonal story\u201d about Obamacare. (The old anecdote trumps facts trick.)\n\n\u201cIt was just a full blown disaster Steve, it\u2019s made me a complete mess,\u201d complained Anna Kendrick as the Fox Obamacare \u201cVictim\u201d. Trembling with outrage and primly pursed lips of disapproval, she then lists her issues: She\u2019s tired, she has mood swing, and she has problems with certain foods like alcohol, which causes her to black out when she drinks a lot.\n\nSomeone who blames Obama for all of their woes and refuses to take personal responsibility for themselves? Sounds exactly like Fox \u201cNews\u201d and just to confirm it, the whining continues.\n\nFrom this unrelated nothing, the lynch mob, led by Hasselbeck, decides that Obamacare also made the \u201cVictim\u201d lose her job. Indeed, the \u201cVictim\u201d tells us her sad story of having a few drinks and then finding her boss stabbed after being told she had to have insurance. Thanks, Obama.\n\nAnd the worst part is? Barack Obama (spit out with the appropriate level of contempt for someone who hates the person they are projecting their own faults onto) told her if she liked her doctor she could keep him, but because of a court order, she\u2019s not allowed within 500 yards of her doctor.\n\nThe lynch mob known as Fox and Friends has heard it before, of course, and they nicely don\u2019t call for a revolution just yet, but we can see that Obama is evil and a lying liar who lies because this woman can\u2019t see her same doctor.\n\nThe panel of ignorance dishing out propaganda on a string pause for disapproval \u2013 of Obamacare, of course, not the stabbing. But then they launch right into another shiny anecdotal exercise in blaming Obama for everything, as Hasslebeck complains that Obamacare glitches are to blame for her husband watching p*rn.\n\nHasslebeck claims the Obamacare website redirected her husband to \u201cthe most awful p*rn site.\u201d The other day she walked in on him signing up, and he was so appalled that the \u201cwebsite knocked off his pants!\u201d\n\nThe group decided this was par for the course because, \u201cThat\u2019s Obama\u2019s America!\u201d\n\nAnd they do have a point, because why watch p*rn when Fox gives it out for free and pretends it\u2019s news? It\u2019s the perfect solution for a bible belt that consumes more online p*rn than the rest of America while blaming liberal America for making it.\n\nGot any problems due to your own ignorance and willful refusal to take responsibility for your life? Fox wants to hear from you so they can add your story to their BLAME OBAMACARE files! And remember, 7.1 million is less than 7 million because the Fox chart says so.\n\nFox doles the Obama hate crack out for free, but the the rest of the reality based world pays for it.\n\nSNL can\u2019t even really do a parody of Fox, because the crazy exaggeration is so close to the reality of what Fox has become \u2014 a joke on itself that only fools those most dedicated to remaining misinformed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" did  \"Fox and Friends\" doing evil Obamacare, and in the process mocked and skewered the conservative network's favorite ACA lie.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Sarah Jones", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" did  \"Fox and Friends\" doing evil Obamacare, and in the process mocked and skewered the conservative network's favorite ACA lie.", "title": "Saturday Night Live Mocks and Shreds Fox News' Obamacare Lies", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/04/06/snl-fox-friends-obamacare-climate-change-denial.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Screen-Shot-2014-04-06-at-11.20.13-AM-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-04-06T14:02:57+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Anna Kendrick,SNL,obamacare,obamacare victim,obamacare lies,saturday night live,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "published_time": "2014-04-06T13:24:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-06T14:02:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ae8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was just a full blown disaster Steve, it\u2019s made me a complete mess,\u201d complained Anna Kendrick as the Fox Obamacare \u201cVictim\u201d.\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d did \u201cFox and Friends\u201d doing evil Obamacare, and in the process mocked and shredded the conservative network\u2019s favorite ACA lie.\nNot anywhere close.\u201dTo poison the well for any of their viewers who are bothering to do their own math, a breathlessly hurt \u201cvictim\u201d of Obamacare tells Fox and Friends a \u201cpersonal story\u201d about Obamacare.\nIndeed, the \u201cVictim\u201d tells us her sad story of having a few drinks and then finding her boss stabbed after being told she had to have insurance.\nThe panel of ignorance dishing out propaganda on a string pause for disapproval \u2013 of Obamacare, of course, not the stabbing."}
