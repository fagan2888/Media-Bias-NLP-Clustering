This sample is much older than any previously found human excrement, including possible 14,000-year-old poop from Oregon and 6,000- to 7,000-year-old poop from Turkey.\n\nBesides being the oldest known coprolite (fossilized dung), this Neanderthal poop holds a different scientific significance: possible proof that Neanderthals ate plants. A study on the findings was published Monday in the journal PLOS One.\n\nPreviously data and zooarcheological studies concluded that Neanderthals were mainly carnivorous. This new evidence suggests otherwise. According to the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\u201cUsing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, researchers studied the powdered samples for traces of stanols and sterols, lipids that are formed in the intestines when gut bacteria act on plant and animal matter. \u201cThe authors said that samples taken from five different areas suggested that Neanderthals predominantly consumed meat, but also had significant plant intake.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeanderthals are primates after all,\u201d lead author Aniara Sistiaga told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cOur findings are solid evidence of a dietary component \u2014 plants \u2014 that so far has been missing in the fossil record.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists may have found the world's oldest human excrement in Spain", "author": "Sarah Gray", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scientists may have found the world's oldest human excrement in Spain", "title": "Newly discovered 50,000-year-old poop proves the Neanderthals ate better than you do", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/26/newly_discovered_50000_year_old_poop_proves_the_neanderthals_ate_better_than_you_do/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_102037327-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists may have found the world's oldest human excrement in Spain", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_102037327-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Newly discovered 50,000-year-old poop proves the Neanderthals ate better than you do", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Newly discovered 50,000-year-old poop proves the Neanderthals ate better than you do", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, digestion, humans, Neanderthals, Nutrition, poop, sciecne, vegetables, world's oldest human poop", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc138\"", "article_summary": "Topics: digestion, humans, Neanderthals, Nutrition, poop, sciecne, vegetables, world's oldest human poop, Innovation News, Life News, NewsScientists discovered 50,000-year-old human poop while excavating the ancient Neanderthal site El Salt, located in Spain near the port of Alicante on the Mediterranean.\n\u201cThe poop samples come from rock layers dated to roughly 50,000 years ago,\u201d reported USA Today.\nBesides being the oldest known coprolite (fossilized dung), this Neanderthal poop holds a different scientific significance: possible proof that Neanderthals ate plants.\nThis sample is much older than any previously found human excrement, including possible 14,000-year-old poop from Oregon and 6,000- to 7,000-year-old poop from Turkey.\n\u201cOur findings are solid evidence of a dietary component \u2014 plants \u2014 that so far has been missing in the fossil record.\u201d"}
