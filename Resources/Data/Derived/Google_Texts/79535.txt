The Maize Police Department said a woman missing for neatly a year has been found safe.

Kathryn Lynn Partida, 35, has been in contact with her family and is safe, the department said. Police did not elaborate on where she was found.

"We appreciate the media and citizen support in locating Partida," Maize police said in a news release.

Partida left her children with their grandmother in May of 2015. Since then, she'd had unconfirmed contact with police in Oklahoma in August 2015, and a person using her identity was treated at an Oklahoma hospital a month later.

The Maize Police Department is asking for the public's help finding a woman who's been missing for nearly a year.

Police said on Facebook that 35-year-old Kathryn Lynn Partida left her children with their grandmother in May of 2015. Since then, she's had unconfirmed contact with police in Oklahoma in August 2015, and a person using her identity was treated at an Oklahoma hospital a month later.

"There has been no contact with Partida since that time and her whereabouts is unknown to her family which is highly unusual," Maize police said.

Partida stands 5-foot-3 and weighs about 130 pounds. She has brown hair, brown eyes and has tattoos of flowers on her hip and four doves on her back shoulder area.
