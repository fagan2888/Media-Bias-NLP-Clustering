With hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, courts may have to sort out the winners and losers.\n\nIt\u2019s been 13 years since the Florida Legislature put a hold on building new nursing home beds because of rising costs in the state budget.\n\nThat moratorium expired this year, and 163 companies are competing to build more 3,100 new nursing home beds in Florida.\n\nCompetition will be fierce: The new beds mean the possibility of more than $285 million in revenue statewide.\n\nFlorida Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Elizabeth Dudek said it\u2019s the most applications the state has seen in one cycle since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cI am guessing that with this kind of volume there will be some potential litigation involved, which would tie things up for a little bit,\u201d Dudek said.\n\nThe state will make its decision in February, and it would likely take two to three years to build the new nursing homes.\n\nBrian Lee, executive director of nursing home watchdog group Families for Better Care, said more competition is better for consumers.\n\n\u201cMore nursing homes in the marketplace with more specialized modernized services will force the rest the nursing homes to do a better job,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAgain, there\u2019s no more living off their laurels in quality of care.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 72,000 residents use nursing homes in Florida every year. One year in a private nursing home room in Orlando costs about $90,000, and government sources of revenue typically make up 80 percent of the money coming into a nursing home.\n\nUnion County in North Florida could get its first nursing home through this process.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter for WMFE in Orlando.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "There\u2019s a shortage of nursing home beds in Florida, and companies are flooding the state with applications to build.
