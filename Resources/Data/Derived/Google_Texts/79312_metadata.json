Upon his death, it was revealed the man who hadn\u2019t visited a doctor in decades and who only had one light in his home recently became a millionaire.\n\nThe newspaper reported that Konnight had $3 million in the bank after a sale in November of his family\u2019s 31.5 acres in Ramapo, New York, to JIEM Properties.\n\n\u201cHe lived a very simple life, hermit-like,\u201d Ramapo Detective Lt. Mark Emma told the Journal News of the man found dead last week. \u201cHe had his attorney and another man looking in on him now and again. He was alone.\u201d\n\nThomas O\u2019Connell, a lawyer who worked with the family for more than a decade, told the Journal News Konnight and his sisters lived in their childhood home, not holding jobs but selling pieces of their family\u2019s 200 acres of land in the area for money. It\u2019s something O\u2019Connell said the Konnight\u2019s parents did as well.\n\nHe added that the recent sale of property was to help pay off $130,000 of property taxes. Konnight\u2019s two sisters died within the last couple years.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to stay where they were because they enjoyed their bucolic lifestyle, being isolated and surrounded by trees with deer running through the yard,\u201d O\u2019Connell told the Journal News. \u201cTheir only overhead was taxes. They didn\u2019t have a lawyer helping them out. They didn\u2019t want to get involved with the government. They just couldn\u2019t keep up with the taxes.\u201d\n\nSome locals have memories of the reclusive family. Beverly Moore, a 75-year-old woman who claims to be a distance cousin of the Konnights, told the newspaper that she hadn\u2019t seen them since a funeral in 1973.\n\n\u201cThey ran a farm,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThey kept to themselves. They didn\u2019t ask anyone for anything, as far as I know.\u201d\n\nEugene Erickson, 82, who has been a neighbor to the Konnights since the 1950s, said when she would say \u201chello\u201d she \u201cmaybe got a wave\u201d in response.\n\nAll in all, O\u2019Connell said Konnight had \u201ceverything to live for.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, he was able to get insurance so I had just gotten him an insurance card,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cHe had just gotten a clean bill of health. I brought him to the doctor in May for the first time since he was 12 years old and had his tonsils taken out.\u201d\n\nAn autopsy is being conducted on Konnight\u2019s remains, but the medical examiner\u2019s office told the newspaper the man\u2019s death is not thought to be suspicious.\n\n(H/T: WFAA-TV)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 7, "twitter": {"description": "George Konnight was living \"off the grid\" alone in a home in Rockland County, New York, with no indoor plumbing or heat, but it turns out the 79-year-old hermit, who was recently found dead, could have afforded so much more.
