And because much of what ails America today would be mitigated if the Republican Party were less fanatic in its hatred of taxes, the reformicons have gotten some liberal commentators very, very excited.\n\nOnly time will tell if the reformicons have the policy substance to back-up the media\u2019s hype. Sadly, the recent release of a new tax plan from Sens. Marco Rubio and Mike Lee, who are both seen as at least reformicon-friendly, is not a good sign. In keeping with their stated desire to support middle-class earners with children, the two senators claimed in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal earlier this month, that their reforms would \u201cend the unfair treatment of our ultimate investor class: America\u2019s moms and dads.\u201d But when Eric Harris Bernstein of the liberal Roosevelt Institute took a close look at the plan\u2019s specifics, he found that while it did much to increase the income of the wealthy and corporations, the Lee-Rubio framework was much less concerned with giving workers more than lip service.\n\nRecently, Salon communicated with Bernstein via email to talk about the Lee-Rubio tax plan, and whether it helped show that the reformicon movement was more than an attempt to rebrand conservatism for America\u2019s inequality-anxious elites. Our correspondence is below and has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nWhat were you keeping your eye out for when you read the plan for the first time in terms of judging the sincerity of the \u201creform\u201d claims? And what did you find?\n\n\n\nWell, first it is important to note that, although Rubio has consulted reformocons and credited their ideas, neither he nor this plan befit that label; his ideas \u2013 as exemplified by this plan \u2013 are still very much Reagan-era. The rhetoric might be different, but these are essentially the same policies conservatives have been selling for the past 30 years. They may have replaced \u201ctrickle-down\u201d with more populist phrasing, but the policies are the same.\n\nIn one way they do depart significantly from classic conservative doctrine: By cutting all capital gains taxes, Republicans would add trillions to the national debt. In the sense that conservatives profess to abhor debt, this represents an enormous break from Republican policies.\n\nIs there anything in the plan that\u2019s new that you\u2019d consider a step in the right direction?\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s be clear \u2014 there is very little in this plan that helps anyone other than the wealthiest Americans. Five years ago, in the midst of post-crisis upheaval, few would have dared propose such an enormous tax break for the wealthy. Now Rubio and Lee think they have found an opening to twist the inequality debate into an opportunity to push extreme, regressive tax proposals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio says his tax plan has new ideas for the GOP.
