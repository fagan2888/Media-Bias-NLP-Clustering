For the 17th year, 98.7 The River’s “Christmas Wish” aims to brighten the holidays for families coping with the cancer of a child or parent.

On-air personality Mark Robertson reads letters written by nurses at Children’s Hospital at Memorial University Medical Center about families who cannot experience the joy of the holiday because of the financial expenses of cancer. The letters tell what these families would like for Christmas but cannot afford, usually ranging from clothing, toys and video games to gas cards to get them to and from treatments.

“It’s the one time of year where it’s almost certain that I’ll cry every day,” Robertson said, referring to having to read the emotional letters on air.

“Christmas Wish” has generated more than $250,000 to help featured families.

He will read one letter each weekday starting Monday and ending Dec. 11. He encourages listeners to donate whatever they can afford. An account is set up for each family. The families don’t get cash, but gift cards to get the things they say they want and need most.

Robertson said donations over the past 16 years have come from throughout the Savannah area, including Bryan County.

“Sometimes donors wish to be anonymous, and often area businesses collect money in lieu of Christmas parties or buying a gift for the boss. That’s when the tears begin,” he said, “and they don’t stop until I surprise these families with gifts, thanks to the generosity of our listeners.”
