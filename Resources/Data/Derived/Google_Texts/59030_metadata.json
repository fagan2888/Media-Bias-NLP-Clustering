Really good. As of this week, in fact, $700 billion worth of good. Apple's closing price of $122.02 per share on Tuesday made it the first American company ever to cross that market-cap threshold.\n\nApple is also now selling bonds in Switzerland, which is probably a smart way for the company to buffer its ginormous pile of cash. (As The Wall Street Journal points out, this means Apple can use proceeds from debt sales to reinvest in itself without getting taxed the way it would if it used money brought back from overseas.)\n\nPlus, global interest rates are so low that selling bonds is a pretty cheap way to raise money. And boy does Apple have a lot of money\u2014a staggering $178 billion in cash on hand. (That's more than double Bill Gates's net worth, and he's the richest man in the world.)\n\nApple has the financial influence of a not-even-that-small country at this point. The company's $178 billion\u2014$178 billion!\u2014puts it on par with the gross domestic product of a country like New Zealand, surpassing the GDPs of Vietnam, Morocco, and Ecuador, according to the most recent World Bank data.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The tech giant is worth $700 billion and is issuing bonds in Switzerland.", "author": "Adrienne LaFrance", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The tech giant is worth $700 billion and is issuing bonds in Switzerland.", "title": "Apple Is Basically a Small Country Now", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/02/applestoreflagedit/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/apple-is-basically-a-small-country-now/385385/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/adriennelafrance"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2b6\"", "article_summary": "Apple is also now selling bonds in Switzerland, which is probably a smart way for the company to buffer its ginormous pile of cash.\nApple has the financial influence of a not-even-that-small country at this point.\nPlus, global interest rates are so low that selling bonds is a pretty cheap way to raise money.\nAnd boy does Apple have a lot of money\u2014a staggering $178 billion in cash on hand.\nIt's good to be Apple."}
