Beloved costume /game/general geek castle The Wizard’s Chest has told customers on Facebook and in an email newsletter that it will open a new location in September at 451 Broadway , next to Meininger Art Materials.

There will be castle turrets at the new location.

“Oh, most definitely,” said manager and co-owner Brad Brickley. “That was our first point, before we even thought of anything else.”

The turrets and other whimsical features can be seen in a rendering attached to the Facebook announcement.

“We’ll open the new place in September, primarily focusing on Halloween,” Brickley said. “But then once October is over, in November, we’ll move more and more of our products over.”

The current location at 230 Fillmore in Cherry Creek will close in January 2016.

The Cherry Creek location, immediately recognizable by its fantastical castle features against the sleek, upscale backdrop of Cherry Creek North, opened in 1982.

The new location moves The Wizard’s Chest from a building with an overall square footage of about 8,500 to a building with about 18,000 square feet, some 12,000 of which will be retail space, Brickley said.

The new building is owned by the store’s current landlords — and original owners — Arca Properties.

Brickley said that space was the motivating factor, not rent, but that the rent per square foot is sufficiently different that the rent at the Cherry Creek North location and the new Broadway location will be similar.

“There’ll be more space for everything we do now. We’re not getting rid of anything,” Brickley said. “We’ve got a fair amount more event space (at the new location) than what we do here, so we’ll definitely be able to more conveniently run some board game and card game tournaments.”
