Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week on Wednesday, the team announced.

On Sunday, Manning completed 22-of-26 passes for 318 yards and four touchdowns in a 42-17 victory against the 49ers. His third TD pass gave him 509 for his career, breaking Brett Favre’s all-time record.

It’s the 27th time Manning has received the honor — most in NFL history, ahead of Tom Brady (24) — and sixth since he’s been with Denver. He’s the third Broncos player to win the award this year, joining TE Julius Thomas (Week 1) and WR Demaryius Thomas (Week 5).

On the season, Manning has thrown for 1,848 yards, 19 touchdowns and three interceptions.
