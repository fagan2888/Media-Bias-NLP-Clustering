4 stocks to buy heading into the new year

As the trading year wraps up, "Fast Money" traders chose the stocks they feel are primed for success in 2016.

Some would buy into companies that suffered this year. Wal-Mart — the Dow's biggest loser in 2015 — looks primed for a recovery, said trader Tim Seymour.

Wal-Mart shares have fallen about 30 percent this year. But the company showed signs of improving its comparable metrics and margins in the third quarter and sits at an appealing price, Seymour contended.
