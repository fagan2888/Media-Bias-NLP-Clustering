More than 90 percent of the injuries are damaged bones including arms, femurs, the lower leg tibia and collarbones, she said. Then, there are many dislocated shoulders.\n\nBiker George Meyers, 38, from Brentwood, took his two children Ivy, 9, and Austin, 7, to Hollister Hills to ride their motorcycles Friday but he also taught them how to stay safe.\n\n\u201cEvery time these guys ride, they wear\u2013obviously\u2014boots, knee guards, chest protector and goggles,\u201d he said.\n\nAt this recreation area, Meyers likes that many of the paths are one way and the corners are covered with hay bales instead of just wood and wire. The one-directional trails reduce the risk of a head-on collision while the hay can cushion a hard fall.\n\nFor Los Gatos biker Blaine Sollazzi, 40, safety isn\u2019t just about protective riding gear. Sollazzi also brings his cell phone.\n\nIs the sport risky?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not ping pong,\u201d he said, adding that there\u2019s a chance he could have died while driving his truck to the recreation area.\n\nSollazzi knew Doug Williams, the 23-year-old Gilroy man who reportedly hit a tree just days before this visit to Hollister Hills. The bikers met when Williams lent Sollazzi a tool.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve ridden with him before,\u201d Sollazzi said. \u201cHe was a great kid. He was very nice.\u201d\n\nSollazzi has been coming to this recreation area since he was eight years old and acknowledged it\u2019s best to go in a group. Sometimes that isn\u2019t possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safer to ride with someone but you can\u2019t always do that and you can\u2019t stay home,\u201d he said.\n\nBikers Austin Ceja and Nick Feliciano from Monterey, who were also sitting on picnic benches overlooking Hollister Hills trails Friday afternoon, felt more strongly about the importance of never riding alone, especially as they considered Williams\u2019 disappearance earlier in the week.\n\n\u201cDo not go alone,\u201d said Feliciano, 21.\n\n\u201cYeah, you can\u2019t ride alone out here,\u201d said Ceja, 28.\n\n\u201cIf someone had been with him, he\u2019d be found,\u201d Feliciano added.\n\nThose who insist on riding alone should stick to the main trails and ride on the weekends instead of late in the evening on a workday, the bikers said. When more people are at the site, there\u2019s a better chance someone will see a biker if they fall, the friends said.\n\nTraumatic head injuries are not treated locally, said Jones, the E.R. director. The most severe cases go to Hazel Hawkins only if the patient needs resuscitation, she said. Otherwise, patients with serious head injuries are flown to trauma centers, including the Natividad Medical Center in Monterey and the Regional Medical Center of San Jose.\n\nThe emergency department director doesn\u2019t remember a Hollister Hills-related fatality. She does know that patients of all kinds who arrive at the emergency room don\u2019t always have insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for people to not have insurance,\u201d said the director. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunate because a lot of these people are out of county.\u201d\n\nIn the last six months, the emergency room has seen a 15 percent to 20 percent increase in patients because the Obamacare reimbursement to doctors has not been \u201cadequate to cover expenses\u201d and primary physicians are opting out of accepting people with these plans, Jones said. As Obamacare users are turned away by primary physicians, they\u2019re heading to the emergency room for care, she said.\n\nLongtime friends Ceja and Feliciano don\u2019t keep extra insurance because they ride bikes. Ceja doesn\u2019t keep insurance at all.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you ride without insurance because Obamacare doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Ceja admits it\u2019s not \u201csmart,\u201d since a certain amount of tumbles are inevitable with the sport. Ceja keeps coming back to biking for the \u201cstress release,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re free,\u201d said the biker. \u201cYou\u2019re away from everything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "hollister hills,doug williams,motocross,economy,health_care,featured", "og": {"site_name": "Free Lance News", "description": "Though a Gilroy biker died in the Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreation Area last week after hitting a tree, the tragedy didn\u2019t stop more than a dozen adrenaline junkies of all ages from hitting the trails last Friday.", "title": "Risks give the ride its spark at Hollister Hills", "url": "http://www.sanbenitocountytoday.com/news/economy/risks-give-the-ride-its-spark-at-hollister-hills/article_ad6b675c-d3dc-11e4-8926-f72d93686f2a.html", "image": {"width": 896, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/sanbenitocountytoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/1b/31ba2fa2-d3dd-11e4-8033-dffce5e87cdb/551441325846f.image.jpg?resize=896%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 170440809698642}, "keywords": "hollister hills,doug williams,motocross,economy,health_care,featured", "description": "Though a Gilroy biker died in the Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreation Area last week after hitting a tree, the tragedy didn\u2019t stop more than a dozen adrenaline junkies of all ages from hitting the trails last Friday."}, "article_summary": "While deaths are \u201crare,\u201d said Hollister Hills Recreation Area Superintendent Matthew Allen, injuries are part of the sport.\nSollazzi knew Doug Williams, the 23-year-old Gilroy man who reportedly hit a tree just days before this visit to Hollister Hills.\nBiker George Meyers, 38, from Brentwood, took his two children Ivy, 9, and Austin, 7, to Hollister Hills to ride their motorcycles Friday but he also taught them how to stay safe.\n\u201cWe probably see a couple (Hollister Hills bikers) every weekend on average throughout the year,\u201d said Rebecca Jones, the director of the emergency department for Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re like me, you ride without insurance because Obamacare doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said."}
