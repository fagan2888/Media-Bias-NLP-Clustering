Sarah Palin, who had been selected to be Republican presidential nominee John McCain\u2019s running mate.\n\n\u201cI was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women \u2026 so I said no,\u201d the 2016 hopeful wrote.\n\nAfter the excerpt was released, Palin took to her Twitter account to slam President Obama for firing \u201cthe 1st shot in the real \u2018war on women.'\u201d\n\nLook who fired the 1st shot in the real \"war on women\".

Do you know anything about her?'\u201d Clinton told Roberts.\n\nThe Obama White House has fielded accusations of sexism in the past.
