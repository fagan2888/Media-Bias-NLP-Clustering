Under the amendment a community could ban just about any industrial activity it found objectionable.\n\nSignatures are being collected by another campaign committee, Coloradans for Safe and Clean Energy, on two ballot measures.\n\nInitiative 88 would mandate a 2,000-foot setback from homes for drilling rigs. Initiative 89 would place an environmental bill of rights in the state constitution.\n\n\u201cWe started out with 19 radical measures to ban oil and gas drilling in Colorado. One by one, they have fallen by the wayside,\u201d Dan Hopkins, a spokesman for Coloradans for Responsible Reform, which is opposing the ballot measure, said in a statement. \u201cWe won\u2019t be surprised if 88 and 89 also fall short of the number of required signatures to get on the ballot.\u201d\n\nMara Sheldon, a spokeswoman for Coloradans for Safe and Clean Energy, said the committee is \u201cwell on the way\u201d to getting the required signatures.\n\n\u201cColoradans are clearly ready for a balance between common sense protections for our families and responsible energy development going forward,\u201d Sheldon said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Community rights ballot measure pulled due to lack of signatures", "title": "Community rights ballot measure pulled due to lack of signatures", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/14/community-rights-ballot-measure-pulled-due-to-lack-of-signatures/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-14T12:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-14T12:01:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2f4\"", "article_summary": "A ballot initiative that would have given communities sweeping powers over oil drilling and other industrial activity was pulled Monday for a lack of supporting signatures, sponsors said.\nInitiative 75 would have added the so-called Community Rights Amendment to the state constitution, but to get it on the ballot required 86,105 valid signatures \u2014 a rule of thumb is that 125,000 signatures need to be gathered to meet the requirement.\nSignatures are being collected by another campaign committee, Coloradans for Safe and Clean Energy, on two ballot measures.\n\u201cColoradans are clearly ready for a balance between common sense protections for our families and responsible energy development going forward,\u201d Sheldon said.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be surprised if 88 and 89 also fall short of the number of required signatures to get on the ballot.\u201dMara Sheldon, a spokeswoman for Coloradans for Safe and Clean Energy, said the committee is \u201cwell on the way\u201d to getting the required signatures."}
