But it\u2019s also not the Holy Grail.\n\nSo the key word there is ideally.\n\nSakic and Roy will go into this looking to upgrade the defense, period, ending up with two trusted pairings, which so far project to have Johnson in the top tandem and Barrie in the second. Under Roy, Colorado alternately has gotten away with (2013-14) and struggled (2014-15) on defense when asking declining veterans or American Hockey League journeymen to do too much.\n\nChicago won the Stanley Cup with former Avs scooter-type, off-the-scrap-heap Kyle Cumiskey in the third pairing, and Joel Quenneville and assistant Mike Kitchen made marathon men of Keith, Hjalmarsson, Brent Seabrook and Johnny Oduya.\n\nI\u2019m certain the Avalanche realizes it would be a mistake to excessively prioritize the quest for a left shot. If Sakic and Roy are convinced Washington\u2019s Mike Green, for example, isn\u2019t physically suspect after missing an average of 20 games in the past seven seasons, they shouldn\u2019t dismiss him because he\u2019s a right shot.\n\nA trade of Ryan O\u2019Reilly also could land a defenseman. It\u2019s universally recognized that he\u2019s a terrific two-way player. The question continues to be whether that is sufficiently coveted \u2014 especially given his salary benchmarks and his camp\u2019s past negotiating militancy in a hard-cap league \u2014 for him to be the major element in a deal that brings a difference-making defenseman to Colorado.\n\nSakic\u2019s comments about O\u2019Reilly on Thursday were virtual word-for-word repeats of what he has been saying for months. There will be no Paul Stastny replay here, and I say that uncritically, because as that drama played out, I thought the Avalanche\u2019s calculated risk in accepting the possibility of Stastny getting to unrestricted free-agent status in July 2014 was justifiable.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t going to happen again.\n\nIf O\u2019Reilly isn\u2019t signed to an extension, he\u2019s gone.\n\nThat\u2019s no revelation. Sakic has made that clear for months.\n\nAlso in July 2014, Colorado and the O\u2019Reilly camp managed to put aside the contentiousness long enough to come to an agreement on a two-year, $12 million deal minutes before an arbitration hearing.\n\nThey could pull that off again, but O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sincerity likely will be tested. He repeatedly has said his preference is to stay with the Avalanche. It\u2019s tricky for a lot of reasons, among them that the annual salary cap hit is $6 million and his 2015-16 salary is $6.25 million.\n\nI get that players deliver a mandate to agents to get as much as possible, and most agents love the art of the deal as macho-testing gamesmanship. But it\u2019s a cop-out for players to shrug and essentially say: Hey, I pay my agent to take care of that stuff.\n\nAt some point, including after months of conventional and even contentious maneuvering to maximize the offer on the table, the player \u2014 any player \u2014 can step in and say it\u2019s time to shake hands then reach for the pens.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tTFrei\n\nUpdated June. 22 at 12:48 p.m. The following corrected information has been added to this article: Because of an error by a reporter, the names of the third marathon man was initially incorrect.
