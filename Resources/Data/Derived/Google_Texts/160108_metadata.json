CO-OPs\u2014Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans\u2014have attracted a sizable share of customers in Maine and New York, it said. In Oregon, Moda Health Plan Inc., based in Portland, captured the largest market share.\n\nAccording to proposed and final rates in the 15 marketplaces analyzed, nine of the issuers that captured the most enrollment requested rate increases of 9 percent or more for the 2015 plan year, the analysis said. Rates are final in Florida, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington.\n\n\u201cBecause proposed 2015 rates were filed when exchange plans had little experience with their new members, rates may reflect that early enrollees may have been older or had higher health needs,\u201d Avalere Vice President Caroline Pearson said in the analysis. \u201cIt's important to pay attention to the premium increases among the highest-enrollment plans in 2014 because current enrollees who renew their coverage will be directly impacted,\u201d she said.\n\nConsider Shopping for Lower Premiums\n\n\u201cConsumers should look at their plan premiums carefully and consider whether they should shop for a lower premium option in 2015 rather than re-enroll, especially if they qualify for federal premium subsidies,\u201d Pearson said.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released a final rule Sept. 2 under which 2014 enrollees who don't take action to change plans will be automatically renewed for 2015.\n\nResearchers have warned that many consumers who are automatically re-enrolled in plans for 2015 may receive lower subsidies than they would if they went through a redetermination process.\n\nThe premium increases proposed by the dominant exchange carriers are consistent with historical growth, the analysis said. It cited a report by Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics professor, released June 5 by the Commonwealth Fund, finding that premiums in the individual market grew by 10 percent or more per year prior to the launch of the ACA marketplaces.\n\nPremiums analyzed were for 40-year-old nonsmokers based on rate filings available as of Sept. 5. Rate filings are proposed in many states and may change, the analysis said.\n\nMcKinsey Report on Marketplace Filings\n\nConsultant McKinsey & Co. also released a report Sept. 10 on 2015 marketplace filings that found the lowest-priced plans have proposed rates varying from a 27 percent increase to a 28 percent decrease, compared with the equivalent product in 2014. The report is based on individual marketplace filings through June 23.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of marketplace enrollees who are eligible for subsidies will see net premium increases in the lowest-price silver tier plan, which covers an average of 70 percent of medical claims, McKinsey said. Twenty-two percent will see premium decreases in the lowest-price silver plan, it said.\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services, 85 percent of the approximately 8 million marketplace enrollees for 2014 received financial assistance to buy the plans, and more than 63 percent chose either the lowest or second-lowest premium plans.\n\nThere are 1.8 times more plans being offered in 2015 than in 2014, McKinsey said. Sixty-eight out of 69 health plans that filed for 2014 filed again for 2015 with only one incumbent exiting, and 18 new entrants plan to participate, it said.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Sara Hansard in Washington at shansard@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janey Cohen at jcohen@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/analysis-finds-wellpoint-n17179894980/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "Sept. 11 - In 12 of 15 Affordable Care Act marketplaces where complete data on market share are available, WellPoint or independent Blue Cross Blue Shield plans captured the greatest percentage...", "title": "Analysis Finds WellPoint, Blues Plans Captured Largest Market Shares in 2014"}, "csrf-token": "amdVh8UAgGQEyTli3A2DrQlTtgwS27qlf8R0UXNFHvrACKdEsDAuX_as0_YCuyarApZFVUbCOp0UZ0yRm1kbiE5WFNJfGOAAw5jQEG3YB6A1:mf_qFf85r2jK_3A5Ctw1r5-wNnjwx-UNywEWgC7AjxZZRiPwhgBXrcTizjiWJnjfWrRr4ZrFgggWeehsBtAt8zMPd2ue0WJruccGk5v21gM1", "description": "Sept", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "In Oregon, Moda Health Plan Inc., based in Portland, captured the largest market share.\nSixty-eight out of 69 health plans that filed for 2014 filed again for 2015 with only one incumbent exiting, and 18 new entrants plan to participate, it said.\nThe premium increases proposed by the dominant exchange carriers are consistent with historical growth, the analysis said.\nThere are 1.8 times more plans being offered in 2015 than in 2014, McKinsey said.\nCO-OPs\u2014Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans\u2014have attracted a sizable share of customers in Maine and New York, it said."}
