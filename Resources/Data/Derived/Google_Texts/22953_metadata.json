Hanen that more botched cases could still be found as employees dig through tens of thousands of applications.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s lawyers are desperately trying to head off punishment by Judge Hanen after several embarrassing missteps.\n\nFirst, the lawyers misled the court as to more than 100,000 three-year amnesty applications that were approved between Nov. 20 and Feb. 16, when Judge Hanen issued his injunction. The lawyers said they didn\u2019t intend to mislead, and they assumed the judge knew those applications were being approved.\n\nThen the Homeland Security Department announced it had approved the 2,000 or so three-year applications even after the injunction \u2014 a clear violation of the judge\u2019s order, and raising questions about the lawyers\u2019 excuses for the first 100,000 botched applications.\n\n\u201cAs the director of USCIS, I accept full responsibility,\u201d agency chief Leon Rodriguez said in an affidavit filed with Judge Hanen. \u201cIn retrospect, I believe that USCIS should have exercised greater management oversight of the efforts to halt the production and issuance of three-year notices and [Employment Authorization Documents] once the court issued its injunction.\u201d\n\nJudge Hanen has halted Mr. Obama\u2019s expanded deportation amnesty, announced in November, that would grant tentative legal status and work permits, or Employment Authorization Documents, to as many as 5 million illegal immigrants. The amnesty expands an earlier 2012 program Mr. Obama announced that covers so-called Dreamers, or young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.\n\nUnder the original amnesty, known officially as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, Dreamers could get two-year status and work permits. As part of his expansion last year Mr. Obama raised that to three years, and USCIS immediately began approving those three-year applications for the Dreamers eligible for the 2012 policy.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s landed the agency in trouble.\n\nAdministration officials said the more than 100,000 applications approved between November and Feb. 16 were a misunderstanding, while the 2,000 cases approved since the Feb. 16 injunction were a problem with the agency\u2019s process.\n\nDonald Neufeld, the agency employee who is overseeing the deportation amnesty, said when the inunction came down, they stopped all amnesty applications. A few days later they began processing two-year approvals again, but didn\u2019t catch thousands of three-year cases that were in the pipeline.\n\n\u201cThe February 20 instruction to resume production of EADs led to the issuance of three-year EADs for the previously held EAD-pending cases, although the intention had been for only the two-year EADs to proceed to production,\u201d Mr. Neufeld said in an affidavit. \u201cIT personnel had implemented a system-wide pause on the production of all DACA-related EAD requests in the queue. They had not removed production requests for three-year EADs from the queue.\u201d\n\nJudge Hanen was already weighing what punishment to issue to the administration for the initial 100,000 cases. The judge has yet to comment publicly on the 2,000 additional cases.\n\nTechnology has bedeviled the Obama administration on other big items on the president\u2019s agenda. In 2013, the federal Obamacare website, HealthCare.gov, went live despite not having been fully vetted, and the site repeatedly crashed, forcing the government to scramble and rewrite legal deadlines to try to get people to sign up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration blamed a technology glitch for why it continued to approve new amnesty applications in February, even after a federal judge issued an injunction, telling the court late Friday that they are now begging about 2,000 illegal immigrants to tear up their three-year work authorizations.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration blamed a technology glitch for why it continued to approve new amnesty applications in February, even after a federal judge issued an injunction, telling the court late Friday that they are now begging about 2,000 illegal immigrants to tear up their three-year work authorizations.", "title": "DHS blames tech glitch for violating judge\u2019s amnesty injunction", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/16/dhs-blames-tech-glitch-violating-judges-amnesty-in/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/b13d46ed8b29e0086e0f6a70670063df.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/22/b13d46ed8b29e0086e0f6a70670063df.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration blamed a technology glitch for why it continued to approve new amnesty applications in February, even after a federal judge issued an injunction, telling the court late Friday", "card": "summary", "title": "DHS blames tech glitch for violating judge\u2019s amnesty injunction"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Social Issues, Andrew S Hanen, Barack Obama, UN Court"}, "article_summary": "President Obama\u2019s lawyers are desperately trying to head off punishment by Judge Hanen after several embarrassing missteps.\nDonald Neufeld, the agency employee who is overseeing the deportation amnesty, said when the inunction came down, they stopped all amnesty applications.\nA few days later they began processing two-year approvals again, but didn\u2019t catch thousands of three-year cases that were in the pipeline.\nFirst, the lawyers misled the court as to more than 100,000 three-year amnesty applications that were approved between Nov. 20 and Feb. 16, when Judge Hanen issued his injunction.\nAdministration officials said the more than 100,000 applications approved between November and Feb. 16 were a misunderstanding, while the 2,000 cases approved since the Feb. 16 injunction were a problem with the agency\u2019s process."}
