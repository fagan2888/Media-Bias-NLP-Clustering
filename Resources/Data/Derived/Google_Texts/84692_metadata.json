It also argues that the U.S. should base more nuclear weapons around the world to better deter attacks.\n\n\u201cForward deploying a robust set of discriminate nuclear response options conveys the message that the United States will \u2018respond in kind\u2019 and proportionately to nuclear attacks on its allies,\u201d wrote Clark Murdock, a former Pentagon policy official who is now a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nRelated: Why Vietnam Will Be the Next Nuclear State\n\nCSIS\u2019 \u201cProject Atom\u201d report, provided to Defense One in advance of its June 22 release, was produced by Murdock and eight co-authors as a \u201czero-based, blue-sky\u201d look at American\u2019s nuclear arsenal. It challenges the Obama administration\u2019s policy of seeking to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in national strategy, and argues for new bombs, missiles, and delivery platforms to replace the ones that have been around since the Cold War.\n\nMurdock\u2019s report comes just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would deploy 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles. It also comes as the Obama administration faces a handful of decisions on nuclear modernization, including proposals to develop new weapons.\n\nThe report recommends the U.S. keep its \u201crough parity\u201d with Russia and \u201cnuclear superiority\u201d over China. It also suggests the U.S.\u201cmaintain sufficient capability to cope simultaneously with nuclear-armed \u2018regional rogues\u2019\u201d and \u201cmaintain a smaller stockpile, which is enabled by a responsive infrastructure.\u201d\n\nIn the report, Murdock argues that the superiority of the American military will lead certain countries to seek nuclear arms as an asymmetric counter.\n\nRelated: The Hot Air Behind Putin's Nuclear Threats\n\n\u201cThe value of nuclear weapons as a \u2018trump card\u2019 for negatingU.S. conventional power was enhanced by the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 to prevent Saddam Hussein from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\u201d the report says. \u201cIf the United States apparently believes that it can be deterred by an adversary\u2019s nuclear weapons, why wouldn\u2019t a nonnuclear \u2018regional rogue\u2019 want one?\u201d\n\nAuthors\u2019 Dissent\n\nBut not all of Murdock\u2019s co-authors agree.\n\nBarry Blechman and Russell Rumbaugh of the Stimson Center argue that the American military is so far superior to its global counterparts that \u201cnuclear weapons add few options\u201d to theU.S. palette. \u201cIndeed, given U.S. conventional military superiority, nuclear weapons serve no military role for the United States beyond deterring nuclear attacks on itself and its allies,\u201d they write in one of the report\u2019s appendices.\n\nBlechman and Rumbaugh formed one of three think-tank teams \u2014 the others came from the Center for a New American Security and the National Institute for Public Policy \u2014 that contributed to the report, along with experts from CSIS and elsewhere. Under a methodology dubbed the \u201ccompetitive strategies approach,\u201d each of the teams produced their own analyses, which were discussed by the report\u2019s authors and ultimately included as appendices. But the final report represents Murdock\u2019s conclusions alone.\n\nRelated: Russia Claims Right to Deploy Nuclear Weapons in Crimea\n\n\u201cAs the author of the final report, my views were shaped and influenced by the debate among the independent think tank teams, but did not attempt to bridge the differences on fundamentals between the competing approaches,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTime to Rebuild?\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the military seemed to lose focus on its nuclear mission. In 2007, the Air Force mistakenly flew nuclear weapons across the country on a B-52 bomber; the next year, it accidentally shipped ICBM fuses to Taiwan. There have also been cheating controversies throughout the Air Force and Navy nuclear ranks.\n\n\u201cThe various scandals of the past decade were a symptom of the post-Cold War failure to believe in the nuclear mission, think seriously about deterrence, and invest and act accordingly,\u201d said Thomas Karako, a senior fellow at CSIS and one of the Project Atom authors.\n\nAfter a cheating scandal erupted under his watch, former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel placed the nuclear forces under close watch. He began regular visits to ICBM, bomber, and submarine bases. And along with other senior Pentagon officials, he began talking about the importance of nuclear forces down the road.\n\nRelated: Nuclear Treaty With Russia Could Be Breaking Down\n\n\u201cThe next decade includes a swell of investments to recapitalize the triad and the weapons themselves,\u201d Karako said. \u201cWe\u2019re paying the piper now, with interest, for having taken a peace dividend of the 1990s and our nuclear allergy in the 2000s. But the real deficit has been in thinking seriously about nuclear deterrence.\u201d\n\nIn coming months, the Pentagon is expected to award a contract for a stealthy new Air Force bomber, a plane that officials say will eventually carry nuclear weapons. The Navy is also planning to buy new ballistic-missile submarines to replace its Ohio class. But these projects are expensive, and Pentagon officials have questioned their affordability.\n\nWe\u2019re paying the piper now, with interest, for having taken a peace dividend of the 1990s and our nuclear allergy in the 2000s. But the real deficit has been in thinking seriously about nuclear deterrence.\u201d\n\nTom Karako, Center For Strategic And International Studies\n\nMurdock argues the Pentagon needs a more diverse suite of nuclear weapons. \u201cIn order to execute its Measured Response strategy, the nuclear forces for both deterrence and extended deterrence should have low-yield, accurate, special-effects options that can respond proportionately at the lower end of the nuclear continuum,\u201d he writes.\n\nThis could also include a \u201csmaller, shorter-range cruise missile that could be delivered by F-35s\u201d including the ones that will someday operate from the Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers, Murdock said.\n\nKarako said, \u201cWithout completing the current slate of modernization programs, we can\u2019t even sustain our current deterrent capabilities from the 20th century \u2013 let alone go further, adapting and expanding our force to the challenges of the 21st. Project Atom represents a thinking competition of sorts, for what that may require.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United States should develop new low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons to det", "title": "This Terrifying Report Wants to Restart the US-Russia Nuclear Arms Race", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/22/Terrifying-Report-Wants-Restart-US-Russia-Nuclear-Arms-Race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-w1280.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/22/Terrifying-Report-Wants-Restart-US-Russia-Nuclear-Arms-Race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-w1280.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The United States should develop new low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons to det", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The Hot Air Behind Putin's Nuclear Threats\u201cThe value of nuclear weapons as a \u2018trump card\u2019 for negatingU.S.\nThe United States should develop new low-yield, tactical nuclear weapons to deter countries from seeking nuclear weapons of their own, a new think-tank report says.\nIt also argues that the U.S. should base more nuclear weapons around the world to better deter attacks.\n\u201cIndeed, given U.S. conventional military superiority, nuclear weapons serve no military role for the United States beyond deterring nuclear attacks on itself and its allies,\u201d they write in one of the report\u2019s appendices.\nIn 2007, the Air Force mistakenly flew nuclear weapons across the country on a B-52 bomber; the next year, it accidentally shipped ICBM fuses to Taiwan."}
