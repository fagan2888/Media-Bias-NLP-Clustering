He\u2019s got the money.\u201d\n\nBut Fox spoke about more than just Trump\u2019s wall plan. A transformational figure in Mexican politics, Fox entered politics after a career in business, which ended with him running all of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in Latin America. He was the first leader in the country\u2019s history to take over from a political rival without violence or other disruption, and his election in 2000 marked a rightward shift in the country\u2019s politics.\n\nFox was on friendly terms with U.S. president George W. Bush and continues to be a high profile figure in his home country and internationally.\n\nAsked by Ramos if he fears a Trump presidency, he first said: \u201cNot at all. Democracy cannot take crazy people that [don\u2019t] know what\u2019s going on in the world today.\u201d\n\nRelated: Sorry Donald, but Hispanic Voters just Aren\u2019t That Into You\n\nFox didn\u2019t bother to disguise his disdain for the brash billionaire currently leading the GOP race. \u201cWhat is Trump? He\u2019s not a Republican,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAbsolutely not. Those are not Republican principles. He is not a Democrat. He is just himself. He\u2019s egocentric.\u201d\n\nWhat did seem to surprise him was that 44 percent of the Hispanics in Nevada who voted in the GOP caucus cast their ballots for Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to know who those Hispanics are, because they are followers of a false prophet, and he\u2019s going to take them to the desert,\u201d Fox said. \u201cAnd if they think that they would benefit from an administration led by Don Trump, they\u2019re wrong. They must open their eyes. Please, Hispanics, Latin in the U.S., open your eyes. It\u2019s not to defend our race, it\u2019s not to defend our creed, it\u2019s to defend this very same nation that is hosting you. This nation is going to fail if it goes into the hands of a crazy guy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Mexican president Vicente Fox on Thursday pleaded with US Hispanics considering a vote for Donald Trump to \u201copen your eyes.\u201d The U.S. will fail as a country, he warned \u201cif it goes into the hands of a crazy guy.\u201d", "title": "Ex Mexican Prez: Trump Is a False Prophet Who Will Take Them to the Desert", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/26/Ex-Mexican-Prez-Trump-False-Prophet-Who-Will-Take-Them-Desert", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02262016_Vicente_Fox.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/26/Ex-Mexican-Prez-Trump-False-Prophet-Who-Will-Take-Them-Desert", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02262016_Vicente_Fox.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Former Mexican president Vicente Fox on Thursday pleaded with US Hispanics considering a vote for Donald Trump to \u201copen your eyes.\u201d The U.S. will fail as a country, he warned \u201cif it goes into the hands of a crazy guy.\u201d", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019d like to know who those Hispanics are, because they are followers of a false prophet, and he\u2019s going to take them to the desert,\u201d Fox said.\nThe attention-grabbing part of his interview with Fusion news host Jorge Ramos was his choice of obscenity when asked about Trump\u2019s wall.\nHe\u2019s got the money.\u201dBut Fox spoke about more than just Trump\u2019s wall plan.\nHe\u2019s not a Republican,\u201d Fox said.\nA transformational figure in Mexican politics, Fox entered politics after a career in business, which ended with him running all of Coca-Cola\u2019s operations in Latin America."}
