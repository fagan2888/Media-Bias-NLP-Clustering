GOLD COAST, Australia — Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin is being treated for a back problem, putting her in doubt for the Pan Pacific championships which start Thursday.

Team USA spokesman Scott Leightman says Franklin had back spasms during practice Tuesday. He told a news conference Wednesday that the 19-year-old Franklin was resting at the team hotel, with her condition expected to be re-evaluated later Wednesday or early Thursday.

Leightman says “it’s a fluid situation,” and didn’t elaborate when asked if she had experienced the injury previously.

Franklin, who won both the 100- and 200-meter backstroke at the 2012 London Olympics, claimed six golds at the world championships last year.

She is scheduled to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle, 100 and 200 backstroke and relays in Australia.
