Calling your rival a vulgar name on the eve of the New Hampshire primary because he doesn\u2019t support torture as much as you do? Child\u2019s play when compared to what could happen between now and the Republican presidential primary in South Carolina on Feb. 20.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that U.S. presidential elections have a long history of questionable, or downright dirty, campaign tactics that in hindsight seem like something straight out of fiction, but the Palmetto State stands apart when it comes to mudslinging.\n\nRelated: As Trump Comes Roaring Back, the GOP Reshuffles the Deck\n\nShortly after winning the New Hampshire primary in a rout, billionaire Donald Trump said he was ready for underhanded attacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had dirty tricks in this campaign, so I\u2019m ready for whatever they want to throw at me,\u201d he said during an interview with CNN.\n\nTrump\u2019s massive Granite State victory could put him on a collision course with Sen. Ted Cruz (TX), the winner of the Iowa caucuses who hopes to duplicate his formula for success by turning out South Carolina\u2019s evangelical voters.\n\nOf course, Trump doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s why Cruz won the Hawkeye State: after the caucuses he accused the Tea Party darling of stealing the election because his camp told Ben Carson supporters that the retired neurosurgeon was dropping out of the race.\n\nCruz has countered that his staffers were merely circulating a CNN report, but the bad blood persists. The two hopefuls are reportedly hoping to meet face-to-face in South Carolina to clear the air.\n\nIf the powwow doesn\u2019t work, the allegations against Cruz will no doubt continue, but such maneuvers would be par for the course in South Carolina.\n\nRelated: Did He Really Say That? Trump Hits a New Low in New Hampshire\n\nIn 2000, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) clobbered then-Texas Governor George W. Bush in the New Hampshire primary and was favored to win in South Carolina. Then a fake telephone poll suggested McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock and Bush went on to win the primary and eventually the presidency. In 2007, voters across the state opened their mailboxes to find a Christmas card suggesting former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, a Mormon, was pro-polygamy.\n\nLines of attack are already appearing among the 2016 field, where Tuesday night\u2019s results essentially clogged what might have been an exodus of White House hopefuls.\n\nCandidates like Ohio Governor John Kasich, who finished second to Trump, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who racked up a fourth place finish, feel invigorated, while Sen. Marco Rubio (FL), who hoped to turn his third-place finish in Iowa into a runner-up trophy in New Hampshire but came fifth, is desperate to eke out a win.\n\nRelated: Why the Working Class Is Choosing Trump and Sanders\n\nIn a Republican primary that has been dominated by national security, it\u2019s not surprising that the new round of criticism revolves around the military, especially when you consider that South Carolina boasts 8 military bases and almost 60,000 veterans.\n\nBush\u2019s campaign is already spreading materials that point out Kasich\u2019s support for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), suggesting it would weaken the U.S. military.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a sad situation when you\u2019ve got to rely on negative to move voters, which they haven\u2019t been able to do, as opposed to articulating a positive vision,\u201d Kasich, a former member of the House Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America.\n\nThere is also chatter that Trump\u2019s Vietnam War draft deferments may boil up as an issue. Cruz could also be under fire for his recent comments that it would be \u201cnuts\u201d to make women sign up for Selective Service despite the suggestion coming from the chiefs of the Army and Marine Corps. Rubio has already come out in favor of the idea.\n\nGOP leaders can only hope that the next ten days of jockeying don\u2019t bloody their eventual nominee too much and provide ammunition for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders in the general election.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Spreading rumors that one of your opponents is dropping out of the presidential race moments before the Iowa caucuses start?
