And Trump uses rhetoric to erode people's trust in facts, numbers, nuance, government and the news media, according to specialists in political rhetoric. "Nobody knows," he likes to declare, where illegal immigrants are coming from or the rate of increase of health care premiums under the Affordable Care Act, even though government agencies collect and publish this information. He insists that Obama wants to accept 250,000 Syrian migrants, even though no such plan exists, and repeats discredited rumors that thousands of Muslims were cheering in New Jersey during the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He promises to "bomb the hell" out of enemies — invoking Hiroshima and Nagasaki — and he says he would attack his political opponents "10 times as hard" as they criticized him.
