White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that the president was \u201cvery interested\u201d in doing so, purportedly to benefit the middle-class.\n\nTalk of unilateral executive action for raising taxes ensued after Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked Obama to raise over $100 billion in taxes through IRS executive action by eliminating corporate tax breaks.\n\n\u201cIf Congress fails to address these problems, the administration should act on its own to close, at a minimum,\u201d the six tax breaks, declared Sanders, who is the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee.\n\nSanders had sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Friday detailing the specific executive actions he believes that the IRS can take without having to wait for congressional approval. His letter declares that the administration can successfully raise more than $100 billion over the next decade simply by closing loopholes that are currently utilized by corporations. He wrote:\n\nAmerica needs tax reform that raises revenue in a progressive way to fund investments like infrastructure improvements that will create jobs and boost economic growth. One way to accomplish this is by closing tax loopholes that allow large, profitable corporations and some of the wealthiest people in our country to avoid paying their fair share.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal notes that three of the tax breaks to which Sanders refers \u2014 check-the-box loophole, Hewlett-Packard loophole, and the real estate investment trust loophole \u2014 were created by administrative actions or regulations, rendering them vulnerable to being closed by executive action. Sanders proposes closing the other three loopholes \u2014 corporate inversions, carried interest loophole, and valuation discounts \u2014 through regulatory powers assigned to the Treasury Department.\n\nSanders\u2019 letter states that closing the check-the-box loophole \u2014 which allows multinational companies to characterize their offshore subsidiaries in multiple ways so as to ultimately avoid taxation from any government \u2014 could raise $78 million over the next decade.\n\nThe Hewlett-Packard loophole enables major companies such as Hewlett-Packard to have offshore accounts that are circulated to the United States by a series of short-term \u201cloans\u201d from subsidiaries in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands.\n\nSanders indicates that the Obama administration should take action against the real estate investment trust loophole to stop businesses from structuring themselves like real-estate investment trusts so that they do not have to pay certain taxes.\n\nHe recommends administrative action to target corporate inversions, or \u201cearnings stripping,\u201d a practice in which an American company acquires a foreign company, relocates overseas, and deducts interest payments on debts borrowed by a foreign subsidiary. He claims that addressing these inversions would bring in $13 billion over a decade.\n\nEliminating the carried interest loophole, which permits wealthy hedge fund managers to label their compensation as capital gains subjecting it to lower personal income tax rates, would raise $17 billion over a decade, writes Sanders.\n\nFinally, he claims that removing valuation discounts \u2014 restrictions on business property for family members that reduce the value of the property for tax purposes in order to keep the business in the family \u2014 would raise $18 billion.\n\nSanders is careful to write that his list is by no means \u201cintended to be exhaustive,\u201d but serves instead to \u201cillustrate that if Congress fails to act, the Administration can act to resolve some of the problems with our tax code.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 letter defends the executive action by blaming his GOP colleagues: \u201cThe Republicans in Congress have made it clear that they will not address these problems.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, several of the tax proposals have already been proposed in Obama\u2019s budgets. WSJ writes, \u201cThe administration would curb one such break that allows multinationals to avoid taxation of profits by using offshore subsidiaries and another to curb \u2018equity stripping\u2019.\u201d\n\nSanders contends that Obama should resort to administrative action to end the practice.\n\nAccording to a White House spokeswoman, the president will be responding directly to Sanders. But Press Secretary Earnest states that the president has not ruled out using executive action to raise taxes.\n\n\"The president certainly has not indicated any reticence in using his executive authority to try and advance an agenda that benefits middle class Americans,\" Earnest said, adding,\n\nNow I don't want to leave you with the impression that there is some imminent announcement. There is not, at least that I know of. But the president has asked his team to examine the array of executive authorities that are available to him to try to make progress on his goals. So I am not in a position to talk in any detail at this point, but the president is very interested in this avenue generally.\n\nThere is very clear evidence that the president is indeed iterested in the executive action \u201cavenue,\u201d as he has already resorted to executive orders for immigration, minimum wage, federal pay discrimination, and EPA regulations on carbon emissions. He has even used administrative action to delay parts of the Affordable Care Act. To date, he has issued over 200 executive orders, according to the Federal Register.\n\nThe president's continuing determination to circumvent Congress reveals his willful disregard for what the American people want, since Congress is comprised of individuals elected by citizens to represent them. More importantly, it blazons his utter disdain for the Constitution, which assigns all legislative powers to Congress alone.\n\nMichael Steel, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, had this to say last June, after Obama threatened to use executive action to achieve immigration reform:\n\nThe president has a clear record of ignoring the American people\u2019s elected representatives and exceeding his constitutional authority, which has dangerous implications for both our system of government and our economy.\n\nFor now, at least, Obama has not resorted to executive action to accomplish the tax reform Sanders has outlined, opting instead to include corporate tax hikes and tax hikes on all Americans in his 2016 budget that would spend nearly $4 trillion and increase the deficit by approximately $470 billion.\n\nThe president's budget proposal includes a one-time 14-percent tax on all overseas profits, a 19-percent tax on all foreign profits going forward, and tax hikes on capital gains.\n\nPhoto of President Obama: AP Images", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Obama, executive action, raise, taxes, middle class. loop holes, tax breaks, Bernie Sanders", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/20265-obama-considers-tax-hikes-via-executive-action", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a5e00e8111d75b6556459c6e7c6ac005_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Obama is considering using executive action to raise taxes, once again circumventing Congress to advance his own agenda. by Raven Clabough", "title": "Obama Considers Tax Hikes Via Executive Action"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/a5e00e8111d75b6556459c6e7c6ac005_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Talk of unilateral executive action for raising taxes ensued after Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) asked Obama to raise over $100 billion in taxes through IRS executive action by eliminating corporate tax breaks.\nPresident Obama has indicated an interest in using executive action to raise taxes, once again proposing to circumvent Congress to advance his own agenda.\nFor now, at least, Obama has not resorted to executive action to accomplish the tax reform Sanders has outlined, opting instead to include corporate tax hikes and tax hikes on all Americans in his 2016 budget that would spend nearly $4 trillion and increase the deficit by approximately $470 billion.\nBut Press Secretary Earnest states that the president has not ruled out using executive action to raise taxes.\nThe president's budget proposal includes a one-time 14-percent tax on all overseas profits, a 19-percent tax on all foreign profits going forward, and tax hikes on capital gains."}
