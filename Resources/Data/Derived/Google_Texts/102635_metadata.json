The law was intended to \u201cpromote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system,\u201d and that it would put an end to \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks.Republicans say their alternative legislation will provide regulatory relief from Washington micromanagement, the Beacon explained.\u201cWhen they voted for it, supporters of Dodd-Frank said it would promote financial stability, end too big to fail, and lift the economy,\u201d House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican, said this week at a National Center for Policy Analysis event.\u201cNone of this has come to pass. Instead, five and a half years later, it has become evident that our society has become less stable, less prosperous, and most ominously, less free,\u201d the Beacon quoted him as saying.\u201cIts foundation very much rests on a false premise: that somehow deregulation was the root cause of the crisis,\u201d Hensarling said. \u201cBut it was not deregulation. In fact, in the decade leading up to the financial crisis regulatory restrictions in the financial sector actually increased,\u201d he said.The Texas Republican says the law has greatly slashed the number of banks offering free checking, made mortgages harder to obtain and jacked up even the most common bank fees. As a result, the act has made banking services difficult for low and middle income families to easily obtain.\u201cThe alternative to Dodd-Frank will be based on the principles that taxpayer bailouts of financial institutions must end and no company can remain too big to fail; systemic risk must be reduced through market discipline; consumers must be protected from force, fraud, and deception; simplicity must replace complexity; economic growth must be restored through transparent and innovative capital markets; and every American must have an opportunity to achieve financial independence,\u201d the Beacon explained.Backed by Wall Street and corporate lobbyists, Republicans in Congress have tried to roll back various provisions of the law. That effort has so far failed, and now the courts have become an alternative venue for the campaign, with a string of minor victories achieved, Bloomberg reported.\u201cThe financial industry is using all the tools available to resist the regulation mandated under Dodd-Frank,\u201d says Brian Marshall, policy counsel at Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group.To be sure, a group of respected think tanks \u2014 the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute and the Mercatus Center \u2014 has issued a 208-page book titled \u201cThe Case Against Dodd-Frank: How The \u2018Consumer Protection\u2019 Law Endangers Americans,\u201d Investor's Business Daily reports, calling the book \"a devastating indictment of the law.\"Dodd-Frank, writes Mollie McNeill, a Heritage Foundation researcher, \u201cpolices everything from derivatives markets to payday lending, and it has (so far) burdened the U.S. economy with thousands of pages of rules.\u201dDodd-Frank\u2019s restrictions come at a hefty price, \"costing the economy hundreds of billions of dollars in lost potential output, jobs and profits,\" IBD said.Newsmax Finance Insiders Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore have cited over-regulation as reason for the business-investment collapse.\u201cObamacare rules and mandates are job-killers. Dodd-Frank red-tape costs have held back lending to such an extent that business start-ups have practically come to a halt. And community banks have drastically pulled back loans to existing small businesses,\u201d they recently wrote for Newsmax Finance.\n\nBut Richard Ketchum, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's chairman and CEO, argued that while the act may be seen as too onerous on the banks, \"the goals behind Dodd-Frank are absolutely the right goals,\" he recently told CNBC. \"The amount of capital that the major banks had were not great enough. The amount of leverage that existed in the system was too great,\" he said. \"Each piece of Dodd-Frank action has been justified in response to a very real problem we saw in 2007 through 2009,\" he said.(Newsmax wire services contributed to this report).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Republicans, dodd frank, GOP, banks", "pubdate": "2016-05-14T12:19:13", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are planning new legislation to effectively repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank Act, a law that places major regulations on the financial industry, The Washington Free Beacon reported.", "title": "Free Beacon: GOP Plans to Replace Dodd-Frank Act", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Republicans-dodd-frank-GOP-banks/2016/05/14/id/728836/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=2e09f4a6-7b65-431d-b476-478d324f5852&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Republicans-dodd-frank-GOP-banks/2016/05/14/id/728836/", "title": "Free Beacon: GOP Plans to Replace Dodd-Frank Act", "description": "Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are planning new legislation to effectively repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank Act, a law that places major regulations on the financial industry, The Washington Free Beacon reported.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "epoch": 1463228353, "google-site-verification": "G8ES7h3vwQTlFRuKZLTkGYYr-GOyLKJVunu1JffVHbs", "keywords": "Republicans, dodd frank, GOP, banks", "article": {"section": "StreetTalk", "published_time": "2016-05-14T12:19:13"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Finance/StreetTalk/Republicans-dodd-frank-GOP-banks/2016/05/14/id/728836/", "description": "Alternative would provide regulatory relief from Washington micromanagement"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0510\"", "article_summary": "Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee are planning new legislation to effectively repeal and replace the Dodd-Frank Act, a law that places major regulations on the financial industry, The Washington Free Beacon reported.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was signed into law by President Barack Obama after the financial crisis of 2008.\nDodd-Frank red-tape costs have held back lending to such an extent that business start-ups have practically come to a halt.\n\"Each piece of Dodd-Frank action has been justified in response to a very real problem we saw in 2007 through 2009,\" he said.\nAnd community banks have drastically pulled back loans to existing small businesses,\u201d they recently wrote for Newsmax Finance.\nBut Richard Ketchum, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's chairman and CEO, argued that while the act may be seen as too onerous on the banks, \"the goals behind Dodd-Frank are absolutely the right goals,\" he recently told CNBC."}
