(Photo: Courtesy of Southern Regional Middle School.)\n\nSenior Airman Sarah Lowry was in quarantine for possible exposure to Ebola when she was scheduled to talk to students at Southern Regional Middle School in the Manahawkin section of Stafford.\n\nLowry had planned to talk to her niece\u2019s seventh-grade Social Studies class in October about her work with a joint military task force building hospitals in Liberia. Instead, she remained in isolation at an Air Force base in Virginia.\n\nDespite the physical limitation, new technology in classrooms enabled Lowry to reach her niece and the students in Manahawkin through a live chat using computers and webcams. The technology enabled the seventh-graders to ask the airman questions and get answers in real time, despite Lowry\u2019s quarantine.\n\nEbola \u201cis all kids wanted to talk about,\u201d said their teacher Bill Smith. \u201cThey were kind of freaking out about it, because they see it on CNN, and they hear about doctors dying and the nurses getting it.\u201d\n\nRead more stories about Ebola\n\nLowry did not have approval from her commanding officers to talk about the experience with an Asbury Park Press reporter, but her 12-year-old niece Karagan Bulger said getting to see her aunt through the live chat technology and ask her questions about the Ebola crisis in Africa calmed her classmates\u2019 fears.\n\n\u201cIt was a miracle,\u201d Karagan said. \u201cI always thought she was a super hero, because she was kind of like saving everybody.\u201d\n\nDays before the chat session, Smith had tried dampening the students\u2019 fears about Ebola, pointing out that none of them knew anyone in Liberia.\n\n\u201cActually, I do,\u201d Karagan recalled telling him.\n\nThat conversation set in motion Lowry\u2019s plan to speak with the class about her ordeal.\n\nFor Karagan, it was an emotional, as well as educational, experience. It was the Stafford girl\u2019s first time seeing her aunt since Lowry returned from Liberia, and her first experience using live chat software.\n\n\u201cI think it was really great for them to have this opportunity,\u201d said Kelly Bulger, who is Lowry\u2019s sister and Karagan\u2019s mother.\n\nBulger said the technology enabled Karagan and her classmates to better see the broader world around them.\n\nKaragan said after the chat session, her classmates were less scared that they would catch Ebola.\n\n\u201cThey were more scared for my aunt,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryday they would come to me and say \u201cIs your aunt OK?\u2019\u201d\n\nKaragan said she was reunited with her aunt the day after Lowry was released from the quarantine.\n\nSmith said technology in the classroom is offering his students more information about current events, geography and giving them a better global perspective.\n\n\u201cWe try not to be insular,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best part about Social Studies. These kids are part of their global community, and I want them to realize that.\u201d\n\nAmanda Oglesby: 732-557-5701; aoglesby@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1zRWIyO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A group of seventh graders at Southern Regional Middle School got schooled in Ebola from an airman in quarantine, thanks to technology that has connected classrooms to the wider world.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "A group of seventh graders at Southern Regional Middle School got schooled in Ebola from an airman in quarantine, thanks to technology that has connected classrooms to the wider world.", "title": "Quarantine doesn\u2019t stop Ebola talk in Stafford", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2014/12/03/southern-regional-middle-school-holds-ebola-chat-despite-quarantine/19854487/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A group of seventh graders at Southern Regional Middle School got schooled in Ebola from an airman in quarantine, thanks to technology that has connected classrooms to the wider world.", "title": "Southern Regional Middle School holds Ebola chat despite quarantine", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cbe5bf38e9a09f4caa2b604bb69e2a2d3c6c8ab8/c=136-0-939-803&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/12/03/B9315314944Z.1_20141203164725_000_GBG99P499.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "www.facebook.com/amanda.oglesby.njpress"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Southern Regional Middle School, Ebola, quarantine, classroom tech, classroom technology"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42a1\"", "article_summary": "Bill Smith\u2019s seventh-grade class at Southern Regional Middle School engages in a chat about Ebola with Senior Airman Susan Lowry while Lowry was quarantined.\n(Photo: Courtesy of Southern Regional Middle School.)\nSenior Airman Sarah Lowry was in quarantine for possible exposure to Ebola when she was scheduled to talk to students at Southern Regional Middle School in the Manahawkin section of Stafford.\nThe technology enabled the seventh-graders to ask the airman questions and get answers in real time, despite Lowry\u2019s quarantine.\nKaragan said after the chat session, her classmates were less scared that they would catch Ebola."}
