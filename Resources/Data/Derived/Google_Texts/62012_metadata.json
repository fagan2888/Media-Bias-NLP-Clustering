What convinced you this was the right year?\n\nWell, I got a clean bill of health from the doctor, and after conversations with my wife and my mother, they thought it was time to do it.\n\nOne of the issues you\u2019ve been very vocal about is the opioid crisis in New Hampshire and especially in Manchester. We\u2019re seeing a lot of activity \u2013 federal, state and local \u2013 what, if anything, do you think is making a difference right now and what, if anything, would you do differently as governor?\n\nThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s no longer just a heroin issue, it\u2019s a fentanyl issue. The deaths up until Monday were 26 in the city of Manchester; that\u2019s ahead of where we were last year, and I know the count is higher in New Hampshire. We need to look and see what we can do. My belief is, if you\u2019re caught dealing fentanyl, and somebody dies and it can be tied back to a dealer, they should be arrested for attempted murder. We have to put some pretty stiff penalties in place to make sure that the dealers turn around and stop doing what they\u2019re doing.\n\nGovernor Hassan had asked state lawmakers for $5 million more for the substance abuse programs in Senate Bill 533. The Senate Finance Committee authorized about half that. What\u2019s the right number?\n\nCertainly talking about dollars is important, but talking about lives is more important. We need to first find out how we\u2019re going to stop it at the top, because no matter what we fund on the bottom side, it\u2019s not going to be enough, because people will die before they get the services. We need to take a look at where we are; we need to find the most cost-effective way of doing it. Just to say \u201chere\u2019s a number\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense. We need to say, can we do this with recovery coaches in a less expensive way? What is the best way of serving the public in the state of New Hampshire?\n\nYou\u2019re one of three candidates in the GOP field; there may be more. What is the way forward for you to win this primary?\n\nI don\u2019t ever run against anybody, I run for the office, and I\u2019ve done that in every election since 1999. People know I don\u2019t run against them, I run for the office, and put my experience and my leadership and my record on the line so people can see it, and show the accomplishments we\u2019ve had here in the city of Manchester. And I believe we can bring those same accomplishments to the state of New Hampshire.\n\nLet\u2019s talk quickly about some additional issues: first, what would you like to see happen with the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program for low-income adults, under the Affordable Care Act?\n\nWe have 46,000 people that are covered by it. I think it we can get folks to primary care physicians instead of emergency rooms, that\u2019s good. We need to take a look at programs they may be using in other states to see if we can fine-tune the one we have in place. We have to make sure it doesn\u2019t cost the taxpayers any dollars.\n\nShould the state be open to contracting with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England in the future for women\u2019s health services?\n\nI can tell you that in the Senate I voted against funding for Planned Parenthood in the past. I would vote against any public funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nOn proposals to expand gambling in New Hampshire, such as casinos or keno, what, if anything, might you support and under what conditions?\n\nI would have to see the bill and see exactly what it says and make sure that it protects the state. And I would never use any of those revenues as part of the budget process, because you don\u2019t know whether they will continue or not.\n\nWhat do you make of the proposal to put a commuter rail line from southern New Hampshire to Boston, which could include two stops in Manchester and another in Nashua?\n\nIt\u2019s important to see what time those stops are going to be and what it\u2019s going to cost people. Most importantly, it\u2019s got to come down and be analyzed about cost. It\u2019s important that we talk about finishing I-93, because when I was a senator, that completion cost was $190 million. It\u2019s over and above $400 million [now], so I-93 must be completed.\n\nNew Hampshire has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation, but there are still concerns about the future of the state economy and the workforce. What would you like to see happen?\n\nLet\u2019s find ways we can reduce the BPT and BET, the business taxes. Once you do that with companies, they will hire people and bring people to work. Let\u2019s get out of the way of business and let them do what they do best, and that\u2019s hire people and get things done.\n\nIt looks like you\u2019re going to be working two jobs for a while. How do you think this campaign might affect your work as mayor of Manchester.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll affect it at all. I was in a campaign just a few months ago, and I was still the mayor and I think people would tell you I was still doing a great job. I will continue doing a good job for the city of Manchester, and I will run a very, very good campaign running for governor.", "article_metadata": {"category": "NH News", "description": "The mayor of New Hampshire\u2019s largest city now wants to be New Hampshire\u2019s next governor.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Weekend Edition", "og": {"url": "http://nhpr.org/post/ted-gatsas-his-campaign-governor-opioid-crisis-expanded-medicaid-and-more", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/nhpr/files/styles/medium/public/201506/mayor_gatsas.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The mayor of New Hampshire\u2019s largest city now wants to be New Hampshire\u2019s next governor.", "title": "Ted Gatsas On His Campaign For Governor, The Opioid Crisis, Expanded Medicaid, And More"}, "story_id": 471163238, "twitter": {"site": "@nhpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@BradyCarlson"}, "author": "Brady Carlson", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Ted Gatsas On His Campaign For Governor, The Opioid Crisis, Expanded Medicaid, And More"}, "nid": 87561, "datePublished": "2016-03-20", "keywords": "Ted Gatsas, NH Politics, 2016 Elections, Governor\\'s Race", "wordCount": 1138, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ec8\"", "article_summary": "Manchester Mayor and Republican candidate for governor Ted Gatsas talks with NHPR's Brady Carlson.\nOne of the issues you\u2019ve been very vocal about is the opioid crisis in New Hampshire and especially in Manchester.\nShortly after that announcement, Mayor Gatsas spoke with Weekend Edition about the campaign and some of the issues the next governor may face.\nRepublican Ted Gatsas of Manchester announced on Thursday he would seek the Republican Party\u2019s nomination for the corner office.\nI will continue doing a good job for the city of Manchester, and I will run a very, very good campaign running for governor."}
