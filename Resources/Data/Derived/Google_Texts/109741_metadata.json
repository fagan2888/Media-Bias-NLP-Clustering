Hill, who was walking with friends in LA, did his best to ignore the paparazzo who was dancing around them and shouting questions at Hill. \"I like the shorts though, bro. They're pretty sexy,\" he said at one point, apparently a swipe at Hill's flowery summer shorts.\n\nHill eventually lost his cool and yelled \"Suck my d---, f-----,\" at the photographer.\n\nOK, celebrities need to cut this out. Listen up, buddies. (I call all celebrities my buddies.) Buddies, no one cares if you yell insults at a paparazzo. We get it. They're horrible. But why let them bait you into this? Why do so many of you have slurs on the tip of your tongues, just waiting to be teased out by an enterprising pest? You need some insults that only offend the person they're intended to. Maybe go back to Shakespeare. \"Suck my d---, knave.\" \"Go f--- yourself, cankerblossom.\" \"Shove it up your ---, you milk-livered pumpion.\"", "article_metadata": {"date": "2014-10-10", "description": "Jonah Hill yells homophobic slur at photographer", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "Jonah Hill yells homophobic slur at photographer", "title": "Jonah Hill yells homophobic slur at photographer", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/jonah-hill-yells-homophobic-slur-at-photographer/tmWnfc---8beHflqGZ4Fg/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$dh99ornf26f9twnc4wmlx05uzsi5ydz/getty-135151136-614x947.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "Jonah Hill yells homophobic slur at photographer", "title": "Jonah Hill yells homophobic slur at photographer", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$dh99ornf26f9twnc4wmlx05uzsi5ydz/getty-135151136-614x947.jpeg"}, "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "The Word,Region National,the-word-2,homophobia, Jonah Hill", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/the-word", "published_time": "2014-06-03T10:59:58Z", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T10:59:58Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "The Word,Region National,the-word-2,homophobia, Jonah Hill"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe118b\"", "article_summary": "A photographer pestering comedy star Jonah Hill caught him on tape using a homophobic slur on Monday (TMZ has the video).\nNEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 06: Jonah Hill attends 'The Sitter' premiere at Chelsea Clearview Cinemas on December 6, 2011 in New York City.\n(Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images)This could just as easily be titled \"Paparazzo successfully baits Jonah Hill into losing his cool by hurting his feelings about his shorts.\"\nHill eventually lost his cool and yelled \"Suck my d---, f-----,\" at the photographer.\nHill, who was walking with friends in LA, did his best to ignore the paparazzo who was dancing around them and shouting questions at Hill."}
