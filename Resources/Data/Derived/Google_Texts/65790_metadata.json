He took the lead for the first time with 58 laps to go and then got caught entering pit road too fast when the 16th and final caution came out with about 40 laps to go.\n\nThe mistake put him well back in the field, and he rallied to finish a disappointing ninth.\n\n\u201cWow. I\u2019m sorry guys,\u201d he said on the radio when told of the penalty. \u201cThat\u2019s on me. I apologize.\u201d\n\nThe race also ended Kevin Harvick\u2019s streak of top-two finishes at eight. Harvick, who was three races shy of tying Richard Petty\u2019s record of 11 top-two finishes, led a race-high 154 laps but faded to eighth place.\n\nGordon and his Hendrick Motorsports teammates have dominated at the 0.526-mile oval in recent years, but Gordon\u2019s finish and an 11th for Kasey Kahne were the best they could muster.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr., who won at the track last fall, wound up in the garage after losing his radiator in a large crash in turn one before the midpoint of the race, and Jimmie Johnson, an eight-time Martinsville winner, had issues throughout the race and finished 35th, 32 laps down. Earnhardt finished right behind him.\n\nThe race also marked the Sprint Cup debut of Chase Elliott, who will replace the retiring Gordon in the Hendrick stable next season, and Elliott got a quick welcome. His car was bounced around early, also wound up in the garage and finished 38th.\n\nThe day went better for Danica Patrick, who was seventh, her fifth career top-10 finish. That tied her with Janet Guthrie for most top-10s by a female driver, and was one spot off Patrick\u2019s career-best sixth place run at Atlanta last year.\n\nHamlin, unlike Gordon, made his mistake early enough in the race to recover. Before the race was 200 laps old, he was penalized for an uncontrolled tire on pit road and dropped from the lead to 22nd.\n\nHe was back in the top 10 by the midpoint, and stalking the leaders shortly thereafter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hamlin passed teammate Matt Kenseth for the lead with 28 laps to go Sunday and went on to end Toyota's 32-race winless streak in the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Martinsville Speedway.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hamlin passed teammate Matt Kenseth for the lead with 28 laps to go Sunday and went on to end Toyota\u2019s 32-race winless streak in the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Martinsville Speedway.", "title": "Danny Hamlin passes teammate Matt Kenseth late, holds on for Martinsville win", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/29/danny-hamlin-passes-teammate-matt-kenseth-late-hol/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/29/NASCAR_Martinsville_Auto_Racing.JPEG-05739.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/29/NASCAR_Martinsville_Auto_Racing.JPEG-05739.jpg", "description": "Hamlin passed teammate Matt Kenseth for the lead with 28 laps to go Sunday and went on to end Toyota's 32-race winless streak in the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Martinsville Speedway.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Danny Hamlin passes teammate Matt Kenseth late, holds on for Martinsvi"}, "Author": "Hank Kurz Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Jeff Gordon, Martinsville, Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec2e\"", "article_summary": "The victory also came after a terrible blunder by four-time series champion and eight-time Martinsville winner Jeff Gordon.\nMARTINSVILLE, Va. \u2014 Denny Hamlin passed teammate Matt Kenseth for the lead with 28 laps to go Sunday and went on to end Toyota\u2019s 32-race winless streak in the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Martinsville Speedway.\nBefore the race was 200 laps old, he was penalized for an uncontrolled tire on pit road and dropped from the lead to 22nd.\nThe mistake put him well back in the field, and he rallied to finish a disappointing ninth.\nHamlin, unlike Gordon, made his mistake early enough in the race to recover."}
