Anybody who wanted your votes for president really had to earn them, holding umpteen town hall meetings, answering gazillions of tough questions from undecideds. Back in the day you loved Republicans like Senator John McCain, but man, you made him work for his wins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI was there in the run-up to the 2000 primary, at scores of those town hall meetings, listening to his voice grow hoarse as he patiently fielded queries on domestic and foreign policy. Legions of you lined up at the microphones. You were magnificent.\n\nIt seems ludicrous now, but McCain captured your hearts by talking about campaign finance reform, and about serving a cause greater than oneself. Now we have those detestable SuperPACs, and candidates trucking in pure ego.\n\nWe have the odious Donald Trump, who has managed to convince an alarming number of you that he is somehow the most genuine candidate in the field.\n\nAnd he\u2019s done it, not by working hard and meeting you where you live, which is what you have long demanded of candidates, but by zooming in and out on his jet, staying only long enough to spew bile and spout useless generalities. A beautiful wall will solve all our immigration issues. Something terrific will replace Obamacare. Let\u2019s protect ourselves from terrorism by excluding Muslims.\n\nDoes any of this answer the kinds of questions you seemed so eager to ask before? Nah, but who cares? Does it matter that this particular straight talker is an utterly unabashed liar? Nope. He\u2019s an American success story! He\u2019s on TV! Enough with the political correctness!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGaffes that would have ended a candidacy in other cycles seem only to strengthen Trump\u2019s appeal. You\u2019re not bothered by the bigotry, or by the fact that he\u2019s clueless about actual issues (Boy, was he lost in Thursday\u2019s debate when asked about nuclear weapons). And if none of that gives you pause, it\u2019s a good bet Trump\u2019s love-fest with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin won\u2019t trouble you, either. Sure, Putin murders journalists and opponents, Trump said on Friday, but \u201cat least he\u2019s a leader, unlike what we have in this country.\u201d Delightful.\n\nYou seem much angrier than you used to be. You\u2019ve had it with Washington, with Democrats and the GOP. Some who have watched Granite State politics for a long time say you want to turn government upside down so badly that you\u2019ve fallen in love with this empty suit who says he wants it too.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re falling for it because, in their mind, he is the only guy standing up and speaking out against everything traditional in politics,\u201d said Mike Dennehy, who managed McCain\u2019s campaigns in New Hampshire in 2000 and 2008. \u201cSo they\u2019re willing to vote for an outrageous outsider like Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nDennehy is appalled by the despicable, un-American things Trump says. He has plenty of company among Granite State Republicans. In November, Party Chair Jennifer Horn told the Globe she didn\u2019t think Trump would prevail in New Hampshire because \u201cshallow campaigns that depend on bombast and divisive rhetoric do not succeed in New Hampshire.\u201d Trump operatives, as thin-skinned as the man himself, are now trying to remove her.\n\nYou used to see right though this kind of thing, New Hampshire. Well, yes, there was your strange romance with Pat Buchanan, but that was long ago. And this is worse. Former governor and party elder John H. Sununu is convinced you\u2019re falling for a guy who isn\u2019t even truly conservative on key issues, like taxation and healthcare.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going for the outlandish wrapping but they\u2019re not reading the label,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Sununu says he clings to hope that the New Hampshire he knew, with its famously discerning and demanding voters, will reappear in coming weeks. When \u201cthe serious electorate\u201d engages, Trump will be over.\n\nSo, he\u2019s not despairing?\n\n\u201cI am not,\u201d Sununu said. \u201cBut I am lighting candles.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1685392395", "eomportal-id": 836225, "description": "What happened, New Hampshire?
