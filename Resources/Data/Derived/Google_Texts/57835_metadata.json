Here is a man obviously in love with his wife, and who just had a baby, being vilified and mercilessly ridiculed by Linda Stasi for his tears on the witness stand and other very private emotions.\n\nYet I did not hear one word directed at his, yes, stalker. So, here it is: Genevieve Sabourin, you should be ashamed of yourself. Whether or not Baldwin ever had a relationship with you, sexual or otherwise, get over it. It is over and so are you. That you continue to harass and drag out your 15 minutes of fame only reinforces the fact that you are a pathetic woman with too much time on your hands.\n\nI do not know the Baldwins personally, but they have my sympathy. As to Stasi, she needs to find another cause, one that does not support abuse of other human beings, especially if they just happen to be more famous than the rest of us. Grace Araujo\n\nBully boy Baldwin\n\nManhattan: Not that I am in love with the paparazzi types, but I loathe bullies even more. Alec Baldwin \u2014 who seems to chase only those he can physically intimidate \u2014 is using his wife and baby as a phony excuse for asking the press to stay away. He was already attacking people before he had them. Jim Bitros\n\nLow-class Kelly\n\nBronx: I guess it\u2019s time for Ray Kelly to start cashing in on his notoriety as police commissioner by talking to Playboy magazine (\u201cDumpin\u2019 on de Blaz,\u201d Nov. 15). Here are a couple of questions Kelly should answer in his next one: If all the young residents in the projects looked like Justin Bieber, would he still be a believer in stop-and-frisk? Now that he\u2019s looking for a new job, would he be interested in being the head of security at Macy\u2019s or Barneys? Virgilio Carballo\n\nWe\u2019ll know soon\n\nRockaway Park: I have a question for Voicer Tim Caravello and all the other right-wing people predicting criminals will roam the streets of our city with impunity simply because our incoming mayor does not support the current stop-and-frisk policy: Will you write in a year from now to admit that you were wrong? I doubt it, since people like you, who seem to lack empathy for those who are the innocent victims of this tactic, rarely admit to being wrong about anything with political implications. Anthony Johnson\n\nObama v. Bush, Obama edition\n\nManhattan: All the people saying President Obama lied about Obamacare, and that his lies were worst than those of President George W. Bush, should take into account that Obama went on TV and apologized. Bush never did. For whatever reason, people were misinformed and the buck stopped with Obama, and he owned up to it. Bush never did. And if we put the two on a scale, we find the Bush lies cost thousands of American lives, while Obama\u2019s have cost zero. Only in America could someone compare the two. Ray McEaddy\n\nObama v. Bush, Bush edition\n\nTrumbull, Conn.: How can Voicer Robert Rundbaken even equate the Iraq war with people losing their health insurance? The Iraq war was voted on by Democrats and Republicans. The information may have turned out to be untrue, but it was there at the time. Obamacare was voted on strictly along party lines. As Nancy Pelosi said, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d There was much bribery and coercion involved to get enough votes to pass an enormous bill that affects the economy of this whole country \u2014 and that should have been debated and thoroughly examined before it was passed. Joyce Pinto\n\nCash chasers and care haters\n\nFar Rockaway: It appears to me that doctors opt out of Obamacare because they can\u2019t get huge payouts for the patients they see. My dermatologist\u2019s office charged my insurance company $175 to remove two skin tags. A tissue pathology lab charged $259 to analyze the samples (negative, by the way). Kudos to my doctor, who knew that the insurance payment would be small. But what about the people whose doctors dropped them because they want to be paid more? All I can say is that this brings the term \u201cambulance chaser\u201d to a higher level. Ora Reed\n\nQuit scapegoating Obamacare\n\nSchenectady, N.Y.: The Affordable Care Act is not the reason Voicer Helen Jaeger\u2019s copays, deductibles and so on are going up. As with all of us, her premiums increase along with the amount her insurance company pays out in claims on her behalf and on behalf of other subscribers included in her rating group. The ACA has started to decrease the cost of health care. The President is trying to make sure your fellow Americans can do what you and I already can \u2014 see a doctor. Diane Hombach\n\nLooking up\n\nJamesburg, N.J.: I\u2019m tired of reading about how bad the Obamacare website is. The first two weeks were horrible, but since then I\u2019ve opened an account and shopped. New Jersey has 27 different policies to compare, and I\u2019ve been on the site three or four times a week doing so. I haven\u2019t bought yet because I have until Dec. 15. You don\u2019t buy the first car or house you look at. John Yancsek\n\nSmear job\n\nWashington: Tammi Rossman-Benjamin baselessly asserts in her Op-Ed \u201cAnti-Semitism, academic freedom and Brooklyn College\u201d (Nov. 14) that I support \u201canti-Semitic\u201d policies, \u201ccondone terrorism\u201d and \u201cadvocate the elimination of the Jewish state\u201d in my effort to change U.S. policy toward Israel and the Palestinians to support human rights, international law and equality. Yet she marshals not one iota of evidence to substantiate these allegations. Her spurious claims not only are meant to discredit me and the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation (which I serve as the national advocacy director) but to pressure university administrators to crack down on Students for Justice in Palestine chapters to try to prevent them from organizing on campus to expose Israeli apartheid and advocate for Palestinian rights. Josh Ruebner\n\nFlashback\n\nBronx: In 1988, new schools Chancellor Richard Green challenged stakeholders to envision all students as worthy and entitled to share in the American experience. He urged our city to \u201creject illiteracy as a norm in some of our communities and move toward a quality of life which is the very foundation of an educated society.\u201d We need our next chancellor to be a seasoned educator, with a vision and a road map for getting us there. As Green reminded us: \u201cIn the final analysis, we must remember that we will be judged by only one standard \u2014 the extent to which we have improved achievement scores for all students.\u201d The time is now! Phyllis C. Murray\n\nThe Black of fire\n\nRidgewood, N.Y.: To Voicer Nancy Rogan, who wants firemen to work the same hours as cops: You obviously know as much about us as Cathie Black did about the schools \u2014 nada! We work two 24-hour shifts per week. I suggest you stick to your 9-to-5 job and enjoy the holidays. Francheisko Perez\n\nColorblind\n\nStaten Island: Where does Voicer Stephanie Ortiz get her information? As far as I\u2019m concerned, the firefighter who comes to save me can be any color, so long as he or she is capable of performing the job. Get over it \u2014 the best person wins no matter what color! Joan Sere\n\nCall for comment\n\nBrooklyn: Of about 4 million registered voters here, only a million voted. Can anyone explain it to me? Joseph R. Kayata\n\nAn outdated pledge?\n\nEdison, N.J.: The Daily News has a problem with Melissa Mark-Viverito not pledging allegiance to our flag. Yet it is our First Amendment right not to do so. If you have an issue with the councilwoman, make it one of policy. Tracy Connors\n\nCano\u2019s gotta go\n\nManhattan: The New York Yankees have an obligation to try to field a championship-caliber team. Overpaying Robinson Cano would undermine that objective, particularly given his unwillingness to run out ground balls and pop-ups, his lack of discipline at the plate and his post-season choke syndrome. This fan would rather have a second baseman who hustles, gets clutch hits in big games and shows some loyalty to his fans and his team, especially when that team has offered him a generous contract.
