Rick Perry (R-TX) (Credit: John Gress / Reuters)\n\nST. CHARLES, Missouri \u2014 Last week, Texas Governor Rick Perry took an uncharacteristically independent stance, bashing Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)\u2019s plan to force a government shut down over Obamacare funding as \u201cnonsensical.\u201d\n\nBut this Saturday, Perry was singing a different tune: \u201cDefund it,\u201d the Governor told ThinkProgress.\n\nWhen asked by ABC News earlier this week whether the shutdown showdown was a smart move, Perry had said \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good option.\u201d Rather, the Governor argued, \u201cthere\u2019s still time to sit down and try to fix Obamacare.\u201d Amend, not defund.\n\nOn Saturday, Perry told ThinkProgress that \u201cyou in the media\u201d were taking him out of context. He claimed his comments to ABC merely amounted to opposition to a shutdown. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone thinks the shutting down of the government was a good option,\u201d he explained, a paraphrase inconsistent with the transcript of his ABC comments.\n\nPerry went on to express support for fully defunding Obamacare, arguing that Obama and Reid have taken repairing Obamacare off the table by refusing to negotiate with Republicans over the shutdown crisis:\n\nI thought there was an opportunity ten days ago to maybe come together and \u2018fix,\u2019 I think was the word I used\u2026the President and Harry Reid clearly took that off the table this last week when they said \u2018we\u2019re not going to talk about it. It\u2019s our way or the highway.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m like a lot of other people who, \u2018you\u2019ll negotiate with the leader of Iran, but you won\u2019t even sit down with Republicans in the House and the Senate to try to find a reasonable middle ground on this? So yeah, I think we ought to defund Obamacare.\n\nWatch it:\n\nPerry\u2019s pretext for his flip doesn\u2019t work. Obama has been saying for years that he won\u2019t negotiate over the debt ceiling despite being willing to negotiate on broader fiscal issues, so Obama\u2019s reticence to negotiate while Republicans are taking hostages that could hurt the U.S. economy isn\u2019t new. At least one Republican in Congress, Sen. Tom Coburn (R-OK), agreed with last week\u2019s Perry that the crusade to defund Obamacare is making it harder to pursue the kind of \u201cfix\u201d Perry originally wanted.\n\nMoreover, there are some fairly obvious differences between Obama\u2019s recent attempt to open up negotiations with Iran and Republicans threatening to crash the economy unless Obama gives up on his signature legislation.\n\nRegardless of the reason, Perry getting on the \u201cdefund!\u201d train is more evidence of Cruz and his faction\u2019s influence inside the Republican Party. \u201c[Sen. Cruz] played a huge role,\u201d in the House leadership picking shutdown fight in the past few days that it originally didn\u2019t want, according to Rep. John Fleming (R-LA). \u201cHe\u2019s been the rallying force.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "He used to think defunding Obamacare was \"nonsense.\" Now he supports it.
