John Hickenlooper signed legislation Wednesday that allows $250 million of state backing for plans to remake the National Western Stock Show site.\n\nThe money will help Colorado State University expand its agricultural programs on and near the site, forming an innovation hub. Denver city leaders and partners, including CSU and the stock show, are aiming to remake the area over the next decade into a year-round tourism, event and education center in the National Western Center master plan.\n\nHickenlooper, CSU president Tony Frank and sponsors of the bill from both parties spoke about the importance of maintaining the site\u2019s connection to agriculture during a ceremony inside the historic 1909 Stadium Arena.\n\n\u201cWe came back (from the recession) faster than just about any state,\u201d Hickenlooper said, \u201cand a lot of that energy came out of our agricultural economy. It doesn\u2019t just stay in rural Colorado; it ricochets across the state.\u201d\n\nUnder the new law, the state can strike lease-purchase agreements for up to 20 years, similar to how it has financed other large projects. Different from selling traditional project bonds, the state would recruit investors to front the money via a tool called certificates of participation and repay them in annual installments from the state budget.\n\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock, who did not attend the signing ceremony, and other backers of the plans now are looking ahead to a potential November tax vote.\n\nWinning Denver voters\u2019 support for decades-long extensions to lodging and car-rental taxes is key to other big components estimated to cost $856 million.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gov.
