Or so I\u2019m told that somewhere in the world isn\u2019t experiencing massive rain storms, or scorching temperatures and wildfires.\n\nAnd in the spirit of sunny weather, Zachary Levi (from \u201cChuck\u201d), Bert (of \u201cSesame Street\u201d) and the folks at Mashable have made a video about detaching ourselves from our many screens, and heading outside. (Only problem is you have to watch the great video on a screen.)\n\nBut after you watch this video, maybe get off Facebook, step away from snapchat and take a look at the blue skies. As Bert sings, \u201cJust look up and there will be/Bright blue skies, don\u2019t need a/Weather app to tell you that/Subscription to this cloud is free.\u201d\n\nIt stars Levi, Bert, Grover, Kal Penn and others. The song is called \u201cLovely Sunny Day\u201d and is below:\n\nAlso, from Mashable, here are the lyrics:\n\nEvery day I sit right there\n\nSit and stare and check my Facebook, Email, Instagram\n\nChatting with my friends and making plans.\n\nBut on days with lots of sun\n\nI say goodbye to everyone online\n\nAnd say hello, cuz I know there\u2019s a place where all the Bees are always buzzing \u2019bout the flowers they have seen.\n\nAnd every tree is trending,\n\nI don\u2019t miss my little screen, because\n\nThe sky won\u2019t need a filter\n\nAnd the birds tweet just to say:\n\nYou should really take a walk on this lovely\n\nsunny day. In the park I reconnect\n\nTake some time to self-reflect\n\nYo, this Snapchat is going to be cray!\n\nNo hashtag selfie, put that thing away.\n\nThe pigeons make it feel like home\n\nFollow me and we can can roam\n\nAcross the grass and see\n\nThat now we\u2019re running faster than 4G! On the playground there\u2019s a million games to play.\n\nWe don\u2019t need a fancy tablet with a\n\nretina display. Because\u2026 The Bees are always buzzing \u2019bout the flowers they have seen.\n\nAnd every tree is trending,\n\nI don\u2019t miss my little screen, because\n\nThe sky won\u2019t need a filter\n\nAnd the birds tweet just to say:\n\nYou should really take a walk on this lovely\n\nsunny day.
