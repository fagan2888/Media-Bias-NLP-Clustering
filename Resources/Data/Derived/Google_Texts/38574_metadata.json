The employment advice line at Challenger, Gray & Christmas is proof of that. It was hopping Thursday.\n\nJohn Challenger says the 2014 job outlook is positive, if this year\u2019s trend continues.\n\nHe says there were 195,000 new jobs every month this year. But Chicago\u2019s 8.1 percent unemployment rate still lags behind the national rate of 7 percent.\n\nThe jobs folks will find here? They are for skilled workers, accounting, engineering, technology, health care and medicine, Challenger says.\n\nMost of the jobs are still the 40-hours-a-week sort.\n\n\u201cThere are still far more full-time jobs than part time jobs in the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd yet the growth of part-time jobs is continuing.\u201d\n\nChallenger says it\u2019s too early to say how the Affordable Care Act will impact the job market. And for those discounting the value of a college education \u2013don\u2019t.\n\nHe says the unemployment rate for college grads is half what it is for the general population.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 567,000 thousand people are unemployed in the Chicago area alone, and many of them were using the day after Christmas to jump on that job search.
