It clearly says \"retired\".\n\n\u201cBut they allowed him to come in, in order to talk to an inmate that we later find out was being represented by one of his family members,\u201d said Whetsel.\n\nWith an IPhone 4 in his possession, Keeter made his way all the way to an interview room and had a private visit with the female inmate, all under the guise of an official law enforcement interview.\n\n\u201cHe was not supposed to be here at all,\u201d said Whetsel.\n\nWhetsel says he was being watched the entire time on surveillance monitors and it didn't take long for sheriff's deputies to realize something wasn't right.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t look right. It didn\u2019t appear right,\u201d said Whetsel.\n\nKeeter was arrested for four felony counts, including false personation of an officer and unauthorized entry into a prison.\n\n\u201cDuring that Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday period, it is busy. It is extremely busy,\u201d said Whetsel. \u201cAnd the employee just didn\u2019t take enough time to make sure that the visit was appropriate.\u201d\n\nNews 9\u2019s Evan Anderson gave Keeter a call at his home in Sapulpa.\n\nEvan: \u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d\n\nJames: \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not allowed to talk about it.\u201d\n\nThe Sheriff says he\u2019s confident that nothing actually happened inside the interview room, because Keeter was only inside a short time before being arrested.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A man is accused of impersonating a law enforcement officer and visiting an inmate after a security breach at the Oklahoma County Jail.", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26146017/man-arrested-after-security-breach-at-the-oklahoma-county-jail", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4343628_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A man is accused of impersonating a law enforcement officer and visiting an inmate after a security breach at the Oklahoma County Jail.", "title": "Man Arrested After Security Breach At The Oklahoma County Jail"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4343628_G.jpg", "description": "A man is accused of impersonating a law enforcement officer and visiting an inmate after a security breach at the Oklahoma County Jail.", "card": "summary", "title": "Man Arrested After Security Breach At The Oklahoma County Jail"}, "wnreadableurl": "man-arrested-after-security-breach-at-the-oklahoma-county-jail", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2014/07/29", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,county jail,security breach,impersonation,evan anderson,kwtv,cbs,news9", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,county jail,security breach,impersonation,evan anderson,kwtv,cbs,news9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2520\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe claimed to be an active probation officer or a deputy sheriff in Tulsa County,\u201d said Oklahoma County Sheriff, John Whetsel.\nA man is accused of impersonating a law enforcement officer and visiting an inmate after a security breach at the Oklahoma County Jail.\nJames Keeter, 70, made his way inside the Oklahoma County Jail with little resistance.\nKeeter was arrested for four felony counts, including false personation of an officer and unauthorized entry into a prison.\nWhetsel says the sheriff\u2019s deputy who checked Keeter in, apparently didn't read Keeter's badge close enough."}
