California was the only state to see a reduction, thanks to extensive restrictions imposed on the insurance industry by a 1988 ballot initiative, Proposition 103. Since then, that state's auto insurance costs dropped 0.3 percent.\n\nUnfortunately, a closer look at the actual numbers in the report, combined with consideration of what happened in Harrisburg back in the 1970s, dampens the Pennsylvania celebration quite a bit.\n\nFirst, the numbers reveal that while Pennsylvania did well on a percentage basis, we had higher auto insurance costs to begin with. In fact, we had higher rates than any of the states with the lowest increases \u2014 California, Hawaii and New Hampshire.\n\nFor example, the average annual cost of auto insurance premiums in Pennsylvania, the CFA report said, is $812. In New Hampshire, it's $706. New Hampshire could have had a 33 percent increase and still have less expensive insurance than we.\n\nThe state with the worst increase was Nebraska, where rates more than doubled. Even at that, however, auto insurance in that state is still hundreds of dollars a year cheaper than in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe state with the lowest cost is South Dakota. Those of us who have driven in Nebraska and South Dakota must admit that cheap insurance may have something to do with the fact that there are fewer things to run into out on the boring plains.\n\nA better comparison is New Hampshire, the only state where auto insurance is optional. That reflects New Hampshire's ferocious devotion to libertarian freedoms. Its state motto is \"Live Free or Die\" and the people there really mean it. Seat belts in cars are not compulsory, nor are helmets on motorcycles for anybody (they're required in Pennsylvania for some riders).\n\nTo put New Hampshire's less expensive auto insurance in perspective, I must go back to 1974, when I worked for The Associated Press and was being transferred from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, where there was a huge fuss over a plan to bring \"no-fault\" auto insurance to the state.\n\nThe insurance industry invested millions in \"political campaign contributions\" and succeeded in having the legislation make auto insurance, at least liability insurance, compulsory for every motorist for the first time. That was accompanied by promises that the measures would reduce rates.\n\nThe people at the current state Insurance Department did not respond to my request for facts and figures, but it is my recollection that as soon as the state's insurance industry had compulsory auto insurance, the cost of premiums for consumers nearly doubled.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local, Columnists-Carpenter, News, Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-mcall", "description": "At first glance, the statistics revealed in a state-by-state analysis of auto insurance costs make Pennsylvania look pretty good. \"Report praised Pennsylvania car insurance model,\" celebrated a...", "title": "Pennsylvania auto insurance picture not rosy", "url": "http://articles.mcall.com/2013-11-16/news/mc-pc-pennsylvania-auto-insurance-20131116_1_auto-insurance-insurance-industry-cheap-insurance", "image": "http://www.mcall.com/media/photo/2013-11/78213799.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818, "app_id": 185854558123618}, "description": "At first glance, the statistics revealed in a state-by-state analysis of auto insurance costs make Pennsylvania look pretty good. \"Report praised Pennsylvania car insurance model,\" celebrated a"}, "article_summary": "Pennsylvania auto insurance picture not as rosy as first indicated\"Report praised Pennsylvania car insurance model,\" celebrated a headline in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, referring to Tuesday's release of a 75-page \"Review of Auto Insurance Rate Regulation in America\" by the Consumer Federation of America.\nThe insurance industry invested millions in \"political campaign contributions\" and succeeded in having the legislation make auto insurance, at least liability insurance, compulsory for every motorist for the first time.\nSince then, that state's auto insurance costs dropped 0.3 percent.\nFirst, the numbers reveal that while Pennsylvania did well on a percentage basis, we had higher auto insurance costs to begin with.\nEven at that, however, auto insurance in that state is still hundreds of dollars a year cheaper than in Pennsylvania."}
