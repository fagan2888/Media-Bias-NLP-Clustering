Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., announcing his bid for the White House last Monday in his hometown of Central.\n\nLindsey Graham\u2019s entrance last week into the Republican scrum for the White House was greeted by enthusiastic chants of \u201cU-S-A, U-S-A\u201d from the hometown crowd who turned out for his announcement in Central.\n\nOnline For more political coverage, information on the Palmetto Politics app or to sign up for our newsletter, go to palmettopolitics.com.\n\nPolitical observers who watched South Carolina\u2019s senior U.S. senator said he touched all the right bases, from idolizing Ronald Reagan to sniping at President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy and identifying radical Islam as a global threat.\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t a breakout or signature moment last Monday, likely leaving Graham at the same place in the GOP pecking order that he was in before his formal kickoff \u2014 near dead-last in most national and early state polls.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a well-orchestrated and even touching event,\u201d said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. \u201dBut it\u2019s had zero impact.\u201d\n\nGraham\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t get much play on the evening news shows, which Sabato attributed in part to it coming amid a flurry of other Republicans and Democrats announcing their candidacy.\n\n\u201cGraham has a lot of work to do. If he doesn\u2019t qualify for the debates I don\u2019t see how he moves up,\u201d Sabato said.\n\nGraham was the ninth Republican to officially enter the race for the GOP nomination, followed by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry later in the week. The rest of the presumed GOP candidates are expected to declare by the end of July.\n\nGraham followed up his announcement with return trips to Iowa, where candidates face their first test in the state\u2019s caucus, and New Hampshire, which holds the nation\u2019s first primary.\n\nIn Iowa, Craig Robinson, founder and editor-in-chief of TheIowaRepublican.com, a blog dedicated to all things GOP in the Hawkeye State, said he didn\u2019t think Graham\u2019s formal kickoff had much of an impact there because Graham doesn\u2019t have the following that others have spent months and years developing.\n\nSeveral candidates \u2014 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum \u2014 had supporters already on the ground from earlier White House runs.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d cultivated interest in Iowa over the years,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cGraham didn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nIn New Hampshire, the state Graham visited first after his Monday kickoff, one political observer said being the ninth Republican to get into the race didn\u2019t help in generating interest in him as a candidate.\n\n\u201cInitially, voters paid more attention because it was early on,\u201d said New England College political scientist Wayne Lesperance, noting the hype that followed the candidates who were first out of the gate. \u201cNow, it\u2019s easier to get lost in the shuffle.\u201d\n\nLesperance said Graham\u2019s tale of growing up in a small town behind his family\u2019s bar and pool hall increased interest in him among famously independent New Hampshire voters.\n\nRecent polling, mostly from before his formal announcement, have Graham barely hitting 1 percent, which could disqualify him from the first debates if they are limited to the top 10 candidates.\n\nFor some in the national media, Graham\u2019s launch was an opportunity to contrast him with another presidential contender and Senate rival Paul.\n\nGraham, the national security hawk, and Paul, the privacy rights libertarian, have sparred over renewing key provisions of the Patriot Act and the mass collection of Americans\u2019 communication data. Graham was pictured recently rolling his eyes as Paul stood behind railing against the government surveillance law.\n\nThe Washington Post noted that Graham\u2019s announcement speech made vague reference to some of the anti-Patriot Act members of Congress, saying some in Washington \u201chave substituted wishful thinking for sound national security strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraham never mentioned Paul by name,\u201d the Post said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to. The two have been openly fighting for months.\u201d\n\nReach Schuyler Kropf at 937-5551", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "As ninth into the GOP pool, Lindsey Graham got little splash from announcement, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Iowa caucus,Lindsey Graham,New Hampshire primary", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Lindsey Graham\u2019s entrance last week into the Republican scrum for the White House was greeted by enthusiastic chants of \u201cU-S-A, U-S-A\u201d from the hometown crowd who turned out for his announcement in Central.", "title": "As ninth into the GOP pool, Lindsey Graham got little splash from announcement", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150606/150609590/as-ninth-into-the-gop-pool-lindsey-graham-got-little-splash-from-announcement", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1603/150609590/AR/0/AR-150609590.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1603/150609590/AR/0/AR-150609590.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lindsey Graham\u2019s entrance last week into the Republican scrum for the White House was greeted by enthusiastic chants of \u201cU-S-A, U-S-A\u201d from the hometown crowd who turned out for his announcement in Central.", "title": "As ninth into the GOP pool, Lindsey Graham got little splash from announcement", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150606/PC1603/150609590/AR/0/AR-150609590.jpg?201506062006", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150609590}}, "keywords": "As ninth into the GOP pool, Lindsey Graham got little splash from announcement , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Iowa caucus,Lindsey Graham,New Hampshire primary", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T19:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-06T20:06:00Z", "author": "Schuyler Kropf"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Lindsey Graham\u2019s entrance last week into the Republican scrum for the White House was greeted by enthusiastic chants of \u201cU-S-A, U-S-A\u201d from the hometown crowd who turned out for his announcement in Central."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29a3\"", "article_summary": "The rest of the presumed GOP candidates are expected to declare by the end of July.\nSen.
