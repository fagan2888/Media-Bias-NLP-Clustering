That compares with 71 percent disapproval of the Republicans in Congress, with six in 10 calling their struggle to select a new House speaker a sign of dysfunction within the GOP caucus. Likely boosted by improving economic sentiment, Obama\u2019s job approval rating has gained 6 percentage points since July to 51 percent, a level he hasn\u2019t seen since May 2013. That\u2019s up 11 points from his career low a year ago.\n\nAll of the usual caveats apply, of course. This is just one poll, and most of the tracking surveys show the president\u2019s support a few points lower \u2013 Gallup, for example, put Obama\u2019s approval at 47% in today\u2019s report.\n\nStill, given the broader political conditions, the fact that the president has climbed above 50% in any major, independent poll is heartening news at the White House. It\u2019s also likely a surprise to congressional Republicans, who\u2019ve spent the last few months insisting \u201cthe American people\u201d are furious with Obama over the Iran nuclear deal, the Affordable Care Act, Syria, immigration, and a variety of other perceived missteps.\n\nIf the Washington Post /ABC News poll is accurate, it would appear GOP assumptions are wildly out of step with mainstream American attitudes.\n\nIndeed, while Democrats in Congress aren\u2019t winning any popularity contests \u2013 their approval rating is just 35% nationwide \u2013 it\u2019s congressional Republicans that are really unpopular. Today\u2019s results put congressional Republicans approval at a woeful 24%.\n\nIn other words, the GOP lawmakers going after the president are less than half as popular as the guy they\u2019re condemning.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Don't just look at 2016 polls; the popularity of the current president will have an effect on who wins next year.
