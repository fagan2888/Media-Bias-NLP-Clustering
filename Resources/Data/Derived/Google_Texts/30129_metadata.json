That standard is known as medical loss ratio, or MLR.\n\nHealth plans are required, under the federal Affordable Care Act, to account for how they spend the premium dollars they collect by reporting composite data for the previous three years.\n\nInsurers that don\u2019t meet the minimum standards are required to issue rebates to their members. In 2013, according to the most recent data available on the website of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, insurers nationwide returned $332 million to their members. In New York, five insurers returned $12.1 million to their individual, small group and large group members that year.\n\nFor individual, direct-pay plans and for small-group plans, health plans are required to spend 82 percent of premium revenues on their customers\u2019 medical benefits. For large group plans, the minimum MLR under federal guidelines is 85 percent.\n\nThe three local insurers reported overall medical loss ratios across all of their lines of business for 2012, 2013 and 2014 combined.\n\nFor Excellus, the MLR was 91.5 percent. In other words, Univera\u2019s parent over the three years spent $10.4 billion on medical benefits on its members, $823 million more than required over that period under the federal standard.\n\n\u201cOur members get high value health coverage with us,\u201d Excellus CEO Christopher Booth said in a statement.\n\nHealthNow\u2019s MLR was 89.5 percent between 2012 and 2014. Over that time, the insurer spent $3.8 billion on medical benefits, or $214 million more than required.\n\n\u201cWith 90 cents of every dollar being spent on medical benefits, health insurance costs are directly correlated to the costs of health care our members receive,\u201d Kyle Rogers, a HealthNow spokesman, said in an email.\n\nAnd Independent Health reported a medical loss ratio of 88.7 percent over the three years.\n\n\u201cOur MLR demonstrates Independent Health\u2019s efforts to operate efficiently, collaborate effectively with our provider partners, and engage our members in their health through innovative products and benefits, such as our nutrition benefit,\u201d Frank Sava, an Independent Health spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nemail: swatson@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "The region\u2019s three main health insurance companies are exceeding government standards for how much of their premium revenue must be spent on medical benefits for their members.HealthNow New York, the Buffalo-based parent of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York; Independent Healt...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "The region\u2019s three main health insurance companies are exceeding government standards for how much of their premium revenue must be spent on medical benefits for their members.HealthNow New York, the Buffalo-based parent of BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York; Independent Healt... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Local health insurers surpass federal standards on medical spending  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/business/local-health-insurers-surpass-federal-standards-on-medical-spending-20150814", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb817\"", "article_summary": "For individual, direct-pay plans and for small-group plans, health plans are required to spend 82 percent of premium revenues on their customers\u2019 medical benefits.\nAnd Independent Health reported a medical loss ratio of 88.7 percent over the three years.\nThe region\u2019s three main health insurance companies are exceeding government standards for how much of their premium revenue must be spent on medical benefits for their members.\nHealth plans are required, under the federal Affordable Care Act, to account for how they spend the premium dollars they collect by reporting composite data for the previous three years.\nOver that time, the insurer spent $3.8 billion on medical benefits, or $214 million more than required."}
