(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) October 5, 2014.\n\nThousands turned out to enjoy the 57th annual St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot, Chicken Dinner & Fall Festival at St. Joseph Hill Catholic Church in Sellersburg on Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a homecoming for a lot of people,\u201d said event co-chair Margaret Popp Tschaenn. \u201cIt\u2019s like a family tradition.\u201d\n\nTschaenn and her sister, Darlene Popp Coleman, have co-chaired the festival \u2013 the church\u2019s biggest fundraiser each year - for 19 years. \u201cWith beautiful weather like this, we\u2019re hoping this will be our best year ever,\u201d Tschaenn said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say which part of the event brings in the most money,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery part of the festival is popular.\u201d\n\nGuests could feast on fried chicken, green beans, dumplings, and a plethora of desserts. The meal draws big crowds every year, with around 2,500 meals served last year.\n\nVolunteers started cooking at 5 a.m. to prepare for the onslaught of visitors starting at 11 a.m. \u201cWe bought 46 cases of chicken,\u201d said Dave Yost, chief chicken fryer for the event. \u201cEvery year it\u2019s a little bit more.\u201d\n\nYost and his team set up a series of deep fryers in an outbuilding, cooking chicken assembly line style, while just outside another team tended to large vats of green beans. In the church\u2019s kitchen, five vats of dumplings were kept at a constant simmer and stirred with large paddles, all to sate the hungry crowds.\n\nMolly Harrington said she comes every year. \u201cI\u2019ve already won a cake and now we\u2019re going to eat dinner,\u201d she said. \u201cWe come every year and we love it. The dumplings are to die for.\u201d\n\nBooths offered a number of wheels of chance and other carnival-style games, along with the quilt booth where a number of quilts handcrafted by parishioners throughout the year were raffled off.\n\nBehind the church, shooters lined up 16 at a time and at $2 a shot to participate in the turkey shoot. Participants shoot for turkeys, rather than at them, with the winner of each round receiving their choice of a frozen bird or $13 grocery gift card.\n\nFelix Hensley came from New Washington to participate in the turkey shoot. \u201cIt\u2019s a good cause,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about winning. It\u2019s just about community.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1xescyw", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "\u201cWe bought 46 cases of chicken,\u201d said Dave Yost, chief chicken fryer for the event.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "\u201cWe bought 46 cases of chicken,\u201d said Dave Yost, chief chicken fryer for the event.", "title": "Dumplings a hit at St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/10/05/dumplings-hit-st-joe-hill-turkey-shoot/16772659/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cWe bought 46 cases of chicken,\u201d said Dave Yost, chief chicken fryer for the event.", "title": "Dumplings a hit at St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/717327c669493885c53bd006239d810c9ef4f9fa/c=648-0-3240-2592&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Joseph Hillstrom", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Joseph Hillstrom", "title": "Dumplings a hit at St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5262a3fca508bc49e1b0aefb92dc445db245ac41/c=972-0-2916-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44718bc186ef2bf2a2929512c8afc7138da5ab6b/c=648-0-3240-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2cccc4549406d22ebdb5e57555edbf9d3eb72268/c=216-0-3672-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5e870a9c0be7654263322588184ff7a5ed38936/c=0-202-3888-2389&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-10-05T16:27:27-04:00", "shorthed": "St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot a hit", "articleid": 16772659, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6866234a81c7e41f9230adf9968a10eaba1accf/c=0-202-3888-2389/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04bd5dcda406da1f9b1fd3b25a8ab8835a554fe7/c=1215-0-2673-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/10/05/3of9.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Thousands turned out to enjoy the 57th annual St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot, Chicken Dinner & Fall Festival at St. Joseph Hill Catholic Church in Sellersburg on Sunday.\nVolunteers Wayne Bouvier, Mary Wright and JoAnna Klein tend a vat of dumplings during the 57th annual St. Joe Hill Turkey Shoot, Chicken Dinner & Fall Festival at St. Joseph Hill Catholic Church in Sellersburg.\nFelix Hensley came from New Washington to participate in the turkey shoot.\nBehind the church, shooters lined up 16 at a time and at $2 a shot to participate in the turkey shoot.\n\u201cEvery part of the festival is popular.\u201dGuests could feast on fried chicken, green beans, dumplings, and a plethora of desserts."}
