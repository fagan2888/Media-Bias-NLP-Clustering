At the first sign of trouble, he\u2019ll pack up his gunny sack and head for base camp, running into the latrine to hide.\n\nOr so I conclude from the budget he released this week. Remember how last year Ryan was reinventing himself as the true friend of \u201cthe poors,\u201d as we ironically say in liberal blogland? Aside from being stunned that all those skewed polls turned out to be exactly on the money and he and Mitt Romney lost, he was also, we were told, chagrined and maddened that he came away from the 2012 campaign with a reputation as a pitiless Randian with a hole where his heart used to be.\n\nSo he set out last year to prove us all wrong. He hired a disaffected ex-Democratic wonk as his top social-policy guy. He was getting the great press you\u2019d expect out of Politico, which loves Republicans Who Confound Liberals (\u201cThe new Paul Ryan,\u201d last December 10; \u201cIs Paul Ryan the GOP\u2019s Next Jack Kemp?\u201d, December 12; someone was asleep at the wheel on December 11 I guess). America would soon see the revealed truth: Government keeps poor people poor, bleeds them of the pluck and spunk needed to liberate oneself from the dependent-American community. St. Paul would save them.\n\nThen came the CPAC conference a month ago, and he tells one little story, about the kid who didn\u2019t want a free lunch, just a normal brown bag like the other kids, and he gets it wrong, and the real and true version of the story doesn\u2019t remotely prove the point he wants it to prove in his retelling, and he gets hammered over it for days, and boom, he throws in the poverty towel. To blazes with those poors. Kicking them was pretty fun after all.\n\nI jest, of course, with my chronology. But the budget he put out this week is nothing to laugh at. Or maybe on reflection it is something to laugh at. Why in the world does it exist, and what good do he and his fellow House Republicans think it\u2019s going to do them?\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard the basic skinny, it\u2019s a budget that\u2019s very pre-new Paul Ryan, characterized by the two features that have chiefly characterized all Ryan budgets: meanness and dishonesty. Meanness starts with the $5.1 trillion in cuts to domestic discretionary spending programs over 10 years, with steep cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and\u2014\n\nNo, wait. Let\u2019s stop here and mull this food stamp cut. As you probably know, in last year\u2019s farm bill negotiations, House Republicans proposed a $40 billion cut to food stamps. By the time the House and Senate agreed to a farm bill last month, that was whittled down to $8.7 billion over 10 years. That\u2019s a small cut in percentage terms (about 1 percent). But even it takes $90 a month away from 850,000 poor families. Ryan\u2019s proposed food stamps cut? $125 billion. More than 14 times the size of the already controversial current cut. As St. Paul sayeth, we rejoice in our sufferings.\n\nBeyond that it\u2019s the usual Dickensian gruel. Federal programs block-granted, which always means far less money and almost always means that governors can spend the money on some more rewarding and more agreeably ZIP-coded constituency if they want to. Huge education cuts. Big cuts to Pell Grants. Oh, and here\u2019s a nice touch\u2014college students would start being charged interest on their loans while still in college, so that now, on top of everything else, the Republican Party is getting into the usury business.\n\nNow don\u2019t think I\u2019ve forgotten the dishonesty part. Obamacare, as you might recall from the aforementioned campaign, cuts $716 billion in payments to hospitals and such. You remember\u2014Romney and Ryan pounded on Obama about that $716 billion. You\u2019re killing the oldsters, and so on.\n\nWell, Ryan\u2019s budget would repeal Obamacare. And yet, it pockets that same roughly $700 billion in Medicare cuts as savings, and, as Sahil Kapur noted for TPM, it \u201cuses the savings to meet its fiscal targets.\u201d How dandy is that? Hate Obamacare hate Obamacare hate Obamacare hate Obamacare\u2026Oh, but I\u2019ll pocket that $700 billion, Barack, thanks, great idea!\n\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned the plan\u2019s biggest political weakness, which is Ryan\u2019s return, yes, to Medicare, to quasi-privatizing it for people under 55. Democrats, until this week wholly on the defensive, have now been handed a huge sledgehammer. The 7.1 million Obamacare enrollees takes the heat off health care for the time being and allows for a topic change. And so here comes Ryan, the very day after Obamacare enrollment closed, offering that topic.\n\nWhy? Why is he re-introducing the idea of tampering with Medicare in an election year? In fact, why even release a document such as this? And why, having released it, force all your members to vote on it within the next week or so, which Ryan and Eric Cantor vow will happen? As Greg Sargent pointed out Wednesday, eight House Republicans in six different states are going to have to vote for this Medicare- and Medicaid-killing budget (old people understand that \u201cMedicaid\u201d means \u201cnursing home care\u201d).\n\nAnd, depending on how you rate these things, there are around 25 House Republicans who could conceivably lose to Democrats this November. Why force them to vote for this? Or maybe if you\u2019re John Boehner you don\u2019t force them to. You let them vote no. But then you lose! Then what a laughing stock you are! But you\u2019ll probably get 218 votes one way or another. So fine\u2014you\u2019ve forced some people in vulnerable positions to vote aye, but hey, you\u2019ve won the vote. Then what? Then nothing. Harry Reid\u2019s Senate will not even take it up. So it\u2019s all symbolism.\n\nAnd this is the symbol the GOP wants to present? The party that destroys federal education programs, Medicaid, food stamps, and (in the future) Medicare? I suppose they think it\u2019ll rev up their base. Will it really? This is the fifth Ryan budget by my count. They\u2019ve all said in essence the same thing, and they\u2019ve all gone the same place: nowhere.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Paul Ryan, Republican Party, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201404030945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Paul Ryan, Republican Party, US Politics", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Paul Ryan: Still a Total Jerk", "tags": "entity:person/paul_ryan,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "With the release of his bizarre budget this week, the congressman from Wisconsin proves once again that he\u2019s a wishy-washy wonk unworthy of sainthood.", "title": "Paul Ryan: Still a Total Jerk", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/03/paul-ryan-still-a-total-miser.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/03/paul-ryan-still-a-total-miser/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1396518341923.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "With the release of his bizarre budget this week, the congressman from Wisconsin proves once again that he\u2019s a wishy-washy wonk unworthy of sainthood.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Michael Tomasky", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-04-03T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/michael-tomaskyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/03/paul-ryan-still-a-total-miser", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Paul Ryan: Still a Total Jerk\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/03/paul-ryan-still-a-total-miser.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/03/paul-ryan-still-a-total-miser/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46550611.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/04/03/paul-ryan-still-a-total-miser\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-03T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Michael Tomasky\",\"tags\":[\"paul_ryan\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/michael-tomasky", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfce7\"", "article_summary": "He was getting the great press you\u2019d expect out of Politico, which loves Republicans Who Confound Liberals (\u201cThe new Paul Ryan,\u201d last December 10; \u201cIs Paul Ryan the GOP\u2019s Next Jack Kemp?\u201d, December 12; someone was asleep at the wheel on December 11 I guess).\nRemind me not to get in a foxhole with Paul Ryan.\nIn case you haven\u2019t heard the basic skinny, it\u2019s a budget that\u2019s very pre-new Paul Ryan, characterized by the two features that have chiefly characterized all Ryan budgets: meanness and dishonesty.\nThis is the fifth Ryan budget by my count.\nHate Obamacare hate Obamacare hate Obamacare hate Obamacare\u2026Oh, but I\u2019ll pocket that $700 billion, Barack, thanks, great idea!"}
