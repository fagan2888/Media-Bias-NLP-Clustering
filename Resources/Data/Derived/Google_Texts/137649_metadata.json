But perhaps one of the bigger stories has been its admission earlier this month that one-third of its players will develop long-term cognitive problems that will likely be diagnosed at \u201cnotably younger ages.\u201d The League came to that conclusion after settling a lawsuit involving over 5,000 players who claimed it hadn\u2019t disclosed the dangers of head trauma to them \u2014 all of them had gone on to develop dementia or other forms of cognitive decline.\n\nBesides cognitive decline, it\u2019s also believed that head injuries in football contributed to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degeneration of the brain that causes impulsiveness, confusion, depression, aggression, and dementia. One such player who had that was 29-year-old San Diego Chargers defensive back Paul Oliver, who shot himself in the head last September in front of his wife and two sons.\n\nHis family filed a lawsuit against the league on Monday asserting that his death was a \u201cdirect result of the injuries, depression, and emotional suffering caused by repetitive head trauma and concussions suffered as a result of playing football, not properly appreciating football\u2019s risks with respect to head trauma,\u201d and using faulty helmets, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Oct. 21, HBO will air an episode of Real Sports that digs into the subject of head trauma and CTE. The episode will feature Oliver\u2019s wife Chelsea, with interviews by Bryant Gumble.
