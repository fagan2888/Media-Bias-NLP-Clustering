Long live the king!\n\nWell, not quite. Not so fast. It\u2019s true that Bill Gross has been dethroned: He has lost his position at Pimco, the $2 trillion investment management colossus that he founded 43 years ago, jumping before the firm\u2019s new majority owners, Germany\u2019s Allianz, could usher him to the door. At his new home, Janus Capital Group, he won\u2019t be managing the hundreds of millions of dollars that he did at the helm of Pimco Total Return, whose assets peaked at $293 billion some 18 months ago.\n\nRelated: Bill Gross Plays His Own Game of Thrones\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s true that, technically at least, the title of King of the Bond Market has fallen vacant. And technically, at least, it has been inherited by Joshua Barrickman.\n\nJoshua who?\n\nBarrickman manages \u2014 oversees might be a better word \u2014 two Vanguard Group bond index funds, the Total Bond Market Index Funds, that as of the end of September had assets of about $208.95 billion. Pimco has already estimated that outflows from Pimco Total Return hit $23.5 billion in September, bringing that fund\u2019s assets below the $200 billion mark and crowning the Vanguard funds (which are managed using precisely the same strategy and whose performances tend to mirror each other) as the single largest group of bond funds out there.\n\nTrailing them by a large margin are a cluster of other Vanguard funds, including the short-term index fund; a municipal bond fund; the Templeton Global Bond fund, whose assets haven\u2019t yet broken above $100 billion; a fund from Lord Abbett; and Jeffrey Grundlach\u2019s DoubleLine Total Return fund. Gundlach\u2019s fund is among the beneficiaries of the Pimco outflows, but while it\u2019s rapidly heading towards $40 billion, it still has a long way to go before hitting the heights that Gross once reigned over.\n\nOf course, so does Gross himself.\n\nRelated: Pimco Staff \u2018Frantic and Sad\u2019 in Wake of Bill Gross Sudden Exit\n\nThe domain over which he will reign, the Janus Unconstrained Bond Fund, still less than six months old, had a mere $13 million in assets at the end of August. Gross\u2019s arrival attracted a surge of inflows from investors willing to bet that the bond market wizard hadn\u2019t lost his touch. They are focusing more on his long-term track record (beating the bond market index by more than a full percentage point over the course of his career, a phenomenal achievement) than on the dismal recent returns generated by Pimco Total Return.\n\nSo, should you order your velvet robes and prepare for Joshua Barrickman\u2019s coronation as the new king of the bond market?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be quite so hasty.\n\nEven if Vanguard were the kind of investment firm that liked to turn its investment managers into superstars (and it isn\u2019t; quite the contrary), Barrickman\u2019s realm isn\u2019t one in which bond market monarchs are made. The funds that he runs are index funds, after all, not actively managed portfolios. Barrickman\u2019s job is to ensure that the funds are doing what they are supposed to do \u2014 that the computers are creating the portfolio that most closely mirrors the Barclays US Aggregate bond fund index.\n\n\u201cHe is the antithesis of Bill Gross,\u201d says Daniel Wiener, CEO of Adviser Investments, who tracks Vanguard\u2019s funds closely. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t choose anything. Sure, it requires expertise to track an index as broad as this, but in terms of understanding the bond market? No, that isn\u2019t needed. You could probably get away without knowing how to spell (Federal Reserve Chair) Janet Yellen\u2019s last name.\u201d\n\nSo, while the Vanguard funds may dominate the landscape, the throne, for now, is vacant. And we could be about to witness a battle for its possession that would do justice to the pen of George R.R. Martin.\n\nWhat does it take to be a bond market king? Well, for starters, unlike Vanguard\u2019s Barrickman, contenders should be active managers, with a deep knowledge and understanding of how the fixed income world works. While at Pimco in Gross\u2019s era, sheer market clout and active management converged, the bond market is more akin to the medieval monarchies of old \u2014 or the Versailles ruled over by Louis XIV, or Catherine the Great\u2019s Russia \u2014 than it is a bloodless constitutional monarchy of today that confines its ruler to signing papers drafted by politicians.\n\n\u201cSure, you want the king to have assets; to carry a big stick; but more than that you want him to have performance and to be willing to be iconoclastic \u2014 not to bow to the crowd and agree with the market,\u201d argues Wiener, who has seen plenty of managers, active and passive, come and go. \u201cIf anything, you want them to have convictions.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pimco Moving Away from Bill Gross Model, CEO Says\n\nIn fact, Wiener makes a case for Gross merely having abandoned his throne temporarily. \u201cHis number one goal right now is to go and prove to the world that he still has what it takes to kill it,\u201d he says.\n\nThere\u2019s at least a decent chance that he could fight his way back to the top of the heap. Already, while some Pimco assets are fleeing to established managers, some are finding their way to Janus. And Gross doesn\u2019t need to have hundreds of billions of dollars. He may fare better with a few hundred million in assets, at least while he re-establishes his track record.\n\nHistory has proved, over and over again, that as a fund\u2019s assets grow, its performance suffers. Indeed, a recent study devoted to the performance of Bill Gross at Pimco Total Return and rival Jeffrey Grundlach at DoubleLine Total Return Bond fund found that every time assets doubled, the amount of alpha \u2014 or performance that can be traced to manager skill rather than to the market, or a rising tide lifting all boats \u2014 fell by 10 percent to 20 percent.\n\nGross still has his high public profile, even though it has been tarnished by his equally public antics and eccentric behavior, which included him comparing himself to both pop singer Justin Bieber and winning racehorse Secretariat. His biggest rival for the throne is likely to be Gundlach, whose own background is far from free of controversy. Both have strong views on the bond markets, and big platforms; both have outsize personalities. Both have a lot to prove.\n\nThe battle for the crown may now begin.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The king is dead.
