Until now, Obama has had very little need of this authority; this is only the third of his entire presidency. For the first six years of his time in the White House, Democrats controlled the Senate, and Harry Reid made sure that Republican initiatives never reached his desk by blocking them from floor votes, even after the GOP won control of the House in 2010 and kept it in 2012.\n\nThat changed last November, when Democrats suffered their second consecutive midterm blowout and lost control of the Senate. Reid lost the ability to control the floor, and with that most of his ability to stop the Republican legislative agenda from proceeding \u2013 at least that without some Democratic support.\n\nRelated: GOP 2016 Hopefuls Throw Darts at Obama, Bombs at ISIS\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been frustrated in four attempts to pass the funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security from the House that cuts off spending for Obama\u2019s announced executive actions on immigration. Reid managed to unify his minority Democratic caucus well enough to sustain the filibuster on the bill, and now McConnell has to work with Speaker John Boehner on a Plan B to fight Obama\u2019s actions \u2013 even while a federal court blocks them for executive overreach.\n\nThat makes the veto Obama issued even more instructive. Obama killed a bill that would have forced the authorization of the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to bring crude from Alberta tar sands in Canada to refiners on the Gulf coast. The project would create 40,000 jobs in construction and pipefitting over the two years it would take to finish it.\n\nFor that reason, unions strongly backed the Keystone XL project, while environmentalists bitterly opposed it. Both of those are important constituencies for the Democratic Party, and the tension was reflected in the votes on the bill in both chambers. Twenty-nine House Democrats joined all but one of the House Republicans in passing the bill 270-152, while nine Senate Democrats joined all 53 GOP Senators for a 62-36 passage in the upper chamber.\n\nRelated: These 9 Democrats Went Out on a Limb for Keystone\n\nThe bipartisan nature of the vote represented, and perhaps underrepresented, the broad approval of Keystone XL among the American electorate. A CNN poll in January showed that 57 percent of Americans wanted it approved, while only 28 percent opposed it. The bill had majority or double-digit plurality support in almost every demographic \u2013 age, region, gender, income, education. Only among Democrats and self-described liberals did opposition exceed support, and in those cases only by single digits.\n\nWith this level of general agreement on a significant issue, one might think that a president who wants to find ways to \u201cwork together\u201d with Republicans on bipartisan initiatives, as Obama repeatedly promised, would have signed the Keystone XL bill. That, however, assumes that Obama wants to \u201cwork together,\u201d and actually supports moderate and bipartisan initiatives. This veto shows clearly that Obama, as Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal said in his response to Obama\u2019s action, is \u201ca pawn of the radical Left.\u201d\n\nObama has talked about generating jobs in America. The Keystone XL project would create tens of thousands of direct and indirect good paying jobs for the duration of its construction phase, and would continue to support job creation in Louisiana, a point Jindal emphasized in his response as well. \"The President is shirking his responsibility to deliver good paying jobs to American workers,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are ready to work; they just need the Obama administration to get out of the way.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Vetoes Keystone Pipeline, Leaving It in Limbo\n\nThe Obama administration has been dismissive of this claim, pointing out that the jobs would be temporary. That\u2019s true \u2013 but the mythical \u201cshovel-ready jobs\u201d from Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus plan were just as temporary, if not more so, being mostly generated in public-infrastructure maintenance that only lasted a few months to a year. Plus, this project did not require massive government spending, as the companies that benefit from the pipeline would have funding most of the effort. It would cost Obama almost nothing to create those jobs other than the ink it took to affix his signature to the legislation.\n\nThe statement that Obama issued with his veto fumbled through excuses and hypocrisy while failing to give any good reason for blocking the project. He accused Congress of \u201cattempt[ing] to circumvent longstanding and proven processes\u201d for approving cross-border pipelines. Congress intervened, though, because Obama sat on the project for the entire six years of his presidency rather than allow those processes to come to a conclusion.\n\nObama insisted that he wants to wait for the existing process, through the State Department, to be complete before making a decision on Keystone. A decision now \u201ccuts short through consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest,\u201d Obama states, as though six years isn\u2019t sufficient time to consider anything.\n\nWe fought and defeated Nazi Germany and imperial Japan simultaneously in less than four years. In this case, State issued a finding over a year ago that the pipeline project would be neutral on climate change and would not have a serious impact on the environment. That was actually the second time in two years the State Department reached that conclusion. Congress didn\u2019t attempt to circumvent the process; they want Obama to quit stalling.\n\nRelated: U.S. Construction Spending Rises, but Misses Expectations\n\nThe president also stated that he was at the mercy of \u201cestablished executive branch procedures,\u201d a claim that deserves widespread derision. As president, those executive branch procedures serve his office to facilitate his leadership and decision-making. Obama has wide latitude to amend those processes \u2013 and in this case, an opening provided by Congress to dispense with them.\n\nMore to the point, though, this is the same president who announced three months ago that he\u2019d rewrite the law unilaterally to expand amnesty to millions of people who emigrated illegally to the US. It\u2019s his administration that filed a request for a stay after a federal judge reminded him that it takes Congress to change the law, not a president on his own. In other contexts, Obama\u2019s sudden modesty and adherence to \u201cexecutive branch processes\u201d might have been amusing. In this refutation of a bipartisan consensus on a common-sense initiative, it insults the intelligence of all Americans.\n\nCongress has the option of overriding the veto, but that will be a tall order. Not enough Democrats crossed the aisle in either chamber\u2019s floor votes to sustain a veto override on a second round. The veto does do voters one favor, though. It exposes Obama for the extremist he always has been, one who can no longer hide behind the skirts of Harry Reid.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "To no one\u2019s surprise, President Barack Obama issued a veto this week.", "title": "Keystone XL Veto Demonstrates Obama\u2019s Hypocrisy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/02/25/Keystone-XL-Veto-Demonstrates-Obama-s-Extremism-And-Hypocrisy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_Obama_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/02/25/Keystone-XL-Veto-Demonstrates-Obama-s-Extremism-And-Hypocrisy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06072013_Obama_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "To no one\u2019s surprise, President Barack Obama issued a veto this week.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf008\"", "article_summary": "For that reason, unions strongly backed the Keystone XL project, while environmentalists bitterly opposed it.\nThat makes the veto Obama issued even more instructive.\nRelated: These 9 Democrats Went Out on a Limb for KeystoneThe bipartisan nature of the vote represented, and perhaps underrepresented, the broad approval of Keystone XL among the American electorate.\nObama killed a bill that would have forced the authorization of the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to bring crude from Alberta tar sands in Canada to refiners on the Gulf coast.\nNot enough Democrats crossed the aisle in either chamber\u2019s floor votes to sustain a veto override on a second round."}
