Different groups of bicyclists are more likely to interact, Craft said, when they\u2019re not wearing racing uniforms and workout gear.\n\n\u201cPeople who love mountain bikes and only talk about mountain bikes can talk to the cruisers,\u201d Craft said. \u201cAnd I think less Lycra at a biking event is probably good for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe event brings together local government officials and the biking community to raise $75,000 this year for a more bike-friendly Denver. Beer and souvenir proceeds benefited BikeDenver, a nonprofit organization that advocates bicycle safety.\n\nThe group helped plan the protected bike lane that Denver City Council and Public Works recently installed on 15th Street, said Eliza Lanman, one of 13 BikeDenver board members. The lane opened Aug. 29.\n\nDenver City Councilman Albus Brooks led the parade down East 17th Avenue on Saturday, pedaling \u201cthe bike with beats,\u201d a disco-blaring road bike courtesy of BikeDenver.\n\nMary Beth Susman, president of the council, rode her own bicycle alongside him. Like Brooks, she wore city and county of Denver bike gear. The two were involved in approving the 15th Street Bikeway and said a similar project is planned for 19th and 20th streets from Lincoln to Park Avenue.\n\nAlison Noon: 303-954-1223, anoon@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Tour de Fat attracts bananas, council members for beer, bikes", "title": "Denver Tour de Fat attracts bananas, council members for beer, bikes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/07/denver-tour-de-fat-attracts-bananas-council-members-for-beer-bikes/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__tour-de-fat-1p1.jpg", "height": 408}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130907__tour-de-fat-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-07T15:45:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T11:38:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda58a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTwenty-two years ago, we put bicycles on the Fat Tire labels because we all love bikes,\u201d Craft said.\nKnee-high striped socks were popular with more than 13,000 people who attended New Belgium Brewing\u2019s Tour de Fat at City Park on Saturday.\nLike Brooks, she wore city and county of Denver bike gear.\nThe group helped plan the protected bike lane that Denver City Council and Public Works recently installed on 15th Street, said Eliza Lanman, one of 13 BikeDenver board members.\nThe annual bicycle parade and beer festival, named for the brewery\u2019s signature beer, Fat Tire, has grown each of its six years in Denver, according to Mike Craft, a director for nonprofit relations at New Belgium."}
