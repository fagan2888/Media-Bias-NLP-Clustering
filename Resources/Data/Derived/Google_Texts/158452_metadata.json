Researchers looked at patients who were readmitted to the same hospital within 30 days of discharge. They classified a readmission as \"unplanned\" when the hospital coded it as an urgent admission.\n\nThe overall unplanned readmission rate was 5.2 percent, according to the study. The most common reasons for readmissions were cardiovascular and pulmonary diagnoses and 10.4 percent of all readmissions were due to complications.\n\nHowever, the strongest predictor of readmission was a high number of previous emergency department visits. Indeed, the odds ratio for patients with at least four ED visits in the past six months was 4.65, according to the study. Other predictors of a higher risk for readmission included discharge on Friday (odds ratio, 1.05) and a long length of stay (odds ratio, 1.19).\n\nThe findings indicate that hospitals can reduce readmissions by targeting the patient groups at risk, researchers said, such as patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, and preventing complications. In addition, because multiple ED visits and longer patient stays are linked to higher readmission rates, clinicians must work with caregivers and primary care physicians to coordinate a smoother transition from hospital to home, especially for patients discharged on Friday. Previous research also calls for post-discharge monitoring to ensure that patients follow the hospital's detailed care plan, such as taking medications correctly and keeping follow-up appointments.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n30-day readmission measure fails to account for changing risk factors\n\nEarly follow-up reduces readmissions of high-risk patients\n\nHospitals that reduce readmissions still hit with penalties\n\nReadmissions lead to $41.3B in additional hospital costs\n\nHospitals can predict high-risk surgical patients, reduce readmissions\n\n4 ways hospitals can prevent readmissions\n\nMedicare slaps two-thirds of US hospitals with readmission penalties\n\n3 ways to make readmission policies fair for hospitals\n\nBeth Israel Deaconess lowers readmissions with post-discharge program", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u200bPatients with chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, those discharged on Fridays, those who have long lengths of stay, and those with a high number of previous emergency department visits are at a greater risk for unplanned and expensive\u00a0hospital readmissions, new research shows.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "\u200bPatients with chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, those discharged on Fridays, those who have long lengths of stay, and those with a high number of previous emergency department visits are at a greater risk for unplanned and expensive\u00a0hospital readmissions, new research shows.", "title": "5 factors that indicate patients are at risk for unplanned readmissions", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-factors-indicate-patients-are-risk-unplanned-readmissions/2015-08-19", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,Care Delivery,Discharge Planning,emergency room super-users,hospital readmissions,length of stay,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,super-users", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Patients with chronic cardiovascular and pulmonary disease are at a greater risk for unplanned and expensive hospital readmissions, new research shows.\nThe findings indicate that hospitals can reduce readmissions by targeting the patient groups at risk, researchers said, such as patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, and preventing complications.\nThe overall unplanned readmission rate was 5.2 percent, according to the study.\nThe most common reasons for readmissions were cardiovascular and pulmonary diagnoses and 10.4 percent of all readmissions were due to complications.\nOther predictors of a higher risk for readmission included discharge on Friday (odds ratio, 1.05) and a long length of stay (odds ratio, 1.19)."}
