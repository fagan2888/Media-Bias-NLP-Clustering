A country of free men has been transformed into an authoritarian state on its road to totalitarianism as the final denouement unfolds under their policies. The final connecting dots of from whence we came, where we are today, and the inevitable destination of societal and economic collapse of empire as has been seen throughout history and Austrian economics. It's been an EXTREMELY interesting journey, one which has been full of opportunities and heartbreaks. I have witnessed much of it in my 58 years. At the time of many events, I did not understand the significance of them. Now, I believe I do. This is not a story of doom and gloom. It is the story of man, human behavior and history repeating.\n\nIn the Rise and Fall of empires and societies such as ours, it is always darkest before the dawn. We are in the late evening (9pm) heading towards midnight in my opinion. Soon the destruction will come to an end with a bang, and spring can emerge as the global economic system and societies are rebuilt from the ashes. It has always been so throughout history. This time will be no different. When people ask you what's wrong with the world and you tell them and they stare back at you with an empty look, you can print this series out and hand it to them and they can read it in a hour.\n\nIn Part I of this series we covered the transformation of the monetary system from sound reserve backed constitutionally mandated currency system to what now has become completely unsound Fiat currency and credit system. Money has changed from a system for storing wealth, purchasing power and ones labor for the future to a confiscation scheme run for the benefit of Banksters and socialist progressive government. Do not miss this as UNSOUND money and Reserveless banking is the master thread and foundation of all the chaos unfolding in the world today.\n\nIn PART II of this series we thoroughly covered how the ACCOUNTABLE, LOCALLY controlled education systems have been high jacked and transformed into FEDERALLY CONTROLLED, UNACCOUNTABLE, public school MONOPOLIES designed to create sheeple and Useful Idiots ripe for exploitation. The Locally controlled school systems that created the most prosperous country in the history of man are now nothing more than PROGRESSIVE SOCIALIST indoctrination centers designed to mentally cripple the futures of our children. It is now an insidious system to create morally and fiscally insolvent citizens, bereft of histories lessons, contemptuous of what created our exceptional country and its burgeoning middle classes, unable to produce more than they consume. They do not know how to live prudent and productive lives and DO NOT have the BASIC knowledge needed to build a prosperous and independent life.\n\nIn Part III of this series, we covered the impoverishment of the masses and how they have been turned from free men into debt and tax slaves through the scheme known as Fiat currency and credit creation and creeping centralized government. We learned how the value of their wages has been reduced and debased by the very people in whom they have placed their trust: the government and banking/financial systems. In reality, the powers that be have created a land of serfs in the developed world. Only serfs had it better as they only gave 25% of their incomes to their masters and dealt in coin based sound money. In history, one man's taking of the fruits of another man's labor was called SLAVERY. Now, in the land of George Orwell we have become, it is called FAIRNESS. Real money is basically EXTINCT in today's world, except for gold and silver, killed by the elites who control the world today. All three previous parts of this series are critical foundations to this edition: DON'T MISS THEM.\n\nNow onto today's missive:\n\nWhile government has grown, so has its CONTROL over and destruction of the PRIVATE sector, and FREE ENTERPRISE! Regulating personal freedom, free market capitalism and opportunity away from the private sector and entrepreneurs to their crony capitalist partners in crime. This is the imposition of the socialist fascist state the US has BECOME! The EU, Japan and UK are WORSE.\n\nSmall business is where most if not all job creation comes from. It is entrepreneurs with better ideas entering the economy in the quest of the holy grail of providing MORE GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC FOR LESS MONEY. It is the ultimate PUBLIC service as it lets people get MORE FOR THEIR MONEY and thus gives their families a better standard of living. In the Something for Nothing Society, corrupt public officials and crony capitalists stand against this process. They want to take the fruits of the industrious and transfer it to themselves as entitlements and to their crony supporters as regulated demand to themselves. Just another way to KILL their emerging new COMPETITORS, they raise the price of entry into business for them. Look at this disparity of the costs of the regulatory state by enterprise size:\n\nPENALIZED for creating a business and new jobs, these numbers are from 2008 so the regulatory freight train since that time has added considerably to this disparity and crime against the private sector which is where wealth and incomes come from. These last two illustrations are from a working paper called 10,000 Commandments by the American Enterprise Institute, and are the picture of loss of PERSONAL and BUSINESS freedoms. It represents CAPITALISM, entrepreneurism, competition, productivity and innovation PROHIBITED by LAW. It is the imposition of SLAVERY of those that produce by those who DO NOT! It is also central government tyranny, crony capitalism, less goods and services for more money, and economic central planning being IMPOSED BY LAW! What you see here is but the tip of a regulatory ICEBERG. Icebergs sink things: in this case it is the US and European economies. Progressive socialists have become totalitarians in the past and this is one way they do it.\n\n\"Like many of the challenges we're facing, the tipping point we're approaching is the result of a liberal progressive mindset that seeks a larger, more active government and lets bureaucrats decide what's best for everyone instead of allowing citizens to govern themselves. Its response to every social problem is more government, more bureaucracy and more taxpayer money.\" - Rep Paul Ryan\n\nThis is reported by NO ONE in the main stream media and few outside it, as it is a SILENT KILLER working in the shadows of Brussels and Washington DC. It is SEIZING and hammering away at your freedoms, cementing their interests into place above yours and passing laws to attempt to stop future change. Can you imagine a world where unsuccessful policies are NEVER REFORMED or REPEALED? This is IT!\n\n\"If you have ten thousand regulations you destroy all respect for the law.\" - Winston Churchill \"Beware the greedy hand of government, thrusting itself into every corner and crevice of industry.\" - Thomas Paine\n\nThose regulations number in the millions. We are expected to know and comply with them all. Not knowing them is no excuse. Men's rea, has been SUSPENDED (men's rea is the idea that you have to have the knowledge and intent to violate the law, if you did not you were not guilty). Now, we are expected to know and comply with millions of words of regulatory and legal gibberish, indecipherable to the common man. Everyone's behavior and endeavors must comply with the thoughts of a bureaucrat who has no idea of the realities of business, nor the problems or situations they are trying to regulate. This was done to you by your elected representatives in Washington DC and Brussels. They turned every one of us into habitual criminals OVERNIGHT, just waiting to be picked up, or challenge them PUBLICLY. Then, they will roll out the law and TAKE YOU and YOUR family down for challenging their POWER OVER YOU and your behavior. FREEDOM DENIED!\n\n\"Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force, like fire it is a dangerous servant, and a fearful master.\" - George Washington\n\nA totalitarian state has been put in place; you just haven't been notified yet. You are subject to ARREST if you do not COMPLY to rules which DO NOT WORK in REAL LIFE. Real life problems will not yield to faraway and fairytale solutions. They think themselves GODS but are imbeciles of hubris. Mostly PROBLEMS must be solved by those directly confronted with them, think doctor/patient relationships. Should that between patient and their doctors be handled by a RULE BOOK? Obamacare, Medicaid and increasingly Medicare are RULE BOOK medicine. Their explanation for this behavior: you have no knowledge of the issues you are bring confronted with and they are doing this to save and protect you. Of course, the public school monopolies work to insure general stupidity.\n\nGovernment rulebooks now exist for almost EVERY activity in the PRIVATE SECTOR. The rules they have for themselves (constitution, IRS, Immigration, NSA, etc.) are ROUTINELY IGNORED, with no penalty to themselves for their CRIMES against the rule of law or the public at large.\n\n\"The two enemies of the people are criminals and Government, so let us tie the second down with the chains of the constitution so the second will not become the legalized version of the first.\" - Thomas Jefferson\n\nWashington DC regularly ignores and works to undo the supreme laws of the land, and insists we comply with laws and regulations which are blatantly UNCONSTITUTIONAL. Progressive socialists and their useful idiot supporters call the constitution a LIVING document subject to endless reinterpretation. No! It is not. Only weasel word lawyers and \"would be\" MONARCHS and RULERS think this. They are working to impose this on the something for nothing societies and useful idiots. We are in a constant constitutional crisis. Our Constitution is being completely eviscerated on a daily basis by the powers that be in Washington DC (District of Corruption). How many people really understand that FEDERAL EMPLOYEES are not subject to being FIRED? Do you think they can be held accountable for their actions if they can't be fired? Once again: NEVER REPORTED. This is the destruction of private sector opportunities, common sense solutions, and the middle class. None of this is new. Wise men and women have written about it for centuries. It happens over and over again throughout HISTORY. It is the decline, destruction and demise of EMPIRES! They kill what made them great.\n\nThe last time TAXES and REGULATIONS were reduced was the presidency of Ronald Reagan. He tore the chains of overregulation off the American economy and it BOOMED as you shall see later in this missive. Take a look...\n\nRonald Reagan cut the regulatory chains on the private sector by ONE THIRD, and people reacted accordingly. They went to work because it PAID to do so. They innovated, started small businesses, hired people and the economy BOOMED after a DECADE of STAGFLATION. Reagan was MORNING IN AMERICA as he cut the government regulations and confiscatory taxes that were binding us. That ECONOMIC miracle can be REPEATED! Just lift the chains of overregulation and taxation off the American people! Chance of that NIL. It is why Reagan's memory and the truth of the economy at that time is VILIFIED, and misreported by progressive socialists. He stood AGAINST everything they stand FOR. The results are a testament to the different outcomes of the two approaches to societal wealth creation. Freedom and reward for hard work versus government authoritarianism and confiscatory taxation of the fruits of your labor.\n\n\"I think we have more machinery of Government than is necessary, to many parasites living on the labor of the industrious.\" - Thomas Jefferson \"The more corrupt the state the more it legislates.\" - Cicero \"We are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion: the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases, while the citizens may act only by permission; which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history, the stage of rule by brute force.\" - Ayn Rand \"It doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? Such machinery already exists.\" - Ronald Reagan\n\nTocqueville also foresaw exactly how this regulatory state would suffocate the spirit of free enterprise:\n\n\"It rarely forces one to act, but it constantly opposes itself to one's acting; it does not destroy, it prevents things from being born; it does not tyrannize, it hinders, compromises, enervates, extinguishes, dazes, and finally reduces [the] nation to being nothing more than a herd of timid and industrious animals of which the government is the shepherd.\" - Alexis de Tocqueville \"Whenever men are allowed liberty, and freedom of choice, they will make mistakes. Liberty is not a guarantee of omniscience. But neither are the mistakes of free-men a valid excuse to take away their liberty, and impose Government controls in its stead, on the ground that all wisdom and disinterestedness resides in the people who are going to do the controlling.\" - Henry Hazlitt\n\nBureaucracies have life cycles as all things do in nature and God's world. Here is an excellent illustration explaining them by Charles Hugh Smith of www.oftwominds.com. We are firmly on the bottom row depending on what state or country you reside in:\n\nThis is why the economy can't recover as State and Federal bureaucracy has grown to a point of poisoning the economic system in the US and Europe. It does not pay to start a business or hire a worker as the obstacles are just growing and growing. Take a look at this chart from the Brookings institution showing more businesses closing than beginning. It is NO COINCIDENCE that this began in 2008 when the president took office:\n\nThis is a picture of the entrepreneurism and dynamism of the US economy GRINDING to a STOP as it no longer pays to take the risk of starting a business while expectations of the future of the economy under government policies are so NEGATIVE. This is the face of a something for nothing society destroying and outlawing the incentives to produce. RUNAWAY REGULATIONS and mindless BUREAUCRACIES are now blocking the blood system of the economy, throwing EVER GROWING sand in the gears of the system. The more it grows, the more it destroys the economy going forward. That is actually its reason to exist - to take over more and more of your lives, confiscate your freedoms and opportunities and transfer it to themselves and their cronies. This is one of the BASIC REASONS Europe and AMERICA CANNOT recover. This REGULATORY STATE must be REFORMED before the economy will resume real growth. Do you really think the SOMETHING for NOTHING family is getting $14,758 dollars' worth of safety from the federal government and its regulations? Or would that money be better served in their POCKETS? This COST goes UNREPORTED by the main stream media. As the government legislates and regulates, COMPLIANCE officers will be entering our lives more and more to document and punish those that don't COMPLY. Compliance officers are now the largest job opportunity in America and Dodd Frank, the Affordable Care Act and other malevolent legislation from the president's first term will just grow and grow. It is an ever growing python squeezing the life out of America.\n\nBacking out misstated inflation and illustrating the cost of runaway government and regulation, the REAL economy has been in SECULAR DECLINE since 1971.\n\nThe NUMBERS don't LIE. Notice how Growth in REAL terms skyrocketed when REAGAN CUT TAXES and SLASHED REGULATION rolling back the Something for Nothing Society and WELFARE STATE? The economic expansion ENDED as the same time his presidency did (Bush was a socialist progressive in disguise as a conservative just as his son was and is). May Ronnie rest in peace, he was the greatest president of my lifetime in my opinion and you can see it in the numbers. Most if not all GDP since 2000 is courtesy of MISREPORTED INFLATION to FOOL the USEFUL idiots and Something for nothing society. All GDP growth is nominal (measured in fake DEPRECIATING dollars and misreported inflation) not real wealth creation. Our standards of living and economies are IN FREEFALL; the Middle class is desperate for an improving economy and the ability to GET ahead. THOSE DAYS ARE GONE courtesy of the money printers, banksters, public servants, bureaucrats and the elites which CONTROL THEM. Useful idiots will vote for any CHARLETON who promises an ability to get ahead as it SOUNDS GOOD. The same people the USEFUL idiots have PUT in CHARGE!\n\nIn closing, today we learned of the totalitarian state being cemented into place by Washington DC and Brussels (European Commission). Statehouses and individual countries in the EU have done all this and more. Putting two layers of economic and personal destruction upon their SUBJECTS. They are not your servants, you are theirs. The word \"public servant\" is an oxymoron and doublespeak. One meaning for you, another for them. It is corruption on plain display, but largely unseen until it smashes you in the face and diminishes your futures like the silent KILLER. What I have just detailed has EXPLODED in size since the Global financial crisis. As Rahm Emanual for chief of staff to the president once said:\n\n\"You never want to let a serious crisis go to waste.\" - Rahm Emanuel\n\nWell, they didn't waste it on either side of the Atlantic. Reform may be something the political class utters but makes no actions to do so. The REQUIRED road to recovery has become much FARTHER AWAY. Many MAIN STREAM leaders say this is urgent priority but their admonitions go unaddressed.\n\nThe socialists in charge today say this is to protect you as you are too stupid to protect yourself. Of course, much of that is true as almost 40% of the public has now been dumbed down and mentally disabled by design in the public school monopolies they have IMPOSED upon us. For those poor souls, the future is very bleak and, for those that can take care of themselves, slavery lies ahead as the people the useful idiots support and vote for legislate are the DUMBEST AMONG US. The developed world is increasingly being brought on a sociopathic road. It is the definition of useful idiots and something for nothing societies. As they grow, so grows the insane behavior and outcomes throughout our lives.\n\nLaws must be simple, easily understood and widely known to be complied with. We all want the rule of law versus the rule of man. The rule of man is known as dictatorship, while the rule of law is known as a constitutional republic, what was given to us by the founding fathers. The insidious nature of the imposed legal and regulatory systems is a crime against all free men. These systems are contrary to the constitution and magna carta, which enshrined the powers over government to the man on the street aka the public. This is enslavement, freedoms and private property rolling back in plain sight to a public, which does not know or has not been taught history.\n\nLaws and regulations are NEVER REPEALED or REFORMED, only left on the books to expand government power over the people and economy. I can't imagine a better way to poison our futures than not policing ourselves and throwing out what no longer works. Government is not the solution to problems, it is the cause of them. Useful idiots have been taught just the opposite and vote for it. It is another example of how the suicide of the greatest nation ever on earth is unstoppable as their legions just grow and grow, manufactured by the school systems in which we have misplaced our trust and our children.
