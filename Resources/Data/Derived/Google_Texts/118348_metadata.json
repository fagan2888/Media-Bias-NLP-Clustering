When asked what grade he would give the ACA\u2019s debut, Sandel said, \u201cAn F.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dependent upon them and every bit of involvement that I\u2019ve had with the federal government has been a disaster,\u201d Sandel told New Mexico Watchdog after the board wrapped up its recent monthly meeting. \u201cSo I\u2019m apprehensive about what the future holds for this open enrollment.\u201d\n\nIn little more a month \u2014 Nov. 15 to be exact \u2014 a 90-day open enrollment period begins for New Mexicans looking to obtain individual ACA health care policies.\n\nWhile a host of questions surround the second year of the ACA, the largest is whether the HealthCare.gov site can smoothly sign up all the new enrollees the NMHIX board hopes will respond to an upcoming multi-million dollar marketing, advertising and public relations blitz across the state.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s prudent for the board to get the most bang for the buck,\u201d said NMHIX board chairman Dr. J.R. Damron. \u201cThe bucks we\u2019re talking about (come from) taxes.\u201d\n\nNMHIX officials originally planned to ditch HealthCare.gov after the first year and funnel individuals to New Mexico\u2019s own www.bewellnm.com website, which small businesses in the state use.\n\nBut worried that IT issues wouldn\u2019t get resolved in time for the November re-enrollment period, board members voted 11-1 in July to stick with the federal site for one more year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a year under our belt,\u201d said Dr. Martin Hickey, director of the NMHIX marketing, public relations and outreach committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve not only learned from New Mexico, but we\u2019ve learned from other states.\u201d\n\nOn the positive side, 165,000 previously uninsured New Mexicans signed up for Medicaid in the past year and 34,200 signed up for individual policies.\n\nBut last year\u2019s goal was 83,000 individual policies. After the botched roll-out of healthcare.gov, NMHIX adjusted its goal to 40,000 but still fell short of expectations.\n\nEven though New Mexico is one of the poorest states in the country, the number of enrollees receiving subsidies to reduce their premiums was six points lower than the national average.\n\nTo make things worse, a statewide poll commissioned by the board showed that despite a $7 million marketing and advertising campaign to convince New Mexico enrollees to sign up, only 40 percent of respondents even knew what the state\u2019s health care exchange did.\n\nIn response, the NMHIX board has put its marketing and advertising contract up for re-bid and hired a new CEO \u2014 Amy Dowd, who comes over from Idaho where she won favorable reviews for running the Your Health Idaho exchange.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking very strategically how we\u2019re going to spend our money,\u201d Dowd told New Mexico Watchdog.\n\n\u201cWe need to work hard to get the uninsured in New Mexico insured,\u201d Damron said. \u201cThat is our key element. An emphasis will be on the Hispanic population.\u201d\n\nBut staying tied to the HealthCare.gov site means that as the feds go, so goes New Mexico.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working out the bugs and the cumbersome parts to it so I\u2019m feeling confident that it will work on Nov. 15,\u201d Hickey said.\n\nSandel, though, admits he\u2019s worried.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned that our success is being based on whether or not they\u2019ll be able to perform,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the General Accounting Office reported \u201cweaknesses remained in the security and privacy protections applied to HealthCare.gov and its supporting systems.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the load in New Mexico figures to be heavier this year. Earlier this week, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico sent out notices to 30,000 customers saying their policies were being canceled because they didn\u2019t meet the minimum requirements of Obamacare.\n\nNMHIX officials haven\u2019t disclosed what numbers they hope to reach this time around, but Damron told New Mexico Watchdog the goal is to reduce the percentage of uninsured in New Mexico from 23 percent to less than 10 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d Damron said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s a two to five-year process.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely a critical year,\u201d Sandel said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Officials at the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange are counting on the www.HealthCare.gov website working smoothly this time for Obamacare enrollees.", "title": "Obamacare in New Mexico: Take two  - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/Obamacare-Navigator.png", "updated_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:47+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/174959/obamacare-new-mexico-3/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,Amy Dowd,Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Mexico,Dr. Martin Hickey,Gabriel Parra,General Accounting Office,Jason Sandel,JR Damron,New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange,New Mexico Watchdog,NMHIX,ObamaCare,Presbyterian Healthcare Services,www.bewellnm.com,www.healthcare.gov", "published_time": "2014-10-03T08:45:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T15:23:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Officials at the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange are counting on the www.HealthCare.gov website working smoothly this time for Obamacare enrollees.", "title": "Obamacare in New Mexico: Take two  - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/Obamacare-Navigator.png"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Officials at the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange are counting on the www.HealthCare.gov website working smoothly this time for Obamacare enrollees."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd36a7\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this week, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico sent out notices to 30,000 customers saying their policies were being canceled because they didn\u2019t meet the minimum requirements of Obamacare.\nBy Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico WatchdogSANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 Officials at the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange are making a number of changes as Year Two of Obamacare rolls out, but one big element remains: individual policies will still go through the same www.HealthCare.gov website that experienced a series of embarrassing mishaps when the Affordable Care Act rolled out last winter.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a year under our belt,\u201d said Dr. Martin Hickey, director of the NMHIX marketing, public relations and outreach committee.\n\u201cWe need to work hard to get the uninsured in New Mexico insured,\u201d Damron said.\nAfter the botched roll-out of healthcare.gov, NMHIX adjusted its goal to 40,000 but still fell short of expectations."}
