Pretty much all major evangelical gatherings or religious talk shows meet this description, hosted, as they inevitably are, by sanctimonious sermonizers who can be merely antiquated and ridiculous, if in a venomous sort of way (Pat Robertson comes to mind), or outright fraudsters (recall Jim Bakker), or even just plain old hypocrites (Ted Haggard). They reliably spout odious piffle, fleece their credulous flock and get off in most un-Christian ways. But for rationalists, at least, all this usually amounts to little more than something to be laughed at and quickly forgotten. Oh, the humorous ephemera of faith!\n\nIn the United Kingdom, however, a different situation obtains, and it is no laughing matter. For the past 30 years, church attendance has been plummeting; one can almost speak of the death throes of Christianity there. But Islam is decidedly in no need of a requiem. Since 1982, at least 85 Shariah councils have dispensed their peculiar form of \u201cjustice\u201d to an unknown number of the country\u2019s almost 3 million Muslims. Islam has even begun extending its tentacles into British law enforcement. A body called the National Association of Muslim Police has worked tirelessly, says its website, to promote the hiring and promotion of Muslim officers, \u201ctackle Islamophobia and anti-Muslim hate crime,\u201d and lastly, \u201cassist with countering terrorism.\u201d In theory, the keeping of law and order should be an objective, unbiased task; exactly how adding a confessional element will help the cause of justice in the U.K. remains to be seen.\n\nBut there\u2019s more. The NAMP has, shockingly, urged British votaries of Islam to report crimes not to the police, but to another U.K. Muslim entity known as the Islamic Human Rights Commission. The IHRC, headquartered in London, professes \u201cto campaign for justice for all peoples (italics mine) regardless of their racial, confessional or political background.\u201d At the same time, it also proclaims its \u201cinspiration derives from the Qur\u2019anic injunctions that command believers to rise up in defence of the oppressed.\u201d This would somehow seem to exclude, say, oppressed apostates, for whom the Islamic canon prescribes the death penalty. And what about Hindus? Don\u2019t they fall into the reviled category of idolaters whom the Quran (2:190-193) orders Muslims to combat? Hardly \u201call peoples,\u201d then, can count on the IHRC to rush to their aid in times of need.\n\nThe IHRC has, in fact, given me the subject of this week\u2019s essay. The organization confers an \u201cIslamophobe of the Year award\u201d at a ceremony that, by my book, might better be called \u201cOscars for Rationalists.\u201d (One wonders what the prize is: a pile of bejeweled rocks with which winners are to stone themselves to death? A gilt whip for them to administer lashes to their own backs?) If the 2014 event was anything to go by, these are cringeworthy, pathetically risible affairs of doggerel commentary and clumsy \u201ctribute\u201d songs performed before an almost mournful audience.\n\nThis year the IHRC saw fit to offend not just good taste, however, but the very notion of human decency. Just a month after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, the IHRC gave the aggrieved survivors of the satirical magazine\u2019s staff their \u201cIslamophobe of the Year\u201d award for 2015. Four thousand votes were cast to determine the \u201cwinner.\u201d Even by the standards of the faith-addled, this was repugnant.\n\nIHRC Chairman Massoud Shadjareh apparently suffered a bout of aphasia as he sputtered out a justification for the selection. Try to parse this: \u201cIf you are saying that satire should be disassociated from Islamphobic attacks, then surely satire can also be disassociated from the attacks [on Hebdo].\u201d Without a hint of irony, but a little more comprehensibly, if disingenuously, Shadjareh added that \u201cThe reality is that this is a satirical thing and if people think Muslims should be on the receiving end of satire, then why cannot Muslims give it, too? The point made against Muslims regularly is that they do not have a sense of honour; they are portrayed as being dry and angry, but we have a sense of humour and we can give it back.\u201d Though he called the Paris massacre \u201cbarbaric,\u201d he also held the magazine accountable for the lethal violence erupting during the anti-cartoon protest marches in the Islamic world. The award, said the IHRC, was intended to be understood as \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing, it goes without saying, \u201csatirical\u201d about presenting an award. Anyone can do that. Nor, obviously, does Western law provide for the death penalty for Muslims or anyone else mocking popes or pastors, priests or rabbis. There was, thus, no equivalency to be drawn. Shadjareh\u2019s was little more than nah-nah-nah \u201creasoning\u201d that presumably owes much to the smarting indignities Britain\u2019s Islamic community believes it is unjustly suffering while dwelling amidst hordes of infidels on the \u201csceptred isle.\u201d Shadjareh no doubt knows full well that, if anything, non-Muslims attribute an excess of a \u201chonour\u201d to Muslims. We are only too aware of the honor killings that often take place in Muslim communities in Europe and beyond. No generalizations need be made about a Muslim sense of humor, but that the IHRC chose Charlie Hebdo for its award does demonstrate an utter failure to understand the function of satire in the West: to desacralize hallowed ideologies of control (which both Islam and Christianity are) and institutions of power, along with their representatives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The faithful expose themselves as heartless to the grief-stricken, heedless to the suffering and just mean-spirited", "title": "The big Islamophobia lie: A shameful new assault on Charlie Hebdo", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The faithful expose themselves as heartless to the grief-stricken, heedless to the suffering and just mean-spirited", "title": "The big Islamophobia lie: A shameful new assault on Charlie Hebdo", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/the_big_islamophobia_lie_a_shameful_new_assault_on_charlie_hebdo/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/charlie_hebdo3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The faithful expose themselves as heartless to the grief-stricken, heedless to the suffering and just mean-spirited", "title": "The big Islamophobia lie: A shameful new assault on Charlie Hebdo", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/charlie_hebdo3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Charlie Hebdo, Christianity, Editor's Picks, Islamophobia, Muslims, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "We are only too aware of the honor killings that often take place in Muslim communities in Europe and beyond.\nIHRC Chairman Massoud Shadjareh apparently suffered a bout of aphasia as he sputtered out a justification for the selection.\nBut for rationalists, at least, all this usually amounts to little more than something to be laughed at and quickly forgotten.\nJust a month after the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, the IHRC gave the aggrieved survivors of the satirical magazine\u2019s staff their \u201cIslamophobe of the Year\u201d award for 2015.\nFor the past 30 years, church attendance has been plummeting; one can almost speak of the death throes of Christianity there."}
