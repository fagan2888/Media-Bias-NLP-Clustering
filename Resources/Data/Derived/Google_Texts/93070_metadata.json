In a letter to Congress dated Feb. 25, 60 conservative organizations \u2014 including CPPR \u2014 voiced support for the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2014, which would block the IRS for one year from implementing new rules to define and limit political activity by \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofits. The letter lashed out at the \u201cdraconian\u201d guidelines proposed by the IRS last November, which were open for public comment until Feb. 27.\n\nThe bill passed the House last week and now heads to the Senate, where it is expected to die.\n\nThe letter echoed concerns voiced by organizations across the political spectrum that the proposed rules are overbroad and burdensome. However, unlike other organizations opposing the possible changes, many of the groups on the letter were renowned for pushing the limits of permissible political activity by 501(c)(4)s, which do not have to disclose their donors to the public.\n\nNearly a third of the 60 groups made political expenditures that they reported to the Federal Election Commission in 2012. Together, they spent more than $66 million \u2014 one-fourth of all 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d group spending reported that cycle. That\u2019s nearly double the $34 million spent by all liberal (c)(4)s combined. Even with union spending added, the total only rises to $58 million.\n\nOf course, that\u2019s looking only at FEC-reported spending. Americans for Prosperity , another group that signed the letter, has opted to spend more than $30 million so far running issue ads like this against endangered Senate Democrats in several states; they don\u2019t have to be reported unless they run very close to an election. AFP, in fact, has spent about as much as all the reported spending by super PACs, PACs, 527s and 501(c) nonprofits combined so far in 2014.\n\nCPPR hasn\u2019t reported any political spending, ever \u2014 but it has played a key role in financing the politicking of other groups. The organization, first discovered by OpenSecrets Blog in 2012 , has acted as an ATM for politically active nonprofits on the right, all in the name of social welfare.\n\nWith only a post office box in Phoenix as an address, CPPR has been the linchpin in one of the most complex networks of dark money in the country , unparalleled on the left or, for that matter, anywhere else on the right. Between 2009 and 2012, it funneled more than $182 million in grants to other organizations, with $167 million of that going to nonprofits that reported political spending on the federal level. Most of that money came to CPPR from other nonprofits like TC4 Trust , another 501(c)(4), and Freedom Partners , a 501(c)(6) trade association, which also doesn\u2019t have to makes its donors public.\n\nInitially, the group attracted attention because it had seemingly boundless revenues, but no employees, volunteers, office space or significant operations aside from making grants. Then, in 2012, California\u2019s campaign finance agency found that CPPR had engaged in \u201c campaign money laundering \u201d with its involvement in channeling $15 million through several nonprofits and into the bank accounts of two California PACs working on ballot initiatives. The findings, and the attention they drew, apparently strained relations between the group\u2019s president, Phoenix-based political consultant Sean Noble, and its backers, Charles and David Koch, who had helped to corral donors over the years.\n\nNoble\u2019s troubles mounted in late 2013 when CPPR filed its 2012 paperwork with the IRS ; it showed that Noble was sending tens of millions of the group\u2019s dollars to firms he controlled. Last month, ProPublica reported that Noble had begun to live lavishly , and divorce records suggested that a great deal of the group\u2019s money was making its way into Noble\u2019s bank account, in possible violation of the private benefit rules that govern 501(c)(4) groups. Still in business\n\nDespite the recent rocky patch, though, signs of a renewal for CPPR came two days after the 60 conservative groups submitted their letter to Congress, when three of the signatories filed a 59-page comment with the IRS opposing the agency\u2019s proposed rules for 501(c)(4) groups: the Center for Individual Freedom, American Commitment, and a third group called American Encore, which, the comment notes, was \u201c formerly known as the Center to Protect Patient Rights .\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerican Encore,\u201d according to the comment , \u201cadvocates for limited government and free enterprise and is committed to protecting individual liberty, including the rights of patients to choose and use their desired medical care providers. It goes on, \u201cAmerican Encore has primarily advanced its policy interests by investing in and conducting research, as well as providing financial support to other organizations in support of shared policy interests.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s investment in public policy research, though, has heretofore been invisible. Last year, the group was paying consultants, including Noble\u2019s firms, to conduct opposition research and develop ads.\n\nThat was only a fraction of the group\u2019s spending, though. American Encore/CPPR gave out more than $112 million in grants to politically active nonprofits that reported more than $127 million in political spending in the 2012 elections. Recipients of American Encore/CPPR funds spent more to influence the 2012 elections than all liberal nonprofits, including unions, have spent starting with the Citizens United decision in 2010 and going to the end of February 2014.\n\nAnother of the three groups listed on the IRS comment, American Commitment, was founded by Noble in 2012. It has received the bulk of its funding over two years from American Encore/CPPR and, later, that group\u2019s top funder, Freedom Partners.\n\nIn its comment to the IRS, American Commitment is described as an organization that \u201cengages in critical public policy debates over the size and instrusiveness of government through direct advocacy, strategic policy analysis, and grassroots mobilization.\u201d Yet, American Commitment spent 96 percent of its funds in 2012 on \u201c media production and polling ,\u201d using the same firms it listed in its political spending reports filed with the FEC.\n\nDuring the summer of 2012, American Commitment ran a number of ads that did not have to be reported to the FEC. In one ad criticizing Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), the group claimed that the Affordable Care Act \u201cimposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.\u201d That garnered a \u201c pants-on-fire \u201d rating from Politifact, which checked four of the ads. The best the group rated on the truth meter was \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\nFactcheck.org gave an ad by American Commitment against Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) a berth among its \u201cWorst Political Ads of 2012.\u201d\n\nThe fact that organizations like American Commitment, a group that describes itself as engaging in \u201ccritical policy debates\u201d and conveying \u201c timely, effective public policy research ,\u201d are running misleading ads slamming politicians predominantly or entirely of one party in tight races highlights the complexity of the task the IRS is facing in its rulemaking.\n\nCitizens United. It has spent almost exactly the sum of those grants on ads critical of Democrats in federal races. In 2010, CIF told the IRS it spent more than $2 million on politics, none of which was reported to the FEC. The third group on the IRS comment, the Center for Individual Freedom , has received two large cash infusions from Crossroads GPS \u2014 the large (c)(4) formed by GOP strategist Karl Rove \u2014 since. It has spent almost exactly the sum of those grants on ads critical of Democrats in federal races. In 2010, CIF told the IRS it spent more than $2 million on politics, none of which was reported to the FEC.\n\nLike American Encore/CPPR and American Commitment, CIF doesn\u2019t appear to have much grassroots support, having received more than two-thirds of its revenues in 2012 from Crossroads GPS and one other unknown organization\n\nHowever, CIF does engage in major litigation related to its mission. For example, it was CIF, along with the Hispanic Leadership Fund, that appealed the Van Hollen v. FEC decision in 2012. The case dealt directly with disclosure of donors to nonprofits that engage in certain kinds of reportable political activities. CIF ultimately won and the issue was sent back to the FEC for a possible rulemaking.\n\nNot Going Anywhere\n\nThe emergence of American Encore from the scandal and turmoil of CPPR last year indicates some role for the organization in the current election cycle, whether Noble has patched up relations with his benefactors or is going it alone.\n\nNAACP v. Alabama case in which the Supreme Court said a 501(c) organization \u2014 in that instance, one facing the very real threat of physical harm \u2014 could not be compelled to reveal the names of its financial supporters. But Noble and his allies signal no intent to change their ways when it comes to revealing the identities of their donors. The IRS comment speaks forcefully about the importance of free speech, but just half of one paragraph mentions donor disclosure, concluding that such a requirement \u201cwould raise additional First Amendment issues.\u201d It cites in part the 1958case in which the Supreme Court said a 501(c) organization \u2014 in that instance, one facing the very real threat of physical harm \u2014 could not be compelled to reveal the names of its financial supporters.\n\nUnmentioned are the majority\u2019s words in the Supreme Court\u2019s 8-1 Citizens United decision that \u201cprompt disclosure\u201d would allow citizens to \u201csee whether elected officials are \u2018in the pocket\u2019 of so-called moneyed interests.\u201d\n\nSo far in this election cycle, groups that don\u2019t disclose their donors have already spent 300 percent more than they had at the same point in 2012, which was a record-setting \u2014 and presidential \u2014 election year. And there\u2019s evidence that liberal groups \u2014 outspent more than 7-to-1 in 2012 \u2014 won\u2019t be left behind: They\u2019ve already spent nearly seven times more than they had by now two years ago.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "Sean Noble's mammoth group -- which since 2009 has funneled $170 million-plus to conservative organizations involved in politicking -- seemed to be on the outs last year with its main backers.
