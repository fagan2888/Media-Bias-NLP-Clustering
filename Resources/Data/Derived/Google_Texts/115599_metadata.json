It's part of a national \u201cOrder Sons of Italy in America\u201d founded in New York City in 1905.\n\nIn any case, said Ruma, \u201cI'm kind of a traditionalist. My mother and father were involved in Sons of Italy, and my brother was the state lodge president.\u201d\n\nSo why did it take so long before a woman was elected the local president?\n\n\u201cI have no clue,\u201d Sarah said with a smile. \u201cWe have a lot of strong women besides me.\u201d\n\nDr. Tom Pruse, state lodge president for the Sons, said no women previously ran for the office.\n\n\u201cWe had to kind of talk Sarah into it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said, 'Think how proud your parents would be.' I think that's what turned her.\u201d\n\nA longtime trustee of the local and state lodges, Sarah said she was a little nervous the night of the Nov. 12 election at the Sons of Italy hall in the neighborhood long known as \u2014 what else? \u2013 Little Italy.\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Pruse announced: \u201cWe have a president.\u201d\n\nRuma quips that there was \u201cno puff of white smoke,\u201d as happens in Rome upon the election of a pope.\n\nPruse continued: \u201cAnd for the first time in history ...\u201d\n\nEveryone knew what that meant. A cheer went up. Sarah was touched that a nephew in the back of the hall was the first to stand and applaud.\n\nMany in Omaha associate Sons of Italy with the popular Thursday pasta luncheons at the club's hall. Men and women attend from all ethnic backgrounds and parts of the metro area.\n\nOn a recent Thursday, I sat at the club on 10th Street \u2014 a former carriage house dating to 1905 \u2014 with several people who work west of 200th Street.\n\n\u201cFrom Seventh Street to 202nd Street, anybody can come,\u201d Ruma said. \u201cIt's a place where everyone can join and have a good time.\u201d\n\nBesides the Thursday spaghetti, mostaccioli, meatball and sausage feeds run by the state lodge, the local lodge sponsors a Friday evening dinner. At both, volunteers cook and dish out the food, and proceeds go to charity.\n\nThe Sons of Italy has social members, which can include anyone, and regular (voting) members, who have an Italian connection. That means Italian heritage or marriage into an Italian family.\n\nI mentioned to Dr. Pruse, the state president, that although his name ends in a vowel, it doesn't sound Italian.\n\n\u201cI'm full-blooded Croatian,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife was a Carlini.\u201d\n\nThe Sons of Italy was originated in America partly to teach immigrants English and to help them become U.S. citizens.\n\nIn Omaha, many came beginning in the 1890s, some from the Sicilian towns of Carlentini and Lentini. They brought traditions that include the Santa Lucia Festival, which still features a parade, the crowning of a queen and a Mass at St. Frances Cabrini Church, across the street from the Sons' hall.\n\nSarah Ruma's grandparents were immigrants, and her grandmother worked a hard job in the South Omaha Stockyards, at the Swift packinghouse. She is proud of the impact that descendants of the city's early Italians have made in professions \u2014 law, medicine, education and others, including many restaurateurs.\n\nHer own family ran a grocery store at 18th and Vinton Streets, and Sarah worked from an early age \u201cbagging pasta.\u201d\n\nHer late parents spoke fluent Italian, and Sarah says she can understand the language. She has made five trips to Italy and plans to return.\n\nRuma's profession as a therapist has included counseling those with eating disorders, among other problems, and she appreciates getting to help people.\n\n\u201cIt is stressful, but I work with great people and have a great support system,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's good to help people understand what they need to do to make a change and give them the skills to help follow through with it.\u201d\n\nRuma, 58, is a 1973 graduate of Mercy High School and of the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where she also earned a master's degree in counseling. She is the longtime president of the Freedom Choir at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, 22nd and Binney Streets.\n\nAs for her Sons of Italy election, she hopes to run meetings effectively and increase membership, with more men as well as more women.\n\nAnd she is pleased that the members of many families stay active from one generation to the next. \u201cThe cool thing is that a lot of history repeats itself.\u201d\n\nBut now Ruma has made a bit of \u201cnew history\u201d with her election.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty cool,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were lots of female members cheering loud \u2014 younger than my mom, but they knew my mom. One said, 'She must be screaming in heaven.' \u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "Sarita L. \u201cSarah\u201d Ruma, a mental health therapist at Children's Hospital & Medical Center, will be sworn in Dec. 14 as the first woman to lead the local Cristoforo Colombo Lodge.", "title": "Kelly: Local Sons of Italy elect 1st daughter as president", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/kelly-local-sons-of-italy-elect-st-daughter-as-president/article_6381694d-c13b-5d73-a6c7-66ee1dbe0547.html", "image": {"width": 760, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/03/503ef539-ec61-57ee-9bee-bb9334651b60/5332eecf65b8e.image.jpg?resize=760%2C316", "height": 316}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Sarita L. \u201cSarah\u201d Ruma, a mental health therapist at Children's Hospital &amp; Medical Center, will be sworn in Dec. 14 as the first woman to lead the local Cristoforo Colombo Lodge.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news,kelly", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news,kelly"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ba4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have a lot of strong women besides me.\u201dDr. Tom Pruse, state lodge president for the Sons, said no women previously ran for the office.\nI mentioned to Dr. Pruse, the state president, that although his name ends in a vowel, it doesn't sound Italian.\nMy mother and father were involved in Sons of Italy, and my brother was the state lodge president.\u201dSo why did it take so long before a woman was elected the local president?\nThe Sons of Italy has social members, which can include anyone, and regular (voting) members, who have an Italian connection.\nIt's part of a national \u201cOrder Sons of Italy in America\u201d founded in New York City in 1905."}
