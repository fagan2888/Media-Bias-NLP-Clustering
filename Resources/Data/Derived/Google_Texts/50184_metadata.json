Most concretely, the Senate electoral map was arguably the worst one Democrats have faced since World War II\u2014certainly the most unrepresentative, as Patrick Egan explained at the Monkey Cage blog. It was the most unfavorable electorate they could have faced. Democrats also failed to take advantage of Obamacare\u2019s success, which upset GOP plans to run their entire campaign against it. As MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes put it:\n\nThe Republicans always thought this would be another Affordable Care Act referendum election and then it clearly became the case that they no longer had the politics in their favor. And rather than seeing Republicans retreating as a sign of weakness and attacking, Democrats and Republicans came to this weird kind of truce in which the central political debate of the last six years was just thrown out the window by everyone.\n\nOn top of that, Republicans were not the least bit fazed by running out of their expected ammo. They simply decided to keep attacking Obama non-stop, regardless of what they were attacking him for. They even ended up attacking him for not having appointed an Ebola czar! And, of course, as I\u2019ve already explained\u2014Obama\u2019s race played into deep divisions within the Democratic Party reflecting decades-long trends that no individual, not even a president, can do much to change.\n\nBut President Obama is also to blame for a wide range of policy positions and actions that have directly or indirectly worked to demobilize the Democratic base. Perhaps most important, he has failed to revive the economy for those who need it most and are most important for Democrats politically. The economy has done just fine for the Mitt Romneys of the world. But not for anyone else.\n\nAs my former Open Left blogmate Ian Welsh pointed out, \u201cTwo Charts Show Why the Obama Economy Sucks.\u201d The first shows the portion of the working-age population that\u2019s working. It was hovering around 63 percent before the Great Recession, and has been between 58 and 59 percent since late 2010. The second shows median household income, falling from over $56,000 in 2007 to roughly $52,000 in 2011, about where it\u2019s been ever since. These two charts show why the headline economic numbers showing a recovering economy fail to register with the American people. It\u2019s not the people who are mistaken\u2014it\u2019s the pundit class that\u2019s out of touch, clinging to an outmoded set of increasingly misleading statistics.\n\nYou can make any excuse you want for Obama\u2014blame anyone else as well as him, there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around\u2014but the grim facts remain. If he were raising hell about them every day, it might not matter for the Democrats politically. Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 victory comes to mind in this regard. If Obama were fighting mad, and fighting on the side of those being left behind, things would be a whole lot different than they are today, and people still might believe in his promise of hope and change. But he\u2019s not doing any of that, which is a huge part of why the Democrats did so poorly. They had no clear sense of who was on their side\u2014when it should have been obviouos who was against them.\n\nNaturally, there\u2019s more to the Democrats\u2019 current condition than just those two charts can tell. But one way or another, the same sad story of base demobilization repeats itself with only minor variations from one issue to another. The big picture here is simple: The Bush Administration represented a total failure on two fronts\u2014first, a failure of conservative ideology, and second, a failure of American elite rule. But instead of opening up space and striking out beyond the confines of misguided elite rule, Obama\u2019s presidency was premised on trying to heal the schisms within elite rule\u2014a task that was not only misguided in its purpose, but also doomed to fail on its own terms, as shown most starkly by figures such as Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers.\n\nIn a toxic political environment, Obama\u2019s desire to heal still stands in striking contrast to that of his enemies, but the problem remains that he wants to heal the wrong thing\u2014healing elite rule would not heal America, even if it were possible. Elite rule is what ails America, it\u2019s what we need healing from. Nothing shows this more clearly than Obama\u2019s own fumbling and quickly abandoned attempts to deal with the issue of economic inequality, despite delivering one \u201chistoric\u201d speech declaring it a \u201cdefining issue of our time.\u201d Writing for The Baffler last July, Kathleen Geier summarized the speech\u2019s problems thus:\n\nTruth be told, it was never clear how serious Obama ever was about fighting inequality. Though his big inequality speech marked a step forward, as many of us noted at the time, it also contained serious omissions. The economist Max Sawicky observed that much of that speech didn\u2019t actually concern inequality. Rather, it was about social mobility, which is something entirely different. Writer Anat Shenker-Osorio pointed out that perhaps the most glaring omission of all in Obama\u2019s inequality speech was a simple one: a villain. To hear Obama and the Democrats tell it, inequality is something that just happened.\n\nThis is the kind of profound fumbling that lies behind the figures in Welsh\u2019s two charts. But you can find similar profound fumbling virtually everywhere you look. Here\u2019s just a small sample of the examples to be found.\n\n1. Vastly expanding the scope of Bush\u2019s \u201clong war\u201d strategy, merely debranding it, rather than ending it and replacing it with a progressive alternative.\n\nIt may be hard to remember, but the only reason that Obama had a shot at being elected president in 2008 was that he opposed the Iraq War in 2002, and Hillary Clinton simply would not seriously rethink her position. And yet, seeing the problem as the Iraq War alone was always problematic at best. Our response to 9/11 went far deeper than that. Perhaps Bush\u2019s greatest blunder was responding to 9/11 as a call to endless war stretching decades into the future, rather than recognizing it as blowback, a result of endless war in the past. And that is a mistake that Obama has continued, with only relatively minor tweaks.\n\nBut pleasing the conservative blogosphere by keeping Bush\u2019s secretary of defense was hardly a sign that even this scaled-back ambition would be met. Obama launched his first drone strikes within days of taking office, declined to prosecute war crimes\u2014invoking the Nazi\u2019s own Nuremberg defense\u2014and ended up jailing whistleblowers who tried to expose crimes, instead. He has used the Espionage Act six times\u2014twice as many times as all other presidents combined, and it\u2019s now reached the point where we\u2019re fighting \u201csecret wars\u201d in more than twice as many countries as Bush envisioned\u2014up to 134 at last count.\n\nPeople may not have a clear-cut idea of what Obama should have done instead, but there\u2019s a widespread sense of disappointment and disillusion. The online antiwar activist core that helped make Obama\u2019s candidacy viable in the first place is now quite estranged from him, whether or not they have anywhere else to go. And Rand Paul is seriously trying to lay claim to them.\n\n2. Pushing through a conservative, corporate-friendly model of health care reform, excluding the more popular progressive alternative of a public option.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 hysterical, often delusional opposition\u2014death panels, anyone?\u2014has largely obscured the true nature of Obamacare, particularly how conservative it is compared to what progressive activists wanted, and what\u2019s proved most effective in the rest of the industrialized world. But it traces back to the Heritage Foundation, which first came up with the individual mandate in 1989; it was largely based on Mitt Romney\u2019s adaptation of Heritage Foundation ideas in Massachusetts; and was \u201cenhanced\u201d with hundreds of Republican amendments during the legislative process. In the end, the public option, which candidate Obama openly supported, was cast aside with barely a thought.\n\nA short history overview by Michael Tomasky notes the public option\u2019s origins in the work of Jacob Hacker, as well as the key role of Roger Hickey, with the Campaign for America\u2019s Future, in selling the idea, first to single-payer advocates as a \u201cpragmatic compromise\u201d and then to the Democratic presidential candidates as a popular progressive policy stance. As Tomasky explained:\n\nIn other words, the public option was itself a compromise position, got it? It was a way to tell single-payer advocates, OK, listen, we want single-payer too, but political realities are such that this is the best we can get, and if we get this and it works well and people see that, maybe it will serve as a step toward an eventual single-payer system. John Edwards took it up first, but Obama and Clinton signed on quickly.\n\nWhat difference does all this make in the grand electoral scheme, if it\u2019s only a matter of obscure political history? Quite a lot, actually, given that the single-payer advocates were the only organized constituency on health care that the Democrats had leading up to the 2008 election. The fact that their ideas, aspirations, insights and concerns were so thoroughly sidelined means that a potentially powerful progressive constituency has been effectively fragmented, disorganized and dissipated. It may be very hard to measure what isn\u2019t there, but in this case, what isn\u2019t there is truly substantial.\n\n3. Foot-dragging on fighting global warming and promoting alternatives.\n\nEarly efforts to get significant climate action through Congress failed\u2014and one certainly could find fault with Obama for that, though he\u2019s certainly not alone. But what about actions that were entirely up to him? In September 2010, Bill McKibben and other activists with 350.org tried to get Obama to reinstall solar panels on the White House, as a symbolic statement in the fight against global warming, which would give a big boost to a planned a \u201cglobal work party\u201d with over 7,000 events in 188 countries. McKibben wrote about the solar panel effort here. As he explained, the action was a creative response to an inside-the-Beltway failure:\n\nThe inside-the-Beltway green groups took what seemed to be the route of least resistance: a very tame piece of climate legislation larded with special prizes for special interests. They worked it as hard as it could have been worked\u2013and in the end it didn\u2019t even come close. The fossil fuel industry and their allies in D.C. barely had to break a sweat shooting it down.\n\nAs a result, McKibben concluded\u2014well in advance of the midterms\u2014that no federal action would take place for at least two years, which in turn meant little chance of international action, either. \u201cSo what do we do with those two years? I think we use them to build a movement, which explains the solar panel we\u2019re hauling south from Maine.\u201d\n\nSo here you had President Obama with a perfect opportunity to give a hand to community organizers, who in turn were trying to give a hand to him on one of his most important issues. It should have been a no-brainer. Put the panels back up\u2014simple. But Obama didn\u2019t do it. In a devastating post mortem, McKibben wrote: \u201cAsked to do something easy and symbolic to rekindle a little of the joy that had turned out so many of us as volunteers for Obama in 2008, they point blank said no.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president and his base are disconnected \u2014 for good reasons.
