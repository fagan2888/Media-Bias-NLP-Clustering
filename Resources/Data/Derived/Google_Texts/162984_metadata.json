Some oilfield workers vote for candidates who adamantly refuse to pass safety measures that could extend their lives. Motorists who depend on well-maintained, safe roads for their survival often pick candidates who don\u2019t want to spend any money for critical transportation upgrades.\n\nYou get the picture. But the one issue that constantly amazes me is why so many voters \u2014 from the working poor to the wealthy \u2014 keep electing officials who maintain that raising the minimum wage will kill jobs, raise prices and cripple the economy.\n\nIn reality, millions of workers across the country would take home more money to spend on both essential products and other items they can\u2019t afford now. The federal minimum wage has been raised 22 times since it was set at 25 cents in 1938, and not one of those increases has resulted in fewer jobs or higher prices.\n\nCompany presidents who oppose any minimum wage hike may benefit from a substantial increase because it would give people more money to buy their products and services. In turn, it may be necessary to hire more workers to keep up with demand.\n\nThe most well-known example of this strategy is when Henry Ford more than doubled the daily wages of his workers in 1914, from $2.25 to $5. After he did it, his auto manufacturing company became the most successful in the industry.\n\nThe reason Ford dramatically increased wages has long been debated. Some argue that his main motivation was to reduce turnover on his assembly lines, thus cutting the huge expense of training new workers. That certainly was a factor.\n\nBut Ford supplied his own answer in his 1926 book, \u201cToday and Tomorrow.\u201d He wrote: \u201cThe owner, the employees, and the buying public are all one and the same, and unless an industry can so manage itself as to keep wages high and prices low it destroys itself, for otherwise it limits the number of its customers. One\u2019s own employees ought to be one\u2019s own best customers.\u201d\n\nThe bold move worked. Ford sold 398,000 Model Ts in 1914, 501,000 the next year, and topped 1 million cars annually by 1920.\n\nFord noted his company increased the buying power of its own workers, and they increased the buying power of others. \u201cIt is this thought of enlarging buying power by paying high wages and selling at low prices that is behind the prosperity of this country,\u201d he wrote.\n\nFive states do not have minimum wages on the books. In the rest of the nation, the state minimum wages are all set at or above the federal $7.25 per hour minimum \u2014 except Wyoming and Georgia, which both have only a $5.15 per hour minimum requirement.\n\nWyoming politicians and businesses maintain that raising the state minimum wage to $7.25 an hour isn\u2019t necessary, because most employers pay at least the federal level. But not all of them do. A worker who is in any occupation not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act is subject to the state minimum wage, not the federal. An employee at a business that makes less than $500,000 annually and does not engage in interstate commerce is not covered by the federal minimum wage.\n\nThere are other exceptions to the federal law. There are no minimums for agricultural workers, domestic service workers, workers on commission or employees of educational, charitable, religious or nonprofit organizations. The Equality State Policy Center reports that about one-third of Wyoming workers are not covered by the federal law. According to the Department of Labor Statistics, about 9,000 workers in Wyoming are paid at or less than the minimum wage.\n\nMeanwhile, it\u2019s outrageous that tipped employees such as restaurant workers are subject to a $2.13 state minimum wage. Some may make more in tips to regularly bring in more than $7.25 an hour, but many do not. The state\u2019s \u201ctipped offset\u201d law requires employers to make up the difference between the state tipped minimum and the federal minimum wage, but in Wyoming, that\u2019s a joke.\n\nThere is absolutely no enforcement of the requirement. I\u2019ve talked to wait staff in local restaurants and national franchises, and the universal answer is they don\u2019t request the tipped offset because they are afraid of losing their jobs.\n\nThe real issue Wyoming should be debating is an increase to a livable wage for all workers in the state. A full-time worker who now makes $7.25 an hour earns $15,080 a year. The federal poverty level for a family of two is $15,930. For a family of three, it\u2019s $20,090.\n\nThe latter obviously cannot get by with one adult working for minimum wage and another adult staying at home with a child. The second adult would also have to work, at least part-time, and child-care costs could easily wipe out most of that second income.\n\nThat means the family must be dependent upon government welfare programs such as food stamps and housing subsidies to survive. But requiring all employers to pay livable wages would greatly reduce the government\u2019s high cost of operating such programs. All taxpayers should welcome that change, but too many fail to see the connection between wages and the use of social services. They would apparently rather rant about \u201cwelfare queens.\u201d\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology calculated livable wages in all 50 states. In Wyoming, MIT estimated the living wage for an individual in the state is $9.93 an hour. For single parents with one child, it increases to $20.80.\n\nState Rep. James Byrd (D-Cheyenne) will make his third straight run at increasing the state minimum wage during the Legislature\u2019s budget session beginning Feb. 8. His first two attempts were soundly defeated: in 2014, the House voted 51-9 against the proposal, and earlier this year it was shot down 8-1 by a legislative committee.\n\nThe bill\u2019s chances in 2016 have not improved. Byrd wants to raise the state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour, and the tipped minimum from $2.13 to a more reasonable $5 an hour. But in the budget session, bills must receive a two-thirds vote in both chambers just to be introduced. The same legislators who killed the 2015 bill will be back next year.\n\nBut they don\u2019t have to return in 2017, when a newly elected Legislature is sworn in. Candidates running for re-election should be asked at every door they knock on and at every campaign forum they attend to explain why they voted to keep stifling the Wyoming economy and keep workers below poverty by not raising the state minimum wage.\n\nCandidates seeking a first term in office should be made by voters to state a clear position on raising the state minimum wage.\n\nIf Wyoming voters are better educated about the issue, they should stop buying state lawmakers\u2019 whoppers about massive layoffs and higher prices and vote in the best interests of all Wyoming residents. We can follow the example of Henry Ford, who knew that a rising tide lifts all boats.\n\nTop 5 Drake\u2019s Takes of 2015\n\nWhen you write a weekly column, it\u2019s kind of instant nostalgia: You opine on a topic and quickly move on to the next one.\n\nBut there are some columns in 2015 that I believe set themselves apart from the rest. Here\u2019s my own \u201ctop 5\u2032\u201d for the year.\n\nBy far the most read column I wrote was on May 12, \u201c State should look to Laramie for leadership on LGBT issues .\u201d It had 1,800 shares on Facebook, and it likely found an audience outside of Wyoming. I wrote a few others on the topic of same-sex marriage in 2015, but none had this many readers.\n\nFrequent readers of The Drake\u2019s Take know I am passionate about the need for more effective gun regulations to help reduce the level of violence in our state and nation. They often top the columns that readers respond to the most. \u201c Move over NRA, you can\u2019t hold a candle to this patriotic group \u201d from Dec. 1 drew 19 comments, the majority critical of my views. I know some columnists who say they don\u2019t read what people write, but I can\u2019t help myself. I read them all, plus emails.\n\n\u201c Wyoming continues wrong path to punish innocent \u201d on April 7 continued the sad story of Andrew Johnson, a Cheyenne man who was convicted of sexual assault and spent nearly 24 years in the Wyoming Penitentiary before he was finally exonerated by DNA evidence. For the past two sessions our Legislature callously rejected bills to compensate him. My column was about an exonerated Connecticut man who also lost more than one-third of his life but was fairly compensated, while Johnson has no money to live on two years after he was freed. Not many stories tick me off more than this one.\n\n\u201c Lummis\u2019 Planned Parenthood performance shames all of Wyoming \u201d in October is a column that was both shared by many readers and commented about. I think the contentious debate about the proposed defunding of Planned Parenthood touched a raw nerve with my readers, many of whom were upset about the actions of Republican Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming at a committee hearing.\n\nWhat list of my columns could be complete without one about the Affordable Care Act? \u201c Obamacare isn\u2019t to blame for failure of WINhealth \u201d on Oct. 27 wasn\u2019t shared as much as other columns, but readers apparently liked having a forum to express their opinions. My hope is that in the coming year, many more of you will tell me and other people what you think.\n\nThanks for reading, and have a great New Year.\n\n\n\n\u2014 Columns are the signed perspective of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the views of WyoFile\u2019s staff, board of directors or its supporters.
