The Colorado Department of Transportation worker killed Friday in an accident on U.S. 50 has been identified as 61-year-old David Morris.

Morris, who joined CDOT in 2011, died in a multivehicle accident at the base of Monarch Pass. He was a member of the maintenance crew that services the pass, CDOT said in a news release Saturday morning.

“Dave was a doer and just a tremendous man,” said David Vialpando, CDOT maintenance superintendent in Alamosa. “Everyone has a story about David; he was that type of coworker and friend. He touched everyone he knew.”

Morris is survived by his wife, daughter and son.

According to the State Patrol, the accident happened in an active construction zone where temporary signaling devices were in place, alternating east and westbound traffic.

An 18-wheel tractor-trailer traveling eastbound on U.S. 50 failed to stop at the signal and crossed into westbound lanes, colliding with three vehicles, including a CDOT truck being driven by Morris.

The truck driver was seriously injured. The State Patrol is investigating.

“David was on his way to serve the public when this terrible accident happened,” said CDOT executive director Shailen Bhatt. “Everyone who puts on the orange realizes they put themselves at risk when they go on the road. If not for David’s presence and sacrifice, yesterday’s tragedy may have been even worse. We are incredibly grateful for his service to CDOT and the residents of Colorado.”

CDOT said that since 1929, 58 employees have died in the line of duty, the last occurring in 2009.

Contributions in David Morris’ memory may be sent to CDOT’s Helping Hands, a program to assist CDOT families in need. Checks can be mailed to 4201 E. Arkansas Ave., Denver, CO 80222.
