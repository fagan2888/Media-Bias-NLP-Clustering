It\u2019s Super-Easy In Mass. Now Do You?\n\nVeronica Thomas\n\nCommonHealth Intern\n\nPestering someone with the same question over and over again doesn\u2019t usually get you what you want. But with organ donation, asking repetitively might just be the key to increasing the number of much-needed organ donors.\n\nAccording to a new working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, providing more information and opportunities for people to become organ donors could boost registrations dramatically.\n\nThis increase in donors is needed more than ever. Each day, 18 people die while waiting for a transplant organ to become available. The waiting list is over 123,000 people deep but there were only about 29,000 organ transplants last year.\n\nThe new findings are based on a survey of Massachusetts drivers, which The Washington Post\u2019s Jason Millman describes in One Way To Boost Organ Donations: Just Keep Asking. From the article:\n\nResearchers surveyed 368 people with a Massachusetts driver\u2019s license or ID card, including 156 people (42.4 percent) who were already registered organ donors. Of those who weren\u2019t registered donors, 61 people in the study decided to sign up after researchers presented them with the chance to update their status. Just two people who had been registered donors asked to remove themselves from the registry. \u201cPut simply, asking again for organ donation generates more donors,\u201d wrote Judd Kessler of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School and Stanford University\u2019s Alvin Roth. They said this suggests that policymakers should look for more opportunities to keep asking this question, like on income tax forms, as the researchers said some states are considering.\n\nAsking more than once may work for a number of reasons. Millman explains:\n\nPeople may have missed the opportunity to register the first time; or, repeat requests may signal the importance of organ donation, Kessler and Roth write. The \u201cguilt factor\u201d may also kick in after repeat requests. And there\u2019s also the chance that people learned something that changed their minds. On that final point, Kessler and Roth found that just informing non-donors about what organs they could donate made them more willing to register.\n\nSo, here we go. Let\u2019s test out this strategy and see if it works.\n\nDo you want to become an organ donor?\n\nIf you live in Massachusetts, you can register online through the RMV. It took my coworker only two minutes to sign up this morning. All you need is your driver\u2019s license, permit or ID number, your social security number, and an email address.\n\nOn the fence or want to learn more about becoming a donor?
