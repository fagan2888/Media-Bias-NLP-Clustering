President Barack Obama spoke to the world Tuesday after the deadline to sign up for the Affordable Care Act passed the day before, and he seemed pretty pleased with himself.

“Many of the tall tales people have told about this law have been debunked,” Obama said.

Obama also went on to chastise those against Obamacare, and those “folks” aren’t in short supply.

“Why are they so mad at the idea of folks having health insurance?” he nearly shouted to a crowd outside of the White House.
