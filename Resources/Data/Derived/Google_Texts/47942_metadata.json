Ben Sasse (Neb.) has written an open letter to supporters of GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump, in which he argued that should Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton become their respective parties\u2019 nominees, he will have to seek a third option for president.\n\nOpen Letter to Trump Supporters:https://t.co/yUNSZTqlg6 Good night. Signing off,\n\nGym Rat. https://t.co/xezYe5gszo \u2014 Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) February 29, 2016\n\nSasse previously sparked a Twitter controversy by addressing a series of questions to Trump. The GOP candidate did not answer any of the senator\u2019s questions but fired back by calling him a \u201cgym rat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an establishment Republican, and I will never support Hillary Clinton,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m a movement conservative who was elected over the objections of the GOP establishment. My current answer for who I would support in a hypothetical matchup between Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton is: Neither of them.\u201d\n\nAN OPEN LETTER TO TRUMP SUPPORTERS To my friends supporting Donald Trump: The Trump coalition is broad and\u2026 Posted by Ben Sasse on Sunday, February 28, 2016\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk about voting,\u201d Sasse continued. \u201cVoting is usually just about choosing the lesser evil of the most viable candidates. \u2018Usually\u2026\u2019 But not always. Certain moments are larger. They cause us to explicitly ask: Who are we as a people? What does the way we vote here say about our shared identity? What is actually the president\u2019s job?\u201d\n\nSasse added that merely being labeled a \u201cRepublican\u201d isn\u2019t sufficient reason to vote for someone.\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk about political parties: parties are just tools to enact the things that we believe,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPolitical parties are not families; they are not religions; they are not nations \u2014 they are often not even on the level of sports loyalties. They are just tools. I was not born Republican. I chose this party, for as long as it is useful. If our Party is no longer working for the things we believe in \u2014 like defending the sanctity of life, stopping ObamaCare, protecting the Second Amendment, etc. \u2014 then people of good conscience should stop supporting that party until it is reformed.\u201d\n\nSasse said that neither Trump nor Clinton are good options for president.\n\n\u201cGiven what we know about him today, here\u2019s where I\u2019m at: If Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee, my expectation is that I will look for some third candidate \u2014 a conservative option, a Constitutionalist,\u201d Sasse wrote.\n\n\u201cI do not claim to speak for a movement, but I suspect I am far from alone,\u201d he added. \u201cAfter listening to Nebraskans in recent weeks, and talking to a great many people who take oaths seriously, I think many are in the same place. I believe a sizable share of Christians \u2014 who regard threats against religious liberty as arguably the greatest crisis of our time \u2014 are unwilling to support any candidate who does not make a full-throated defense of the First Amendment a first commitment of their candidacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cConservatives understand that all men are created equal and made in the image of God, but also that government must be limited so that fallen men do not wield too much power,\u201d Sasse continued. \u201cA presidential candidate who boasts about what he\u2019ll do during his \u2018reign\u2019 and refuses to condemn the KKK cannot lead a conservative movement in America.\u201d\n\nSasse wrote that he believes \u201cmany Trump fans are well-meaning,\u201d but \u201cI sincerely hope we select one of the other GOP candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for listening,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWhile I recognize that we disagree about how to make America great again, we agree that this should be our goal. We need more people engaged in the civic life of our country \u2014 not fewer. I genuinely appreciate how much many of you care about this country, and that you are demanding something different from Washington. I\u2019m going to keep doing the same thing. But I can\u2019t support Donald Trump.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 2, "twitter": {"description": "Republican Sen.
