(Photo: William Mason / Courtesy of the Becket Fund)\n\nRegardless of one\u2019s personal beliefs, it is hard to defend the federal government\u2019s mission to force nuns to violate their faith.\n\nThat\u2019s ultimately what the Obama administration is trying to do by requiring religious nonprofits to provide a range of birth control to employees.\n\nThe nuns\u2019 fight is part of a longstanding pushback by faith-based institutions against the contraceptive mandate under Obamacare. Through the law, the Health and Human Services Department requires employers to offer a wide array of birth control free of charge to employees in their insurance plans, including a handful of drugs and devices that can cause early abortions.\n\nThe mandate spurred dozens of lawsuits, from both for-profit business owners and nonprofit groups who believe the requirement goes against their First Amendment religious freedoms.\n\nThe Supreme Court sided against the government in the Hobby Lobby case last year, ruling that individuals shouldn\u2019t have to give up their religious rights to run a business.\n\nBut nonprofits are still fighting the administration over its most recent \u201caccommodation\u201d for religious schools, charities and hospitals. The government has inched reluctantly the past few years toward giving these faith-based institutions more leeway. And it thinks it has a good compromise in allowing the groups to sign a government form asking a third party to cover the contraceptive costs in their health plans.\n\nThe nonprofits recognize a shell game when they see one. More than 50 lawsuits related to the mandate have been filed. And seven cases are currently before the Supreme Court; justices will decide this fall whether to take them on.\n\nOne of the most prominent cases comes from the Colorado-based Little Sisters of the Poor. The nuns care for the elderly poor, with 30 homes in the U.S.\n\nThe government has exempted churches and church-run ministries from the contraceptive mandate \u2014 but it didn\u2019t extend the same rights to organizations like the Little Sisters. Apparently, these nuns aren\u2019t religious enough by the government\u2019s standards.\n\nIf the Little Sisters don\u2019t comply by asking someone else to pay for the contraceptive coverage \u2014 typically the insurance company \u2014 they face millions in IRS fines.\n\n\u201cThe most baffling thing is that the government doesn\u2019t need the Little Sisters to distribute contraceptives,\u201d says Adele Keim, legal counsel with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is representing the Little Sisters, and also represented Hobby Lobby.\n\nKeim points to the federal program Title X, which provides funding for a range of birth control options through clinics like Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason the Little Sisters have to do this,\u201d Keim says.\n\nNonprofits in Michigan are also fighting the mandate, although they received a blow last Friday when the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said it won\u2019t strike down the mandate because the accommodation is adequate. The Michigan Catholic Conference, the Catholic Charities Diocese of Kalamazoo and some Tennessee Catholic nonprofits argued the mandate violated their rights under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nDave Maluchnik, director of communications for the Michigan Catholic Conference, says these groups are still being forced to \u201ctrigger\u201d the birth control coverage by signing the government\u2019s opt out form \u2014 and that\u2019s too much involvement in their view.\n\n\u201cThey are still participating,\u201d Maluchnik says.\n\nHe also sees the mandate as a direct affront to the First Amendment, with the government telling religious organizations how to conduct their affairs.\n\nThe Supreme Court has already granted interim relief five times from the mandate to religious groups, including the Little Sisters, Wheaton College and the Michigan Catholic Conference. And Keim thinks it is \u201cmuch more likely than not\u201d the High Court will take up these cases.\n\nGiven what\u2019s at stake, it should.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is determining who is and who isn\u2019t Catholic,\u201d Maluchnik says.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1F2REdm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It is hard to defend the federal government\u2019s mission to force nuns to violate their faith", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "It is hard to defend the federal government\u2019s mission to force nuns to violate their faith", "title": "Jacques: Federal government should leave nuns alone", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/ingrid-jacques/2015/08/28/jacques-feds-leave-nuns-alone/71297170/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It is hard to defend the federal government\u2019s mission to force nuns to violate their faith", "title": "Jacques: Federal government should leave nuns alone", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e2ac9e632603c867668801360f2128da36b3b000/c=1336-0-4424-3088&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/28/DetroitNews/B99299695Z.1_20150828103925_000_G70IUFBH.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "nuns, feds, Ingrid Jacques, Obamacare, birth control, Hobby Lobby, Little Sisters of the Poor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1eb9\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s ultimately what the Obama administration is trying to do by requiring religious nonprofits to provide a range of birth control to employees.\nThe Michigan Catholic Conference, the Catholic Charities Diocese of Kalamazoo and some Tennessee Catholic nonprofits argued the mandate violated their rights under the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n(Photo: William Mason / Courtesy of the Becket Fund)Regardless of one\u2019s personal beliefs, it is hard to defend the federal government\u2019s mission to force nuns to violate their faith.\nOne of the most prominent cases comes from the Colorado-based Little Sisters of the Poor.\nThe nuns\u2019 fight is part of a longstanding pushback by faith-based institutions against the contraceptive mandate under Obamacare."}
