As someone who was equally idealistic until reality took over, I still think that Mr. Sanders\u2019s aspirations for society are honorable and attractive. But talk is cheap. And working toward such goals is very hard.\n\nFree college education, free medical care, lower-priced prescription drugs, etc., are goals that every Democrat would support, but most Democrats also understand that bringing these dreams to reality isn\u2019t just a matter of making promises. As a senator, Mr. Sanders bragged about the Affordable Care Act as a compromise that he helped create. I characterize it as a confusing hybrid and caving to the GOP. What makes millennials think that as president he would have more power to fashion a single-payer system? Mr. Sanders would serve millennials better by sticking with the Senate and helping get more Democrats elected, which wouldn\u2019t happen with him heading the Democratic ticket.\n\nPamela Kincheloe, Manassas", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "pamela kincheloe, bernie sansders, sanders millennials, catherine rampell", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "In her Feb. 5 Washington Forum column, \u201cWhy millennials feel the Bern,\u201d Catherine Rampell gave us two good reasons for Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders\u2019s\u00a0(I-Vt.) popularity with millennials.
