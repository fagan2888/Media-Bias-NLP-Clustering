John Jackson recalled King\u2019s dream of economic and racial equality and social justice, as well as the civil rights leader\u2019s nightmarish 1968 assassination. Jackson said dreams of equality and justice remain for black people, as do nightmares.\n\nJackson said that although blacks dare to dream of better lives, \u201coften our dreams are shattered by the reality of our lives, leaving us to face a nightmare.\u201d\n\nJackson said many nightmares are realities, including a high rate of violence among young black men. Between 2002 and 2011, the homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than for whites, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nJackson said other nightmarish realities include many black children growing up without fathers in their homes and many struggling in school. Some get hooked on drugs and others die early due to a lack of health care.\n\nJackson criticized Republican efforts to block ObamaCare and said efforts to improve society are often fought tooth and nail. He recalled King\u2019s sermon of April 3, 1968, the night before he was fatally shot. That night, King said, \u201cI may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land.\u201d\n\nJackson said it was an example of not letting adversity and fear defeat righteousness.\n\n\u201cThe reality may be hard to bear,\u201d he said. \u201cBut brothers and sisters, you\u2019ve still got to have some type of hope.\u201d\n\nAfter the sermon, Jackson said King\u2019s image has been sanitized. He said King\u2019s fight for racial equality has overshadowed his antiwar stance and calls for economic justice.\n\nState Rep. Dan Ramos, D-Lorain, who spoke after Jackson, said while King\u2019s last sermon may seem that King foreshadowed his own death, Ramos interpreted it as a call to action. Ramos said King\u2019s condemnation of American economic injustice \u2014 \u201cthe overfed mouths of middle and upper classes\u201d is how King described it in his 1967 book, \u201cWhere Do We Go from Here?\u201d \u2014 has not been answered.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018There is no deficit in human resources,\u2019\u201d Ramos said, quoting King. \u201cThe deficit is in human will.\u201d\n\nRamos said that mentality hasn\u2019t changed much since King uttered the quote. For example, Ramos blamed Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s administration for allowing food stamp benefits to expire for able-bodied people not working 20 hours per week or in job training 20 hours per week.\n\nRamos said the change was unfair given Ohio\u2019s high unemployment rate. Ohio\u2019s rate increased from 6.9 percent to 7.5 between October 2012 and October 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national rate dropped from 7.9 percent to 7.3 percent during that same period.\n\nLike Jackson, Ramos called on the 75 people at the church to continue King\u2019s fight.\n\n\u201cHe knew that we couldn\u2019t reach that Promised Land with his work and his work alone,\u201d Ramos said. \u201cIt must be a group effort. We must continue to take the torch from Dr. King and keep on marching, and 50 years later, keep on fighting.\u201d\n\nContact Evan Goodenow at 329-7129 or egoodenow@chroniclet.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chronicle-Telegram", "description": "Complete list of Martin Luther King Jr. Day events LORAIN \u2014 Dreams and nightmares were the subjects of a Sunday tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. at the Friendship Baptist Church.
