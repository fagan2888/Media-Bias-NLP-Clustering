It is also being sued for Medicaid fraud. It has also violated FDA protocols with regards to administrating RU-486 chemical abortions, which has led to the deaths of at least eight women.\"\n\n\"We must end this threat to America's pre-born children and their mothers and certainly stop funding it through state and federal tax dollars,\u201d Stanek concluded.\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds each year, and has received more money to help Americans navigate the Affordable Care Act.\n\nClick \"like\" if you are PRO-LIFE!\n\nIn addition to Rose, speakers included Family Research Council Executive Director Josh Duggar, Americans United for Life Legal Associate Mary Drury, Concerned Women for America's Alison Howard, the Radiance Foundation's Ryan Bomberger, and Students for Life of America's Missy Martinez.\n\nStanek told LifeSiteNews, \"As a board member of Live Action, I was proud to join them in their fight for life near the most pro-abortion White House in American history.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Live Action told LifeSiteNews that during the press conference one man approached the microphone and shouted that pro-life advocates should leave women alone. The spokesperson said that several supporters of Live Action responded with \"Be a real man! Stand against abortion.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood did not return a request for comment on this story.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "title": "Monitor Planned Parenthood for fraud, lawbreaking: Pro-life coalition in D.C.", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/LiveActionDCRallyKemperBombergerStanekLilaRoseMore-October142014-1000px-CreditDrewBelsky.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/monitor-planned-parenthood-for-fraud-lawbreaking-pro-life-coalition-in-d.c", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb634\"", "article_summary": "\"In addition to killing the unborn, Planned Parenthood has broken laws related to sex trafficking and statutory rape.\nPlanned Parenthood did not return a request for comment on this story.\nNewsAbortion\"All eyes should be on Planned Parenthood - a killer of over 300,000 children every year, and an entity pushing a disturbing, BDSM-promoting sexual agenda on our nation's kids.\"\nThe spokesperson said that several supporters of Live Action responded with \"Be a real man!\nPlanned Parenthood receives hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayer funds each year, and has received more money to help Americans navigate the Affordable Care Act."}
