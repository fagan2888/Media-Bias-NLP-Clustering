New Jersey is getting new license plates that officials hope will be stronger than the storm.

The colors will remain the same. But instead of embossed raised letters and numbers, the new plates will feature digitally printed flat lettering.

Officials hope the new plates will better withstand the wear-and-tear of weather.

The state will continue to issue embossed plates until the current inventory is exhausted.
