Harrisburg is tenth, with about 50,000.\n\nPennsylvania was among the slower states in expanding Medicaid, which is the part of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the U.S. Supreme Court decided is voluntary on the parts of states.\n\nThe federal government made funding for the expansion available as of Jan. 1, 2014. But Republicans including former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett were apprehensive, with Corbett finally making his own version available at the start of 2015.\n\nBut Democrats including new Gov. Tom Wolf opposed Corbett's version, saying it was confusing and flawed, and Wolf eventually switched to the approach favored by President Obama.\n\nDallas, in recently providing the latest numbers, said well over half of the new enrollment has taken place since the switch, which is also favored by advocates for the poor.\n\nState officials say about 140,000 more state residents are eligible for the coverage, which is available to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level, or $16,243 for a single person and $33,465 for a family of four.\n\nDallas said the state is ramping up outreach to the remaining people who are eligible. He said he expects another 100,000 people will eventually be enrolled, but the process will take one to two years. Advocates say that's because most of the remaining eligible people aren't in dire medical need, or are located in remote communities, or may have heard bad things about the program.\n\nDallas said he has heard of few people who, upon learning they qualify for coverage that involves no premiums and only small co-pays, turn down the offer.\n\nThe federal government is paying 100 percent of the medical costs through next year, then will gradually scale back the federal share to 90 percent by 2020 and beyond.\n\nInformation about enrolling in the expansion can be found here.\n\nRELATED: The federally-run health insurance exchange, which is for people who earn too much for Medicaid, opens Nov. 1.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Jones Township, Elk County, Pennsylvania, Tom Corbett, Federal government of the United States, Medicaid, Dallas, Secretary of Human Services Ted Dallas, health care, pennsylvania, politics, news", "title": "Medicaid expansion could create 'second largest city' in Pa.", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Medicaid expansion could create \\u0027second largest city\\u0027 in Pa.\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/11/tom_wolf_ted_dallas_medicaid_p.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/19101352-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17334255\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-01T15:47:52Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topmobile\",\"@topstories\",\"health care\",\"pennsylvania\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The state hopes to enroll an additional group that could fill two Harrisburgs."}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, November 01, 2015, 11:29 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/ted-dallas-689db2c9724bdf2c.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The state hopes to enroll an additional group that could fill two Harrisburgs.", "title": "Medicaid expansion could create 'second largest city' in Pa.", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2015/11/tom_wolf_ted_dallas_medicaid_p.html", "image": "http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/19101352-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, November 01, 2015, 10:47 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "The state hopes to enroll an additional group that could fill two Harrisburgs."}, "article_summary": "\"If it was a city of people, it would be the second largest city in the state,\" said state Secretary of Human Services Ted Dallas.\nPennsylvania has enrolled 462,000 people in the Medicaid expansion which became available Jan.1.\nThe federal government made funding for the expansion available as of Jan. 1, 2014.\nTom Wolf opposed Corbett's version, saying it was confusing and flawed, and Wolf eventually switched to the approach favored by President Obama.\nTom Corbett were apprehensive, with Corbett finally making his own version available at the start of 2015."}
