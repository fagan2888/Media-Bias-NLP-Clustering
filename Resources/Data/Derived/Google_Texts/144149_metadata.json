Northside operates hospitals in Canton and Cumming as well as its flagship hospital in Sandy Springs, which it says delivers more babies than any other U.S. hospital and performs the most surgeries in Georgia.\n\nGwinnett Medical operates hospitals in Lawrenceville and Duluth. Gwinnett County is the second most populous in the state.\n\nThe merger talks follow the recent aggressive moves of Marietta-based WellStar Health System. WellStar has begun talks to buy Tenet Healthcare\u2019s five hospitals in metro Atlanta after earlier abandoning a proposed deal with Emory Healthcare. WellStar also has a proposed deal in place to acquire West Georgia Health.\n\nAnd in May, Atlanta-based Piedmont Healthcare said it plans to bring Newton Medical Center in Covington into its group of hospitals. Meanwhile, many other Georgia hospitals, including Athens Regional, are seeking partners as well.\n\nHospitals in Georgia and around the nation have sought alliances or mergers to help weather the rapid changes in health care, many of which were sparked by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nGovernment and private insurers are increasingly stressing quality of care in reimbursements, instead of just paying for the quantity of services delivered. Medicare is paying bonuses and imposing penalties under the ACA based on quality-of-care measurements.\n\nGetting bigger may help hospital systems cut costs and meet these new demands on quality, experts say. And partnering with a large system may help smaller, independent hospitals escape financial trouble.\n\nThe wave of consolidation in the health care business has also been evident among insurers, with Aetna\u2019s proposed acquisition of Humana, and Anthem\u2019s planned deal to buy Cigna.\n\nThe leaders of Northside and Gwinnett Medical said Wednesday that they\u2019re targeting early 2016 as a completion date for a deal.\n\n\u201cA Northside Hospital and Gwinnett Medical Center combination is a strong and strategic fit on many levels,\u201d Bob Quattrocchi, Northside CEO, said in a statement. \u201cWe come to the table with very similar organizational cultures and unsurpassed commitments to patient safety and quality care. Northside and Gwinnett Medical Center already are geographic neighbors, and together we will serve one of the fastest-growing markets in the country.\u201d\n\nPhilip Wolfe, CEO of Gwinnett Medical, added in a statement that the health systems\u2019 service offerings complement each other.\n\n\u201cNorthside Hospital is a regional and national leader in women\u2019s health and cancer care, while Gwinnett Medical Center is a leader in cardiac care, trauma care and sports medicine,\u2019\u2019 Wolfe said. \u201cGoing forward, our strategy will be to leverage our respective strengths in our expanded footprint and provide the total spectrum of health care to patients not only in our market area, but throughout Georgia and the Southeast.\u201d\n\nDave Smith, a consultant with Kearny Street Consulting, said Wednesday that the deal with Gwinnett Medical \u201cis a great move for Northside.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes sense for Northside to grab that eastern part of Atlanta,\u2019\u2019 Smith said. \u201cNorthside is looking for a heart program, and Gwinnett has a good heart program.\u201d\n\nNorthside\u2019s reputation in baby deliveries could enhance Gwinnett Medical\u2019s obstetric program, Smith added.\n\nOverall, he said, Northside\u2019s brand name is stronger in metro Atlanta, and thus likely would have \u201ctop billing\u2019\u2019 in a resulting merger.\n\nNorthside has been active on the outpatient front, recently acquiring 22 medical imaging centers in Georgia. The purchase of MedQuest\u2019s centers in the state brings Northside\u2019s total of imaging centers to 56 in North and Central Georgia.\n\nQuattrocchi and Wolfe said in a statement that the merger should create many opportunities for enhanced patient care, additional growth, professional development and fiscal strength.\n\nChristopher Press, a consultant with Morgan Healthcare Consulting, said Wednesday that the merger talks reflect how much the Atlanta health market has changed over the past 25 years. \u201cSome of the combinations today would have been unimaginable even 10 years ago,\u2019\u2019 Press said.\n\nAnd Greg Charleston, with the consulting firm Conway MacKenzie in Atlanta, said the north Fulton and Gwinnett markets, where the merger is centered, have an ideal mix of patients \u2013 middle to upper class and privately insured.\n\n\u201cIt seems like every health system is looking around to see who they can partner with,\u2019\u2019 Charleston said. \u201cThe bigger you are, the more leverage you have with insurance companies\u2019\u2019 on obtaining good payment rates.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Andy Miller", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "ATLANTA -- Up until now, Northside Hospital has stayed relatively quiet in the almost frantic rush by metro Atlanta hospital systems to seek mergers or acquisitions.", "title": "More Georgia hospital mergers loom", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2015-09-03/more-georgia-hospital-mergers-loom", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "article_summary": "\u201cA Northside Hospital and Gwinnett Medical Center combination is a strong and strategic fit on many levels,\u201d Bob Quattrocchi, Northside CEO, said in a statement.\nWellStar also has a proposed deal in place to acquire West Georgia Health.\nMeanwhile, many other Georgia hospitals, including Athens Regional, are seeking partners as well.\nHospitals in Georgia and around the nation have sought alliances or mergers to help weather the rapid changes in health care, many of which were sparked by the Affordable Care Act.\nNorthside operates hospitals in Canton and Cumming as well as its flagship hospital in Sandy Springs, which it says delivers more babies than any other U.S. hospital and performs the most surgeries in Georgia."}
