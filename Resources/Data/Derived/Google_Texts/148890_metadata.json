Clementa Pinckney\u2019s funeral Friday (June 26), President Obama spoke of the black church as the bulwark of the people, of gun violence and racism. But he wove it all in to a meditation on God\u2019s grace. Here is the video and the full text as released and annotated by the White House. Note that the written text does not convey fully the impact, at the end of the president singing the hymn a cappella.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Giving all praise and honor to God. (Applause.)\n\nThe Bible calls us to hope. To persevere, and have faith in things not seen.\n\n\u201cThey were still living by faith when they died,\u201d Scripture tells us. \u201cThey did not receive the things promised; they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance, admitting that they were foreigners and strangers on Earth.\u201d\n\nWe are here today to remember a man of God who lived by faith. A man who believed in things not seen. A man who believed there were better days ahead, off in the distance. A man of service who persevered, knowing full well he would not receive all those things he was promised, because he believed his efforts would deliver a better life for those who followed.\n\nTo Jennifer, his beloved wife; to Eliana and Malana, his beautiful, wonderful daughters; to the Mother Emanuel family and the people of Charleston, the people of South Carolina.\n\nI cannot claim to have the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well. But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina, back when we were both a little bit younger. (Laughter.) Back when I didn\u2019t have visible grey hair. (Laughter.) The first thing I noticed was his graciousness, his smile, his reassuring baritone, his deceptive sense of humor \u2014 all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation.\n\nFriends of his remarked this week that when Clementa Pinckney entered a room, it was like the future arrived; that even from a young age, folks knew he was special. Anointed. He was the progeny of a long line of the faithful \u2014 a family of preachers who spread God\u2019s word, a family of protesters who sowed change to expand voting rights and desegregate the South. Clem heard their instruction, and he did not forsake their teaching.\n\nHe was in the pulpit by 13, pastor by 18, public servant by 23. He did not exhibit any of the cockiness of youth, nor youth\u2019s insecurities; instead, he set an example worthy of his position, wise beyond his years, in his speech, in his conduct, in his love, faith, and purity.\n\nAs a senator, he represented a sprawling swath of the Lowcountry, a place that has long been one of the most neglected in America. A place still wracked by poverty and inadequate schools; a place where children can still go hungry and the sick can go without treatment. A place that needed somebody like Clem. (Applause.)\n\nHis position in the minority party meant the odds of winning more resources for his constituents were often long. His calls for greater equity were too often unheeded, the votes he cast were sometimes lonely. But he never gave up. He stayed true to his convictions. He would not grow discouraged. After a full day at the capitol, he\u2019d climb into his car and head to the church to draw sustenance from his family, from his ministry, from the community that loved and needed him. There he would fortify his faith, and imagine what might be.\n\nReverend Pinckney embodied a politics that was neither mean, nor small. He conducted himself quietly, and kindly, and diligently. He encouraged progress not by pushing his ideas alone, but by seeking out your ideas, partnering with you to make things happen. He was full of empathy and fellow feeling, able to walk in somebody else\u2019s shoes and see through their eyes. No wonder one of his senate colleagues remembered Senator Pinckney as \u201cthe most gentle of the 46 of us \u2014 the best of the 46 of us.\u201d\n\nClem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant. But the person who asked probably didn\u2019t know the history of the AME church. (Applause.) As our brothers and sisters in the AME church know, we don\u2019t make those distinctions. \u201cOur calling,\u201d Clem once said, \u201cis not just within the walls of the congregation, but\u2026the life and community in which our congregation resides.\u201d (Applause.)\n\nHe embodied the idea that our Christian faith demands deeds and not just words; that the \u201csweet hour of prayer\u201d actually lasts the whole week long \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that to put our faith in action is more than individual salvation, it\u2019s about our collective salvation; that to feed the hungry and clothe the naked and house the homeless is not just a call for isolated charity but the imperative of a just society.\n\nWhat a good man. Sometimes I think that\u2019s the best thing to hope for when you\u2019re eulogized \u2014 after all the words and recitations and resumes are read, to just say someone was a good man. (Applause.)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be of high station to be a good man. Preacher by 13. Pastor by 18. Public servant by 23. What a life Clementa Pinckney lived. What an example he set. What a model for his faith. And then to lose him at 41 \u2014 slain in his sanctuary with eight wonderful members of his flock, each at different stages in life but bound together by a common commitment to God.\n\nCynthia Hurd. Susie Jackson. Ethel Lance. DePayne Middleton-Doctor. Tywanza Sanders. Daniel L. Simmons. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton. Myra Thompson. Good people. Decent people. God-fearing people. (Applause.) People so full of life and so full of kindness. People who ran the race, who persevered. People of great faith.\n\nTo the families of the fallen, the nation shares in your grief. Our pain cuts that much deeper because it happened in a church. The church is and always has been the center of African-American life \u2014 (applause) \u2014 a place to call our own in a too often hostile world, a sanctuary from so many hardships.\n\nOver the course of centuries, black churches served as \u201chush harbors\u201d where slaves could worship in safety; praise houses where their free descendants could gather and shout hallelujah \u2014 (applause) \u2014 rest stops for the weary along the Underground Railroad; bunkers for the foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement. They have been, and continue to be, community centers where we organize for jobs and justice; places of scholarship and network; places where children are loved and fed and kept out of harm\u2019s way, and told that they are beautiful and smart \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and taught that they matter. (Applause.) That\u2019s what happens in church.\n\nThat\u2019s what the black church means. Our beating heart. The place where our dignity as a people is inviolate. When there\u2019s no better example of this tradition than Mother Emanuel \u2014 (applause) \u2014 a church built by blacks seeking liberty, burned to the ground because its founder sought to end slavery, only to rise up again, a Phoenix from these ashes. (Applause.)\n\nWhen there were laws banning all-black church gatherings, services happened here anyway, in defiance of unjust laws. When there was a righteous movement to dismantle Jim Crow, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. preached from its pulpit, and marches began from its steps. A sacred place, this church. Not just for blacks, not just for Christians, but for every American who cares about the steady expansion \u2014 (applause) \u2014 of human rights and human dignity in this country; a foundation stone for liberty and justice for all. That\u2019s what the church meant. (Applause.)\n\nWe do not know whether the killer of Reverend Pinckney and eight others knew all of this history. But he surely sensed the meaning of his violent act. It was an act that drew on a long history of bombs and arson and shots fired at churches, not random, but as a means of control, a way to terrorize and oppress. (Applause.) An act that he imagined would incite fear and recrimination; violence and suspicion. An act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation\u2019s original sin.\n\nOh, but God works in mysterious ways. (Applause.) God has different ideas. (Applause.)\n\nHe didn\u2019t know he was being used by God. (Applause.) Blinded by hatred, the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group \u2014 the light of love that shone as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer circle. The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court \u2014 in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness. He couldn\u2019t imagine that. (Applause.)\n\nThe alleged killer could not imagine how the city of Charleston, under the good and wise leadership of Mayor Riley \u2014 (applause) \u2014 how the state of South Carolina, how the United States of America would respond \u2014 not merely with revulsion at his evil act, but with big-hearted generosity and, more importantly, with a thoughtful introspection and self-examination that we so rarely see in public life.\n\nBlinded by hatred, he failed to comprehend what Reverend Pinckney so well understood \u2014 the power of God\u2019s grace. (Applause.)\n\nThis whole week, I\u2019ve been reflecting on this idea of grace. (Applause.) The grace of the families who lost loved ones. The grace that Reverend Pinckney would preach about in his sermons. The grace described in one of my favorite hymnals \u2014 the one we all know: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. (Applause.) I once was lost, but now I\u2019m found; was blind but now I see. (Applause.)\n\nAccording to the Christian tradition, grace is not earned. Grace is not merited. It\u2019s not something we deserve. Rather, grace is the free and benevolent favor of God \u2014 (applause) \u2014 as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings. Grace.\n\nAs a nation, out of this terrible tragedy, God has visited grace upon us, for he has allowed us to see where we\u2019ve been blind. (Applause.) He has given us the chance, where we\u2019ve been lost, to find our best selves. (Applause.) We may not have earned it, this grace, with our rancor and complacency, and short-sightedness and fear of each other \u2014 but we got it all the same. He gave it to us anyway. He\u2019s once more given us grace. But it is up to us now to make the most of it, to receive it with gratitude, and to prove ourselves worthy of this gift.\n\nFor too long, we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens. (Applause.) It\u2019s true, a flag did not cause these murders. But as people from all walks of life, Republicans and Democrats, now acknowledge \u2014 including Governor Haley, whose recent eloquence on the subject is worthy of praise \u2014 (applause) \u2014 as we all have to acknowledge, the flag has always represented more than just ancestral pride. (Applause.) For many, black and white, that flag was a reminder of systemic oppression and racial subjugation. We see that now.\n\nRemoving the flag from this state\u2019s capitol would not be an act of political correctness; it would not be an insult to the valor of Confederate soldiers. It would simply be an acknowledgment that the cause for which they fought \u2014 the cause of slavery \u2014 was wrong \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the imposition of Jim Crow after the Civil War, the resistance to civil rights for all people was wrong. (Applause.) It would be one step in an honest accounting of America\u2019s history; a modest but meaningful balm for so many unhealed wounds. It would be an expression of the amazing changes that have transformed this state and this country for the better, because of the work of so many people of goodwill, people of all races striving to form a more perfect union. By taking down that flag, we express God\u2019s grace. (Applause.)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think God wants us to stop there. (Applause.) For too long, we\u2019ve been blind to the way past injustices continue to shape the present. Perhaps we see that now. Perhaps this tragedy causes us to ask some tough questions about how we can permit so many of our children to languish in poverty, or attend dilapidated schools, or grow up without prospects for a job or for a career. (Applause.)\n\nPerhaps it causes us to examine what we\u2019re doing to cause some of our children to hate. (Applause.) Perhaps it softens hearts towards those lost young men, tens and tens of thousands caught up in the criminal justice system \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and leads us to make sure that that system is not infected with bias; that we embrace changes in how we train and equip our police so that the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve make us all safer and more secure. (Applause.)\n\nMaybe we now realize the way racial bias can infect us even when we don\u2019t realize it, so that we\u2019re guarding against not just racial slurs, but we\u2019re also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal. (Applause.) So that we search our hearts when we consider laws to make it harder for some of our fellow citizens to vote. (Applause.) By recognizing our common humanity by treating every child as important, regardless of the color of their skin or the station into which they were born, and to do what\u2019s necessary to make opportunity real for every American \u2014 by doing that, we express God\u2019s grace. (Applause.)\n\nFor too long \u2014\n\nAUDIENCE: For too long!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: For too long, we\u2019ve been blind to the unique mayhem that gun violence inflicts upon this nation. (Applause.) Sporadically, our eyes are open: When eight of our brothers and sisters are cut down in a church basement, 12 in a movie theater, 26 in an elementary school. But I hope we also see the 30 precious lives cut short by gun violence in this country every single day; the countless more whose lives are forever changed \u2014 the survivors crippled, the children traumatized and fearful every day as they walk to school, the husband who will never feel his wife\u2019s warm touch, the entire communities whose grief overflows every time they have to watch what happened to them happen to some other place.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans \u2014 the majority of gun owners \u2014 want to do something about this. We see that now. (Applause.) And I\u2019m convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country \u2014 by making the moral choice to change, we express God\u2019s grace. (Applause.)\n\nWe don\u2019t earn grace. We\u2019re all sinners. We don\u2019t deserve it. (Applause.) But God gives it to us anyway. (Applause.) And we choose how to receive it. It\u2019s our decision how to honor it.\n\nNone of us can or should expect a transformation in race relations overnight. Every time something like this happens, somebody says we have to have a conversation about race. We talk a lot about race. There\u2019s no shortcut. And we don\u2019t need more talk. (Applause.) None of us should believe that a handful of gun safety measures will prevent every tragedy. It will not. People of goodwill will continue to debate the merits of various policies, as our democracy requires \u2014 this is a big, raucous place, America is. And there are good people on both sides of these debates. Whatever solutions we find will necessarily be incomplete.\n\nBut it would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, I believe, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again. (Applause.) Once the eulogies have been delivered, once the TV cameras move on, to go back to business as usual \u2014 that\u2019s what we so often do to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudice that still infects our society. (Applause.) To settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change \u2014 that\u2019s how we lose our way again.\n\nIt would be a refutation of the forgiveness expressed by those families if we merely slipped into old habits, whereby those who disagree with us are not merely wrong but bad; where we shout instead of listen; where we barricade ourselves behind preconceived notions or well-practiced cynicism.\n\nReverend Pinckney once said, \u201cAcross the South, we have a deep appreciation of history \u2014 we haven\u2019t always had a deep appreciation of each other\u2019s history.\u201d (Applause.) What is true in the South is true for America. Clem understood that justice grows out of recognition of ourselves in each other. That my liberty depends on you being free, too. (Applause.) That history can\u2019t be a sword to justify injustice, or a shield against progress, but must be a manual for how to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past \u2014 how to break the cycle. A roadway toward a better world. He knew that the path of grace involves an open mind \u2014 but, more importantly, an open heart.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve felt this week \u2014 an open heart. That, more than any particular policy or analysis, is what\u2019s called upon right now, I think \u2014 what a friend of mine, the writer Marilyn Robinson, calls \u201cthat reservoir of goodness, beyond, and of another kind, that we are able to do each other in the ordinary cause of things.\u201d\n\nThat reservoir of goodness. If we can find that grace, anything is possible. (Applause.) If we can tap that grace, everything can change. (Applause.)\n\nAmazing grace. Amazing grace.\n\n(Begins to sing) \u2014 Amazing grace \u2014 (applause) \u2014 how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me; I once was lost, but now I\u2019m found; was blind but now I see. (Applause.)\n\nClementa Pinckney found that grace.\n\nCynthia Hurd found that grace.\n\nSusie Jackson found that grace.\n\nEthel Lance found that grace.\n\nDePayne Middleton-Doctor found that grace.\n\nTywanza Sanders found that grace.\n\nDaniel L. Simmons, Sr. found that grace.\n\nSharonda Coleman-Singleton found that grace.\n\nMyra Thompson found that grace.\n\nThrough the example of their lives, they\u2019ve now passed it on to us. May we find ourselves worthy of that precious and extraordinary gift, as long as our lives endure. May grace now lead them home. May God continue to shed His grace on the United States of America.
