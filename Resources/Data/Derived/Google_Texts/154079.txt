Friday afternoon, the Panama City Fire Department, and other agencies responded to a boat fire at the Watson Bayou Marina off East 3rd Street and Maple Avenue in Millville.

The 35 foot Sport-Fishing type boat was located underneath the metal “barrel roof” of the covered slip and was moored with bow and stern lines to the dock.

The boat was engulfed in flames, and a large column of black smoke was visible.

The next slip to the West was occupied with a 40 foot Cabin Cruiser type boat and it was catching fire due to the radiant heat being given off, as was the dock itself and the associated wood pilings.

The firefighters used a hand line to extinguish the fire on the Cabin Cruiser and to start the attack on the Sport-Fishing boat.

Once the second Engine arrived and established a water supply source, a three inch attack line and a second hand line was staffed with personnel to attack the main body of the fire.

The fire was extinguished and all firefighters were ordered off of the boat due to the bow and stern coming dangerously close to the water line.

The boat’s stern eventually sank with the cabin-portion and aluminum bow railings remaining visible above the water.

After an investigation by the Panama City Fire Department the cause was determined to be “accidental.”

The boat’s owner and a friend were on scene when the fire began with the friend receiving burn injuries.

He was transported to Bay Medical Center and then will likely be transferred to a Burn Center.
