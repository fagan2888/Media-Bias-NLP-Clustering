Haley VA Hospital in Tampa to show the staff his progress. He was severely injured in 2009 and spent two years recovering at Haley\u2019s Polytrauma Center.\n\nRemsburg was on his tenth deployment when he was injured by an IED in Afghanistan. His teammates found him face down in a water-filled canal with shrapnel in his brain.\n\nHe was in a coma when he arrived at the Haley.\n\nMore than 800 patients have come through the polytrauma system according to Haley Chief of Staff Dr. Edward Cutolo, but he remembers Remsburg.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a hard one to forget. He was very ill when he came here, very ill,\u201d Cutolo said.\n\nAnd Remsburg has not forgotten them, the therapists, nurses and doctors.\n\nHe returned this year with one goal in mind, to walk, unassisted to Dr. Steven Scott, director of the Haley Polytrauma Center.\n\nTrailed closely by his stepmother, Annie Remsburg, Cory Remsburg successfully navigated about a 10-foot stretch, unaided, and was greeted with a handshake from Dr. Scott and applause from onlookers.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s so interesting about Cory\u2019s story is he was told by so many, so many people said he couldn\u2019t do things. \u2018You\u2019re not going to walk, you\u2019re not going to do this. You know what I mean,'\u201d Scott said. \u201cSo, Cory always said, \u2018Yes, I\u2019m going to, yes I can.\u2019\u201d\n\nCory Remsburg responds slowly, \u201cBeing a Ranger, I had the mental part down. It\u2019s the physical part I\u2019m learning to overcome.\u201d\n\nHis speech is labored because he had to learn to speak all over again. That\u2019s just one of many things he\u2019s had to overcome: dozens of surgeries, blindness in his right eye, a partially paralyzed left side.\n\nHe was in a coma more than three months. The treatments and people at Haley brought him back.\n\nCraig Remsburg, credits a combination of \u2018the man above\u2019, Haley\u2019s Emerging Consciousness Program, family and familiarity for bringing his son back.\n\n\u201cWe knew that he loved vanilla extract, so we would burn that aroma. We would play Scrubs, he loved Scrubs. So, we had that playing always on a reel,\u201d Craig Remsburg said.\n\nThere was no great awakening like in a movie. Instead, it was gradual and took a lot of hard work every day for two years.\n\nAs soon as Cory could eat solid food, Dr. Scott would sneak him two Boston Cream doughnuts each morning as incentive. And even though Cory now lives in Arizona \u2013 Dr. Scott is still motivating his prized patient.\n\nHe asked Cory for his goals which are to walk independently for a sustainable distance and then run.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I hoped you would say. I\u2019ll give you a third,\u201d Dr. Scott said. \u201cRun up hill. Alright? The reason why you run uphill is because the view is better.\u201d\n\nAt that suggestion, Cory smiled, held up his large cup of coffee as a toast affirming his new goals and said, \u201cHe knows me.\u201d\n\nThis coverage is part of the WUSF Veterans Coming Home project which is made possible by a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/army-ranger-cory-remsburg-leads-way", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201409/350633263.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Army Ranger Cory Remsburg 'Leads the Way'"}, "org_id": 671, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "wordCount": 632, "dc": {"title": "Army Ranger Cory Remsburg &#039;Leads the Way&#039;"}, "nid": 7921, "datePublished": "2014-09-24", "story_id": 349869009, "keywords": "veteran, Department of Veterans Affairs, James A.
