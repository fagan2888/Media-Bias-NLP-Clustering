All of our organizations \u2013 you must find a way to get involved in the health and wellness of our communities.\u201d\n\nCooperation shouldn\u2019t be limited to advocacy groups, said Mary Wakefield, acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cPart of our job is to help others in our community see their value-add,\u201d she said. \u201cThe health of a community is a product of all of us coming together. I think it\u2019s being mindful, being open \u2013 creating porous borders, if you will.\u201d\n\nWakefield touted several Affordable Care Act provisions that address the health needs of local communities, including the expansion of funding for community health centers and for the National Health Service Corps, which provides loan forgiveness for medical providers who agree to practice in underserved areas.\n\nMike Sherry is a reporter for KCPT television in Kansas City, Mo., a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Something as simple as schoolyard gates can play a role in improving the health of low-income communities.
