The smaller companies represent those with revenue of $25 to $325 million.\n\nAt the mid-sized, companies, those with revenues of $325 to $650 million, and at largest companies, with revenues of $650 million to $1 billion, board compensation increased by 4 and 7 percent, respectively.\n\nStock awards continue to make the bulk of the compensation package, making up close to half, 47 percent, of all board compensation packages in 2014, the study said.\n\nThe second largest portion was retainers and fees, which made up 39 percent of the compensation package.\n\nThe survey found a slight decline in stock options, which decreased to 8 percent of the compensation package from 10 percent in 2013.\n\n\"Compensation packages are increasingly reflective of the growing pressure on boards to be more accountable for the performance of the organization as a whole,\" said Randy Ramirez, a senior director in the Global Employer Services Practice at BDO. \"Mid-size companies are also following the trend toward eliminating meeting fees for board members and moving towards an all-retainer approach. This is in an effort to realize the notion of role equalization, versus the prior practice of weighting some roles heavier and compensating them at a premium rate, and communicate that all roles are important and meetings are mandatory.\"\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-executive-compensation-increased-8-percent-year-over-year-study-finds", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/hospital%20executives.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Stock awards continue to make the bulk of the compensation package, making up close to half of all board compensation packages in 2014, the study said.", "title": "Healthcare executive compensation increased 8 percent year over year, study finds"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/hospital%20executives.png"}, "description": "Stock awards continue to make the bulk of the compensation package, making up close to half of all board compensation packages in 2014, the study said.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Healthcare executive compensation increased 8 percent year over year, study finds"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Average healthcare director compensation grew to $176,749 in fiscal year 2014, an 8 percent increase from $163,069 in fiscal year 2013, according to a study released Nov. 17 by the accounting and consulting firm BDO.&#13; Healthcare executives made the third largest percentage gains in compensation across eight different industries, after those leading energy companies and in the retail sector, according to the study.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The non-banking financial services sector was the only one to see a decline in director compensation, the study found.\nStock awards continue to make the bulk of the compensation package, making up close to half, 47 percent, of all board compensation packages in 2014, the study said.\nAverage healthcare director compensation grew to $176,749 in fiscal year 2014, an 8 percent increase from $163,069 in fiscal year 2013, according to a study released Nov. 17 by the accounting and consulting firm BDO.\nDirector compensation at smaller companies declined 2 percent in 2014, after an increase of 15 percent from 2012 to 2013.\nHealthcare executives made the third largest percentage gains in compensation across eight different industries, after those leading energy companies and in the retail sector, according to the study."}
