An appointee of President Bill Clinton, Garland is a graduate of Harvard and Harvard Law School. As a Justice Department lawyer he supervised the investigations in the Unabomber case as well as the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nSenate Republicans do not plan to vet or have hearings on the nominee, and say the next President should be able to choose Scalia\u2019s replacement. Obama and Democrats argue that with 10 months left in his term, there is plenty of time for the Senate to take up and confirm a new justice.\n\nObama will formally unveil his pick at 11 a.m. ET in the White House Rose Garden he told supporters in an email Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve devoted a considerable amount of time and deliberation to this decision,\u201d Obama wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve consulted with legal experts and people across the political spectrum, both inside and outside government. And we\u2019ve reached out to every member of the Senate, who each have a responsibility to do their job and take this nomination just as seriously.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s announcement amplifies the ongoing political battle over the precedent and propriety of considering a Supreme Court nomination amid a heated presidential election.\n\nThe announcement comes after a big night in the 2016 election, with both party\u2019s front-runners \u2014 Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump \u2014 emerging with sweeping victories as they march toward their respective nominations. Some believed Obama would time his pick so it wouldn\u2019t get lost in the election obsession. But the timing seems suited to directly insert the selection into the political conversation.\n\nFueling the argument is the potential for the first shift in the court\u2019s ideological leaning in two decades. If confirmed, Obama\u2019s nominee will likely offer a vastly different legal outlook that Scalia, who was considered one of the court\u2019s most conservative members.\n\nAt 63, Garland is much older than the other contenders on the short list such as Judges Sri Srinivasan and Paul Watford. Garland\u2019s supporters argue he is the nominee that the senators couldn\u2019t refuse even in a contentious environment. \u201cHe\u2019s the establishment of the establishment,\u201d one backer said.\n\nThis is Obama\u2019s third nomination to the high court. Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan were confirmed in 2009 and 2010, respectively. But those confirmation hearings and votes occurred when Democrats were firmly in control of the Senate.\n\nAll eyes on Senate Republicans\n\nSince Scalia\u2019s death and for the foreseeable future, the court has operated with eight justices, four appointed by Democrats and four by Republicans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the GOP chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Charles Grassley of Iowa, have both expressed little leeway in their determination to forgo hearings for Obama\u2019s nominee.\n\nThere have been dissenters on the Republican side, particularly from moderate Republicans. But their ability to force hearings before the full judiciary panel appear slim.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it will be difficult for them to change tactics now.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how at this point they can go back on this promise,\u201d not to move on the nominee, Toobin said Wednesday morning.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have already begun a campaign to pressure Republicans into considering Obama\u2019s nomination. In their sights: vulnerable senators up for reelection, some of whom are already facing backlash from opponents for refusing to consider even a hypothetical Obama nominee.\n\nPolls show most Americans do support giving a nominee a nomination hearing. A CNN/ORC survey taken late last month indicated sizable majorities of Republicans, Democrats and independents want Senate Republican leaders to hold hearings on the nominee.\n\nGrassley last week said the Senate retained a prerogative to forgo hearings for Obama\u2019s selection.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t any different if the President of the United States notifies Congress well in advance of a piece of legislation that he\u2019s going to veto it,\u201d Grassley said at a Judiciary panel hearing, citing criticism from Republicans over the role of the high court.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s today or tomorrow or whether it\u2019s for the next seven or eight months, this is a very important debate that we ought to have about the Constitution and about not only who\u2019s going to be a replacement for Justice Scalia but about the role of the Supreme Court,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the grassroots of America, there\u2019s a real feeling of \u2018Is the Supreme Court doing what the Constitution requires?'\u201d\n\nGOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump said he agrees with the stance of the Hill Republicans. \u201cI think the next president should make the pick. And I think they shouldn\u2019t go forward. And I believe I\u2019m pretty much in line with what the Republicans are saying,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Wednesday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes 32 days after Scalia\u2019s death, only slightly longer than it took him to name his two previous appointments to the high court. Unlike his nominations of Sotomayor and Kagan, the vacancy this time wasn\u2019t expected. White House officials have said they weren\u2019t anticipating another Supreme Court nomination during Obama\u2019s term ahead of Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nObama oversaw a team led by his counsel Neil Eggleston, chief of staff Denis McDonough, and his senior adviser Brian Deese to select and vet a group of potential nominees. After conducting interviews last week, Obama narrowed his list to include Merrick, Watford and Srinivasan, each of them considered \u201cconsensus\u201d candidates for their history in gaining confirmation support from Republicans.\n\nAny replacement of Scalia has the power to tilt the ideological balance of the court for decades, something conservatives are using to move their base to hold the line.\n\n\u201cThis seat could be transformational to the court because Justice Scalia\u2019s fidelity to the Constitution was a real anchor for the court. If he were replaced by an Obama nominee that would give the court a solid five votes for enacting an extremely liberal agenda that the American people will not be comfortable with,\u201d Carrie Severino, of Judicial Crisis Network , a conservative group opposed to any candidate getting a hearing until after the election. It would shift the court \u2013that is somewhat balanced \u2013to a liberal stronghold. She is a former clerk of Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nSince Scalia\u2019s death, justices have been considering several major cases, including a challenge to public sector unions, a race-conscious admissions plan at the University of Texas, the first big abortion case since 2007, challenges to voting rights, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate and a challenge to Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Scalia\u2019s death means not only the loss of the court\u2019s main conservative voice but also increases the likelihood of a 4-4 split on controversial issues. If the court is equally divided in a case, ruling 4-4, it means the lower court opinion stands and there is no precedent set by the Supreme Court.\n\nBy Kevin Liptak, Manu Raju and Ariane de Vogue\n\nCNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court Wednesday morning, multiple congressional sources tell CNN, setting up a dramatic political fight with Senate Republicans who have vowed to block any replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX2now.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court Wednesday morning, multiple congressional sources tell CNN, setting up a dramatic political fight with S\u2026", "title": "Obama nominates Merrick Garland to Supreme Court", "url": "http://fox2now.com/2016/03/16/obama-to-nominate-merrick-garland-to-supreme-court/", "image": {"width": 941, "identifier": "https://localtvktvi.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/s006643842.jpg?w=941", "height": 1200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvktvi.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/s006643842.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox2now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox2now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "St. Louis News, Weather & Sports From FOX 2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339559940", "fb": {"pages": 48244074227}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox2now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/755e6b237618f1b2fe250cb518a56c05?s=16", "application-name": "FOX2now.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox2now", "published_time": "2016-03-16T14:03:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-16T14:03:16+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox2now"}, "keywords": "merrick garland", "google-site-verification": "v2FI_hS3rbbnwol7DXZ8ZI4CeJjQgWkN7jruGb7UZfc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Merrick Garland"}, "article_summary": "If the court is equally divided in a case, ruling 4-4, it means the lower court opinion stands and there is no precedent set by the Supreme Court.\n\u201cAt the grassroots of America, there\u2019s a real feeling of \u2018Is the Supreme Court doing what the Constitution requires?\nWhite House officials have said they weren\u2019t anticipating another Supreme Court nomination during Obama\u2019s term ahead of Scalia\u2019s death.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Barack Obama will nominate Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court Wednesday morning, multiple congressional sources tell CNN, setting up a dramatic political fight with Senate Republicans who have vowed to block any replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\nIn their sights: vulnerable senators up for reelection, some of whom are already facing backlash from opponents for refusing to consider even a hypothetical Obama nominee."}
