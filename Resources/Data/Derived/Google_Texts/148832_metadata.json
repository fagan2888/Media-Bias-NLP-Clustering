Affirmation president Randall Hacker says he\u2019s expecting about 300 people at the gathering.\n\nSteve Young and his wife are scheduled to speak Saturday night. Young is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and played football at Brigham Young University.\n\nThe Youngs said in a statement they are happy to be a part of the conference and \u201clend their voices to the healing work of making our families, our society and our church more welcoming places for our LGBT brothers and sisters.\u201d\n\nHaving Young, a role model for both Mormons and young athletes, speak at the conference is yet another sign of a growing movement among straight Mormons to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender brethren, Hacker said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what changed things: the straight people coming out in support,\u201d Hacker said. \u201cFor years, LGBT members were alone in fighting for their own. We will have more allies at this conference than ever before.\u201d\n\nHe said the Youngs already support a project dedicated to helping LGBT youth in crisis and also spoke out against California\u2019s Proposition 8, a ballot measure passed by voter in 2008 that banned gay marriage. The Mormon church was one of the main backers of the law.\n\n\u201cHe lends another strong voice, especially with Mormons in the inter-mountain west,\u201d Hacker said.\n\nBenji Schwimmer, an openly gay professional dancer who grew up Mormon, will speak Friday and give a dance performance Saturday night. He is a past winner of the show, \u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\u201d\n\nThe LDS church still teaches its members that marriage is between a man and a woman, and that same-sex relationships are sinful. But the church launched a campaign earlier this year encouraging members to be more compassionate toward gay and lesbian members of the church. The church welcomes members who experience \u201csame-sex attraction\u201d as long as they don\u2019t act on those feelings.\n\nThe church also threw its support behind a new policy passed this year by the Boy Scouts of America that opens the door for gay youth to join the ranks, while continuing to ban gay adult Scout leaders.\n\nSeveral groups have formed around the country to support gay Mormons, and hundreds have marched in gay pride parades to show their backing.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Steve Young to speak at Mormon conference on LGBT relations", "title": "Steve Young to speak at Mormon conference on LGBT relations", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/13/steve-young-to-speak-at-mormon-conference-on-lgbt-relations/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__059a23ca-90ea-4c84-9c13-44d7a94b9efbp2.jpg", "height": 367}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130914__059a23ca-90ea-4c84-9c13-44d7a94b9efbp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T04:03:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:55:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6e7\"", "article_summary": "Several groups have formed around the country to support gay Mormons, and hundreds have marched in gay pride parades to show their backing.\nThe Mormon church was one of the main backers of the law.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what changed things: the straight people coming out in support,\u201d Hacker said.\nYoung is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and played football at Brigham Young University.\nBenji Schwimmer, an openly gay professional dancer who grew up Mormon, will speak Friday and give a dance performance Saturday night."}
