Immigration officials wanted to remove him from the country a sixth time when he was released from San Francisco jail in April despite a federal detainer request.\n\nSan Francisco police ballistics expert Andy Smith testified Wednesday during a preliminary hearing to determine if there\u2019s enough evidence to try Lopez-Sanchez for murder.\n\nSmith said the hollow-point bullet that killed Kate Steinle, 32, was flattened on one side.\n\n\u201cThe bullet struck a very hard surface \u2026 concrete, steel, very hard metal,\u201d Smith testified.\n\nLopez-Sanchez said he found the Sig Sauer .40-caliber pistol wrapped in a t-shirt under a bench on San Francisco\u2019s pier 14. The gun belonged to a Bureau of Land Management ranger, who reported that his service weapon was stolen from his car in downtown San Francisco in June.\n\nDivers plucked the gun from the San Francisco Bay next to the pier the day after the shooting.\n\nSmith testified that the gun was in good, working condition and that the weapon probably didn\u2019t malfunction.\n\n\u201cPulling the trigger, however that trigger was pulled, was the only way for that gun to discharge,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThis gun could not just be sitting on a table and all of a sudden, due to some malfunction, go off.\u201d\n\nLopez-Sanchez\u2019 attorney Matt Gonzalez suggested that his client \u201cmishandled\u201d the gun, which needs about five pounds of pressure to pull the trigger and successfully fire.\n\nThe preliminary hearing is expected to wrap up Wednesday and a judge will decide if Lopez-Sanchez should face trial.\n\nLopez-Sanchez was brought into court for a second day under heavy security. He was shackled at the waist and ankles. He spent much of the morning yawning, rubbing his eyes and dozing as Smith held up and discussed the gun used to kill Steinle.\n\nOn Tuesday, homicide detective Nico Discenza recounted his interview of Steinle\u2019s father, Jim Steinle.\n\nJim Steinle told Discenza that he had his arm around his daughter as they strolled along San Francisco\u2019s popular Pier 14.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a loud \u201cpop\u201d and Kate Steinle slumped to the ground, moaning \u201cDad, help me, help me,\u201d he testified Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe thought her cellphone blew up,\u201d Discenza said.\n\nJim Steinle has since traveled to Washington, D.C., to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and to urge lawmakers to abolish local policies of ignoring federal immigration requests for cooperation with deportations.\n\nSan Francisco and other cities and counties ignore requests from federal authorities to detain jail inmates who are thought to be in the country illegally.\n\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he was following city law when jailers released Lopez-Sanchez after a 20-year-old marijuana possession charge was dropped. But leading politicians, including top Democrats such as California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, said Lopez-Sanchez should have been detained.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bullet that killed a young San Francisco woman may have ricocheted before striking her in the back while she was sightseeing with her father along the city's popular waterfront, a ballistic expert testified Wednesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The bullet that killed a young San Francisco woman may have ricocheted before striking her in the back while she was sightseeing with her father along the city\u2019s popular waterfront, a ballistic expert testified Wednesday.", "title": "Ballistic expert testifies in San Francisco pier murder case", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/26/san-francisco-judge-deciding-if-murder-suspect-sta/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/25/f0edeefe25001426800f6a706700a301.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/25/f0edeefe25001426800f6a706700a301.jpg", "description": "The bullet that killed a young San Francisco woman may have ricocheted before striking her in the back while she was sightseeing with her father along the city's popular waterfront, a ballistic expert", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ballistic expert testifies in San Francisco pier murder case"}, "Author": "PAUL ELIAS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd88c1\"", "article_summary": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The bullet that killed a young San Francisco woman may have ricocheted before striking her in the back while she was sightseeing with her father along the city\u2019s popular waterfront, a ballistic expert testified Wednesday.\nSan Francisco police ballistics expert Andy Smith testified Wednesday during a preliminary hearing to determine if there\u2019s enough evidence to try Lopez-Sanchez for murder.\nThe testimony could prove important after Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez admitted to firing the fatal shot, but said it was an accident.\nDivers plucked the gun from the San Francisco Bay next to the pier the day after the shooting.\nSan Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he was following city law when jailers released Lopez-Sanchez after a 20-year-old marijuana possession charge was dropped."}
