Last month, the Bracy Family dismissed its lawsuit after the addition of health plans to the exchange that will not require them to pay for abortions.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Barth and Abbie Bracy Family of Dayville, Connecticut on the Rhode Island border, were forced onto the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange when their health insurance plan was cancelled in October of 2013 along with those of many other Americans.\n\n\u201cWe liked our insurance plan and wanted to keep it, but couldn\u2019t because it was cancelled due to Obamacare,\u201d Bracy told Breitbart News during an interview that included his attorney, Senior Counsel Casey Mattox of Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), which represented the family in the lawsuit.\n\nBracy, who is the executive director of Rhode Island State Right to Life, said that after his insurance was cancelled, he looked at Connecticut\u2019s Access Health CT Obamacare exchange to see which plans would not cover elective abortions.\n\n\u201cEven though Obamacare specifies that plans that do not offer abortions must be listed, I couldn\u2019t find any information,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cBarth is incredibly well-informed about abortion coverage,\u201d Mattox told Breitbart News, \u201cyet even he couldn\u2019t find any information about it in the Connecticut exchange or figure out how to readily get it. Finally, he learned that all the plans covered abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier to find IRS emails than to find out if your health insurance covers abortion,\u201d joked Mattox. \u201cYou need a working knowledge of the Hyde Amendment and you need to be like Barth Bracy and look to see if every month you\u2019re paying into a fund to pay for other people\u2019s abortions.\u201d\n\nIn fact, in October of last year, then-Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Kathleen Sebelius told members of Congress that she did not know if she could provide Americans with a list of which plans fund abortions when they enroll in the exchanges.\n\nBracy explained that because federal law prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion, Obamacare requires every exchange health insurance plan that includes abortion to collect a separate \u201cabortion surcharge\u201d fee to pay for these procedures. The surcharge, however, is not enumerated in the premium but is, instead, added to the total.\n\n\u201cIt must be a separate fee collected from each enrollee each month,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut, nobody is doing that and they\u2019re not following the law.\u201d\n\nIn September, the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute (CLI) reported that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released its account of 1,036 federally subsidized health insurance plans that cover elective abortions.\n\n\u201c[I]nsurance consumers were frequently not informed of this coverage before enrolling; and plan issuers are not billing elective abortion coverage separately despite a legal requirement,\u201d said CLI. \u201cThe report also makes public for the first time a complete list identifying every plan by name that covers elective abortion and those that do not in the states that permit coverage on the insurance exchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots of secrecy and confusion about coverage of abortion in the Obamacare exchange plans,\u201d Mattox continued. \u201cFour states still require all plans to cover abortion and have an abortion surcharge: Rhode Island, Vermont, New Jersey, and Hawaii.\u201d\n\nAccording to ADF, \u201cAll plans nationwide that include abortion coverage require the surcharge, but the ACA [Obamacare] requires that it not be separately disclosed in the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf everyone who signed on to the Obamacare exchanges were to get a bill for an \u2018abortion surcharge,\u2019 that would make a huge difference,\u201d Mattox said. \u201cPeople would not sign up for plans and there would be transparency.\u201d\n\nMattox went on to explain that in the Bracys\u2019 case, the stipulation from Connecticut was that at least two and up to four health insurance plans on the exchange would not have the abortion surcharge. Subsequently, ADF, on behalf of the Bracys, voluntarily dismissed the case.\n\nAdditionally, Mattox said Americans should be aware that, in half of the states, including Connecticut, people have already been in exchange insurance plans, and paying for abortions, for a year.\n\n\u201cThese people have a right to have money refunded to them and the right to have the surcharge stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cAmericans have the right to protect their own family\u2019s health without paying for other peoples\u2019 abortions.\u201d\n\nBracy said he believes the best recourse for all Americans who do not wish to pay for abortions is for Congress to pass Rep. Chris Smith\u2019s (R-NJ) \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder Obamacare, billions of dollars in the form of tax credits are today buying abortion-subsidizing health insurance plans in exchanges throughout the country,\u201d said Smith when he announced his bill. \u201cFor example, of the 112 health insurance plans available to members of Congress and staff, most, that is, 103 plans pay for abortion on demand.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmericans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health,\u201d said Mattox. \u201cThe Bracy family has experienced first-hand the kind of deception that was used to pass and that continues to pervade this law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Life Family No Longer Forced to Pay Obamacare 'Abortion Surcharge'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Pro-Life Family No Longer Forced to Pay Obamacare 'Abortion Surcharge'", "title": "Pro-Life Family No Longer Forced to Pay Obamacare 'Abortion Surcharge' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/20/Abortion-Baby.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/12/10/pro-life-family-no-longer-forced-to-pay-obamacare-abortion-surcharge/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pro-Life Family No Longer Forced to Pay Obamacare 'Abortion Surcharge'", "title": "Pro-Life Family No Longer Forced to Pay Obamacare 'Abortion Surcharge' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/11/20/Abortion-Baby.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "published_time": "2014-12-10T08:24:15-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1249\"", "article_summary": "Bracy explained that because federal law prohibits taxpayer funding of abortion, Obamacare requires every exchange health insurance plan that includes abortion to collect a separate \u201cabortion surcharge\u201d fee to pay for these procedures.\nLast month, the Bracy Family dismissed its lawsuit after the addition of health plans to the exchange that will not require them to pay for abortions.\n\u201c[I]nsurance consumers were frequently not informed of this coverage before enrolling; and plan issuers are not billing elective abortion coverage separately despite a legal requirement,\u201d said CLI.\nFinally, he learned that all the plans covered abortion.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s easier to find IRS emails than to find out if your health insurance covers abortion,\u201d joked Mattox.\n\u201cBarth is incredibly well-informed about abortion coverage,\u201d Mattox told Breitbart News, \u201cyet even he couldn\u2019t find any information about it in the Connecticut exchange or figure out how to readily get it."}
