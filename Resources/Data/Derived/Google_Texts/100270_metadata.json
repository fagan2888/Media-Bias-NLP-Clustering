Don\u2019t be surprised if you get corralled for some extra-vigorous pat-downs. And good luck if they find a GPS on you. You just branded yourself as a likely terrorist suspect, according to a 92-point TSA checklist recently obtained by \u201cThe Intercept.\u201d\n\nThe list is grouped into different categories\u2014\u201cfear factors,\u201d \u201cdeception factors\u201d\u2014with a point system attached. Do you appear to be confused or disoriented? That will be 3 points. Are you repeatedly patting your upper body with your hands, possibly to make sure you didn\u2019t forget your cell phone/wallet/passport/any number of other things travelers constantly check? Also 3 points!\n\n\u201cExaggerated yawning\u201d and \u201cfacial flushing\u201d during the checkpoint are worth 1 point each. Because travelers are definitely never tired and embarrassed when having their groins man-handled by a stranger! Totally suspicious.\n\nComplaining about the screening process will, obviously, put you on Terror Watch, as well as whistling or arriving late to your flight. \u201cWearing improper attire for location\u201d is 2 points\u2014although what constitutes \u201cimproper,\u201d particularly in an airport, where anything from pajamas to a business suit generally goes, is left undefined.\n\nIf you are sufficiently suspicious, the checklist advises agents to pull you aside and search for \u201cunusual items,\u201d like almanacs, a GPS (a GPS is \u201cunusual\u201d for travelers?) or prepaid calling cards and cell phones. They are also to check for \u201csigns of deception,\u201d like \u201cexaggerated yawning\u201d (again) and \u201cexcessive throat clearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo single behavior alone will cause a traveler to be referred to additional screening or will result in a call to a law enforcement officer (LEO),\u201d the TSA told \u201cThe Intercept\u201d in a statement. \u201cOfficers are trained and audited to ensure referrals for additional screening are based only on observable behaviors and not race or ethnicity.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, a rigorous point system for when agents automatically notify a law enforcement officer\u2014two or more \u201csigns of deception,\u201d for example, would qualify\u2014so, \u201c\u2019Adam\u2019s Apple\u2019 jump\u201d + \u201cfast eye blink rate.\u201d\n\nThere are, however, some things that can also subtract points\u2014if you appear to be part of a married couple over the ages of 55, for example, or are a woman over the age of 55 or a man over 65.\n\nThe TSA\u2019s Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques program has been widely criticized as inefficient pseudoscience.
