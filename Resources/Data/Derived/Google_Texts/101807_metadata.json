Hard to see. The pipe was slow. There were lots of reasons to gripe about the biggest night in ski halfpipe history.\n\nBut the 12 skiers gathered atop their first-ever Olympic halfpipe threw down solid performances Tuesday night at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.\n\nCanadian Mike Riddle highlighted the most technical tricks in pipe skiing with back-to-back double-cork 1260s, earning silver.\n\nKevin Rolland showed how high skiers can fly above the pipe \u2014 it\u2019s much loftier than the snowboarders \u2014 and earned bronze.\n\nAnd Nevada nice guy David Wise \u2014 a husband and father \u2014 combined the technical with amplitude and style to earn ski halfpipe\u2019s first-ever Olympic gold medal.\n\nWise won the gold, but all the competitors agreed that freeskiing won Tuesday night when it showed the world a whole new way of riding the halfpipe. Up to that moment, the skiers often fielded the same quizzical responses from nonskiers when they described their high-flying sport.\n\n\u201cOh, like Shaun White, but on skis.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve heard that,\u201d Wise said.\n\nThe 23-year-old came closer to a hidden wish when he won his sport\u2019s first Olympic gold.\n\n\u201cI hope that Shaun someday gets the, \u2018Oh, so you are like David Wise but on a snowboard,\u2019 \u201d Wise said.\n\nIn many ways, there is a new ambassador to freeskiing, one who will bring the sport to the masses with a 2-year-old daughter on his hip, a darling wife by his side and a strong faith in God that helps dash the whole stoner-bro, hedonistic reputation of freeskiing.\n\n\u201cDave is, right now, on top of the sport. He\u2019s the best, and he\u2019s proven it multiple times,\u201d said Crested Butte\u2019s Aaron Blunck, a 17-year-old teammate of Wise\u2019s on the inaugural U.S. freeskiing halfpipe team who finished seventh. \u201cHe comes out in every condition, and he has amazing fun.\u201d\n\nWise had reached a plateau in his late teens. He wasn\u2019t winning the big shows. He struggled with injuries. Then he met Lexi. They married. Nayeli quickly followed.\n\nSuddenly, he started winning. Almost every contest he entered.\n\n\u201cI think that just leveled everything. There was no need to go out and compete just for competing. He had to learn to just kind of love and still come home to his family,\u201d said Tom Wise, tears spilling down his cheeks as he relished his son\u2019s magical moment.\n\nAt the bottom of the halfpipe, the Wise clan rowdily cheered for its man. Lexi \u2014 with the words \u201cGo World\u201d on her cheeks \u2014 waved a cut-out photo of 2-year-old Nayeli. Older sisters Christy and Jessica roared for every skier, not just their little brother.\n\n\u201cI was cheering for all of them,\u201d said Christy, who led a prayer for the safety of all the skiers before the contest. \u201cHave a good run, and show the world what halfpipe can do.\u201d\n\nWise said he was honored to carry the banner for freeskiing. Everyone agrees there couldn\u2019t be a better ambassador.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a selfish competitor,\u201d Wise said. \u201cEven Kevin (Rolland) or (Justin) Dorey \u2014 who are my biggest competitors \u2014 if they have something they want to learn and it\u2019s something I already know how to do, I\u2019m all about progressing the sport.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "American David Wise wins Olympic gold in ski halfpipe at Sochi Games", "title": "American David Wise wins Olympic gold in ski halfpipe at Sochi Games", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/18/american-david-wise-wins-olympic-gold-in-ski-halfpipe-at-sochi-games/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140218__ski-halfpipe-oly-blunck-021814p1.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140218__ski-halfpipe-oly-blunck-021814p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-18T09:58:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T21:04:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19ec\"", "article_summary": "But the 12 skiers gathered atop their first-ever Olympic halfpipe threw down solid performances Tuesday night at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park.\nWise won the gold, but all the competitors agreed that freeskiing won Tuesday night when it showed the world a whole new way of riding the halfpipe.\nHe\u2019s the best, and he\u2019s proven it multiple times,\u201d said Crested Butte\u2019s Aaron Blunck, a 17-year-old teammate of Wise\u2019s on the inaugural U.S. freeskiing halfpipe team who finished seventh.\n\u201cI hope that Shaun someday gets the, \u2018Oh, so you are like David Wise but on a snowboard,\u2019 \u201d Wise said.\nAnd Nevada nice guy David Wise \u2014 a husband and father \u2014 combined the technical with amplitude and style to earn ski halfpipe\u2019s first-ever Olympic gold medal."}
