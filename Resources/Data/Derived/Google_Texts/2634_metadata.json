Similar legislation was introduced this year or is pending in more than 20 other states, according to tracking by the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\nAs social media explodes in popularity, employers increasingly are concerned that what employees say in cyberspace could damage their business. Meanwhile, more workers are bringing their own smartphones and tablets into the office.\n\nSponsors of the legislation say the laws are needed to keep basic privacy rights apace with technology. \u201cFifty years ago, if somebody brought in a stack of personal correspondence and put it in their locker, the employer wouldn\u2019t demand to see it,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Kyle Loveless, Senate sponsor of Oklahoma\u2019s law, which was signed in May. \u201cIn today\u2019s time, people put (personal correspondence) online. An employer shouldn\u2019t have the right to see it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an employer, and as an employer I shouldn\u2019t have the right to demand that of an employee or a prospective employee,\u201d said Loveless, who operates a family orthopedic footwear business in Oklahoma City.\n\nLike several states, Wisconsin\u2019s law also prohibits college and school administrators, coaches and teachers from demanding access to students\u2019 personal accounts.\n\nRelated: HealthCare.gov Application Sets Off Privacy Alarm Bells\n\nEven many elementary school students now have smartphones loaded with personal information, said state Rep. Melissa Sargent, a Democrat from Madison who sponsored the law in the Wisconsin Assembly. A smartphone today, she said, is \u201cakin to a scrapbook\u201d in which previous generations kept baby pictures and postcards from grandparents. \u201cDo you bring a scrapbook to a job interview? Do you bring it to school and let everyone see it?\u201d\n\nMortified\n\nA case that helped initiate the flurry of laws wsa that of Robert Collins, a Maryland correctional supply officer who sought to return to work after taking family leave in 2010.\n\nCollins told the Maryland House Economic Matters Committee two years ago that he was \u201cmortified\u201d when a hiring investigator asked to log into his Facebook account as part of his reinstatement interview. The investigator said he was concerned about any gang connections. \u201cI said, \u2018you can\u2019t be serious,\u2019\u201d Collins testified. \u201cHe said, \u2018I am as serious as a heart attack.\u2019 I did not want to do it, but because I really needed my job and he implied that this was a condition of recertification, I reluctantly gave him my password.\u201d\n\nLike the 2012 Maryland law, other laws generally apply to state and local government, as well as private-sector employers. Most apply to accessing the personal accounts of job seekers, as well as employees. Like Wisconsin, many states also include colleges, where coaches seek to control what athletes say. Arkansas and Delaware aim their laws at colleges.\n\nRelated: Your Cellphone Has the Right to Remain Private, Court Rules\n\nMany states prohibit retaliation against employees who refuse to surrender their passwords. Some laws impose fines ranging from $500 to $1,000 for violations.\n\nThe laws reflect growing privacy concerns even as people are ramping up use of social media such as Facebook, which had about 160 million daily users in the U.S. and Canada in March, or Twitter, whose users send out an average of 115 million tweets a day in the U.S. Some 73 percent of American adults who go online now use social media, a December surveyby the Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet Project found. And 42 percent said they use more than one social networking site.\n\nAt the same time, 11 percent of Internet users say they\u2019ve tried to hide their online activity from an employer, supervisor or co-workers, another Pew Research survey found in September. Nearly 70 percent said it was very important that only they or those they authorized had access to their emails. (Stateline is also funded by Pew.)\n\n\u201cI think this is a visceral reaction,\u201d Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said of the flurry of state laws. \u201cPrivacy in the digital age is an incredibly hot topic.\u201d Whether the laws are justified by widespread abuse isn\u2019t clear. Loveless, who sponsored the Oklahoma law, and Sargent, the Wisconsin sponsor, said they had known of instances when employers asked for passwords.\n\nBut the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearing House, which collects citizen complaints of abuse, had none involving employers demanding social media passwords over the last two years. Executive Director Paul Stephens said states are passing the laws because the federal government hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough in protecting privacy as concerns have arisen.\n\nLittler Mendelson, the nation\u2019s biggest labor and employment law firm, found only 1 percent of the 417 business respondents it surveyed last year asked for social media logins as part of hiring.\n\nEmployers' Concerns\n\nBosses have related protections under the laws. Employers can access accounts on devices that they provide employees and, in many instances, if employees are using employer-provided access to the Internet. Some laws spell out that employees cannot divulge private company or government information that they have access to on the job. Others, like Oklahoma\u2019s, don\u2019t. But Loveless said, \u201cIf it\u2019s illegal to do before social media, it\u2019s illegal now.\u201d\n\nEmployers\u2019 concerns are legitimate as are their requests to access personal accounts, said Nancy Flynn, founder of the ePolicy Institute that advises employers on policy in the digital age. The financial, legal and competitive stakes are high if certain company information becomes public, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to protect their organization,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not just trying to snoop around and look at embarrassing photos. They are trying to protect their company, their customers, their investors.\u201d\n\nAs the laws have proliferated so has the practice of more workers taking their own mobile devices to work. And more employers are establishing policies on what employees cannot say about their work online, publicly and privately, on personal as well as employer-provided devices. The lines can blur between an employer\u2019s and personal devices. A survey of 447 human resources professionals earlier this year found 42 percent of employers subsidized employees\u2019 personal phones if they used them for business. And 41 percent offered a business phone for personal use, the survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found.\n\nIn Minneapolis, the city lets its employees use their own smartphones, laptops and tablets on the job when they choose. While there\u2019s no laundry list of rules on their use, employees are expected to follow city policy on what information isn\u2019t to be made public, whether on city-owned devices or not.\n\n\u201cWe trust people as professionals,\u201d said Otto Doll, the city\u2019s chief information officer and former chief information officer for South Dakota. \u201cWe say, \u2018We expect you to abide by the rules.\u2019\u201d The city doesn\u2019t demand passwords to its employees\u2019 online accounts, although the state of Minnesota doesn\u2019t have a law forbidding it. Nor does it monitor employees\u2019 activity, Doll said, only network security.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not the CIA or NSA,\u201d Doll said. \u201cIt boils down to people, their attitudes and their actions. We start with the position they\u2019re professionals and will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/09/Does-Your-State-Protect-You-Prying-Employers", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Does Your State Protect You from Prying Employers?"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/09/Does-Your-State-Protect-You-Prying-Employers", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9540\"", "article_summary": "As social media explodes in popularity, employers increasingly are concerned that what employees say in cyberspace could damage their business.\n\u201cI think this is a visceral reaction,\u201d Allie Bohm, advocacy and policy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said of the flurry of state laws.\nSome 73 percent of American adults who go online now use social media, a December surveyby the Pew Research Center\u2019s Internet Project found.\nBut the nonprofit Privacy Rights Clearing House, which collects citizen complaints of abuse, had none involving employers demanding social media passwords over the last two years.\nA survey of 447 human resources professionals earlier this year found 42 percent of employers subsidized employees\u2019 personal phones if they used them for business."}
