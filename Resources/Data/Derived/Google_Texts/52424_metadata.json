Trump insisted Cruz was lying and when on to declare he had \u201cmental problems.\u201d\n\n\u201c[C]ruz is the one that does the personal attacks on me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe \u2014 there has never been any politician or almost anybody in my life that I have seen that lies so much. He will \u2014 he will say I\u2019m against the Second Amendment. He will say I am against \u2014 that I\u2019m totally in favor of ObamaCare, which is ridiculous. These are things that are staples of what I\u2019m about. I\u2019m totally in favor of the Second Amendment. You know that because you\u2019ve seen the speeches. I want the Second Amendment. I\u2019d strengthen it if anything. He says, Donald Trump is either way. He\u2019ll just say things off the cuff. ObamaCare, I\u2019m absolutely, totally going to repeal it or replace it. And Ted Cruz says, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a big fan of ObamaCare.\u2019 You know, he is a disgrace, he is a liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, what I say \u2014 and by the way, I\u2019m not the only one to say that. Marco Rubio called him a liar during the debate,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThat\u2019s worst than what I said. But Marco Rubio actually had it with him when he called him a liar during \u2014 Ted Cruz is \u2014 he\u2019s serious \u2014 he\u2019s got a mental problem. Ted Cruz is a liar. He\u2019s got a problem. He is a liar. I have never seen anybody to that extent.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump: Cruz Has 'Mental Problems,' 'a Liar'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump: Cruz Has 'Mental Problems,' 'a Liar'", "title": "Trump: Cruz Has 'Mental Problems,' 'a Liar' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 532, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Trump216.jpg", "height": 399}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/02/16/trump-cruz-has-mental-problems-a-liar/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump: Cruz Has 'Mental Problems,' 'a Liar'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Trump216.jpg", "title": "Trump: Cruz Has 'Mental Problems,' 'a Liar' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Fox Business Network, Maria Bartiromo, Mornings with Maria, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-02-16T09:47:16-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But Marco Rubio actually had it with him when he called him a liar during \u2014 Ted Cruz is \u2014 he\u2019s serious \u2014 he\u2019s got a mental problem.\nTrump insisted Cruz was lying and when on to declare he had \u201cmental problems.\u201d\u201c[C]ruz is the one that does the personal attacks on me,\u201d Trump said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTuesday on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump criticized his opponent Sen.
