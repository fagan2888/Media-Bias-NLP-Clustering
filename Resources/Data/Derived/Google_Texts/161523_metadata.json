Circulating around social networks this week--the first person account was written by a friend of a friend of mine--is this grim (and long) tale from Medium.com.\n\nIt's about how when Peretz Partensky called 911 when he stumbled across an injured biker on a San Francisco street, it led to him being shoved, tackled, kneed in the temple, having an existing elbow injury exacerbated, cuffed face down on the street, his hands stomped on, arrested, told he \"was going to be a problem,\" denied medical attention, stripped and shoved into solitary confinement, then let out the next day. When he went to court he had his charges summarily dismissed.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nAfter 12 hours in jail, more than 6 of them in solitary confinement, the process of checking out was unremarkable. I signed a few papers. Retrieved my backpack. Confirmed the contents \u2014 laptop, wallet, phone, books and keys.\n\n\u201cThe charges will be dropped if you show up on Tuesday. If you don\u2019t show up, there will be a warrant for your arrest,\u201d I was casually informed.\n\n\u201cDeputy, should I have been here in the first place?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\nIt was almost too good to hear. \u201cThen why did I end up here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to consider the source.\u201d This phrase I remember verbatim.\n\n\u201cHow do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, there are a lot of young cops on the street, trying to make a name for themselves.\u201d.....\n\nOfficer Kaur\u2019s unnecessary escalation of a peaceful situation, culminating in the sadistic stomping on my cuffed hands is a severe professional failure that reflects poorly on the San Francisco Police Department. It does not surprise me that she and several of the other officers I encountered that night are currently in the middle of a lawsuit.....\n\nI painstakingly retrieved all possible documentation, including: the police report, transcript of radio chatter, audio of my 911 call, security footage from Radius restaurant (handed to me freely by the owner), Rebecca\u2019s and Josh\u2019s feedback, and collected photos from the incident and my injuries.\n\nI presented all of this to the SF Office of Citizen Complaints. The filing party is not allowed to know the outcome due to the Public Safety Officers Procedural Bill of Rights (POBAR) but may be notified if an internal investigation is initiated. Many months have passed since my complaint, and I have no sense of progress....\n\nI conclude with several public service announcements:\n\nDon\u2019t call 911. Obviously, there are exceptions, but the sad lesson is, there are fewer than you\u2019d think.\n\nCall Lyft to take you to the hospital. (Worked well when I broke my elbow.)\n\nTake such incidents to trial, where justice isn\u2019t veiled by the POBAR. It\u2019s not a matter of litigious vindictiveness. It\u2019s just the only available way. The SF Office of Citizen Complaints is not a valid alternative.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It's a crummy lesson, alas crummy police officers keep teaching it.
