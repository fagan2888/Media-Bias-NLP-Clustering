Law enforcement officers across the metro area are on the lookout for an inmate who escaped from the Jefferson County Detention Facility Sunday night, authorities say.

Travis Sandlin, 32, escaped from the jail’s maximum security pod, said Jacki Kelley, spokeswoman for the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Department.

“We consider anyone who escapes from jail to be dangerous,” she said. “We not only rarely have someone escape from the jail, we’ve never had anyone escape from the jail.”

Sandlin is being held on a laundry list of offenses including burglary, trespassing, theft, motor vehicle theft and felon in possession of a hand gun.

Kelley said she could not discuss how Sandlin was able to flee the jail.

Sandlin escaped some time between 9 and 10 p.m.

Sheriff’s officials have notified RTD officials because there is a nearby light rail station, Kelley said.

A K-9 unit also is out searching for Sandlin. Golden and Arvada police as well as the Colorado State Patrol have been notified, she said.
