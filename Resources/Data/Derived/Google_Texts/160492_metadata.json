Trump used his time to rip Romney as a loser and a failure and to complain about his treatment at the hands of the party establishment.\n\nThe move angered many Republicans, like Roy Postel, a Trump supporter from the Chicago area who was attending the annual gathering of conservative activists outside Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cI think the whole pushback from the Republican hierarchy is shameful,\u201d Postel said, adding that he believed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would be facing similar attacks if he were the frontrunner. \u201cIt\u2019s pointed at Trump now because he leads in the polls, but if Cruz was pulling 40 percent, all their animosity, all the rancor would be pointed towards him.\u201d\n\nBy suggesting a plan to disrupt Trump\u2019s advance to the nomination, Postel said: \u201cThey\u2019re sticking their finger in the eye of all the voters. So what\u2019s the point of the process if leadership won\u2019t respond? They\u2019re asking us to get in line and just take whoever we\u2019ve got. Well, what\u2019s that gotten us for the last 30 years? It\u2019s heartbreaking. The last presidential candidate they pushed this hard against was Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dump Trump and Lose Voters \u2013 Is That Really the GOP\u2019s Plan?\n\nOpposition to the next Reagan is not a good look for the RNC \u2013 particularly at CPAC, where the 40th president is a treated as a figure of almost mystical power \u2013 and Priebus clearly knew he had some work to do on Friday morning.\n\nSo, he launched right into it in his conversation with Sean Hannity of Fox News.\n\n\u201cLet me just clear something up for everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cWhoever the nominee is of our party, they are going to get the full backing and the 100 percent support of the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe don\u2019t take sides, regardless of what you may think or read. There is no side that we take at the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nHannity, who has been very supportive of Trump, was not willing to let the issue go that easily.\n\n\u201cThere seems to be a strategy to target one candidate and force a brokered convention,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe people are going to decide,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that the people are not going to decide. There\u2019s no way that the delegates are not going to decide. If you were at the convention you would be bound on the first vote, and the majority of you would choose the nominee. And whoever the majority chooses is going to be the nominee of our party.\u201d\n\nRelated: Debating the Deficit \u2013 \u2018Mr. Trump, Your Numbers Don\u2019t Add Up\u2019\n\nBut a tautology is not an argument. The fact that the delegates at the convention will decide ignores the fact that there appears to be a movement by influential figures in the party to manipulate the selection of delegates in the first place.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to do what they\u2019re going to do, but eventually the people are going to decide,\u201d Priebus insisted again, while assuring Hannity that \u201cthe odds of a contested convention are very small.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re trying to influence the process in a way that would be disruptive,\u201d Hannity said.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s a strategy that people can use, but I would suggest it\u2019s better to win,\u201d Priebus replied vaguely.\n\nIt has to be a tough position for Priebus. His party\u2019s leading candidate is campaigning on a promise to burn the establishment Priebus runs to the ground. Worse, not only would Trump completely upend the GOP\u2019s hierarchy, polls suggest he would also lose to Democrat Hillary Clinton in a general election. Yet in an attempt to prevent the party from splintering, Priebus publicly has to promise to assist in both efforts if the voters ask him to do so.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as though Trump doesn\u2019t have vulnerabilities that a concerted establishment attack could exploit. The night before Priebus\u2019s appearance, Trump had appeared alongside his fellow candidates in the 11th GOP debate. The billionaire took the opportunity to assure the audience of millions that, despite suggestions to the contrary from his opponent, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, he does not, in fact, have a small penis.\n\nOutside the convention hall, Susana Postel, who had traveled to CPAC with her husband, said that she had been a Trump supporter until that moment.\n\n\u201cI was a big Trump supporter, you know, because of the wall, the Muslims, the things he\u2019s been saying,\u201d she said. \u201cBut oh, my goodness, the part of the debate where he referred to his manhood really, really turned me off.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m not sure. I think I\u2019m back to the drawing board,\u201d Postel said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It had, no doubt, been a rough 24 hours for Republican National Committee Chairman Rei", "title": "Is Anyone Running This Show?
