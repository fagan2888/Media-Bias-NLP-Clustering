At the same time, Cuban police kept some dissidents from attending and pounced on others apparently attempting to hand out flyers near the Mass.\n\nThe huge plaza is the site of government and Communist Party headquarters and where Cubans celebrate May Day beneath massive portraits of revolutionary leaders Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos built into the facades of state buildings.\n\nTo welcome the pope, who helped bring about the recent rapprochement between Cuba and the United States, a similarly giant poster of Jesus Christ was hung nearby.\n\nSome pilgrims waited for hours in the tropical heat, eager to hear the first Latin American pope speak to them in Spanish, their common language.\n\n\u201cFrancis has come to bless this new union between Cuba and the United States,\u201d said Enrique Mesa, a 32-year-old tourism worker.\n\nREAD: Pope exhorts US and Cuba to push detente further\n\nWhile Cuba\u2019s government basks in the glow of the pope\u2019s four-day visit, he may use the stage to criticize the Communist leaders on democracy and human rights.\n\n\u201cService is never ideological, for we do not serve ideas, we serve people,\u201d the pope said in his homily. \u201cDo not neglect them (others) for plans which can be seductive, but are unconcerned about the face of the person beside you.\u201d\n\nBetween 30-40 dissidents were detained to stop them attending papal events, a dissident human rights group said.\n\nSecurity agents wrestled two men and a woman to the ground at the edge of Revolution Square, then led them off, after they started shouting and tried to hand out flyers, a Reuters witness said.\n\nThe pope\u2019s homily carried messages that both committed Communists and the government\u2019s most strident critics could claim as their own.\n\n\u201cAll of us are called by virtue of our Christian vocation to that service which truly serves, and to help one another not to be tempted by a \u2018service\u2019 which is really \u2018self-serving,'\u201d the pope said.\n\nREAD: Conservatives outraged at gays on White House guest list for Pope Francis! (Vatican, not so much)\n\nThe government\u2019s opponents may feel the pope was talking about Fidel and Raul Castro, the brothers who have been Cuba\u2019s dominant figures since the 1959 revolution while their defenders could point to another passage as praise for a revolution that has provided Cubans with free health care and education.\n\n\u201cWho is the most important? Jesus is straightforward in his reply: \u2018Whoever wishes to be the first among you must be the last of all, and the servant of all,'\u201d Francis said.\n\nFrancisco was expected to visit retired leader Fidel Castro, 89, later on Sunday.\n\nArriving on Saturday, Francis exhorted Cuba and the United States to deepen their detente, and encouraged Cuba to grant more freedom to the Roman Catholic Church, which has re-emerged as a powerful force after suffering decades of repression.\n\n\u201cHis visit is cause for hope in our aspirations for improvement,\u201d said biologist Benito Espinoza, 41, at Revolution Square. \u201cWe are an optimistic people, but we have suffered for many years.\u201d\n\nFrancis waved and greeted Cubans as he arrived at the Mass, delighting one family when he picked up and kissed a four-year-old girl Karen Correoso.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a historic moment for her and for us. He blessed her,\u201d said the girl\u2019s aunt, Maria Teresa Gonzalez, 64, from a church in Matanzas city.\n\nMany Cubans appreciate the pope for his role in the secret talks that led to last December\u2019s breakthrough with Washington, when Cuban President Raul Castro and U.S. President Barack Obama vowed to normalize relations and end more than half a century of Cold War-era animosity.\n\nFrancis will fly from Cuba to Washington on Tuesday for meetings with Obama and addresses at the U.S. Congress and United Nations.\n\nCuba will welcome any papal condemnation of the U.S. economic embargo, which persists despite Obama\u2019s policy change as only the U.S. Congress can lift it. The Republican leadership in Congress has defied Obama\u2019s calls to do so.\n\nBut Castro\u2019s government will also be sensitive to any criticism of its one-party political system or repression of dissidents.\n\nREAD: Pope Francis\u2019 real challenge to Washington\u2019s pols: Be politicians, not partisans! (ANALYSIS)\n\nElizardo Sanchez, head of the Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, said most of the 30-40 opposition activists rounded up were in Santa Clara and Havana.\n\nAmong them were three dissidents whose detention kept them from a meeting with the pope on Saturday night, said Berta Soler, leader of the dissident group Ladies in White.\n\nInstead of seeing Francis at the Vatican\u2019s diplomatic residence in Havana, Soler said she, Miriam Leyva and Martha Beatriz Roque were in police custody for several hours.\n\n\u201cThe Holy Father is not going to change anything in Cuba,\u201d Soler said. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect much from Francis because he comes here to talk about political matters between Cuba and the United States, not to resolve anything.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "While the pontiff warned of the dangers of power and ideology when others are excluded, Cuban police kept some dissidents from attending.", "title": "Pope Francis in Cuba: \u2018We do not serve ideas.
