Peter Shumlin.\n\nThis year\u2019s transportation funding bill, which was passed on Friday by Vermont\u2019s House and Senate, mandates a study of physical measures, such as barriers, or new emergency communications on the bridge. It also calls for the installation by July 1 of a new structure \u201caimed at preventing suicides at the bridge\u201d that will have signs, information or communication devices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically what we wanted,\u201d said Rep. Teo Zagar, D-Barnard, who in January introduced a bill calling for the state to consider installing a physical suicide barrier on the historic and scenic bridge.\n\nThe call for measures to prevent suicides and reduce dangers to first responders at the local tourist attraction originated with the parents of Derek Cooper, a 21-year-old Hartland student and volunteer firefighter who died after jumping from the bridge on July 4, 2011.\n\nRegina-Anne Cooper, Derek Cooper\u2019s mother, noted how difficult it was to have the bill\u2019s fate unsettled as Mother\u2019s Day weekend approached. \u201cAll day Friday I was sweating it, thinking, \u2018Oh, no, we\u2019re not going to make it,\u2019 \u201d she said. Even the news it had passed \u201cwas bittersweet.\u201d\n\nBut Cooper said she saw in the bill \u201cvery creative and innovative\u201d thinking: \u201cI\u2019m all for it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe passage marked an advance in a process that Cooper had put in motion by contacting Zagar, who drafted a bill that would have given the state Agency of Transportation until Jan. 15 to study \u201csuicide and pedestrian safety measures\u201d at the bridge and until Oct. 1, 2017, to complete them.\n\nIn March, the House Transportation Committee held a hearing on Zagar\u2019s bill and then incorporated it into its annual transportation funding bill language, calling for the agency to install suicide prevention signage this summer and then assess the costs and benefits of more substantial measures. That assessment is due early next year.\n\n\u201cI was very, very pleased that the House Transportation Committee included (the Quechee Gorge measures) in its budget,\u201d said Rep. Anne Donahue, R-Northfield, a mental health care advocate.\n\nCooper said she felt supportive testimony from Hartford Interim Fire Chief Scott Cooney and police Chief Phil Kasten helped to \u201csway the Transportation Committee.\u201d\n\nThe mandate for work on the bridge remained in the bill on Friday, when both chambers of the Legislature agreed to a conference committee report. The bill now is on Shumlin\u2019s desk, Zagar said Tuesday, and is expected to be signed shortly.\n\nA spokesman for Shumlin could not be reached late Wednesday for comment.\n\nOfficials in Vermont tallied 833 suicides in the state for the period that began July 1, 2008, and ended Dec. 31, 2015. While mental health care, including treatment for depression, constitutes the state\u2019s main response to suicide, experts say that putting physical barriers in the way of what often is an impulsive act also can save lives.\n\nThe Quechee Gorge Bridge was the site of eight of the 11 Vermont suicides by jumps from high bridges since July 2008, according to state officials.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research (showing) that certain locations become hot spots\u201d that attract individuals who are considering suicide, Donahue said.\n\nShumlin\u2019s signature would set a July 1 deadline by which the Agency of Transportation would need to seek to deter suicides on the bridge through \u201ca structure providing information and resources, signs or communication devices, or some combination of these.\u201d\n\nQuechee Gorge Gifts and Sportswear owner Kipp Miller said he had heard talk of a \u201ckiosk\u201d being built, but was unsure where it would be located.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of in a waiting mode now to see where it happens,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bill also gives the agency until Jan. 10 to report back to the Legislature with a plan for structural changes or emergency communication devices that would help prevent suicides and make the bridge safer for pedestrians and first responders. It mandates the agency consult with other state and local officials, business owners and mental health caregivers; do a cost-benefit analysis; and weigh the \u201ceconomic, community and tourism concerns\u201d generated by any measures.\n\nLocal businesses had asked to be included in that process, Miller said.\n\nCooper noted the bill did not specify \u201cany one total fix,\u201d but instead directed the agency \u201cto meet with different entities on coming up with a solution for a long-term fix that suits the town, the businesses and people that are visiting the bridge.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Zagar introduced a bill that would have mandated the state Agency of Transportation to design suicide barriers at the Quechee Gorge Bridge as a model to be implemented on bridges around the state. That legislation died in the House Transportation Committee.\n\nBut the advocacy work isn\u2019t done, Zagar cautioned. \u201cWe all need to be on top of Hartford\u2019s Selectboard, the Chamber of Commerce, the Agency of Transportation, just to make sure that things are progressing.\u201d\n\nCooper also was skeptical about the likelihood of rapid change. \u201cThe fix may not come for a decade,\u201d she said. \u201cIt could be two decades.\u201d\n\nBut some progress already was in hand, she said. \u201cWe got people to think about it \u2026 and come together to find a solution.\u201d\n\nThe bridge measure was one of several legislative actions this year that was important to mental health care advocates, according to Donahue. She hailed the approval of a 2 percent increase in reimbursement rates to the nonprofit organizations, known as designated agencies, that provide mental health care in communities. That increase will take effect on Sept. 1, so the overall impact on agency budgets will be a little less than 2 percent, Donahue said.\n\nDonahue also noted the Legislature\u2019s rejection of a proposal by the Department of Vermont Health Access that would have required prior approval for Medicaid coverage of some mental health services. That would have violated a provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires health insurance cover mental health and substance misuse care on the same terms that it covers other chronic illness, she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vermont legislature, transportation funding bill, quechee gorge bridge, suicide, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "This year\u2019s transportation funding bill mandates a study of physical measures or new emergency communications on the bridge, which has been the site of eight suicides since 2008.", "title": "Legislation aims to prevent suicide at Quechee Gorge Bridge | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Quechee_Gorge_Bridge.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-12T10:38:16+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2016/05/12/legislation-aims-to-prevent-suicide-at-quechee-gorge-bridge/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "This year\u2019s transportation funding bill mandates a study of physical measures or new emergency communications on the bridge, which has been the site of eight suicides since 2008.", "creator": "@vtdigger", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Quechee_Gorge_Bridge.jpg?fit=3535%2C2356", "title": "Legislation aims to prevent suicide at Quechee Gorge Bridge | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "Vermont Legislature, transportation funding bill, Quechee Gorge Bridge, suicide", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Vermont legislature", "published_time": "2016-05-12T10:35:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-12T10:38:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI was very, very pleased that the House Transportation Committee included (the Quechee Gorge measures) in its budget,\u201d said Rep.
