The Better Business Bureau wants consumers to be cautious when making purchases at state fairs.

The Topeka Capital Journal reports the Better Business Bureau says it's calling on the public to "exercise smart consumerism."

The Kansas State Fair, along with the exhibits and contests, starts Friday and lasts for 10 days at the Kansas State Fairgrounds in Hutchinson.

The Better Business Bureau says the Federal Trade Commission's "cooling-off rule," which lets consumers change their mind about purchases within three days, doesn't apply to the state fair if the value of the item is less than $25, the goods and services aren't primarily for personal, family or household purposes and if the purchase is of insurance, securities or real estate, motor vehicles or arts and crafts.
