It\u2019s no longer uncommon to see exotic ingredients such as offal, insects, or even dirt on restaurant menus.\n\nGoodyear, who also writes for The New Yorker, describes foodies as people who are passionate about food and dining experiences. \u201cWhereas other people may care about literature or film or sports, a foodie cares about food,\u201d states Goodyear. \u201cI think that\u2019s a really new thing in this country\u2014that there are people who are activists around access to food and ingredients and food experiences.\u201d\n\nWhile Goodyear sees the foodie movement as an indicator that American food culture is becoming more democratized as more choices are made available to consumers, the regulatory regime that has been built around ensuring food quality has proven outdated and unable to handle the artisanal, homegrown movement.\n\n\u201c[T]he way in which that initial legislation\u2014the Pure Food and Drugs Act of 1906\u2014has been built upon has really encouraged the industrialization of food and it\u2019s really only possible for very large producers to comply perfectly,\u201d says Goodyear. \u201cA lot of people are feeling now that smaller scale producers who may not be able to afford the manpower to keep up the paperwork that\u2019s required for compliance are actually practicing safe food.\u201d\n\nThe growing tension between regulators and food producers has led to more innovation in the fine dining world as chefs seek new ways to offer people unique dining experiences free from the bureaucratic headaches that typically consume restaurant operations. Pop-up restaurants and underground supper clubs are just some of the more inventive ways chefs are able to experiment and provide new dishes to customers.\n\nGoodyear describes her experience at an underground supper where cannabis was the featured ingredient as an illustration of the growing disconnect between regulators and foodies. \u201cThat was a really fun dinner because it really got to the heart of chefs innovating and experimenting and using ingredients that are not typically thought of as food ingredients,\u201d says Goodyear. \u201cAnd then here it is an ingredient that is actually a Schedule I drug.\u201d\n\nProduced by Alexis Garcia.
