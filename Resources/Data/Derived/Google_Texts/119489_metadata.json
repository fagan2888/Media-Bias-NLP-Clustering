The new blanket COA altitude remains lower than the operating ceiling of 500 feet proposed in the small UAS rule.\u201d\n\nThe agency was supposed to develop a broad plan for the \u201csafe integration of civil unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace system\u201d by September 2015. The FAA has made incremental steps toward that goal, such as by requiring all small drone users to register on an FAA website and by proposing a rule to allow the routine use of small commercial drones in the aviation system.\n\nThe final rule for commercial UAS that weigh less than 55 pounds is expected to be finalized this spring.
