Not long ago, we brought you the story of how South Lake Union is having a bit of a rat problem. Back in September we reported rats were invading the neighborhood.

These rats are making their homes in current and future developments, and it’s getting bad.

Now, some people are starting to fight back. However, in at least one case, whomever is combating the rats hasn’t figured out what the term “unintended consequences” means.

According to local blog Seattle Dog Spot, someone scattered rat poison around sidewalks and in shrubs, presumably to kill the rats. But dogs are eating the poison, too.

According to the owner of one dog who ate the rat pellets, they saw about 50 bags of rat poison “in the planters outside” two businesses.

And this isn’t a type of rat poison that is safe for animals. According to photos of the rat poison bags, it’s a brand called Ramik Green, which has a label that says “HAZARD TO HUMANS AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS CAUTION: Keep away from humans, domestic animals and pets.”

Apparently the poison causes internal bleeding where the animal who ingests to poison will die in three to five days. The dog, in this case, was quickly treated by an emergency veterinarian and is expected to live.

I understand the need to kill the rats in the neighborhood, but maybe next time use a little common sense?
