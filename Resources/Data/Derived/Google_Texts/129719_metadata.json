It turns out these troops aren\u2019t the only ones in DOD planning it.\n\nForeign Policy magazine obtained a secret Pentagon document, dated April 2011 and called CONOP 8888, which outlines a strategy to fight flesh-eating zombies in order to \u201cpreserve the sanctity of human life\u201d and protect \"non-zombie humans.\" The document is called \u201cCounter-Zombie Dominance\u201d and contains this disclaimer: \"This plan was not actually designed as a joke.\"\n\nRelated: How Zombies Are Finally Boosting America's GDP\n\nThe document originated in U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha, Nebraska, says FP. It was reportedly written in 2009 and 2010. The planners aimed to find ways to \u201cprotect citizens in the event of an attack of any kind\u201d and used zombies as \u201ctheir muse,\u201d reports FP.\n\n\u201cPlanners ... realized that training examples for plans must accommodate the political fallout that occurs if the general public mistakenly believes that a fictional training scenario is actually a real plan,\u201d the document reads. \u201cRather than risk such an outcome by teaching our augmentees using the fictional 'Tunisia' or 'Nigeria' scenarios used at [Joint Combined Warfighting School], we elected to use a completely impossible scenario that could never be mistaken for a real plan.\u201d\n\nIn an email to FP, Navy Capt. Pamela Kunze, a spokeswoman for Strategic Command, acknowledged that the document was authentic, but said that it was simply a training tool.\n\n\u201cThis document is not a U.S. Strategic Command plan,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: The Stock Market's Walking Dead: 4 Surprising Survivors\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time, however, that federal government has used zombies as a training tool. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has an entire website that outlines how to prepare for a zombie attack.\n\n\u201cIf you are generally well equipped to deal with a zombie apocalypse, you will be prepared for a hurricane, pandemic, earthquake, or terrorist attack,\u201d CDC director Ali Khan says on the site \u2013 which also acknowledges that \u201cwhat first began as a tongue-in-cheek campaign to engage new audiences with preparedness messages has proven to be a very effective platform.\u201d\n\nDOD\u2019s zombie plan is much more thorough. It outlines the different kinds of zombies that can attack - zombies from outer space, zombie infected by a pathogen, and vegetarian zombies, among others. It also outlines how to destroy zombie holdouts as the zombie war comes to an end.\n\nThe document is a fun read simply because it exposes how DOD actually plans for contingencies. The Pentagon\u2019s job is to be prepared for anything, even the most unlikely of events, like an invasion by Canada or a zombie apocalypse.\n\nRelated: Breaking Bad Finale: AMC's in the Empire Business\n\nIt also shows that the normally straight-laced Pentagon has a sense of humor.\n\n\u201cWe figured that an entry like this would not only be instructive, but possibly entertaining for personnel deployed away from their families supporting military ops abroad,\u201d the document says. \u201cIf this plans helps illustrate how [joint operation training processes] works and brings a smile or a brief laugh in the process, so much the better.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DOD has a plan for saving the world from zombies.
