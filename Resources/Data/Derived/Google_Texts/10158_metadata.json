Workers who are not statutory employees are not covered by most state and federal labor laws; for example, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), Title VII, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and state unemployment laws. The IRS\u2019s Final Regulations implementing the ACA\u2019s Pay-or-Play rules clarify that while employers are not required to offer coverage to independent contractors, contingent worker misclassification could, nonetheless, result in penalty exposure to the employer by triggering either the \u201cno-coverage offered\u201d or \u201cinsufficient coverage\u201d penalty. Whether contingent workers are \u201cemployees\u201d of the company for whom their service is provided, the employment or staffing agency, or are truly independent contractors depends on the workers\u2019 duties and work conditions, not IRS form filings. Courts and regulators have developed several different tests to determine employment status.\n\nThe three basic control tests include: (1) the \u201cCommon Law\u201d test, which depends upon whether the employer can hire or fire the individual, set the rules and regulations of the individual\u2019s work and to what extent the employer supervises the individual\u2019s work; (2) the \u201cEconomic Realities\u201d test (applicable under the FLSA); and (3) a hybrid approach.\n\nThe Economic Realities test evaluates whether:\n\nthe services rendered are an integral part of the principal\u2019s business; the permanency of the relationship; the amount of the contractor\u2019s investment in facilities and equipment; the nature and degree of control by the principal; the contractor\u2019s opportunities for profit or loss; the amount of initiative, judgment, or foresight in open market competition with others required for the success of the claimed independent contractor; and the degree of independent business operations.\n\nThe Hybrid test considers:\n\nthe opportunity for profit or loss depending on the worker\u2019s skills; the investment in equipment or materials required for the worker\u2019s task; the employment of helpers; whether the services rendered require a specific skill; the degree of permanence of the working relationship; and whether the services rendered are an integral part of the employer\u2019s business.\n\nNo one factor is decisive, and all factors must be taken into account. The IRS also promulgated its own test for \u201cemployee,\u201d in which the IRS will find an employment relationship where the employer has the right to control the individual\u2019s performance of services. Leased employees, sole proprietors, partners in a partnership, 2 percent S Corporation shareholders and certain direct sellers and real estate agents are excepted from this IRS\u2019s definition of \u201cemployees.\u201d\n\nThere are significant tax consequences to employers who misclassify employees as independent contractors. For instance, payroll and withholding liabilities may accrue, and double if violations are found to be willful. Misclassified workers who are ultimately considered employees will be covered by pension and profit sharing plans, labor and employment laws, including all wage and hour, discrimination and the NLRA, and the employer mandates and tax penalties embodied in the ACA can accrue, all at significant cost.\n\nWhen using leased employees, companies should consider that the contractor often will be deemed a \u201cjoint\u201d employer, jointly responsible for compliance with wage and hour, workers\u2019 compensation and related laws. Using leased employees may create a joint employer relationship with a staffing agency or other provider where the contracting entity can \u201cshare or co-determine matters governing essential terms and conditions of employment.\u201d \u201cEssential terms and conditions of employment\u201d include hiring, firing, discipline, supervision and direction. Where the staffing agency is deemed a joint employer with the client/employer, both will be subject to, among other laws, the NLRA, the various state laws against discrimination, state workers\u2019 compensation laws, as well as the ACA.\n\nEmployment status or a joint employer relationship is generally determined based upon one of the same control theories discussed above. Under the FLSA, an entity may be found to be a joint employer where the employers are not entirely unrelated with respect to employment of a particular employee and may be considered to share control of the employee by reason of the fact that one employer controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the other employer. Employers using or considering the use of contingent workers should carefully review their procedures and policies to ensure that they do not inadvertently misclassify workers, thereby subjecting themselves to penalties and lawsuits.\n\nWritten by Cynthia J.
