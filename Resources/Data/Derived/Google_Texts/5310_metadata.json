I think it is fair to say that Kentucky reduced its rate of uninsured by 40% and Arkansas hit almost the same percentage -- so there are success stories.\"\n\nShe agreed that more work needed to done on implementation of Obamacare, but offered no specifics.\n\nAsked about another issue that bedeviled her husband's administration -- tort reform -- Clinton pointed to use of checklists to eliminate procedural errors and initiatives such as that at University of Michigan \"where they have created an environment in which saying you are sorry and going immediately to patients cut down litigation.\"\n\nBut, \"whether the malpractice is lawyers who betray clients' confidence or doctors who are negligent, you need to really isolate that very small group of professionals who cause a lot of problems for everybody else,\" she said.\n\nClinton was not asked about her future plans, but she sounded more like a candidate than a diplomat when she chastised the gridlock in Congress and she made a personal plea for bipartisan support of the children's health insurance plan, which will be defunded unless Congress reauthorizes it.\n\nOn nonhealth issues Clinton said she supported President Obama's economic stimulus, but admitted that it did not result in the type of robust recovery that the country wants and needs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Peggy  Peck", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Washington-Watch/47679", "image": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/9/16/47679.jpg", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton says fee-for-service medicine is probably an idea whose time has passed.", "card": "Summary", "title": "Hillary to TCT: Fee-for-Service Days Are Numbered"}, "dc.date.issued": "2014-09-16 12:30:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "practicemanagement,cardiology,primarycare,publichealthpolicy,prevention,healthpolicy,generalprimarycare,pci,washington-watch,hospitalbasedmedicine,generalprofessionalissues,fdageneral,nursing,nursing,theguptaguide,publichealth", "sailthru.date": "2014-09-16 12:30:00", "sailthru.title": "Hillary to TCT: Fee-for-Service Days Are Numbered", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton says fee-for-service medicine is probably an idea whose time has passed.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-09-17 12:09:00", "date": "2014-09-16 12:30:00", "sailthru.description": "WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton says fee-for-service medicine is probably an idea whose time has passed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/Washington-Watch/47679", "image": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/9/16/47679.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton says fee-for-service medicine is probably an idea whose time has passed.", "title": "Hillary to TCT: Fee-for-Service Days Are Numbered"}, "sailthru.featured": 1, "dc.date": "2014-09-16 12:30:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "Other,cardiology,primarycare,pain_management,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/upload/2014/9/16/47679.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22fb\"", "article_summary": "Answering a question from TCT president Jack Lewin, MD, she said, \"We need to have as evidence-based and mature a conversation as we can have about [fee-for-service].\"\nWASHINGTON -- Hillary Clinton says fee-for-service medicine is probably an idea whose time has passed.\nPress were not barred, but no seats were reserved for it, and the TCT asked members of the press to acknowledge that they were asked not to write about Clinton's remarks.\nJust as fee-for-service may be sunsetting, Clinton said that employer-paid health insurance may also be a time-honored tradition that \"we can no longer afford.\"\nThe Clinton appearance was billed as a keynote address, but was treated as a private event."}
