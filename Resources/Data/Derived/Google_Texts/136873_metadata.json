It turns out that they fall into a regulatory gray area.\n\nThe word \u201cestate\u201d conjures images of manicured lawns and sweeping terraces. Evergreen Mobile Estates near Shelton, Washington has a very different feel. The moss-streaked single-and-double wides stand cheek-by-jowl, along with the occasional broken window and a general look of dilapidation.\n\n'The only place we could really afford'\n\nAretta Darling and her fianc\u00e9 Dennis McCallum have been living at Evergreen Mobile Estates since May. McCallum said, \u201cIt\u2019s the only place we could really afford at the time.\u201d\n\nMcCallum is a recovering addict who was previously evicted from an apartment and for a time was homeless. The rent here is $675 a month. To McCallum it feels like a lot for not much.\n\nMcCallum showed how the front wall was detaching from the floor. He then shut the front door and pointed out light coming in through gaps between the door and the wall.\n\n\u201cYou can see the light all the way through the doors,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep it warm in here because of all this.\u201d\n\nTo keep warm, McCallum and his fianc\u00e9 sometimes light a fire in the wood stove that occupies a corner of the cramped living room. But they worry about burning the place down. The stove sits just a few inches from the wall and there\u2019s no fireproof backing.\n\nMcCallum believes this trailer is borderline habitable. But he\u2019s been reluctant to call the county and say, \u2018hey come inspect this place.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve thought about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I do that then we probably wouldn\u2019t have a place to live because they\u2019d end up condemning this place, but we\u2019d have no place to go then.\u201d\n\nWho has jurisdiction?\n\nAt least that\u2019s what he\u2019s afraid of. But even if McCallum did call to report the condition of his rental, he might not get very far.\n\nDebbie Riley, the environmental health manager at Mason County Public Health, said her department deals with outdoor health issues. But she said when it comes to the interior condition of rental properties, \u201cAt this point in time Mason County Public Health hasn\u2019t stepped into that arena.\u201d\n\nAt the county building department, the lone code enforcement officer there said she has a backlog of 1,500 complaints from across the county and said the Washington Department of Labor and Industries has some jurisdiction over mobile homes.\n\nAgency spokesman Matthew Erlich said, \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that there are substandard mobile home parks out there\u201d\n\nBut Erlich said his agency doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over the condition of the homes.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t condemn or determine if something is habitable,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat would be the local authority.\u201d\n\nOptions for recourse are complicated\n\nLabor and Industries has conducted safety inspections when requested to by local officials. That happened in 2011 at a trailer park in Yakima County. The Yakima Herald reported at the time that L&I found 75-pages worth of problems \u201cincluding leaky roofs, rotted floors, plumbing and electrical hazards.\u201d But those sorts of sweeps are rare.\n\nLeslie Owen, a senior attorney with the Northwest Justice Project in Olympia, said Washington\u2019s Landlord-Tenant Act does give renters some avenues of recourse.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cthey\u2019re so complicated that very few tenants can make use of them.\u201d\n\nSo Owen said renters often just put up with the conditions. Or they start withholding rent and get evicted.\n\n\u201cAnd in court these people are trying to tell judges all about the horrible conditions that exist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter because a judge is basically saying \u2018you didn\u2019t pay your rent and I don\u2019t have any choice.\u2019\u201d\n\nOwen would like to see more communities follow the example of Seattle and Pasco -- cities that require inspections of rental properties.\n\n'They\u2019re affordable and we take care of them'\n\nThere is another side to this story.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re filling a need for affordable housing in Mason County, Washington,\u201d said Darlene Pennock, the co-owner of Evergreen Mobile Estates. Pennock said it\u2019s a constant battle to keep mobile homes that are 30, 40, even 50 years old inhabitable. Especially because of the wear and tear tenants put on them.\n\nBut she rejected the suggestion that her rentals are sub-standard.\n\n\u201cThey might be old, they might not be pretty, but they\u2019re affordable and we take care of them,\u201d Pennock said. \u201cWe want our properties safe.\u201d\n\nWashington law requires that landlords keep their rentals \u201cfit for human habitation\u201d and \u201cin reasonably good repair.\u201d Pennock insisted her mobile homes pass this test. But she knows not everyone agrees.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called a slumlord,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYes, more than once.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI can\u2019t let it get to me because I know I am not doing that.\u201d\n\nAs for the problems her current tenants pointed out, Pennock said she was unaware of those issues and promised to have her maintenance person \u201cget right on it.\u201d\n\nSince then the issues with the wall and stove have been addressed.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuow.org/post/mobile-home-rentals-fall-regulatory-gray-area", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201412/371996256.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Mobile Home Rentals Fall Into Regulatory Gray Area"}, "story_id": 371992523, "twitter": {"site": "@kuow", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuow"}, "author": "Austin Jenkins", "org_id": 1146, "dc": {"title": "Mobile Home Rentals Fall Into Regulatory Gray Area"}, "nid": 46931, "datePublished": "2014-12-21", "keywords": "housing, government", "wordCount": 1157, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1c7\"", "article_summary": "Across the Northwest, some families will spend Christmas in rented mobile homes where the living conditions are marginal at best and dangerous at worst.\nPennock said it\u2019s a constant battle to keep mobile homes that are 30, 40, even 50 years old inhabitable.\n\u201cWe\u2019re filling a need for affordable housing in Mason County, Washington,\u201d said Darlene Pennock, the co-owner of Evergreen Mobile Estates.\n\u201cWe want our properties safe.\u201dWashington law requires that landlords keep their rentals \u201cfit for human habitation\u201d and \u201cin reasonably good repair.\u201d Pennock insisted her mobile homes pass this test.\nIt turns out that they fall into a regulatory gray area."}
