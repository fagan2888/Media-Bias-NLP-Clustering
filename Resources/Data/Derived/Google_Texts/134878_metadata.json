That\u2019s right, those dang Stanfurd trees have a three-year winning streak in the Big Game. For nostalgia purposes, we\u2019re here to bring you some of the top pop culture highlights of 2009, that glorious winning year. Must\u2019ve been some good karma somewhere\u2026\n\n1. Hassle in the House\n\nRepresentative Joe Wilson, a South Carolina Republican, yells \u201cYou lie!\u201d at President Obama during a 2009 speech discussing coverage of illegal immigrants under health care legislation. This ends up being a huge fundraising opportunity for the Democrats \u2014 $1 million poured in during the 48 hours after the incident.\n\n2. Kanye vs. Taylor\n\nIn a moment that will live in MTV Music Awards infamy, Kanye snatched the mic from T. Swift in September 2009 with the words \u201cImma let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time.\u201d Sorry, baby North West, but we still think Blue Ivy had one of the best baby names of all time. Also: T Swift wasn\u2019t even twenty-two-oo-oo yet.\n\n3. Lightning Speed\n\nEnter the track-and-field world championships in Berlin, summer 2009. Usain Bolt, at 9.58 seconds, topples the world record for the 100 meters by 0.11 seconds (the largest improvement of a world record since the inception of electronic timing). Then he kills the 200-meter world record with a 19.19 finish two days later. Those records he broke \u2014 did we mention he originally set them? Makes us want to up that treadmill mph.\n\n4. FarmVille Frenzy\n\n\n\nIn June 2009, this iconic social networking game was released by Zynga. Turns out virtual crop-harvesting is strangely addictive \u2014 the game jumped to 62 million users by October of the same year, making it the most popular social networking game of its time. In 2010, Zynga drew on its FarmVille success to release CityVille, now the largest game on Facebook by monthly active users. FarmVille 2 was released in 2012.\n\n5. Avatar\n\nRounding out the box office at $749,766,139, the supposedly $200+ million-budget film beats out \u201cTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen,\u201d \u201cHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,\u201d \u201cThe Twilight Saga: New Moon,\u201d \u201cThe Hangover,\u201d and \u201cUp\u201d for the title of highest-grossing film of 2009.\n\n6. Buzzwords\n\nThanks to Sarah Palin\u2019s Facebook post, the phrase \u201cdeath panel\u201d catches fire in describing certain provisions of Obama\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Other phrases, such as \u201cpulling the plug on grandma,\u201d quickly latched on to the former Alaska governor\u2019s claims. All was officially debunked by media, fact-checkers, Democrats and even some Republicans, earning Palin PolitiFact\u2019s \u201cLie of the Year.\u201d The issue seems to be back in the hot seat, however, with recent attention to the controversial panels.\n\n7. No Regrets \u2014 Except this high-five\n\nScott MacIntyre delivers an inspiring audition for the eighth season of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d and moves on to the Hollywood round. Amid ecstatic family and friends, Ryan Seacrest raises up his hand for a high-five \u2014 forgetting Scott is legally blind. It clicks with Seacrest after a couple of horrific seconds \u2014 \u201cWell, I\u2019m giving you a high-five!\u201d he says, and he takes Scott\u2019s hand from his side.\n\n8. Octomom\n\nPseudonym for California single mom Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in January 2009. Suleman ends up signing a $250,000 deal with a British production company, granting it access to her home and kids for 11 days. The two aspects of this causing the most public outrage? The concept of in vitro fertilization and Suleman\u2019s uncanny resemblance to Angelina Jolie.\n\n9. Election Day in Iran\n\nTumultuous elections in Iran declare incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the winner by an exceedingly large margin in June 2009. Tehran became home to millions of irate Iranians protesting the regime and their distrust of the election\u2019s fairness. The election results were upheld, creating what media called a \u201cpolitical quagmire,\u201d and Ahmadinejad held office until Aug. 3 of this year.\n\n10. David After Dentist\n\nDrugged-out 7-year-old David copes with his post-dentist meds on the way home, and the video goes viral. With more than 121 million views, David\u2019s shown us that video our sibling took of us post-anesthesia from wisdom teeth removal is in good company.\n\nContact Leah Hegyi at [email protected]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Californian", "description": "The last time the Bears won the Big Game, most of us weren\u2019t students here.
