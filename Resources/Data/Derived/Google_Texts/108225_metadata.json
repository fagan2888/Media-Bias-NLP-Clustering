When you find that gem, big alarms go off in the reward center of your brain.\n\nDoctors say that delightful brain chemistry makes you more likely to repeat the behavior.\n\nMany people enjoy shopping and do it in ways that are healthy with relatively low hazard. But some people may develop a slight addiction to bargain hunting and find themselves dealing with a more serious problem, like hoarding.\n\n\"I've run into plenty of people who have stacks and stacks of new stuff they've bought because it was a bargain, but they've never opened it,\" Dr. Bea said. \"They never had a real use for it. So, make sure if you're shopping for a bargain that it's something you're really going to use.\"\n\nExperts say it's important to pay attention to what shopping does to your brain and to make sure you're able to shop in healthy and helpful ways that aren't going to lead to trouble financially, or otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Psychologists say we can have actual chemical reactions to the thrill of getting a good deal.", "language": "english", "og": {"description": "Psychologists say we can have actual chemical reactions to the thrill of getting a good deal.", "title": "Bargain hunting can have psychological benefits", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/news/newschannel7today/headlines/Bargain-hunting-can-have-psychological-benefits-355787061.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/7BA/2B8/7BA2B8CB58F74133B39D9D1C9AA05AD6", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C72/8EF/C728EF0376A7470D97031BDC9BC263AC.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "Psychologists say we can have actual chemical reactions to the thrill of getting a good deal.", "title": "Bargain hunting can have psychological benefits", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/news/newschannel7today/headlines/Bargain-hunting-can-have-psychological-benefits-355787061.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/shopping87.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Bargain hunting can have psychological benefits", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Bargain hunting can have psychological"}, "article_summary": "So, make sure if you're shopping for a bargain that it's something you're really going to use.\"\nBargain hunting can be like panning for gold, you have to sift through a lot of items to find the gem.\nBut some people may develop a slight addiction to bargain hunting and find themselves dealing with a more serious problem, like hoarding.\n\"I've run into plenty of people who have stacks and stacks of new stuff they've bought because it was a bargain, but they've never opened it,\" Dr. Bea said.\nWho doesn't love a good bargain, especially on Black Friday?"}
