Furthur Officially Call It Quits

Furthur have officially parted ways. The band, which featured Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, John Kadlecik, Jeff Chimenti, Jeff Pehrson, Sunshine Becker and Joe Russo, confirmed the news today via a post on Furthur.net that reads:

To our loyal Furthur fans and members of the Furthur community at furthur.net, we’d like to thank you for a terrific ride. We’ll be closing up shop at furthur.net, and heading onward. Thanks for making the Furthur community a great place to hang out, and for coming out to the shows. We’ll all be keeping very busy over the foreseeable future, and it’s time to let Furthur take a bow. We enjoyed the ride more than we can possibly express. You can keep tabs on Phil’s activities atwww.terrapincrossroads.net, Bob’s activities atwww.bobweir.net and all Grateful Dead news atwww.dead.net

Furthur was founded in the fall of 2009, a few months after The Dead wrapped up their last tour. The group performed consistently between then and 2014, when they played their final show on January 23 at the first-and-only Paradise Waits event in Riviera Maya, Mexico (the band was scheduled to perform at this year’s Lockn’ Festival, but the show was cancelled after Weir scrapped all of his touring plans). However, Weir and Lesh teamed up to sing the “Star Spangled Banner” at Game 3 of the World Series in San Francisco last month, and rumors have been circulating for some time that the pair will reunite with the rest of The Dead in 2015 to mark the Grateful Dead’s 50th anniversary.
