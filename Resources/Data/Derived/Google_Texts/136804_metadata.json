She started smoking marijuana at age 12 and gravitated toward painkillers, angel dust, cocaine and heroin in her teens.\n\n\u201cWhere I grew up, it was very acceptable,\u201d Houlihan, 38, says of her Boston neighborhood. \u201cThat\u2019s how I knew how to live. If I had problems, I would just run away from them.\u201d\n\n[See photos of the finalists' work]\n\nWhile dealing drugs and overdosing countless times, she kept landing back in prison and losing custody of her four children. A substance abuse program affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital helped Houlihan to clean up her act and for three years she has clung steadfastly to her new course. Today, she juggles two jobs while maintaining her driver\u2019s license and raising her youngest son.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s really looked at as the poster child for someone who had been in and out of various treatment systems and has turned her life around,\u201d says Shannon Lundin, a former addict who became the community outreach coordinator for the Charlestown Substance Abuse Coalition, which is overseen by the hospital\u2019s Center for Community Health Improvement. Despite \u201csome bumps, barriers and hiccups in the road, she didn\u2019t pick up no matter what.\u201d\n\nFor broad-based efforts to improve the health of vulnerable populations, Massachusetts General was named the winner of the 2015 Foster G. McGaw Prize for Excellence in Community Service. The $100,000 prize, first awarded in 1986 and now marking its 30th anniversary, recognizes the hospital\u2019s comprehensive initiative to stem the state\u2019s opioid epidemic, as well as programs that target obesity and increase access to health care in underserved communities.\n\nThe Foster G. McGaw Prize is presented annually to an organization with innovative programs that substantially advance local residents\u2019 health and well-being. The prize is sponsored by the Baxter International Foundation, and the American Hospital Association and Health Research & Educational Trust. It is named after a Chicago-area philanthropist and industrialist. McGaw, now deceased, started the American Hospital Supply Corp. in 1922, which merged with Baxter International Inc. in 1985.\n\n\u201cMassachusetts General Hospital has spent the past 20 years building highly engaged partnerships with communities,\u201d says John O\u2019Brien, chair of the Foster G. McGaw Prize Committee. \u201cThey are dedicated to addressing social and economic determinants of health, reducing barriers to care for vulnerable populations and promoting health equity.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, the hospital\u2019s Center for Community Health Improvement assessed residents\u2019 health needs in the Chelsea, Revere and Charlestown neighborhoods, pinpointing substance use, and particularly opioids, as the most immediate concern. Then it launched far-reaching efforts to transform care for patients with substance use disorders. Capitalizing on long-standing, community-based prevention work, this initiative became the top clinical priority of the hospital\u2019s strategic plan. It was the first time the community directly influenced the hospital\u2019s clinical agenda.\n\n\u201cServing the community is really in the DNA of Massachusetts General Hospital, founded in 1811 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to be a place where poor people could be cared for with dignity,\u201d says Peter L. Slavin, M.D., the hospital\u2019s president since 2003 and a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \u201cUntil then, poor people in this area and other parts of the United States couldn\u2019t access the health care system.\u201d In those days, the health care system consisted largely of doctors visiting patients in their homes,\u201d Slavin notes. \u201cSome people couldn\u2019t afford to pay the doctors. Others didn\u2019t have homes. Those people were excluded from the health care system.\u201d\n\nWhile integrating patient care into its teaching and research missions, the 1,000-bed tertiary care hospital annually admits 48,000 inpatients and facilitates nearly 1.5 million outpatient visits to the main campus. It also serves 290,000 individuals at comprehensive community health centers in the three low-income target neighborhoods.\n\nMassachusetts General is the original and largest teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School and, with about 26,000 employees, the largest private employer in Boston. Leaders boast that it conducts the most extensive hospital-based research program in the U.S., with an annual research budget exceeding $760 million and major research centers in AIDS, cardiovascular research, cancer, computational and integrative biology, cutaneous biology, human genetics, medical imaging, neurodegenerative disorders, regenerative medicine, reproductive biology, systems biology, transplantation biology and photomedicine.\n\nDelivering excellent health care isn\u2019t enough, however, to make a difference. In 2015, the hospital marked the 20th anniversary of its Center for Community Health Improvement, founded to address the social and economic determinants of health among vulnerable populations.\n\nIt\u2019s vital to adhere to \u201can approach that recognizes that the social determinants of health have the greatest influence on health status,\u201d says Joan Quinlan, the hospital\u2019s vice president for community health. \u201cIf we want healthy patients, then we need to work to have healthy communities. Where people live, work and play affects their health status more than their access to health care.\u201d\n\nIn initiatives known as Healthy Chelsea and Revere on the Move, citywide and multisector coalitions work to improve food and physical environments in ways that encourage healthy choices about eating and active living. Joining forces with the city of Revere led to designated bike lanes and chevron markings with the bicycle icon, alerting drivers when to share the road with cyclists. A street policy in development is intended to bring more bike lanes to the community and to better connect existing ones. Another bicycle trail \u2014 spanning 7 1/2 miles of compressed granite \u2014 is expected to undergo enhancements this year, says Andrea Janota, co-leader of Revere on the Move.\n\nThe initiative partnered with WalkBoston, a pedestrian advocacy organization, to create four urban walking trails and to share safety and training resources, she says. Founded in 1990, WalkBoston\u2019s goal is to make walking and pedestrian needs a basic part of the transportation discussion, while representing more than 106 cities and towns across the state.\n\nAlso in Revere, community development block grants funded a garden with 15 plots. As plots become available, they are allocated to interested residents by lottery. An expansion of the garden doubled the number of plots. Families bring their own seedlings, and this spring the garden\u2019s leadership team is hosting a seed swap in one of its workshops.\n\nVegetables and herbs of a wide variety grow in the garden. \u201cActive urban gardeners are interested in incorporating fruit trees into the area if space allows,\u201d Janota says. Last year, Revere on the Move received a Harvard Pilgrim Healthy Food Fund grant to implement a composting system, supply new gardening tools and conduct a workshop series for community gardeners.\n\nMeanwhile, Healthy Chelsea and Chelsea\u2019s Board of Health led the passage in 2013 of a ban on artificial trans fats in food service establishments. At the time, it was the only regulation in the country that completely prohibited artificial trans fats by banning ingredients containing partially hydrogenated oils. Ron Fishman, Healthy Chelsea program coordinator, trained the city of Chelsea food inspection supervisor.\n\n\u201cWe visited many establishments, including bakeries \u2014 independent and in supermarkets \u2014 and restaurants, until they were proficient in identifying artificial trans fats,\u201d Fishman says. If trans fats are discovered, the establishment receives a warning or a fine and a referral to Fishman for help in finding a substitute ingredient. An inspector makes repeated trips until the issue is resolved. \u201cYou can\u2019t ensure there aren\u2019t artificial trans fats in the food, but the city regulation maximizes the possibility of eliminating artificial trans fats in Chelsea,\u201d he says.\n\nIn keeping with the hospital\u2019s mission to reduce barriers to care, a 15-year-old initiative at the MGH Chelsea HealthCare Center has aided refugees who endured violence and trauma in their native, war-torn countries, such as Bosnia, Somalia, Iraq and Bhutan. In 2014, the staff completed 107 health assessments and connected 95 percent of new refugees to primary care within 30 days. The program also supports the urgent needs of new arrivals, serving almost 1,000 refugees and immigrants in 2014.\n\nInterpreters and community health workers tailor their advocacy to refugees\u2019 needs. For instance, in an effort to decrease disparities in breast cancer screening rates among female refugees, Kaftun Ahmed facilitates mammograms for Somali and Arab women by helping them to understand the importance of testing. Ahmed works directly with the providers and translates radiologists\u2019 reports. She also aims to boost refugees\u2019 health literacy through workshops and outreach events.\n\n\u201cWe have done a focus group trying to find out what are the barriers for our patients, including what barriers they were facing toward literacy,\u201d says Ahmed, who has native proficiency in Somali and is bilingual in Arabic.\n\nAhmed found that many women who had lived in refugee camps can\u2019t read in their own language \u2014 a consequence of limited access to education after Somalia\u2019s civil war erupted in 1991. The literacy workshop, conducted in both English and Somali, concentrates on visual learning and teaches them basic skills, such as recognizing the hospital\u2019s logo on letters they receive in the mail, as well as understanding what constitutes a bank statement or immigration document.\n\nParticipants have noted \u201chow lucky they were to come into a place they\u2019ve never been before and to find somebody who speaks their language and who can understand them culturally,\u201d Ahmed says. \u201cThey come and say how grateful they are.\u201d\n\nThrough the National Center for Medical-Legal Partnership, refugees with pediatric patients gain access to a lawyer who assists them with housing and Supplemental Security Income. In another endeavor, a public schools coordinator who speaks Somali and Arabic has guided refugees in registering children for classes to promote the importance of education, to help communicate academic expectations in the U.S. and to interpret grade reports. \u201cIt was the bridge between the school, the teachers and the parent,\u201d Ahmed says of the program.\n\nBelieving that education has a huge impact on outcomes, the Center for Community Health Improvement also strives to expose students from third grade through college to careers in STEM-related disciplines \u2014 science, technology, engineering and math.\n\nStephanie Urvaez Mejia became involved with the youth programs at their inception, when she was in 10th grade. She transitioned into the comprehensive after-school program for students from Boston\u2019s public high schools. \u201cIt has honestly provided me with so many opportunities,\u201d says Urvaez Mejia, 22, who received a $5,000 annual college scholarship through the program. A senior majoring in biology at Fitchburg (Mass.) State University, she has held paid internships in various departments of the hospital, including the pediatric inpatient unit, obstetric ultrasonography and the developmental immunology laboratory.\n\nThe program also offered a coach through Accelerated College Experiences, or ACE, a Boston-based nonprofit that teaches students how to take control of their academic outcomes. They connect every two weeks by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice when I\u2019m feeling kind of overwhelmed with all of my classes and all the things I\u2019m involved in on campus,\u201d Urvaez Mejia says. \u201cShe keeps me pretty sane.\u201d\n\nLast semester, when Urvaez Mejia was considering whether to drop a difficult calculus course, the coach helped her to balance the pros and cons. \u201cShe was my sounding board,\u201d says Urvaez Mejia, who opted for a statistics course this semester to satisfy her major\u2019s math requirement. She is considering physician assistant studies as her next endeavor.\n\nHer coach, Lorita Williams, is the nonprofit\u2019s founder and CEO. The conversations center on how to self-manage stress, anxiety and grades as students navigate from being \u201cthe known\u201d in a smaller high school setting to \u201cthe unknown\u201d in a larger college environment, which may lead them to question their own confidence and abilities. Six ACE-certified coaches currently work with 74 college students. \u201cWe empower them,\u201d says Williams, who is also vice president for advancement and community engagement at Roxbury (Mass.) Community College. \u201cWe do not tell them what to do. We use the inquiry methodology, where we\u2019ll ask them a hundred questions to get them to figure out what it is they should do.\u201d\n\n2015 Foster G. McGaw Prize Finalists\n\nThree Foster G. McGaw Prize finalists also were recognized for their significant accomplishments in community service. Each received a $10,000 prize:\n\n\u2022 Lancaster (Pa.)
