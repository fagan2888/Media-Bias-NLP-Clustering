Former president Jimmy Carter said President Obama’s signature health-care law and its botched rollout have fallen short of expectations. “His major accomplishment was Obamacare, and the implementation of it now is questionable at best,” he told Parade magazine in an interview for Sunday’s issue.

As for Obama’s record after 5 years in office, he’s “done the best he could under the circumstances,” Carter said.

The former president told the magazine that President Obama remains grateful to Carter’s grandson, James Carter IV, who uncovered the infamous “47 percent” video from a Romney fundraiser during the 2012 campaign. In a visit to Georgia earlier this year, the president met with Carter’s grandson and thanked him profusely for the video. “I was very proud,” Carter said.
