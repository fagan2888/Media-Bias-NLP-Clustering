That stands to reason because occupancy rates have remained fairly flat over the same period. Suddenly, though, six new hotels are being planned collectively in downtown Greensboro and Winston-Salem.\n\nTriad Business Journal reporter Catherine Carlock is covering this real estate trend for the newspaper this week. She says, \u201cDevelopers smell opportunity in these cities for several reasons including, a pickup in loan activity that gives established hotel developers more access to loans for economic development projects. There is also a lot of capital that is pouring into the downtown areas in both cities.\u201d\n\nWFDD contributor Justin Catanoso recently sat down with Carlock to find out what development projects stand the best chance of moving forward.\n\nTo read Catherine Carlock\u2019s stories and more breaking business news from the region, go to the Triad Business Journal online at triad.bizjournals.com.\n\nJustin Catanoso is director of the journalism program at Wake Forest University and a regular contributor to 88.5 WFDD.
