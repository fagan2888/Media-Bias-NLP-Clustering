Ms. Burwell suggested that a huge campaign with thousands of field workers would be needed to keep enrollment at recent levels.\n\nWhy did the Obama administration set such a modest goal? It was part of an elaborate numbers game played for several years by proponents and opponents of the health law.\n\nOn the one hand, administration officials want to manage expectations in a presidential election year, when surpassing the goal will be better for Democrats than falling short. In this respect, federal officials are like corporate executives who smooth out earnings to meet or exceed projections given to investors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn the other hand, health policy experts said, the enrollment goal for 2016 may be realistic. The White House aims to have 10 million people insured through the new marketplaces at the end of 2016, an increase of just 100,000 over the number enrolled in June of this year, and experts said it would not be easy to find and enroll people who have refused to sign up for the last two years.\n\nStan Dorn, a health lawyer at the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group, said the enrollment goal was sensible. \u201cI am not optimistic that we will see more than that,\u201d Mr. Dorn said. \u201cThe easiest people to reach have already signed up.\u201d\n\nJudith Solomon, a vice president at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research and advocacy group, said the administration\u2019s target was \u201crealistic but disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe tax penalty for people who go without insurance will be higher next year: $695 for each adult or nearly 2.5 percent of household income, whichever is greater. That may encourage some people to enroll, Mr. Dorn said, but the cost of insurance is \u201cstill an obstacle\u201d for some.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is the latest prominent politician to suggest that the Affordable Care Act is not so affordable for some people. A significant number fail to pay their monthly premiums or struggle with high out-of-pocket costs for medical services and prescription drugs.\n\nThe cautious calculus by the White House, as the administration gears up for the third open-enrollment period, from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, tends to confirm perceptions of the health law that have been taking shape in the last two years. The expansion of Medicaid appears to be a more durable source of coverage than private insurance bought through the marketplaces.\n\nConsumers with the lowest incomes receive the largest subsidies in the exchanges, and many have concluded that subsidized insurance is a good value. More than 80 percent of people using the federal exchange have incomes less than 250 percent of the poverty level (less than $29,425 a year for an individual). But marketplace coverage has been less attractive to people with higher incomes who receive less financial assistance.\n\nOne of the big questions raised by the new target is whether enrollment is reaching a point where it will remain stable.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing evidence of having plateaued,\u201d said Richard G. Frank, an assistant secretary of health and human services. But, he added, \u201cwe are seeing a much longer path to long-term equilibrium in the market.\u201d\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office predicted in June that enrollment through the exchanges would reach 20 million in 2016 and then level off around 22 million through 2025.\n\nThe White House accepted the budget office\u2019s estimate for 2014 as a goal, but now administration officials do their own analysis and projections, and they take issue with the office\u2019s numbers.\n\nIf the administration\u2019s prediction disappointed supporters of the health law, it was in part because the administration had pumped up expectations with several years of optimistic reports on enrollment trends and market dynamics.\n\nThe history of Medicaid, enacted in 1965, and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, created in 1997, shows that it took years for them to gain momentum. Medicaid did not include all states until 1982, when Arizona joined. In a 2001 report, the Congressional Research Service said that \u201cuntil recently, there was general disappointment\u201d with the children\u2019s health initiative because of \u201clow enrollment rates early in the program.\u201d\n\nThe program for children, now seen as a great success, was devised and adopted with broad bipartisan support from members of Congress and state officials.\n\nBy contrast, the Affordable Care Act was adopted without any Republican votes, and Republicans\u2019 continual criticism of it may sow doubts among consumers about its benefits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Republicans lie to the American public for years about it, and they\u2019ve spent hundreds of millions of dollars to propagate those lies,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cSo the fact that there\u2019s a little bit of confusion is not surprising to me.\u201d\n\nRobert Laszewski, a consultant who works with insurance companies, said the goal announced Thursday by Ms. Burwell was astonishing and made him wonder, \u201cHas the Obama administration given up on Obamacare?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cEnrollment of 10 million people is not sustainable,\u201d Mr. Laszewski said. \u201cYou need almost twice that number to have a viable pool of policyholders with enough healthy people to pay for the sick.\u201d",
