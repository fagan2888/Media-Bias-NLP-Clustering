Michelson\n\nUnlike most how-to books, this one is thick with advice and instructions that require real work on the reader's part. But think about what's at stake: Your need to obtain the best possible diagnosis and treatment from an expensive but fractured network of health care providers. When Michelson was young, his father was told he needed open-heart surgery. The teenager called up the head of cardiology at a New York hospital and arranged for a second opinion; little surprise that he grew up to found a company that offers medical case management. \"Before we get sick,\" he writes, \"we believe that there is a health care 'system' out there that will help us navigate whatever ails us. But when illness strikes, the journey to wellness is terribly confusing.\" The steps Michelson offers for negotiating the system mirror what his company does for patients -- finding top experts and coordinating care. But it's clear why people pay for this service; it requires assertiveness, focus and follow-through at a very stressful time. You probably won't try all the tricks he recommends -- like demanding copies of your records at every medical encounter. But his insights about the importance of getting your caregivers to notice and talk to you are invaluable. (Alfred A. Knopf, Sept. 1, $24.95 hardcover)\n\n-- Barbara Peters Smith", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2271\"", "article_summary": "The steps Michelson offers for negotiating the system mirror what his company does for patients -- finding top experts and coordinating care.\n\"Before we get sick,\" he writes, \"we believe that there is a health care 'system' out there that will help us navigate whatever ails us.\nBut think about what's at stake: Your need to obtain the best possible diagnosis and treatment from an expensive but fractured network of health care providers.\n\"The Patient's Playbook: How to Save Your Life and the Lives of Those You Love,\" by Leslie D.
