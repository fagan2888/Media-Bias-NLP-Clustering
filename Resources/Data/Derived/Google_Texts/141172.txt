LETTER: Reader has personal stake in Burgum's Obamacare claims

In response to Doug Burgum's slick TV ads on Wayne Stenehjem supporting Obamacare, my wife summed it up like this:

"Wayne Stenehjem has always looked out for North Dakota people. When Obamacare was implemented and forced upon America, our state Legislature decided not to implement an Obamacare exchange. When Stenehjem saw that North Dakota families and individuals would not be able to afford health insurance, he reached across party lines in the case known as King v. Burwell.

"If that lawsuit had been successful, it would have eliminated the credits to help low-income families pay health insurance premiums. Stenehjem has always opposed Obamacare, but this law was not the way to eliminate it. Stenehjem has always looked out for our best interests." Nicely put by my wife, Cathy.

As a North Dakota farm boy, I'd say it like this: The Obamacare bull was let out of the corral by Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama. Stenehjem signed on early with a Florida lawsuit to block it. Stenehjem and other AGs opposed it because it was—and still is—unconstitutional. So this bull has been running wild all across America, trampling our health care system.

I'm dealing with it now, however, and I'm glad Wayne's action allowed the credits to keep coming so I can pay premiums for coverage.

If the King v. Burwell lawsuit had successful, I wouldn't have health insurance. I've been to the ER twice recently with chest pains, and I was admitted to the hospital to figure out what was wrong. Angiogram results indicated the narrowing of three arteries, requiring a triple bypass which was performed on April 28. I am recuperating and will return home soon.

Again, vote for Stenehjem for the next North Dakota governor. I believe Burgum means well and is a great guy, but I believe he needs to get off the Obamacare bull, because he will be riding this bull off into the sunset.
