Congress wants answers.\n\nAn oversight subcommittee of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee has decided to officially investigate the IRS\u2019s decision to award a $4.5 million IT contract to CGI Federal, the notorious Canadian IT company that was fired because of its key role in the Obamacare website fiasco.\n\nOn Friday, oversight chairman Rep. Peter J. Roskam sent a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen demanding documents related to the decision.\n\nIn the letter \u2014 obtained by The Daily Caller \u2014 the lawmaker requested the IRS turn over the actual CGI contract, internal IRS communications on the award, bidding information from CGI\u2019s competitors, as well as the names of IRS officials who approved the award.\n\nThe chairman fast-tracked his request, telling the IRS commissioner his subcommittee expected the documents to be turned over within two weeks time, and no later than February 6.\n\nRoskam\u2019s move constitutes the second time in as many days a congressional oversight body has decided that it would investigate the CGI award. The Daily Caller first disclosed the existence of the $4.5 million contract on Tuesday.\n\nIn his letter, Roskam said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d the IRS hired CGI after officials at U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the states of Vermont and Massachusetts fired the company for failure to design properly operating Obamacare websites.\n\nRoskam told the commissioner he was troubled that even after the firings, \u201cthe IRS selected the same contractor to provide critical technology services to the administration of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\u201d \u2014 also known as Obamacare.\n\nThursday, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform told TheDC he had instructed his staff to see if the government\u2019s fiasco over Obamacare was being repeated by the IRS.\n\n\u201cI am concerned that this type of mismanagement will be repeated by the current administration under the new IRS contract,\u201d he told TheDC via email.\n\nThis is the first year the IRS will process millions of American tax returns that demand taxpayer information on health care.\n\nIt also is the first time that Obamacare policymakers will be required to confirm household income and other private information to prove they were eligible for low-cost insurance through government subsidies.\n\nObamacare enrollees who earned too much money last year or misreported their income may face a smaller tax refund or actually pay additional money out of pocket.\n\nTaxpayers with insufficient health coverage may also face penalties.\n\nThe IRS software is particularly important this year because, for the first time in the agency\u2019s history, the IRS has adopted a so-called \u201cweb-only\u201d strategy to provide assistance to taxpayers who have health-care questions about their tax return.\n\nLive telephone service will not be available to those with Obamacare or health-care questions, according to Nina Olson, the U.S. Taxpayer Advocate, who is independent of the IRS.\n\nLast April, Olson, in testimony largely ignored by the media, warned senators about the IRS\u2019s \u201cweb-only strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile other agencies have telephone or web chat options, the IRS has adopted a web-first strategy that acts more as a \u2018web-only\u2019 strategy, limiting taxpayers\u2019 access to in-person assistance with tax-related health care questions,\u201d she told the Senate subcommittee on Financial Services then.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has specifically advised its assistors the best service to the customer is to provide the web URLs. This is known as the \u2018Web First\u2019 strategy,\u2019\u201d she told the senators.\n\nCongressman Roskam has been deeply critical of the IRS and intimately involved in previous crises at the IRS.\n\nHe was one of the key lawmakers at the center of the congressional investigation last year into the IRS\u2019s targeting of conservative organizations.\n\nThe congressman was also the prime sponsor of legislation that barred the IRS from inquiring about religious, political or social beliefs of citizens.\n\nIn his current letter to Koskinen, the chairman also wondered if the agency was squandering money by hiring companies that have a shoddy performance record.\n\n\u201cGiven your publicly-stated concerns about resource challenges at the IRS, I am seeking assurances that taxpayer dollars are being put to their highest and best use,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn addition to seeking all internal IRS communications regarding the hiring of CGI Federal, Roskam requested a description of \u201cwhen and how the IRS decided to hire CGI Federal, including the names of all IRS personnel involved in the decision-making process.\u201d\n\nHe further asked the tax agency to turn over the August 11, 2014 contract with CGI, as well as official bids from competitors.\n\nThe Illinois Republican also asked for \u201c[a] description of the controls the IRS has in place for this project to ensure that the problems associated with Healthcare.gov and the state exchange websites do not arise with this project.\u201d\n\nThe IRS has refused to respond to several requests for comment from TheDC.\n\nSee the letter:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "rpollock", "description": "'The names of all IRS personnel involved in the decision-making process'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Why did the Internal Revenue Service hire the same company that ruined HealthCare.gov to build the Obamacare tax system?
