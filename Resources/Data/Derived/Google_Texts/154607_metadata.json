Popplewell runs off, jumps into the driver's seat of a second sheriff's deputy's car and puts it in drive.\n\n?7/6/2014 Related Story: Authorities Identify Suspects In Deputy-Involved Shooting?\n\nOne deputy attempted to pull Popplewell from the vehicle. Instead, Popplewell dragged that deputy several feet before crashing into Mormann's SUV.\n\n\n\nAccording to the district attorney, Popplewell then put the car in reverse, threatening the life of that deputy who was then laying on the ground behind the car.\n\n\n\nThe first pop was the sound of a taser, almost a warning for what the deputies had to do next.\n\n\n\nThe shots are what killed 27-year-old Nicholas Popplewell.\n\n\n\n\"In these circumstances, nothing is ever easy,\" said Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn. \"Someone lost their life, but was it clear, after all the evidence was taken into consideration, that the use of force was justified? Yes.\"\n\n\n\nIn the video, you see the driver of the SUV, Mormann, watch everything unfold.\n\n\n\nDetectives later found out Mormann did not know Popplewell and had just picked him up for a plumbing job.\n\n\n\nDetectives also later discovered Popplewell had three warrants out for his arrest at the time of the incident.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Two Cleveland County deputies are back to work after being involved in a deadly shooting.", "author": "Justin Dougherty", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/26177260/dash-cam-video-released-after-officers-involved-in-shooting-are-cleared", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4374637_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two Cleveland County deputies are back to work after being involved in a deadly shooting.", "title": "Dash Cam Video Released After Officers Involved In Shooting Are Cleared"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/4374637_G.jpg", "description": "Two Cleveland County deputies are back to work after being involved in a deadly shooting.", "card": "summary", "title": "Dash Cam Video Released After Officers Involved In Shooting Are Cleared"}, "wnreadableurl": "dash-cam-video-released-after-officers-involved-in-shooting-are-cleared", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/08/01", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,cleveland, county, deputy, involved, Shooting, norman, dash cam, Christopher Mormann, Nicholas Popplewell, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS16", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,cleveland, county, deputy, involved, Shooting, norman, dash cam, Christopher Mormann, Nicholas Popplewell, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "In the video, you see the driver of the SUV, Mormann, watch everything unfold.\n\"In these circumstances, nothing is ever easy,\" said Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn.\nDetectives also later discovered Popplewell had three warrants out for his arrest at the time of the incident.\nDetectives later found out Mormann did not know Popplewell and had just picked him up for a plumbing job.\n7/5/2014 Related Story: One Suspect Dead, Another In Custody After Officer-Involved Shooting In NormanJuly 5 - 8:47 a.m.Cleveland County Sheriff's Deputy Cody Shobe initiates a routine traffic stop."}
