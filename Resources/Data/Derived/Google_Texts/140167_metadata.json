Now the grades are averaged and tabulated: Obama gets a mediocre B-.\n\nMany participating academics included comments to explain their grades (a practice HNN encouraged). Based on those comments, the general scholarly consensus is that Obama just hasn\u2019t moved the country far enough to the left.\n\nSure, there have been the two Supreme Court appointments. The surveyed historians loved the choice of Elena Kagan and were positively effusive over the choice of Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nThe scholars also applauded the assassination of Osama Bin Laden and credited Obama with ending the Iraq War.\n\nHistorians also roundly praised Obama for his role in passing the Affordable Care Act. At the same time. however, many also lamented the modesty of the law and complained that Obamacare should have gone farther to overhaul the American healthcare system.\n\nOther criticism centered on Obama\u2019s failure to fulfill his much-ballyhooed promise to shutter Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. military\u2019s heavy reliance on drone strikes was another cause for concern.\n\nThe professors also condemned Obama for his management of the economy. HNN did not specify exactly which policies they don\u2019t like or would change.\n\nThe president also came in for disapproval over his relationship with Congress. However, most respondents who commented in this regard placed the blame for gridlock squarely on those dastardly Republicans.\n\nStill other areas of concern among the surveyed scholars are the prosecution of Bradley Chelsea Manning and the Obama administration\u2019s general lack of transparency.\n\n(The survey was largely complete before Edward Snowden leaked details of several top-secret programs and fled to Russia.)\n\nThe 203 American history professors gave Obama an A- for both \u201ccommunication ability\u201d and \u201cSupreme Court appointments.\u201d The 44th president got a B for \u201cdiplomacy and foreign policy\u201d but just a B- for \u201cnational security and wartime leadership.\u201d He got another a B- for \u201chandling economy.\u201d For \u201ctransparency and accountability,\u201d he received a C+.\n\nObama\u2019s lowest grade was a C for \u201crelationship with Congress.\u201d\n\nHalf of the professors who responded to the HNN survey are affiliated with public colleges and universities. Some 12 percent are highfalutin Ivy League academics. Three percent are employed by the service academies.\n\n(h/t: The College Fix)\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter and send education-related story tips to [email protected].", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Owens", "description": "George Mason University History News Network (HNN) surveyed 203 American history professors on President Obama in 15 categories and Obama got B- overall", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "George Mason University's History News Network (HNN) recently asked a few hundred American historians to give President Barack Obama letter grades in 15 different categories.
