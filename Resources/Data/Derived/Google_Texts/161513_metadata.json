Their results reflected a slight increase over 2013 results.\n\n\u201cProviders continue to target POS collections as a beneficial by-product of the emphasis on pre-service patient engagement and communication,\u201d said Sandra Wolfskill, director of revenue cycle MAP at the HFMA.\n\n[See also: Collection tips for community hospitals.]\n\nAccording to The Advisory Board\u2019s 2013 Survey of Hospital Revenue Cycle Operations, hospitals are indeed getting better at collecting at the point of service. The high-performance POS collections quartile improved by 64 percent since 2011, while median performance improved 38 percent.\n\nHFMA\u2019s Wolfskill said that the continued implementation of technology tools is critically important to boosting point of service collections.\n\n\u201cPrice estimator tools designed to link the patient\u2019s benefits with the service being provided can produce the expected out-of-pocket responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are being deployed in both the pre-service and time of service processes.\u201d\n\nWolfskill explained that automated messaging systems are also being used, not only to remind scheduled patients about their upcoming service, but also as an opportunity to support the point of service collections process.\n\n[See also: Billing and Collections.]\n\nThis is achieved \u201cby reminding the patient to bring the payment that was agreed to during the pre-registration call,\u201d she said. \u201cElderly patients in particular are sometimes reluctant to give credit card information over the phone.\u201d\n\nNick Fabrizio, principal at the Medical Group Management Association\u2019s Health Care Consulting Group, agreed with Wolfskill, and said hospitals and medical groups that do a better job of connecting to the patient, and outlining the patient\u2019s responsibilities, inevitably do better in terms of collecting at the point of care.\n\n\u201cThe better [providers] are collecting information about the patient, so when the patient comes through the door, they know what kind of insurance they have,\u201d Fabrizio said. \u201cIf they can understand that, and verify the information, as well as communicate with the patient on the front end, then when the patient comes in the door for their first appointment, they can have a meaningful discussion about what the patient's financial obligations are.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/point-service-collections-rise", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Sandra_Wolfskill.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "As providers continue adjusting to the reimbursement changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act, it appears increasingly likely that hospitals will place more emphasis on collecting payments at the point of service.", "title": "Point of service collections on the rise"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Sandra_Wolfskill.jpeg"}, "description": "As providers continue adjusting to the reimbursement changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act, it appears increasingly likely that hospitals will place more emphasis on collecting payments at the point of service.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Point of service collections on the rise"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "As providers continue adjusting to the reimbursement changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act, it appears increasingly likely that hospitals will place more emphasis on collecting payments at the point of service.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "HFMA\u2019s Wolfskill said that the continued implementation of technology tools is critically important to boosting point of service collections.\n\u201cThey are being deployed in both the pre-service and time of service processes.\u201dWolfskill explained that automated messaging systems are also being used, not only to remind scheduled patients about their upcoming service, but also as an opportunity to support the point of service collections process.\nAccording to The Advisory Board\u2019s 2013 Survey of Hospital Revenue Cycle Operations, hospitals are indeed getting better at collecting at the point of service.\nAs providers continue adjusting to the reimbursement changes wrought by the Affordable Care Act, it appears increasingly likely that hospitals will place more emphasis on collecting payments at the point of service.\n\u201cPrice estimator tools designed to link the patient\u2019s benefits with the service being provided can produce the expected out-of-pocket responsibility,\u201d she said."}
