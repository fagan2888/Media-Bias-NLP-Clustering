He has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with a state court, asking for release from captivity. But Tommy is a chimpanzee (the petition was filed on his behalf by an animal rights group), and New York grants the right of habeas review to \u201cpersons.\u201d\n\nSo Tommy must persuade a judge that he is a person if he is to have his day in court. He and the craft company Hobby Lobby\u2014which operates according to its owners\u2019 Christian convictions, and is mounting a religious freedom challenge to the contraception mandate in Obamacare\u2014have become an unlikely pair in an ideologically tinged battle over what a \u201cperson\u201d is. There has been much mockery of the idea that \u201ccorporations are people, my friend,\u201d as Mitt Romney put it. But if you think it matters whether the law calls a chimpanzee, corporation, or even human zygote a \u201cperson,\u201d you are making a fundamental error about how the law works.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there is nothing remarkable about a chimpanzee claiming to be a person. Indeed, there are a number of cases that have been brought by animals\u2014including a palila, a marbled murrelet, and a spotted owl. All of these animals sought to enforce their rights under the Endangered Species Act, under a provision that gives \u201cpersons\u201d the right to bring suit.\n\nIn none of these cases was a judge fooled into thinking that an animal possesses all the rights of human beings. The lawyers bringing them were simply ensuring that a judicial remedy was available to address the harm that Congress sought to fix. If the spotted owl had also asked for the right to vote, the request would have been denied. A judge wouldn\u2019t give a hoot that an earlier court had deemed the owl a \u201cperson\u201d under the Endangered Species Act. A person for one legal purpose is not necessarily a person for another.\n\nThe law also treats various nonhuman, nonsentient entities as \u201cpersons\u201d for certain legal purposes. Corporations, estates, trusts, partnerships, and government entities are often defined this way. Walmart, Illinois, and the California Pension Fund can sue, for example, without anyone asking if they have a right to abortion. Sometimes, corporations can bring suit (or be sued) because a statute explicitly gives \u201cpersons\u201d that right, and defines \u201cpersons\u201d to include corporations. At other times, the statute does not define \u201cpersons,\u201d but courts interpret the word to include corporations because they believe that is what Congress intended. This transubstantiation of corporations into persons advances some pretty uncontroversial policy goals. If corporations lacked personhood, you couldn\u2019t sue FedEx for crashing a van into your car, or Walmart for selling you a defective space heater that burns down your home, or J.P. Morgan for defrauding you when you get a lemon mortgage. You wouldn\u2019t be able to enter into contracts with a corporation at all. Legislatures and courts have been treating corporations like persons for hundreds of years: There is even a general interpretive rule in the law that when Congress says \u201cpersons,\u201d it means corporations as well, unless the context of the statute provides otherwise.\n\nThe legal fiction that corporations are persons helps courts prevent people from evading, or losing opportunities from, laws that are too narrowly written. For example, imagine that a town enacts a zoning ordinance that gives certain rights (to build here or there) to \u201cpersons\u201d and imposes obligations on them (not to build too high). The city council will usually define \u201cpersons\u201d to include corporations. Or if it forgets to, a court will likely interpret \u201cpersons\u201d that way. You don\u2019t want someone to evade a zoning restriction simply by incorporating a business that he solely controls and then erecting a skyscraper in a residential neighborhood.\n\nHobby Lobby argues that corporations enjoy the right to free exercise of religion provided by a 1993 law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. RFRA protects \u201cpersons\u201d from certain religiously burdensome laws and regulations, and Hobby Lobby argues that Congress meant to include corporations under that shield. Hobby Lobby\u2019s opponents do not argue that RFRA doesn\u2019t apply to corporations\u2014they can\u2019t, because it is undisputed that the statute applies to nonprofit corporations like the Catholic Church. The argument instead is that Congress did not intend RFRA to apply to for-profit, commercial corporations. Whoever is right, the answer turns on what Congress intended, not the metaphysics of personal identity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick says that \u201c[c]onferring human attributes such as religious conviction and the capacity for embarrassment on a corporation is dangerous,\u201d and that right-wingers harbor \u201cthe ambition of large, for-profit corporations to see themselves as people, with faith, convictions, and consciences.\u201d But the law already treats corporations as capable of being reckless or negligent; of having intentions, beliefs, and states of mind. If it didn\u2019t, then it would be impossible to hold a corporation guilty of committing a crime. Of course, judges don\u2019t think that corporations possess mental states. To find a corporation guilty of a crime, they determine if relevant employees had the requisite bad intent, and then attribute it to the corporation as a whole. Far from turning persons into \u201cthings,\u201d as Lithwick argues, these laws protect people from corporate wrongdoing and enable them to benefit from the goods and services that only corporations can provide.\n\nWhat of bills that would deny women the right to abortion by defining one-celled human zygotes as \u201cpersons\u201d? If the effect of such a definition is to deprive women of their constitutional rights, then a court should\u2014and will\u2014strike down the law. Legislatures cannot use legal fictions to change physical facts. They would have just as much success disenfranchising women by defining them as chimpanzees.\n\nSpeaking of which, Tommy will lose his case. The reason is not that it would be horrible or dehumanizing if a legislature chose to include animals in its definition of \u201cpersons\u201d for the purpose of asking to be released from captivity. Tommy\u2019s theory that private individuals should be permitted to come to his aid if state agencies fail to enforce animal welfare laws is not a crazy one. Nor would such a rule throw into doubt whether there is any relevant moral difference between human beings and animals, as some religious commentators fear. The Catholic Church held ecclesiastical trials of rats, mice, and other vermin for more than two centuries, apparently to punish them for destroying crops, yet no one thought that because mice were entitled to defense lawyers, they must also be allowed to own property or to serve as witnesses in the trials of their accomplices. The spotted owl, too, remains firmly on the animal side of the species barrier, despite its legal victory against the U.S. government.\n\nThe reason Tommy will lose is that the New York Legislature did not intend to encompass animals within the definition of \u201cperson\u201d for filing a habeas petition. If lawmakers had meant to extend the writ of habeas in this way, when that had never been done before, they would have said so. If Hobby Lobby wins, on the other hand, it will be because courts think that Congress did intend to encompass for-profit corporations within the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in providing for religious freedom. Whatever you make of these outcomes, you don\u2019t have to worry that chimpanzees, craft stores, and zygotes will use them to conquer the planet and enslave humanity.
