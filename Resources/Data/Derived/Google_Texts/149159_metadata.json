Photo: Getty Images\n\nI have a dear friend who is one of the strongest feminists I know. Yet, when I tell other women that former Footy Show host, Collingwood president and Channel 9 personality Eddie McGuire is that person, the reaction is disbelief.\n\nHe can't be! How could he be? It's a PR stunt. I am being conned. There's just no way ...\n\nNow, I understand why some people may have that impression \u2013 Eddie does dwell in some blokey domains and some of his mates may not be as inclined, but the fact remains he is not just a committed feminist, but an active one. I know it because I have seen it.\n\nHe recently spearheaded the building of a women's change room at Collingwood's training facilities after noticing girls running around the Tan in the mornings had nowhere safe to shower and change. He is determined to find ways to help stem the epidemic of domestic violence in Australia and is tirelessly committed to numerous charities, many with women and children's welfare at their core. What's more, he speaks about the women in his life with respect and near-on reverence, something I know he is passionate about passing on to his two young boys.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's a guy who gets bagged a lot in the press, but I wish others could see Eddie through my eyes \u2013 it would certainly open theirs. There is a lot more to the man than footy calls.\n\nBut this isn't about Eddie, this is about good men in general \u2013 men who do not want to be considered part of the patriarchy. Good men who read the same domestic violence stats \u2013 showing one in four Australian women will be abused by a male known to them in their lifetimes \u2013 and who want to do something about it. Good men who do not talk about their sexual conquests with their mates, reducing women to mere sperm receptacles. Men who believe in equal rights, equal pay, equal representation and who respect and value the effort that goes in to raising children.\n\nIt is to good men such as these I would like to hand on the baton of feminism because I, like so many women I know, am fatigued. I just don't know if I have the energy to run another lap, to espouse the same messages and urge on change yet again.\n\nI feel we women have shouldered the heavy load for too long, because the reality is, if we really want change, it is men who are going to have to activate it. The next, and much-needed, wave of feminism has to be led by men if it is to succeed.\n\nThink about it: If we want equal pay, it is up to the men who are running the business in Australia to insist on it. If we want more board positions, it is men who are going to have to elect us. If we want generational change, it is men who are going to have to instil respect for women in their sons. And if we want to stop domestic violence, it is men who are going to have to unclench their fists and stop hitting women.\n\nFor too long the notion of feminism has entailed women striving for change, with imagery and messages wrongly regarded as anti-men. But the fact is, we need men. We want men on board. We love men. We know they hold the majority of power and influence. The baton needs to be placed in their hands if we are ever going to change over the line.\n\nAnd while I despair at the statistics, I also take solace that good men exist, strong men who view women as equals and want us represented as such.\n\nTake, for example, some of Australia's top comedians I've had the recent pleasure of contacting on behalf of a fund-raiser I'm helping put together on November 13 to support St Kilda Gatehouse, an organisation that gives street-based sex workers the dignity of a safe place.\n\nImagine how many charity requests these men receive, yet within 24 hours of contacting Lawrence Mooney, Greg Fleet, Adam Zwar, Mick Molloy and Rhys Muldoon, all replied with an enthusiastic yes to offering their time and talent, with most thanking me for the opportunity.\n\nGood men, all of them, only too willing to take up the baton for their sisters. Not just to talk the talk, but walk the walk.\n\nIt is men like this I believe should be celebrated and I don't care who knocks me for it. It is too easy to write off good men; to think that because they are masculine they lack a feminine side, that because the power lies in their hands they need to hold on to it. That you can't be a great bloke, a man's man, and still respect the gender that enable their very existence.\n\nI'll put my hand up and admit it: I was one who would write off men too quickly; to judge them by their footy colours, their burly builds or their limited emotional vocabulary. But I've discovered that big hearts beat in broad chests, bless 'em.\n\nAt a time when abortion rights are once again on the public agenda, and many women are actively (and in my view, ignorantly) spurning feminism, or burnt out and brow beaten from fighting the fight, it is the knowledge that good men exist and are willing to take up the slack that restores my faith.\n\nLet's respect, cherish and encourage them, as they do us.\n\nFairfax columnist Wendy Squires is a journalist, editor and author.\n\nTwitter: @Wendy_Squires", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Eddie McGuire, The Footy Show, feminism, men, sexual assault, women, respect, Collingwood, StKilda Gathouse, Lawrence Mooney, Greg Fleet, Adam Zwar, Mick Molloy, Rhys Muldoon", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "The next, and much-needed, wave of feminism has to be led by men if it is to succeed.", "title": "Is this man the kind of feminist women need?", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/comment/is-this-man-the-kind-of-feminist-women-need-20141016-1177e4.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/1/7/l/j/e/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.1177e4.png/1427774424748.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/1/7/l/j/e/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.1177e4.png/1427774424748.jpg"}, "description": "The next, and much-needed, wave of feminism has to be led by men if it is to succeed.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is this man the kind of feminist women need?"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "The next, and much-needed, wave of feminism has to be led by men if it is to succeed."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a9d\"", "article_summary": "Good men who do not talk about their sexual conquests with their mates, reducing women to mere sperm receptacles.\nGood men, all of them, only too willing to take up the baton for their sisters.\nAnd while I despair at the statistics, I also take solace that good men exist, strong men who view women as equals and want us represented as such.\nBut this isn't about Eddie, this is about good men in general \u2013 men who do not want to be considered part of the patriarchy.\nIf we want generational change, it is men who are going to have to instil respect for women in their sons."}
