Georgia became the 41st state to require coverage.\n\nFaye Montgomery, advocacy director of the Matthew Reardon School for Autism in Chatham County, works with families to help find resources and support. She played a major role in the seven-year battle to get Ava\u2019s Law passed.\n\n\u201cA family who has a kid with autism and who has private insurance now can\u2019t be denied services that are medically necessary,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Georgia lags behind most states in providing insurance coverage for early autism treatment, it\u2019s one of only three states that have created a statewide autism plan funded through federal grants.\n\nResearch shows that treatment at an early age can reduce or even negate the effects, as well as reduce the overall cost of treatment during an individual\u2019s lifetime.\n\n\u201c(Therapy) is incredibly critical for anyone with autism,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard for anyone who doesn\u2019t live with someone with autism to understand what makes it so different and why ABA is so critical.\u201d\n\nNo standard price exists for ABA services, she said, even though Ava\u2019s Law sets the coverage cap at $35,000.\n\nBoth Georgia\u2019s executive and legislative branches have also recently appropriated additional state funds to expand autism treatment options.\n\nOver the past eight years, the Georgia General Assembly has continually increased the amount of state funds appropriated for nonprofit organizations that provide diagnosis, care and treatment. The state provides $4.2 million to nonprofit organizations, such as the Matthew Reardon School, a year-round school for autistic children.\n\nIt costs $40,000 per year for the school to educate each student, said Patti Victor, the school\u2019s president and CEO. State and private funding allows the tuition to remain low enough for families to afford.\n\nDoctors diagnose around one in 64 children in Georgia each year with autism spectrum disorder, which includes autistic disorder and Asperger syndrome. That\u2019s higher than the national average, which is one in 68 children.\n\n\u201cThe thing that\u2019s really important for us, and a lot of people in the autism world, is that (Ava\u2019s Law) has opened the door for insurance,\u201d Victor said.\n\nGraham Thompson, executive director of the Georgia Association of Health Plans, said the employer community generally opposes state-mandated benefits, as those often lead to increases in premiums.\n\n\u201cThey want increased flexibility to offer their employees the health insurance they need,\u201d he said.\n\nMontgomery said access to early therapy continues to be difficult to find in Georgia.\n\n\u201cUp until now, unless a family had some money to come out of pocket to pay for it, there really was no access to it at all,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd even though Ava\u2019s Law has been passed, she said a lot of families still do not have private insurance and will not be covered because the law only applies to insurance companies selling policies. It doesn\u2019t include large employers who insure themselves. However, the state\u2019s insurance for government workers and teachers began including the coverage last year, before the law required it.\n\nVictor said the law provides a \u201cfoot in the door\u201d for future legislation.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happens when the child turns 7?\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a long-term standpoint, an important part of Ava\u2019s Law is that it has put autism on the minds of people who have the ability to pass laws and to offer assistance.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, General Assembly, Health, Local News, Features, Lauren McDonald", "og": {"site_name": "Online Athens", "description": "ATLANTA | Due to a new state law that took effect July 1, private insurance companies must provide coverage for the best therapeutic treatment for children with autism ages 6 and under.", "title": "Georgia law mandating insurance coverage for autistic children now in effect", "url": "http://onlineathens.com/general-assembly/2015-07-07/georgia-law-mandating-insurance-coverage-autistic-children-now-effect", "image": "http://onlineathens.com/sites/default/files/justice-2_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "OnlineAthens.com is the daily online edition of The Athens (GA) Banner-Herald."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2a6\"", "article_summary": "However, the state\u2019s insurance for government workers and teachers began including the coverage last year, before the law required it.\nATLANTA | Due to a new state law that took effect July 1, private insurance companies must provide coverage for the best therapeutic treatment for children with autism ages 6 and under.\nShe played a major role in the seven-year battle to get Ava\u2019s Law passed.\nAnd even though Ava\u2019s Law has been passed, she said a lot of families still do not have private insurance and will not be covered because the law only applies to insurance companies selling policies.\nAva\u2019s Law, passed unanimously this year by the Georgia General Assembly, requires private insurance companies to cover Applied Behavior Analysis therapy for the first time in the state\u2019s history."}
