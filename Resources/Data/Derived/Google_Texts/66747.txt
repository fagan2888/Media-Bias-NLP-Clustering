Dog the Bounty Hunter shocked the women on Fox News’ “Outnumbered” today when he said that he didn’t believe that “rising GOP star” Marco Rubio would be able to defeat the “dynamic duo” of Bill and Hillary Clinton.

The panel was discussing the Fox News poll released yesterday, in which Rubio was identified as leading the GOP field with the support of 13 percent of likely Republican primary voters.

When asked how he felt about Rubio’s presidential chances, Duane “Dog” Chapman said that he “liked him, he came out swinging — and his wife is beautiful — but I don’t think he could beat the dynamic duo.”

“Who is ‘the dynamic duo’?” one of the off-screen co-hosts asked.

“The Clintons,” he replied, much to the dismay of the four women he was sharing a couch with. “I want someone in there with experience. We’re at war.”

Co-host Sandra Smith said that her experience, especially her time at the State Department, would work against her, but Chapman remained adamant about Hillary Clinton’s credentials. “I don’t know,” he said, “I heard her once say if they keep doing this, we’re going to make it a parking lot.”
