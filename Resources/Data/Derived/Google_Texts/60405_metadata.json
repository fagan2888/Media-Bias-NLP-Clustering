(Photo: Philip Scott Andrews Special to the Courier Journal)\n\nWhen Mary Tindall and two other nurses were told that two of them had to go to Vietnam, she volunteered.\n\n\"I wanted it to be on my own time,\" Tindall said.\n\nThat was back in 1969. It was before she met her husband John while serving, before 40 percent of the patients at the hospital in Vietnam died and before her own son eventually entered the military.\n\nSunday, Tindall stood in front of a crowd of about 75 to share her experience for the 23rd Annual Memorial Day Service honoring \"women veterans who gave their all\" at the Highland Memory Gardens. The ceremony was held by the 454th chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n\nRELATED: Waterfront flag planting honors fallen veterans\n\n\n\nShe told the story of Sharon Lane, the first woman to die of hostile fire in Vietnam, and she recognized many other women whose services went unrecognized for years. She also reminded the crowd that Gov. Steve Beshear proclaimed 2015 the year of the woman veteran in Kentucky.\n\nThe Rev. Tom Dillard sang the National Anthem and joined the group in prayer. There was a prayer of remembrance by Margaret Holmes and Wynella Berthards, and a reading of names by Judy Mitchell.\n\nAnother Vietnam veteran, James Angelini, read a poem he wrote dedicated to his friend who died next to him during their service.\n\nStory continues after the gallery.\n\nThe service included a flag ceremony and a 21-gun salute. A scholarship was given to two JROTC members from the Vietnam Veterans Association. A wreath was also presented for each branch of the military, including a wreath for the South Vietnamese Army.\n\n\"We appreciate the U.S. Armed Forces for our freedom and our people's freedom,\" said Hung Lee, a Vietnam veteran who served for the South Vietnamese Army.\n\nRELATED: Man making retreat a reality for troubled vets\n\nThe crowd consisted of attendees who had gone to the event for years, to those who just happened to be walking through the gardens that day.\n\nZelma Greegor has attended the service since her husband was buried in the Memory Gardens in 2008. Greegor sat on her walker with a large flag in hand next to her husband's grave before the ceremony started. She was waiting for her great grandson, Mason.\n\n\"He likes to put the flag in,\" Greegor said as she motioned to the vase atop her husband's grave.\n\nGreegor said she also decorates and cleans the grave of the stone to the left of her husband's.\n\n\"We just noticed nobody ever came to decorate it, and it's a small thing to do compared to their big sacrifice,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., Tindall said she wants people to know more about the veterans than simply seeing their names on the wall.\n\n\"They should also know something about the people because they were more than just names,\" she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1HDGWj4", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mary Tindall, retired nurse and Vietnam veteran spoke to a crowd about her experiences at the 23rd Annual Memorial Day Service.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Mary Tindall, retired nurse and Vietnam veteran spoke to a crowd about her experiences at the 23rd Annual Memorial Day Service.", "title": "Women veterans honored in ceremony", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2015/05/24/women-veterans-honored-ceremony/27894125/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mary Tindall, retired nurse and Vietnam veteran spoke to a crowd about her experiences at the 23rd Annual Memorial Day Service.", "title": "Women veterans honored in ceremony", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b3f4a0e683dc60df530d86e7cadb95a290cfc1d2/c=0-500-2000-2500&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Armed Forces", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Armed Forces", "title": "Women veterans honored in ceremony", "author": "Janica Kaneshiro", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7d5d9e0c3a8f133df634b1266cf0de9e0754fb71/c=0-166-2000-2833/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8890282a74cf88069f1070664ffec7bd8e88a668/c=0-500-2000-2500/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a75a54baf56a734c6b274492e1ac2405ea2a6c34/c=0-750-2000-2250/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9a7017b0abdb3920027ad04f933136483de8e4c/c=0-938-2000-2063&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-05-25T22:16:08.313000-04:00", "shorthed": "Women veterans honored in ceremony", "articleid": 27894125, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/564052dc746b1b1afed3d365e547c9ed1a50e32f/c=0-938-2000-2063/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5197f0e2533370bd0134662e4a1333f367e8bb71/c=156-0-1844-3000/local/-/media/2015/05/24/Louisville/B9317392963Z.1_20150524183232_000_GOFASLKVI.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Vietnam Veterans Memorial, women veterans, female veterans, U.S. veterans, memorial day 2015, memorial day louisville, vietnam veterans, vietnam veterans association"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce1a\"", "article_summary": "The event, organized by the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 454, honored Female veterans for their service and sacrifice.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Judy Mitchell reads the names of women have served in the military during a Memorial Day ceremony to honor women veterans.\nThe ceremony was held by the 454th chapter of the Vietnam Veterans of America.\nSpeaking about the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., Tindall said she wants people to know more about the veterans than simply seeing their names on the wall.\nA scholarship was given to two JROTC members from the Vietnam Veterans Association."}
