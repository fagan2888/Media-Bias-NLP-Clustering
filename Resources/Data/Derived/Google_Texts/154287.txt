Thursday during Fox News Channel’s countdown to the new year special, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, predicted that the forthcoming year would be a great year because it would be the final year of President Barack Obama’s last term, which would be the end for a number of his policies.

“2016 is going to be the last year of the Obama presidency,” Cruz said. “2016 is going to be the last year before Hillary retires permanently to Chappaqua.”

He also said it would be the end of ObamaCare, the IRS and ISIS and compared it to the year before Ronald Reagan became president of the United States.

“Like 1980, 2016 is going to be a very, very good year,” he said.
