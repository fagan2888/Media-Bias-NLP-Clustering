He was smiling as he said this, so it is not clear whether he was using this theory just to illustrate some point. But, in any case, he was not claiming this as a fact.\n\nMore important, the pyramids are not an issue in today\u2019s American political campaign, except as a \u201cgotcha\u201d gimmick.\n\nYet the media have paid far more attention to Ben Carson\u2019s speculation about what the pyramids were built for, thousands of years ago, than to outright lies that Hillary Clinton told about tragic American deaths in Benghazi, within days after she knew the truth, as her own emails now reveal.\n\nAnother media tempest in a teapot has developed because of the mild-mannered Carson\u2019s recollections about some childhood incidents in which he depicted himself as violent toward another child. Some people who knew the young Ben Carson have said that such behavior would have been out of character for him. But has no one ever acted out of character, especially in childhood?\n\nAlbert Einstein, as a child, once threw a heavy object at his little sister that could have injured her or even killed her. Yet Einstein grew up to be a mild-mannered pacifist, and no one ever brought up that incident to try to discredit Einstein\u2019s scientific work.\n\nWhat has been far more disturbing than anything Ben Carson has said or done has been the media\u2019s search-and-destroy mission against the renowned brain surgeon. The utter irrelevance of the issues raised by the media, at a time when the country faces monumental challenges at home and overseas, makes the media hype grotesque. It tells us more about the media than about Carson.\n\nBy contrast, the media showed no such zeal to expose Barack Obama\u2019s associations and alliances with a whole series of people who expressed their hatred of America in words and/or deeds. Here was something relevant to his suitability to become president. But the media saw no evil, heard no evil and spoke no evil.\n\nNor have the media launched such attacks on President Obama as they have on candidate Carson, even after Obama proceeded to abandon existing American commitments to provide defensive aid to countries in Eastern Europe and to directly promote the destruction of governments in Egypt and Libya that posed no threat to American interests \u2013 all the while undermining Israel\u2019s ability to defend itself.\n\nMeanwhile he cut back on our own military defense so drastically that even former secretaries of Defense who had served during his administration have publicly criticized his policies. So have former top generals and former top intelligence officials.\n\nBut the media largely circled the wagons to protect Obama \u2013 and now to protect Secretary of State Clinton, who carried out the foreign policies that left America\u2019s position in virtually all regions of the world worse than when the Obama administration took office.\n\nIt was much the same story on domestic issues. Obama\u2019s outright lies, that people would be able to keep their own doctors and their own health insurance under Obamacare, were far more consequential than Carson\u2019s offhand speculation about the pyramids. But did the media try to destroy Obama\u2019s credibility?\n\nUnfortunately, the moment Carson entered the political arena it became inevitable that the media would try to discredit him, since any prominent conservative black figure is a threat to the left\u2019s vision and the Democrats\u2019 voting base. The flimsy basis for the current attacks only demonstrates the media\u2019s bias and desperation.\n\nThomas Sowell is an author, economist and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Republic", "description": "Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s whole life has been unusual, so perhaps we should not be surprised to see the latest twist \u2013 the media going ballistic over discrepancies in a few things he said.
