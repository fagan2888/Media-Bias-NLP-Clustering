The National Football League said it had chosen Twitter as its exclusive global partner for streaming its Thursday night games during the 2016 regular season.

Twitter, whose shares were up about 1 percent in early trading Tuesday before reversing to end down modestly, will stream 10 games for free, the NFL said in a statement.

The deal also includes in-game highlights as well as pregame broadcasts from players and teams on Periscope, Twitter's live-streaming video service.

Twitter outbid a number of companies, including Verizon Communications, Yahoo, and Amazon.com to win the deal, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. Facebook dropped out of the bidding last week, the report said.
