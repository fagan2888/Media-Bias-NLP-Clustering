Currently, the country has 31 hospitals, 178 basic care clinics and 654 outreach clinics serving a population of 700,000. The program has the potential to impact the model of rural care delivery globally.\n\nMatternet uses small quadcopters to carry 4-pound loads between pre-designated stations no more than 12 1/2 miles apart. Each drone costs between $2,000 and $5,000.\n\nAlthough Bhutan's conditions are poor for small drone flight, Matternet said that they haven't had any incidents yet \u2014 although the drones have not been tested in heavy rains.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nThis has the potential to become a huge market in the healthcare industry. If the Matternet pilot is able to make care delivery by drone conceivable both practically and financially, which it seems likely that it will do, it's hard not to wonder what implications this could have for rural care in the United States. Amazon is already exploring the use of drones to deliver packages to customers; The company is currently pushing the federal government to create regulations for unmanned aerial vehicles that would make it possible for Amazon to test small commercial drones.\n\nIf Amazon thinks it can use drones to deliver purchases to consumers in 30 minutes or less, the potential for drone use in the healthcare landscape looks less pie-in-the-sky. Drones could conceivably be used to deliver needed prescriptions to consumers in rural areas. And theoretically, home and remote care through drone use could benefit from the increased push for regulations easing the path for telemedicine.\n\n\"Essentially, we see a market of civil government and commercial in terms $5.4 billion over the next decade,\" said aerospace industry analyst Phil Finnegan.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nQuartz: A revolutionary drone-based delivery network is being tested\u2014in Bhutan", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie Bo Williams", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "medium": "news", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-health-it,healthcare-practice-mgmt", "description": "Healthcare", "category": "News Post", "title": "How far off are drones in the delivery of rural care?", "pub_date": "aug 11, 2014", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-11T14:40:12", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Monday, August 11, 2014, 02:40 PM", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/71/ab/71ab9256052e798795fe04ff3a78023f.jpg", "news_keywords": "Health IT,Practice Management,Practice Mgmt", "sailthru.expire_date": "2024-07-29T14:40:12", "teaser": "<p>If Amazon thinks it can use drones to&nbsp;deliver purchases to consumers in 30 minutes or less, the potential for drone use in the healthcare landscape looks less pie-in-the-sky.</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2014-08-11", "sailthru.description": "If Amazon thinks it can use drones to\u00a0deliver purchases to consumers in 30 minutes or less, the potential for drone use in the healthcare landscape looks less pie-in-the-sky.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "If Amazon thinks it can use drones to\u00a0deliver purchases to consumers in 30 minutes or less, the potential for drone use in the healthcare landscape looks less pie-in-the-sky.", "title": "How far off are drones in the delivery of rural care?", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/how-far-off-are-drones-in-the-delivery-of-rural-care/296429/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/8725078749_b8baf91344_z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/fd/fa/fdfad1b9badada3fffd7c3c34ff32c68.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd777e\"", "article_summary": "The program has the potential to impact the model of rural care delivery globally.\nDive Brief:A Silicon Valley startup called Matternet is pioneering a pilot program that uses drones to connect rural care providers with major hospitals in Bhutan.\nIf the Matternet pilot is able to make care delivery by drone conceivable both practically and financially, which it seems likely that it will do, it's hard not to wonder what implications this could have for rural care in the United States.\nDrones could conceivably be used to deliver needed prescriptions to consumers in rural areas.\nAnd theoretically, home and remote care through drone use could benefit from the increased push for regulations easing the path for telemedicine."}
