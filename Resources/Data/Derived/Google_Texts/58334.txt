The Walton County Sheriff's Office is investigating a shooting in Freeport that sent a 4 year old to the hospital.

Deputies responded to a home on South Bay Grove Drive around 3:00 Saturday afternoon after a 4 year old boy was shot in the chest with a BB gun.

The shooter was his 14 year old cousin who was standing less than 10 feet away when he pulled the trigger.

The 4 year old was taken to Bay Medical and went straight into surgery upon arrival.

A deputy sheriff assisted the paramedics in their treatment and stabilization of the victim.

The boy is listed in critical condition.
