Five of a possible seven cars left the tracks, though none went into the river, as was first reported. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was on the scene Sunday morning.\n\nMetro-North train was running on Track 2, the middle track. Might be an even worse accident if it had been on the river side. \u2014 Ted Mann (@TMannWSJ) December 1, 2013\n\nThe cause of the crash is currently unclear. Police and fire department emergency crews responded first to the emergency. The National Transit Safety Board is sending a Go-Team to investigate. NBC New York reports the FBI are already on the ground.\n\nThe train was nowhere near full when the derailment occurred. \"On a workday, fully occupied, it would have been a tremendous disaster,\" New York Fire Department Commissioner Sal Cassano told reporters Sunday morning.\n\nCNN reports the driver \"told investigators he applied brakes to the train, but it didn't slow down.\" Frank Tatulli, a passenger on the train, told New York's ABC affiliate the train \"was travelling at a higher rate of speed than it normally does,\" as it came around a sharp curve. A Metro Transit Authority spokesperson explained \"the derailment occurred... in a slow speed area approaching the Spuyten Duyvil station,\" ABC reports.\n\nOne area resident described the tragic morning scene. \u201cI thought I heard what I thought was a building collapsing,\u201d Brendan Conley told the New York Post. \u201cI came to the window and saw people walking across the tracks. Smoke was coming out of the second car that rolled over. I yelled for my mom to call the fire department. I stood there and saw 40 or 50 people come climbing out of the train on their own.\u201d\n\nMaking the whole scenario stranger, another Metro North train derailed near the same spot in July. Ten of 24 cars a cargo garbage train derailed, delaying passenger services for hours. No one was injured in that incident.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Four people died and dozens more were injured after multiple train cars derailed Sunday morning in New York.", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "Four people died and dozens more were injured after multiple train cars derailed Sunday morning in New York.", "title": "Four Dead After Train Derails in New York", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2013/12/01/metro/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/national/2013/12/four-dead-after-train-derails-new-york/355618/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thewire", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2013/12/01/metro/lead_large.jpg", "description": "Four people died and dozens more were injured after multiple train cars derailed Sunday morning in New York.", "card": "summary", "title": "Four Dead After Train Derails in New York"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15d7\"", "article_summary": "Four people died and dozens more were injured after multiple train cars derailed Sunday morning in New York.\nI stood there and saw 40 or 50 people come climbing out of the train on their own.\u201dMaking the whole scenario stranger, another Metro North train derailed near the same spot in July.\nFrank Tatulli, a passenger on the train, told New York's ABC affiliate the train \"was travelling at a higher rate of speed than it normally does,\" as it came around a sharp curve.\nTen of 24 cars a cargo garbage train derailed, delaying passenger services for hours.\n\"On a workday, fully occupied, it would have been a tremendous disaster,\" New York Fire Department Commissioner Sal Cassano told reporters Sunday morning."}
