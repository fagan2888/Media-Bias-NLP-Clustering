Complaints about rampant shaming or \u201cbressure\u201d among affluent women ignore the structural obstacles that working class women and women of color\u2014like myself\u2014face if we decide we want to nurse our babies.\n\nWhile affluent women have the freedom to walk away from jobs that don\u2019t allow them to nurse or pump, as well as the power to demand individual accommodations like paid family leave and comfortable lactation rooms, working class women and women of color disproportionately work in low-paid service sector jobs where they aren\u2019t given the same flexibility. This means that many struggling mothers are stuck either spending thousands of dollars on formula, or losing their jobs altogether.\n\nWe need breastfeeding advocacy campaigns in order to create the public understanding and political will to expand such accommodations, and to make mothers aware of the rights we already have.\n\nIn several online communities for black breastfeeding moms that I belong to, women frequently share stories of being mistreated by employers for requesting pumping breaks or clean, safe places to express and store their milk. Many have no idea that such mistreatment is illegal. Others are seeking support after partners and family members accuse them of being lewd or inappropriate for nursing their children. Lacking support at work or at home or both, many moms forfeit their breastfeeding goals despite wholeheartedly wishing to start or continue nursing.\n\nRegrettably, mothers of all kinds face undue scrutiny and judgment no matter what we do for our kids. But the Department of Labor has found at least 71 serious instances of lactation discrimination since the Affordable Care Act took effect. Trying to turn campaigns like World Breastfeeding Week into #AllFeedingMatters completely ignores the difference between hurt feelings and discrimination.\n\nNo one should be shamed for how they feed their children, as long as those children are well fed and cared for. But letting privileged parents who already have a choice undermine attempts to offer less advantaged parents the information and advocacy they need to claim that freedom for themselves is shortsighted and unfair. Transforming earnest attempts to destigmatize and demystify women\u2019s bodies into a conversation about privileged women\u2019s feelings obscures the fact that breastfeeding awareness campaigns are\u2014or should be\u2014about promoting public health and ending widespread discrimination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s not about affluent parents\u2019 feelings\u2014it\u2019s about public health, and discrimination", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "It\u2019s not about feelings\u2014it\u2019s about public health, and discrimination", "title": "Why the U.S. Needs World Breastfeeding Week", "url": "http://time.com/3989960/us-needs-breastfeeding-awareness/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/breastfeeding.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/breastfeeding.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "It\u2019s not about feelings\u2014it\u2019s about public health, and discrimination", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why the U.S. Needs World Breastfeeding Week"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "breastfeeding, mothers, parenting, public health, race", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "breastfeeding, lactation discrimination, formula feeding, pumping rooms"}, "article_summary": "Trying to turn campaigns like World Breastfeeding Week into #AllFeedingMatters completely ignores the difference between hurt feelings and discrimination.\nTo hear some Mommy Warriors tell it, all of these situations are equal, thus there\u2019s no value in campaigns to normalize breastfeeding, such as last week\u2019s World Breastfeeding Week.\nTransforming earnest attempts to destigmatize and demystify women\u2019s bodies into a conversation about privileged women\u2019s feelings obscures the fact that breastfeeding awareness campaigns are\u2014or should be\u2014about promoting public health and ending widespread discrimination.\nThis means that many struggling mothers are stuck either spending thousands of dollars on formula, or losing their jobs altogether.\nComplaints about rampant shaming or \u201cbressure\u201d among affluent women ignore the structural obstacles that working class women and women of color\u2014like myself\u2014face if we decide we want to nurse our babies."}
