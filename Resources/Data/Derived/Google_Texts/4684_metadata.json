These have been lies by our president.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really want Congress to do its job,\u201d continued Palin. \u201cThe constitutional power that they have to halt an imperial presidency, to halt this fundamental transformation of America that is making us an unrecognizable mess of a nation at this time.\u201d\n\nShe called the need to impeach Obama a \u201cbipartisan issue\u201d that Congress and the American people should support. When Hannity questioned whether or not Congress has the \u201cpolitical backbone\u201d to invoke the constitutional power to impeach, Palin argued that our lawmakers should have the \u201ccojones\u201d to do so. \u201cEnough is enough,\u201d she said.\n\nA poll on Drudge Report asking Americans whether or not Republicans should impeach Obama has over 70% of respondents saying they agree with Palin.\n\nWatch the Fox News video below.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Sarah Palin appeared on Fox News Tuesday night to discuss her call for President Obama's impeachment that she voiced in an exclusive op-ed for Breitbart earlier in the day.
