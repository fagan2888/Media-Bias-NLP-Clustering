If you are not familiar with The Gregory Brothers, they are a group that, for years, has done some great videos “songify”-ing not just viral videos, but the news in general. And one of their favorite politicians to autotune has been Joe Biden. Well, in a video out today, the vice president popped up in one of their “Songify This” videos.

I regret to inform you that the veep does not get autotuned himself. No, the subject of the autotuning is the kid in that viral video who talks about his first kiss.

But if you’re wondering why Biden would be appearing in this video in the first place, well, let’s just say he wants to help plug a little something that President Obama went to BuzzFeed to help promote…

Oh, and he said the word “kablooie.”

Watch the video below:

And you can check out autotuned Biden in one of The Gregory Brothers’ earlier videos:
