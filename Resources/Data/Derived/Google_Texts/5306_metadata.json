To date, the Edison resident said she has delivered nearly 5,000 babies since she began practicing as a midwife 34 years ago, including two very special to her, grandsons, Jacob, and Michael, today 11 and 9, respectively.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe delivery of my two grandsons was indescribable,\u201d she said. \u201cMy eyes were the first to see them and my hands were the first to hold them. The first time, I remember gently placing the baby on my daughter\u2019s stomach. I was just so happy he was crying and healthy that I didn\u2019t even bother to check the sex at first! It was not important.\u201d\n\n\n\nDiegmann, a professor and director of nurse midwifery education at Rutgers School of Nursing, is a recognized expert among the country\u2019s more than 11,000 certified nurse midwives, of whom 3 percent are male, according to the American Midwifery Certification Board. They are typically licensed nurses specializing in prenatal and postnatal care, childbirth, and a wide array of women\u2019s health issues.\n\n\n\nShe started three midwife faculty practices-- Newark\u2019s University Hospital (1978-96), Jersey City Medical Center, and Newark Beth Israel Medical Center--where midwives deliver around 900 babies a year.\n\n\n\nMany people are surprised to learn that midwifery is not just about delivering infants, she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-kept secret,\u201d Diegmann said, adding that midwifery (pronounced \u201cmid-wiff-ery\u201d) encompasses everything from adolescent health, family planning and pre-natal care, to post-menopausal wellness. Midwives can perform breast exams, PAP smears, ultrasounds, and endometrial biopsies. They can also prescribe medication when necessary.\n\n\n\n\u201cWomen choose midwives so that they can have more control over their pregnancy and their well-being,\u201d she said, adding that many women are moving away from the \u201cmedicalization\u201d of birth. \u201cYears ago, when I began my nursing career, three percent of all pregnancies were Caesarean sections,\u201d she said. Today, it's exponentially higher.\n\nOther aspects of birthing have changed as well. \"Women today want control over the birthing process, they want hydrotherapy, they want to be free to walk around, and they want spontaneous, not induced, labor,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nSometimes, a woman doesn\u2019t plan on using a midwife but may end up doing so if her baby decides to enter the world when a midwife is on shift.\n\n\n\nThat is what happened to Rosa Guerrero, 34, of Elizabeth, who gave birth to her daughter, Astrial Ciana Nieves, on December 8 at Newark Beth Israel, with the help of Diegmann.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was in pain and Elaine came into the room,\u201d Guerrero said. \u201cShe looked like an angel and she immediately made me very comfortable. I was glad that she was there.\u201d\n\n\n\nNationwide, nearly 8 percent (7.9 percent) of all births are attended to by a midwife, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, but the percentage varies state by state, Diegmann said. In New Mexico, for example, 33 percent of births are performed by a midwife but in New Jersey, it\u2019s about 6.5 percent, according to Diegmann.\n\n\n\nThe program provided at Newark Beth Israel gives women options, said Dr. Patrick Anderson, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. \u201cIt allows patients to experience childbirth their way, with individualized, family-centered care that results in lower Caesarean section rates and excellent outcomes. Our long-term vision is to have a full-service program focused on delivery, patient education, and wellness,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nOne of the questions Diegmann said she gets asked is whether a woman who has an at-risk pregnancy can still use a midwife. What if she is diabetic, suffers from pre-eclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy), or is at an advanced maternal age?\n\n\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s a vaginal birth, there is no reason why a midwife cannot collaborate with a physician,\u201d she said. \u201cA physician can help the mother manage her diabetes, for example. But the midwife can perform the birth.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnlike some midwives, Diegmann does not deliver babies outside of the hospital. She pointed out that New Jersey used to have three birthing centers but they are now closed.\n\n\n\nThe interest in midwifery is growing in the Garden State, with approximately 350 certified midwives practicing in the state. Currently, 29 students are enrolled in the nurse midwifery program at Rutgers, the state\u2019s only midwife education program. All student clinical rotation slots are area hospitals are regularly filled, Diegmann said.\n\n\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recently reaffirmed its endorsement of midwives who are certified by the American Midwifery Certification Board or who meet the standards of the International Confederation of Midwives.\n\n\n\nDiegmann was recently recognized for her work, earning the Lester Z. Lieberman Humanism in Healthcare Award from The Healthcare Foundation of New Jersey and is a fellow of the American College of Nurse-Midwives and a member of the Master Educators\u2019 Guild at Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS). She frequently lectures medical students and professional organizations throughout the country.\n\n\n\nIt was during her first clinical rotation as a student at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing, when observing a birth for the first time, that Diegmann said she knew this would be her life\u2019s calling. \u201cI love what I do,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing else that compares with helping to bring a life into the world.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe went on to work as a labor and delivery nurse at St. Peter\u2019s Hospital in New Brunswick and later was among the first graduating class of the midwife program at the then College of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (CMDNJ), which later became known as RBHS.\n\n\n\nThat passion runs in the family: Her daughter is a labor and delivery nurse at Newark Beth Israel.\n\n\n\nAlthough the first school of midwifery in the U.S. was started by southern aristocrat Mary Breckinridge in 1939, Diegmann likes to talk about how it goes back to the Old Testament. She jokingly refers to it as the world\u2019s second oldest profession.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Ten Commandments would not exist if it wasn\u2019t for a midwife,\u201d Diegmann said. It was a midwife, she explained, who instructed Moses\u2019 mother, Jochebed, to save her baby from Pharaoh\u2019s armies by putting him in a basket and placing it in the Nile so that he would float away to safety.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "A veteran midwife, who estimates she's delivered 5,000 babies, reflects on the changes she's seen in birthing traditions and preferences.", "title": "Veteran midwife shares memories of 'the second-oldest profession'", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Veteran midwife shares memories of \\u0027the second-oldest profession\\u0027\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/12/veteran_midwife_its_the_second-oldest_profession.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/16633911-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"14818488\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-12-25T13:17:05Z\", \"author\": \"For The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@news\",\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/16633911-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "A veteran midwife, who estimates she's delivered 5,000 babies, reflects on the changes she's seen in birthing traditions and preferences.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, December 25, 2014,  8:17 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/health_and_fitness_multiblog/photo/midwife-in-nj-has-delivered-a-total-of-5000-babies-over-a-period-of-34-years-e4aab60ff28f70f9.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"forstarledger\", \"author_nickname\": \"For The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"9501972\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Health and Fitness News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A veteran midwife, who estimates she's delivered 5,000 babies, reflects on the changes she's seen in birthing traditions and preferences.", "title": "Veteran midwife shares memories of 'the second-oldest profession'", "url": "http://www.nj.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/12/veteran_midwife_its_the_second-oldest_profession.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, December 25, 2014,  8:00 AM", "article_author": "For The Star-Ledger"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95e8\"", "article_summary": "Currently, 29 students are enrolled in the nurse midwifery program at Rutgers, the state\u2019s only midwife education program.\n\u201cThe Ten Commandments would not exist if it wasn\u2019t for a midwife,\u201d Diegmann said.\nThe program provided at Newark Beth Israel gives women options, said Dr. Patrick Anderson, chairman of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center.\nBut the midwife can perform the birth.\u201dUnlike some midwives, Diegmann does not deliver babies outside of the hospital.\nThat passion runs in the family: Her daughter is a labor and delivery nurse at Newark Beth Israel."}
