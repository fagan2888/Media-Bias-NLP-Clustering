Pennsylvania Rep. Ron Marsico didn’t sound too optimistic about the passage of medical marijuana legislation before this fall.

“There’s no way we can get it done before then. We’re still working through the details,” Marsico told PennLive.

Marsico, a Dauphin County Republican, was a part of a group of legislators working on condensing several marijuana-related bills into one which can pass the state House.

He’s not the only concerned the bill won’t come to fruition this year. From PennLive:

Latrisha Bentch of Swatara Township, a leader in the push for medical marijuana, also said she has largely given up hope for a bill before fall. Bentch is in contact with members of the medical marijuana working group. “At this point, it’s more important to get a good bill that helps a lot of people,” said Bentch, whose daughter suffers from seizures which aren’t controlled with approved drugs, and who believes a marijuana-derived medication offers the best hope.

PennLive goes into detail about three conditions of the bill that are holding up its passage the most: distribution, state oversight and the qualifying conditions.
