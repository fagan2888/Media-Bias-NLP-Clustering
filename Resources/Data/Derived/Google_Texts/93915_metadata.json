Brands, iran contra, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, News, Politics News\n\nMargaret Thatcher, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Lech Wa\u0142esa arrived from abroad. Tony Blair, Thatcher\u2019s successor, represented the British government. Secretary-General Kofi Annan brought condolences from the United Nations.\n\nPresident George W. Bush delivered the principal eulogy. \u201cRonald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhen he saw evil camped across the horizon, he called that evil by its name. There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other what the American president had dared to say. There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall that the first and hardest blow had been struck by President Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the service Nancy and the children accompanied the casket to Andrews Air Force Base for the return west. Back in California they laid her husband and their father to rest on the hilltop beside his library. \u201cHe is home now; he is free,\u201d Ron Reagan said. Patti Davis spoke of her father\u2019s final affirmation of love for her mother. \u201cWhen he opened his eyes, eyes that had not opened for many, many days, and looked at my mother,\u201d she said, \u201che showed us that neither disease nor death can conquer love.\u201d\n\n*\n\n\u201cIn his last years he saw through a glass darkly; now he sees his savior face to face,\u201d George Bush had said at the Washington service. \u201cAnd we look for that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind, strong and sure and smiling again, and the sorrow of this parting gone forever.\u201d\n\nBush was speaking of the hereafter, but an approximation arrived in 2011, on what would have been Reagan\u2019s hundredth birthday\u2014or, by the reckoning he liked to employ, the sixty-first anniversary of his thirty-ninth birthday. The tears had dried; the darkness of his last decade had lifted; the time that had passed since his departure from office allowed a clearer view of what his life and his presidency meant.\n\nThe celebrations were less restrained than at the moment of his passing. Reagan had become sufficiently iconic that civic and corporate groups could safely attach themselves to his memory without fear of alienating clients or customers. The Tournament of Roses included a Reagan-themed float in its annual parade in Pasadena. The National Football League hailed the Gipper in a video aired just before kickoff at the Super Bowl. A similar tribute played before the Daytona 500 car race. The Professional Golfers\u2019 Association tipped its cap to Reagan. The U.S. Postal Service issued a Reagan stamp. A measure was introduced in Congress to put Reagan\u2019s image on the $50 bill. Initiatives were launched to name something for Reagan in every county in the country.\n\nIn a more analytical vein were the symposia and conferences that weighed his achievements and measured his contribution to the landmark events of his time. None of the participants could deny that America and the world had changed dramatically during the Reagan era. The nation\u2019s politics took a sharp turn to the right; after a half century of liberalism, Americans rediscovered the virtues of conservatism. The international order was transformed by the collapse of Soviet communism; the end of the Cold War completed what American presidents had been attempting since 1945.\n\nFrom the vantage of the Reagan centennial, with the twentieth century receding into the past, it wasn\u2019t unreasonable to measure Reagan against his political hero, Franklin Roosevelt. And by that measure, he fared quite well. What Roosevelt had been to the first half of the twentieth century, Reagan was to the second half. Roosevelt entered office amid a crisis of the private sector, when the conservative status quo had lost legitimacy. Roosevelt tipped the balance to the left, launching the age of liberalism in American politics. In foreign affairs he asserted America\u2019s world leadership and defeated the first of the century\u2019s two modes of totalitarianism, fascism. Reagan entered office amid a crisis of the public sector, when the liberal status quo was floundering. Reagan tipped the balance back to the right, reviving conservatism as the more credible force in American politics. In foreign affairs he confirmed America\u2019s world leadership and set the century\u2019s second form of totalitarianism, communism, on the path to extinction.\n\nAn additional parallel appeared in the fact that while the magnitude of the accomplishments of the two presidents was impossible to deny, the meaning of those accomplishments continued to provoke vigorous debate. The New Deal was the salvation of democracy, in the minds of Roosevelt\u2019s liberal supporters, and the onset of socialism, to his conservative critics. The Reagan revolution was the restoration of freedom, in the view of Reagan\u2019s conservative admirers, and the abandonment of the weak and vulnerable, to his liberal opponents.\n\nIn certain respects, Reagan\u2019s accomplishment was greater than Roosevelt\u2019s. During the formative stages of the New Deal, Roosevelt enjoyed rubber-stamp majorities in Congress. After Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt as commander in chief met almost no resistance as he redesigned American foreign policy. Reagan, by contrast, had to struggle with a Democratic House during his entire presidency and with a Democratic Senate during his last two years. Nothing in international affairs gave him anything like the carte blanche in foreign policy enjoyed by Roosevelt.\n\nThe key to Reagan\u2019s success, like that to Roosevelt\u2019s, was his ability to restore Americans\u2019 faith in their country. Reagan was called the \u201cgreat communicator\u201d with reason. He was the most persuasive political speaker since Roosevelt, combining conviction, focus, and humor in a manner none of his contemporaries could approach. Reagan\u2019s critics often dismissed the role of conviction in his persuasiveness; they attributed his speaking skill to his training as an actor. But this was exactly wrong. Reagan wasn\u2019t acting when he spoke; his rhetorical power rested on his wholehearted belief in all the wonderful things he said about the United States and the American people, about their brave past and their brilliant future. He believed what Americans have always wanted to believe about their country, and he made them believe it too.\n\nIt helped that his beliefs relentlessly flattered the American people. Reagan blamed the country\u2019s problems not on the people but on their government, as though the government\u2014in a democracy, of all systems\u2014 existed apart from the people. His message was an easy sell. He asked next to nothing of the people, neither the soaring sacrifice of John Kennedy\u2019s inaugural nor the quotidian adjustments sought by Carter. He promised Americans the gift of tax cuts, which he delivered without insisting on conservatism\u2019s traditional precondition, spending cuts.\n\nReagan\u2019s focus was no less important than his conviction. Focus is often the inverse of expertise, and Reagan understood that at the highest levels focus is far more important. He refused to clutter his mind with details that might distract from his major goals. From the start of his political career to the finish, his major goals were always the same: to shrink government at home and defeat communism abroad. Everything else was secondary. Reagan communicated effectively not least because he gave essentially the same speech again and again. The particulars and the anecdotes varied, but the message never did.\n\nYet the anecdotes were crucial. Reagan told stories and jokes better than any president since Lincoln. He understood the disarming power of humor: that getting an audience to laugh with you is halfway to getting them to agree with you. He was not a warm person, but he seemed to be, which in politics is more important. Many people loathed his policies, but almost no one disliked him. Democratic elections are, at their most basic level, popularity contests, and Reagan knew how to be popular.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He knew politics' purpose is to govern, not preserve ideological purity.
