Carlos Lopez-Cantera said the country needs a Republican president — but didn’t quite say he would support Donald Trump.

“We need a Republican president,” said Lopez-Cantera after a campaign stop at Bonita Springs Charter School in Southwest Florida on Wednesday. “People are just tired of hearing red-meat speeches regurgitated to them and not seeing results.”

When asked if he will support Trump if he’s the nominee, the lieutenant governor responded with, “We can’t have Hillary Clinton as president.”

Lopez-Cantera said the country faces big issues, like the changes to the workforce because of the Affordable Care Act — aka Obamacare — and the national debt.

“These are big issues,” said the Miami Republican. “But that’s why I’m focused on the Senate race and being successful and making sure that we keep a Republican Senate, which I think … the Florida seat is going to be the linchpin to that.”

On Wednesday, Republican Senate hopeful Carlos Beruff announced he was supporting Trump in the presidential election. Beruff called on his opponents to “commit to supporting” Trump as the nominee.

In addition to Beruff, Lopez-Cantera faces Rep. Ron DeSantis, Rep. David Jolly, and Todd Wilcox in the Aug. 30 Republican primary. The five men are vying to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate.
