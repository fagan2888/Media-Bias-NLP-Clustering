A Face the Nation panel thought 2016 GOP hopeful Mike Huckabee’s defense of hawking of miracle cures on the program was “lame,” and augured a rough road ahead for the evangelical candidate.

“I thought his handling of your question was, frankly, pretty lame,” New York Times’ Mark Leibovich said. “There is going to be a whole range of questions that he is going to get on his business activities since he left the governor’s mansion of Arkansas. He needs a better answer.”

Huckabee has lent his name and presence to a variety of dietary supplements, biblical cures to cancer, and $19.95 cinnamon-based diabetes cures. After Schieffer, who has diabetes, asked Huckabee to account for this, the candidate argued the diabetes plan was mostly about healthy living, a claim on which the panel called BS.

Schieffer and National Journal’s Ron Fournier stopped just short of calling Huckabee “sleazy.”

“The infomercials are endorsing cures and treatments that no health agency supports,” Fournier said. “Of all the adjectives you can put behind his activities presidential is not one of them.”
