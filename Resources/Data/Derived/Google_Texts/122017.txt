Air Force 4, Holy Cross 2

WORCESTER, Mass. — Third-period goals by Tyler Rostenkowski and Jordan Himley broke a 2-2 tie after two periods and lifted Air Force over Holy Cross.

Senior captain Ben Carey gave the Falcons a 2-1 lead in the second with Air Force was on a penalty kill.

After the Crusaders tied, Rostenkowski put back a rebound for the lead.

“We got off to a much better start tonight,” Air Force head coach Frank Serratore said. “There was nothing easy about this. This game was an absolute battle. The team that got the lead and played with the lead won the game. This was a must-win for us. This was like playoff hockey. Both teams wanted this game so bad and were so determined. Both teams left it all out on the ice tonight.”
