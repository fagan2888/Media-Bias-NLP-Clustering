Khdeir\u2019s death is strongly believed to be part of the out-pour of revenge attacks (pricetag attacks) on Palestinians across Israel and the occupied West Bank that came in the following days.\n\nClashes have occurred in Shufat between residents and Israeli forces for the past three days, and continued for hours after the funeral finished.
