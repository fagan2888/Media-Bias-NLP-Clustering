× Janet Jackson announces world tour and new album

(CNN) – Janet Jackson took to Twitter to answer any fans who might be asking, “What have you done for me lately?”

To celebrate her birthday Saturday, the six-time Grammy winner announced the surprise to her more than 3 million followers: “My conversation… #ConversationsInACafe.”

She elaborated in a video linked out from the tweet, which was also autoplaying when fans accessed her website.

In the mysterious 32-second video, which featured a studio soundboard and a computer screen displaying her voice levels, she says, “I promised you’d hear it from my lips. And now you will. This year. New music. New world tour. A new movement. I’ve been listening. Let’s keep the conversation going.”

It is unknown if “Conversations in a Cafe” is the name of her upcoming album, but since May 10, the singer has been retweeting fans who used the hashtag to promote awareness on a variety of social issues, including sex trafficking and Haiti’s earthquake recovery.

Jackson has not been in the spotlight much since releasing her 10th studio album, “Discipline,” in 2008.

Her brother, pop icon Michael Jackson, died in 2009. She starred the following year in Tyler Perry’s “Why Did I Get Married Too?” and in 2012 married her third husband, Qatari billionaire Wissam Al Mana.

In August, responding to leaked information that her new album was in the works, she tweeted, “If there is a new project, you’ll hear it from my lips.”

Jackson has apparently heard the grumblings that she’s been missing in action. Earlier this month, she retweeted producer Jimmy Jam after he posted a tweet of a missing persons mockup featuring the 49-year-old singer.
