Michaela Pereira signed off CNN’s New Day this morning. She’s headed back to the West Coast, where she was co-anchor of the KTLA Morning News for 9 years, and to CNN’s sister network HLN where she will anchor a late morning newscast. She got a goodbye from New Day staffers, and a welcome from her new colleagues at HLN.

“I look at it this way, you’ve been having thanksgiving dinner with those cousins over there, all you’re doing is coming to your cousins at HLN to have thanksgiving with us,” said HLN anchor Robin Meade, whose own show Morning Express draws more viewers than New Day most mornings.

“This is the best thing ever,” Pereira said. “Thank you for making the last three years a dream. I’ll see you guys on the other side.”
