As The Atlantic notes, the Swiss system is quite similar to Obamacare's newly-implemented compulsory health care strategy, with a key exception being that Swiss insurance companies aren't allowed to profit directly from their plans.\n\nThe study also looked at how much countries spent on health care compared to overall GDP. Though the U.S. came in last for care, it spends a far greater percentage than other nations\u2014a whopping 17.7 percent. To put that in perspective, Australia spends nearly half as much.\n\n[via The Atlantic]\n\nUNRELATED: Singing Conductor Brings Soul to the Subway\n\nSend tips, photos and news developments to cityguidetips@complex.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/akufwstfxfzvneijgqej.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Nathan Reese", "description": "U.S. healthcare is the most expensive in the world, but performs worse than every similar industrialized country.", "og": {"site_name": "Complex", "description": "U.S. healthcare is the most expensive in the world, but performs worse than every similar industrialized country.", "title": "U.S. Healthcare Is Still Expensive, Terrible Compared to Other Nations", "url": "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/06/us-healthcare-is-still-expensive-and-terrible", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/akufwstfxfzvneijgqej.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. healthcare is the most expensive in the world, but performs worse than every similar industrialized country.", "title": "U.S. Healthcare Is Still Expensive, Terrible Compared to Other Nations", "url": "http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/06/us-healthcare-is-still-expensive-and-terrible", "image": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/akufwstfxfzvneijgqej.jpg", "site": {"id": 13049362}, "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-16T15:56:50-0400", "p": {"domain_verify": "51da1c238ae41f7163c35ac3e762917b"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685812641524750}, "sailthru.content.type": "News", "sailthru.tags": "News, City Guide, Complex, Pop Culture, complex", "keywords": "News, City Guide, Complex, Complex Magazine, Style Guide, Fashion News, Celebrity Profiles, Sneakers, Sneakers Guide, Sneakers Blog", "sailthru.channel": "Pop Culture", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_article_image/akufwstfxfzvneijgqej.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccea1\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. may have just passed an historic health care reform bill, but compared to 11 other rich nations it still lags far behind.\nThe report took into account quality care, access, efficiency, equity, healthy lives, and expenditures, ranking each country in both individual categories and overall care.\nThe study also looked at how much countries spent on health care compared to overall GDP.\nThough the U.S. came in last for care, it spends a far greater percentage than other nations\u2014a whopping 17.7 percent.\nAs The Atlantic notes, the Swiss system is quite similar to Obamacare's newly-implemented compulsory health care strategy, with a key exception being that Swiss insurance companies aren't allowed to profit directly from their plans."}
