Leaders of both chambers have pledged to repeal the tax, though President Obama has threatened to the veto a bill to do so.\n\nThe repeal effort has drawn fire from some conservatives, who say only big companies would benefit while millions of people continue to suffer from other parts of ObamaCare.\n\nHealthcare experts have also warned that the effort to repeal the medical device tax could prompt other industries to launch their own lobbying campaigns.\n\nDevice lobbyists have been quiet about how to make up for the lost revenue, though AdvaMed's president and CEO, Steve Ubl, said Wednesday that it \u201cnot entirely clear that the bill will need to be offset.\u201d\n\nThe medical device tax remains one of the only parts of ObamaCare that has bipartisan support for repealing, with Democratic senators such as Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenThe Trail 2016: Hell breaks loose Minority lawmakers bash Trump over housing crisis Patients dying because of FDA inflexibility MORE (D-Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar Amy KlobucharDems pressure Obama on vow to resettle 10,000 Syrian refugees Lobbying World Dem senators: Slash executive pay at pension plans seeking benefit cuts MORE (D-Minn.) voicing support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a tax on medical companies.
