Scott Imberman, Sa A. Bui, and Steven G. Craig analyzed the standardized test scores of more than 14,000 fifth-graders in an urban school district in the United States. They focused on students who just barely made the threshold for their schools\u2019 gifted and talented programs\u2014and those who just barely missed it. The goal was to compare how students of roughly the same abilities do when they\u2019re in gifted classes with how they do in regular classes. If the gifted and talented programs are effective, then the marginal students should end up with higher test scores than the marginal students in regular classes. If they\u2019re not effective, then both sets of students would have around the same scores.\n\nThis passage is mostly sly hyperbole, but it highlights an assumption that a lot of students and parents alike make about gifted and talented programs: that they dramatically affect a child\u2019s academic outcomes. If you make the cut, you\u2019re destined for a life of success; if not, you\u2019re cursed.\n\nMyla Goldberg\u2019s novel Bee Season opens with an account of a traumatic moment in Eliza Naumann\u2019s young life: when she doesn\u2019t get picked to be in her elementary school\u2019s Talented and Gifted program. Though only in second grade, she becomes \u201ca student from whom great things should not be expected,\u201d doomed to a classroom full of \u201cC students who never get picked for Student of the Week, sixth-place winners who never get a ribbon, and short, pigeon-toed girls who never get chased by boys at recess.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that, after a year and a half of gifted and talented classes, the scores of the marginal students were about the same as those of the marginal students who\u2019d taken regular classes.\n\n\u201cThere is essentially no difference,\u201d said Imberman.\n\nHow can this be? How is it possible that gifted and talented classes, which have better teachers and a more rigorous curriculum, don\u2019t improve outcomes for borderline students? The study offers one theory: that the marginal students may have different \u201cself concepts\u201d depending on which type of classes they take. Students at the bottom of the heap in gifted and talented classes may feel discouraged by the fact that they don\u2019t do as well as some of their peers. And this discouragement could cause them to tune out and learn less\u2014which would counteract the higher-quality instruction they receive in the gifted classes. Students at the top of the heap in regular classes, on the other hand, do better than their peers and might get a confidence boost that helps with learning.\n\nThe study doesn\u2019t measure one potential benefit of taking gifted and talented classes: impressing colleges and prospective employers. Some colleges give preference to students who\u2019ve taken rigorous courses, even if their grades in those classes are lower than then would be if they\u2019d taken easier ones. Some employers also like to see that prospective hires have pushed themselves in school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be making decisions based on this paper alone,\u201d said Imberman. \u201cWe don\u2019t find much benefit to gifted and talented classes, don\u2019t find much harm either.\u201d\n\nThe students Imberman and his colleagues studied are now approaching the end of high school and the beginning of college. He says they plan to do a follow-up study to analyze the longer-term impact of gifted and talented classes. For now, though, the Eliza Naumanns of the world can relax\u2014taking classes with a horde of Student of the Week rejects may not be as bad as it seems.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study suggests that for students on the margin, talented classes don&#39;t make a big difference.", "author": "Eleanor Barkhorn", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A new study suggests that for students on the margin, talented classes don&#39;t make a big difference.", "title": "Do Gifted Programs Improve Learning?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/8065467654_ef87b5cca9_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/do-gifted-programs-improve-learning/282532/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26ea\"", "article_summary": "If the gifted and talented programs are effective, then the marginal students should end up with higher test scores than the marginal students in regular classes.\nThe goal was to compare how students of roughly the same abilities do when they\u2019re in gifted classes with how they do in regular classes.\nAnd this discouragement could cause them to tune out and learn less\u2014which would counteract the higher-quality instruction they receive in the gifted classes.\nHe says they plan to do a follow-up study to analyze the longer-term impact of gifted and talented classes.\nHow is it possible that gifted and talented classes, which have better teachers and a more rigorous curriculum, don\u2019t improve outcomes for borderline students?"}
