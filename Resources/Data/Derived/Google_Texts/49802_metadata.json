The Fifth Extinction was the asteroid that collided with Earth some 66 million years ago, killing off the dinosaurs. This newest extinction is far less dramatic, at least in the fire-and-brimstone sort of way \u2014 which explains how it\u2019s been happening right under our noses.\n\nNonetheless, by the end of this century, scientists believe, up to 20 to 50 percent of the plant and animal species on Earth could be gone forever. Only there will be no giant asteroid to blame for the loss. This time \u2014 in a \u201cTwilight Zone\u201d-worthy twist of fate \u2014 the giant asteroid is us.\n\nEver since we first began to migrate and multiply, we humans have been crowding out everything else living on Earth, leading for thousands of years a (largely) unintentional campaign against other species that, in more recent times, has gotten much, much worse.\n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d journalist Elizabeth Kolbert writes, \u201cwe are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways will remain open and which will forever be closed. No other creature has ever managed this, and it will, unfortunately, be our most enduring legacy.\u201d\n\nWith remarkable journalistic prowess, Kolbert, a staff writer at the New Yorker, traveled the world to document mankind\u2019s undeniable role in this world-changing catastrophe, drawing insight from the Amazon rainforest, the Great Barrier Reef and the changing landscape of the United States. \u201cThe Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History\u201d underscores the global scale, and urgent importance, of everything she saw.\n\nKolbert spoke with Salon about extinction\u2019s controversial history and uncertain future. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nBack in 2009 you wrote a New Yorker article entitled \u201cThe Sixth Extinction?\u201d I noticed the question mark\u2019s been removed from the book. Are scientists more certain now that this is something that\u2019s happening? What does that consensus look like?\n\nI don\u2019t want to claim that a tremendous amount has changed since 2009. I think there is a pretty broad consensus that we\u2019re in the midst of a mass extinction, or a certainly a period when extinction rates are way, way above normal for the geological record, what\u2019s called \u201cbackground rate.\u201d Now, whether we are on the verge of a major mass extinction, the beginning of one, or in the middle of one, different people have really different ideas about how you can calculate that. We get past mass extinctions from the fossil record and we don\u2019t have the fossil record of the present yet, so it\u2019s not that easy to compare apples to apples.\n\nBut scientists are definitely convinced that humans are causing this, that it isn\u2019t just something that happens cyclically?\n\nOh yes, absolutely \u2014 it doesn\u2019t happen cyclically. There was a theory at one point that gained a certain amount of notoriety, maybe 20 years ago, that maybe there were these cyclical extinctions that had to do with \u2014 I know it sound kind of crazy and sci-fi-y \u2014 but that maybe we passed through some kind of asteroid belt that caused a lot of damage every 26 million years. That theory has been pretty thoroughly debunked, even by the people who forwarded it at the time. I don\u2019t think anyone subscribes to it anymore.\n\nThe general consensus is that these events are not cyclical at all; they\u2019re quite random, and there\u2019s no one cause. In fact, some people have concluded what is so dangerous about these events that turn out to be mass extinctions is that they\u2019re unprecedented. They\u2019re just weird, out-of-the-blue events. So in a sense, we, humans, are a weird, out-of-the-blue event.\n\nRight, we\u2019re kind of like that giant asteroid that came down and killed the dinosaurs, but at the same time the effect that we\u2019re having is a lot slower.\n\nThat parallel is definitely being drawn. And in a geological sense, well, an asteroid impact is really, really fast \u2014 but we\u2019re really, really fast, too. We\u2019re not quite as fast as an asteroid, but we\u2019re still fast. So, for example, what we\u2019re doing to the climate and to the oceans \u2014 pouring CO2 into the oceans, causing this phenomenon known as ocean acidification \u2014 we\u2019re doing that quite possibly faster than it has even happened before. We\u2019re releasing CO2 at a rate that has never happened before in Earth\u2019s history. So we are pretty fast.\n\nI guess from a human perspective it\u2019s hard for us to recognize how rapidly that\u2019s happening\u2026\n\nYes, exactly, and that is another interesting part of the sort of mismatch of all that. We are in the middle of it, and yet we\u2019re doing things which to us seem incredibly ordinary. Well, okay, there are 7 billion people and X billion of them are driving cars, and that seems really ordinary, but in fact, geologically speaking, what\u2019s happening by transferring all that CO2 from underground, basically, to the air, is really, really unusual in geological terms.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like you can watch things happen from one day to the next \u2014 although in some sense we almost are. Things are happening at a rate that many scientists will tell you they were taught in graduate school was impossible, and now they\u2019re seeing them actually happen.\n\nSo it\u2019s something that\u2019s been accelerating?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Earth's species are dying off at a catastrophic rate, Elizabeth Kolbert tells Salon.
