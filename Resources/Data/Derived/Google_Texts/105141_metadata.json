Compared to today\u2019s budgets, that means that during Obama\u2019s presidency annual VA spending has increased 33.5 percent, according to federal reports.\n\nThis information comes in the wake of recent reports by WND, the Arizona Republic and other media outlets documenting even though the Obama administration drastically increased VA spending, veterans were unable to receive appointments for months because federal employees compiled \u201csecret waiting lists\u201d leading to the deaths of more than 100 veterans nationwide.\n\nIn an interim report to the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs last week, executives from the VA Office of Inspector General testified that their team in Phoenix had linked delayed care to patient harm, but had not verified any veteran deaths due to the problem.\n\nThe VA\u2019s bonus system has come under fire by agency critics who say the incentive money motivates some employees, especially managers, to misrepresent achievements in order to meet performance goals.\n\n\u201cSalary and bonus data at OpenTheBooks.com shows clear evidence that the bureaucracy served the bureaucracy, not veterans,\u201d Adam Andrzejewski, American Transparency chairman at OpenTheBooks.com told WND. \u201cThese troubled VA facilities have nearly $9 million in bonuses. With federal investigations ongoing, was it incompetence or the perverse incentive of too much pay?\u201d\n\nUnited States Secretary of Veterans Affairs Gen. Eric Shinseki just rescinded a $9,345 bonus of a top executive for the Phoenix VA Healthcare system in the wake of allegations of delayed care and death at the Carl T. Hayden Medical Center. In a statement released Wednesday, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that the \u201cincentive pay\u201d had been intended for Sharon Helman, the Phoenix system director, but it was canceled after determining that it had been issued \u201cdue to an administrative error.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, the following facilities have allegedly received bonuses according to a report by OpenTheBooks.com:\n\nEdward Hines, Jr. Hospital, Cook County, Illinois: $4.1356 million\n\nMalcolm Randall VA Medical Center, Gainesville, Florida: $575,400\n\nNew Mexico VA Health Care System, Albuquerque, New Mexico: $2.646 million\n\nGulf Coast Veterans Health Care System Home, Biloxi, Mississippi: $247,103\n\nMiami VA Healthcare System, Miami, Florida: $334,987\n\nFort Collins Outpatient Clinic, Fort Collins, Colorado: $4,150\n\nPhoenix VA Health Care System Home, Phoenix, Arizona: $843,000\n\nAndrzejewski specifically points to the example of the Hines VA hospital in Illinois.\n\n\u201cDuring the last three years, the Hines VA Hospital in Cook County, Illinois, spent $1 billion on salaries, $4 million on bonuses, and veterans still had trouble seeing a doctor. It\u2019s not question of money, but a systemic leadership problem,\u201d he told WND.\n\nBut until now, it has gone unreported that since 2009 several VA hospitals nationwide, including Hines, were part of a system-wide overhaul led by Shinseki to \u201ctransform\u201d VA leadership and ultimately reduce patient wait times.\n\nDocuments obtained exclusively by WND show that this program, also known as the Federal Acquisition Certification for Program and Project Managers, or FAC-P/PM, is specifically designed to \u201cenhance the competencies\u201d and \u201cimprove accountability\u201d of VA\u2019s senior executive staff and other VA employees through a complex system of behavior analysis tools.\n\nThe documents read:\n\n\u201cOn September 23, 2009, VA Deputy Secretary Scott Gould testified before the House Veterans Affairs Oversight and Investigations Committee on his strategy to implement a Performance Management Accountability System (PMAS) to enhance the competencies of VA\u2019s senior executive service. To be effective, this strategy must permeate the organization at all levels. Mr. Gould\u2019s testimony reinforced Secretary Shinseki\u2019s strategy of transforming VA into \u2018a people-centric, results-driven and forward-looking department.\u2019 VA is already making a concerted effort to transform the VA acquisition workforce from \u2018tactical and reactive\u2019 to \u2018strategically-driven and focused on results\u2019 with the investment in the Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy (VAAA).\n\n\u201cThe recent systemic failure of investments to attain cost, schedule, and performance goals has created a heightened sense of urgency to enhance acquisition and project management competencies across the VA acquisition workforce. Fueling this sense of urgency have been widely publicized reports from internal stakeholders and external customers expressing concerns regarding the service level these troubled VA programs are actually providing.\u201d\n\nFinancial auditor Grant Thornton, which touts itself as one of the world\u2019s leading organizations of independent audit, tax and advisory firms, partnered with another publicly traded company to help the Obama administration achieve its transformation goals.\n\nThe documents WND obtained tout accountability and transparency:\n\n\u201cAdding to the complexity of this demanding environment is the bright spotlight of governmental transparency. The result is the need for a comprehensive human capital strategy that takes an aggressive \u2013 beyond \u2018minimum standards\u2019 \u2013 approach to training the VA workforce through an integrated strategy that establishes individual and organizational accountability.\u201d\n\nInstead of increasing the number and quality of hospital care staff, however, Obama administration officials seemingly created more bureaucracy at taxpayer expense.\n\nShinseki in a 2011 statement to Washington Technology said his aim was to \u201ctransform the VA into a 21st century organization\u201d to enable the VA to acquire services for information technology programs that will help ensure timely delivery of health care and benefits to our veterans.\n\nHis vision birthed a $12-billion information technology contracting initiative known as T4. The lofty contract serves as a means to provide efficient, secure systems that help reduce wait times, among other things.\n\n\u201cT4 is a major tool in the transformation of VA into a 21st century organization,\u201d Shinseki said in the statement.\n\nAfter further investigation, WND found that under Shinseki\u2019s leadership, the VA has also suffered from major security breaches, as thieves have gained unscrupulous access to patients\u2019 records. Last March, Tampa VA medical center employee David Lewis was sentenced to six years in federal prison for stealing over 100 veterans\u2019 private information and trading it for crack cocaine.\n\nAccording to the press release from the United States Justice Department in Florida, on at least five different dates in 2012, Lewis accessed and printed the personal information, including names, social security numbers and medical information, of over 100 veterans who were inpatients at the Tampa VA Medical Center.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 More than 12,000 Veterans Administration employees in several states have received nearly $9 million in bonuses since 2011, according to a government watchdog group.
