But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that \"as of April 13, more than 68,000 consumers have taken advantage of this opportunity.\" That would represent less than 2,000 people per each of the 36 HealthCare.gov states offering a grace period.\n\nThe grace period is for people who only this tax season learned they are obligated to have health insurance, learned they owe a fine for not having had coverage last year and who want to avoid an even bigger Obamacare penalty next year.\n\nThe special enrollment season was announced after open enrollment ended Feb. 15, and reflected concern by the Obama administration that many people remain unaware of both the mandate that they have health coverage and the fine for lacking it.\n\nThe fine for not having insurance in 2014 was the greater of $95 per adult or 1 percent of taxable household income. That penalty grows to the greater of $325 or 2 percent of household income this year and is due on the filing of income tax returns.\n\nRead MoreOscar's Obamacare-fueled growth\n\n\n\nThe low tally so far for HealthCare.gov's grace period suggests that millions of people will be subject to the higher fine next year. Tax experts who spoke to CNBC recently said that not many filers were were aware of the special enrollment period.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the 36 states served by HealthCare.gov, similar grace periods are being offered in all but three states: Idaho, Massachusetts and Colorado. A national tally has not yet been released.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Just 68,000 people have signed up for HealthCare.gov plans during a grace period for those subject to an fine.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Just 68,000 people have signed up for HealthCare.gov plans during a grace period for those subject to an fine.", "title": "Obamacare grace period attracts few enrollees", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/obamacare-grace-period-attracts-few-enrollees.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/23/102292851-460502266.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just 68,000 people have signed up for HealthCare.gov plans during a grace period for those subject to an fine.", "title": "Obamacare grace period attracts few enrollees", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/obamacare-grace-period-attracts-few-enrollees.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/12/23/102292851-460502266.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-04-20T17:53:21-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T17:53:22-0400", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 102602893, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, fines, grace period, health insurance, taxes, HealthCare.gov"}, "article_summary": "Tax experts who spoke to CNBC recently said that not many filers were were aware of the special enrollment period.\nThat would represent less than 2,000 people per each of the 36 HealthCare.gov states offering a grace period.\nThat penalty grows to the greater of $325 or 2 percent of household income this year and is due on the filing of income tax returns.\nRead MoreOscar's Obamacare-fueled growthThe low tally so far for HealthCare.gov's grace period suggests that millions of people will be subject to the higher fine next year.\nIn addition to the 36 states served by HealthCare.gov, similar grace periods are being offered in all but three states: Idaho, Massachusetts and Colorado."}
