Robinson, of Holland, who has bipolar depression, was dropped from his treatment services due to budget cuts. (Photo: Amy Biolchini / AP)\n\nHolland \u2014 J.R. Robinson rubbed his hands together. A hollow sadness sits behind his eyes, punctuating a broken expression.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling every day,\u201d said the Holland resident, a Tennessee accent filling soft, steady words.\n\n\u201cBipolar depression doesn\u2019t go away like a virus. There\u2019s only so much medications can do.\u201d\n\nHis appearance at the Holland Drop-In-Center on Sept. 29 was no easy feat.\n\nWithout scheduled classes two days a week at Community Mental Health of Ottawa County, motivating himself to leave his apartment is a battle.\n\n\u201cIt kept me from isolating; it kept me from drinking,\u201d Robinson, 51, said. \u201cWe felt like we were somebody.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been six months since CMH dropped Robinson from services.\n\nHe\u2019s not alone. About 50 CMH clients in Ottawa County no longer receive treatment after the agency went through a round of budget reductions this spring.\n\nSwift budget cuts made this year by the county meant reductions in services for clients with mental health and developmental disabilities, and staff layoffs.\n\nLocal officials have pointed to changes in their Medicaid funding but, regionally, there\u2019s more in play.\n\nAs with any valuable social service, funding for CMH agencies isn\u2019t simple. In Ottawa County, 92 percent of the $38 million CMH budget comes from Medicaid, 3 percent to 4 percent is from state general fund, and $476,000 is from the county.\n\nOttawa CMH was hit with a 62 percent reduction in its funding from the state\u2019s general fund \u2014 a drop from $3.5 million in fiscal 2014 to $1.4 million in fiscal 2015.\n\nMedicaid funding is funneled through a new regional entity \u2014 Lakeshore Regional Partners \u2014 that was launched in 2014 to help county-level agencies reduce administrative costs and create more equitable services across counties.\n\nOttawa used to be paired with Muskegon \u2014 but now the two counties are working with Allegan, Kent, Lake, Mason and Oceana counties. It\u2019s a part of a larger statewide re-grouping of CMH agencies. In 2014, the state \u201crebased\u201d Medicaid funding for mental health agencies: a $10 million cut to the Lakeshore region.\n\nOttawa County has experienced bigger budget issues than most because of one reason: It\u2019s been overfunded.\n\nMuskegon had been giving about $2 million of its unused Medicaid funding to Ottawa CMH for the past 16 years, which it was able to do because of its conservative budget.\n\nWhen the new region formed, the five CMHs agreed to stick with their historical funding methodologies \u2014 and so Ottawa continued to receive additional funds.\n\nThat\u2019s now changing.\n\nThe regional board has voted to move to the state\u2019s standard per-person, per-month formula for determining Medicaid allocations \u2014 which means a $6.8 million cut to Ottawa County. The county has four years to absorb the decreased revenue in its budget.\n\nCMH has reduced its staff by 35 people this year, starting with reductions at the administrative level and then at the clinical and direct care levels, Executive Director Lynne Doyle said.\n\n\u201cWe are always trying to push as many dollars as we can to customer care and consumer services,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nIn the middle of its fiscal year, CMH realized it was overspending in its general fund. The agency foots the bill for clients who are on a Medicaid \u201cspend-down\u201d out of that fund \u2014 and decided to re-evaluate their need for services.\n\n\u201cWe determined there were 50 folks who were at a stage in their recovery and treatment that were good candidates to link to community services,\u201d Doyle said.\n\nAbout 2,600 people use the agency annually. Despite the cuts, the agency still ended its 2015 fiscal year Sept. 30 with a $400,000 deficit in its general fund.\n\nThe budget issues have trickled down to nonprofits like the Holland Drop-In Center, whose budget has been cut by 20 percent this year by CMH and is dropping its cable TV this month to save cash. Still, CMH refers clients it has determined no longer have a medical need for services to the Drop-In Center.\n\nIt\u2019s also affected major CMH contractors like Kandu, which ceased operations Sept. 30. Kandu may have its own financial issues, as the Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s Office launched an investigation two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe have folks that need to be served,\u201d said Rita Bird, Lakeshore Regional Partners board member. \u201cJust because the agency has targeted certain places to cut to make this budget balanced, doesn\u2019t mean the folks that are gone are being served with the correct scope, frequency and duration.\u201d\n\nThe creation of the regional entity \u2014 Lakeshore Regional Partners \u2014 was intended to shift administrative functions off the backs of county agencies to free up money in their budgets for their work. Instead, about 20 people were hired to staff the regional office \u2014 totaling administrative costs of about $4 million \u2014 and their work is still duplicated in each of the five counties they serve, Bird said.\n\nThere\u2019s been a reluctance by some counties to give up control of some administrative functions.\n\nThe management of that transition has come under the scrutiny of state officials, who say the region hasn\u2019t consolidated administrative functions quickly enough.\n\nAs a result, Tom Renwick, director of the bureau of community based services for the state\u2019s Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities Administration, is now attending all meetings of the regional board to provide oversight \u2014 and the region is being audited by Beacon Health.\n\nRenwick explicitly instructed LRP Executive Director Rich VandenHeuvel that administrative functions like customer services, quality oversight, training and information technology services be consolidated first before initiating funding reductions to service providers that would impact clients.\n\nLeadership throughout the transition has been called into question.\n\nWhen the five CMHs entered into the new region, each had their own funding methodologies and formulas. They agreed to divide the region\u2019s Medicaid dollars according to historical spending levels at first \u2014 which meant Ottawa continued to receive a higher level of funding per person than in other counties.\n\n\u201cThere was no transparency amongst all the CFOs about the extent to which people were getting a lot of extra funding,\u201d said Marianne Huff, executive director of Allegan County Community Mental Health.\n\nAllegan\u2019s agency hired a lawyer and called the distribution into question because they were losing Medicaid funding in the new regional arrangement.\n\n\u201cNo one sat down and provided leadership and said, \u2018You guys (like Ottawa County) might want to start working on this now,\u201d Huff said. \u201cIt became more of a crisis when we realized what kind of a deficit we were going to have as a region. . Had we put a plan in place sooner, it would have been so much better because we could have been working on it conjointly.\u201d\n\nIn mid-July Renwick informed VandenHeuvel that the level of reserves that the region was projected to end with \u2014 less than half of a percent of revenue \u2014 raised a major red flag.\n\n\u201cThese projections call the PIHP\u2019s ability to perform their contractual obligations without entering the state\u2019s risk-sharing corridor into question,\u201d Renwick wrote.\n\nThe board, which was split in its support of VandenHeuvel, was left in the dark about the state of the region\u2019s finances during the first years of its formation, Bird said.\n\nIn addition, regional officials forgot to budget for a hospital use tax, Bird said.\n\n\u201cWhat that meant was, the regional board was being told that we had more money to spend than we actually did,\u201d Bird said. \u201cIt was millions of dollars. The end result is, we had to tell every executive director of the five CMHs that make up the region to make cuts and present a new 14-15 budget for that year.\u201d\n\nThe Lakeshore board did not offer VandenHeuvel a new contract \u2014 and so the CEO departed upon his contract\u2019s expiration in July.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re considered a failed region and have to do some things to improve our last couple of year\u2019s performance,\u201d Bird said. \u201cThe audit will either show that we\u2019re improving and addressing the problems, or it will show us there\u2019s not much likelihood we\u2019ll ever get any better. In which case, the state has already told us, if we can\u2019t perform as a region, they\u2019ll bid out the services to someone else.\u201d\n\nMuch of the chaos in the region\u2019s budget came from the introduction of the Healthy Michigan plan \u2014 a product of Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 that is good for patients but not so for agencies\u2019 budgets.\n\nCMH agencies previously received payments for each person in the county that received a type of Medicaid called TANF \u2014 Temporary Aid to Needy Families.\n\nThe number of people on TANF in the region dropped from 140,000 in July of 2014 to 113,00 in January 2015, Huff said, as consumers moved from TANF onto the Healthy Michigan plan. The result: fewer dollars to the region\u2019s mental health agencies that haven\u2019t been replaced.\n\nThe state initially told the region that it would be able to use any excess money from an influx of new funding for the Healthy Michigan plan to offset any Medicaid overspending \u2014 and so it was built into the budget. Three months into the fiscal year in December, the state reversed its position, Doyle said.\n\nThe regional board approved the hire of Jeff Brown as interim director this summer. Brown, a consultant, was previously the executive director of Oakland County Community Mental Health. The Oakland board did not renew Brown\u2019s contract after his nine-year tenure at the helm of the agency.\n\nBrown said the challenge of creating a new region was exacerbated by changes taking place statewide and with the finances of the Healthy Michigan plan.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of change at once, but you need a strong regional entity to be able to work with the local service delivery organizations,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThough an interim director, Brown said he\u2019s committed to \u201cright-sizing\u201d administrative functions across the region throughout the next three months while maintaining provider rates and service delivery.\n\nA priority for Brown is to bring customer service functions and Medicaid fair hearings back to the regional level away from the county agencies.\n\n\u201cBringing areas and functions that are consumer protections to the regional level, so that we get the uninterrupted version of issues people are having with service delivery,\u201d Brown said.\n\nThe LRP is seeking a permanent director, and Brown is applying for position.\n\nThough the budget situation may be complex, the impacts are severely personal.\n\nJeffrey Ford, 64, of Holland, is bipolar depressed and has anxiety. He\u2019s also been treated for borderline personality disorder.\n\nCMH stopped his services in April, also due to budget cuts.\n\n\u201cIf a crisis came up, I could call them,\u201d Ford said, explaining he saw a therapist and took classes twice a week.\n\nHe felt like he belonged to something. Now, Ford says he\u2019s lost.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had multiple relapses because of this,\u201d Ford said, noting he had a friend take their own life after being dropped from services.\n\nFor Robinson, it\u2019s meant he\u2019s lost a therapist he grew to trust; he\u2019s lost programs that taught him how to cope with his anger and emotions; he\u2019s lost a connection to an agency that helped him to finally put a word to the illness he\u2019d carried since the age of 15 that drove him to drink and abuse drugs.\n\nHe\u2019s taking more pills now than he was six months ago, as he again tries to fill a hole in his life.\n\nBut they aren\u2019t they kind of emotional medication Robinson said he received from CMH.\n\n\u201cIt was like we weren\u2019t valued people,\u201d Robinson said, describing his feelings when he was dropped from services. \u201cIt was like taking out the trash.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1LpXQSS", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "About 50 Community Mental Health clients in Ottawa County no longer receive treatment after budget cuts", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "About 50 Community Mental Health clients in Ottawa County no longer receive treatment after budget cuts", "title": "Cutbacks in mental health services hit west Michigan", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/life/wellness/2015/10/11/cutbacks-mental-health-services-hit-west-michigan/73796784/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "About 50 Community Mental Health clients in Ottawa County no longer receive treatment after budget cuts", "title": "Cutbacks in mental health services hit west Michigan", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0b6fb85e535cf5309bb50ab5f862c93cc1a3409f/c=300-0-1800-1500&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/11/DetroitNews/B99312777Z.1_20151011205849_000_GVHJSNUK.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaed7\"", "article_summary": "Without scheduled classes two days a week at Community Mental Health of Ottawa County, motivating himself to leave his apartment is a battle.\nIn 2014, the state \u201crebased\u201d Medicaid funding for mental health agencies: a $10 million cut to the Lakeshore region.\nLocal officials have pointed to changes in their Medicaid funding but, regionally, there\u2019s more in play.\nKandu may have its own financial issues, as the Ottawa County Sheriff\u2019s Office launched an investigation two weeks ago.\nSwift budget cuts made this year by the county meant reductions in services for clients with mental health and developmental disabilities, and staff layoffs."}
