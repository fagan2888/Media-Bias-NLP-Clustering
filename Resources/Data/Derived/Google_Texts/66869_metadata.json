But to understand why Carson\u2019s recent success in Republican polls makes so much sense, one must first take a closer look at the nature of the modern Republican Party.\n\nIn the Age of Obama, GOP elites routinely bloviate about their need to expand outreach to people of color, especially Hispanics and Latinos, given the United States\u2019 changing ethnic and racial demographics. Yet, the Party has consistently failed to leverage opportunities to that end. This could be a function of incompetence. Alternatively, such a lack of substantive efforts could simply be a reflection of a political party that is dedicated to white racial resentment and white identity politics\u2014and thus suppressing the votes of non-whites\u2014as its primary electoral strategy.\n\nGiven these dynamics, how does one make sense of the curious case of Ben Carson? How then does his surging popularity compute?\n\nCarson\u2019s popularity points out the tension between what is known as \u201csubstantive\u201d and \u201cdescriptive\u201d politics. Substantive politics centers on a belief in a person\u2019s values and policy positions as overriding other identity-based concerns about governance and political behavior. Yes, the body that an individual is born into matters. But, substantive politics presumes that almost any person can effectively represent a given constituency and its values. Descriptive politics, on the other hand, is the belief that a person\u2019s life experiences and identity, especially if they are an outsider or Other in a given socio-political system \u2014 in the United States and West this would be women, people of color, gays and lesbians, and members of other marginalized groups \u2014 will lead them to challenge the system or be transformative and somehow resistant.\n\nUltimately, the tension here is between individuals and systems. Do our racialized, ethnic, gendered, and other identities provide gifted insight and leverage for those we represent in government? Or is it best to vote for and support candidates based on their ideas alone, with an understanding that the system exercises constraints on all actors?\n\n(Stated differently: A white man may do a better job of representing his black and brown constituents\u2019 interests than a brother or sister who \u201csells out\u201d to Power. The latter is a \u201ctoken\u201d; the former can be a true and effective representative.)\n\nWhite conservatives love Ben Carson, the black face in a high place, in a sea of white candidates, because his symbolic presence provides cover for the white supremacist politics endorsed by the post-civil rights era Republican Party.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While most campaign coverage has centered on Donald Trump, Carson's rise arguably says much more about the GOP", "title": "The curious case of Ben Carson: How a black neurosurgeon soared to the top of the GOP primary", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While most campaign coverage has centered on Donald Trump, Carson's rise arguably says much more about the GOP", "title": "The curious case of Ben Carson: How a black neurosurgeon soared to the top of the GOP primary", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/01/the_curious_case_of_ben_carson_how_a_black_neurosurgeon_soared_to_the_top_of_the_gop_primary/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ben_carson12.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While most campaign coverage has centered on Donald Trump, Carson's rise arguably says much more about the GOP", "title": "The curious case of Ben Carson: How a black neurosurgeon soared to the top of the GOP primary", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/ben_carson12.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Chauncey DeVega", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Carson, Elections 2016, GOP primary, The Republican Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Given these dynamics, how does one make sense of the curious case of Ben Carson?\nBut, substantive politics presumes that almost any person can effectively represent a given constituency and its values.\nTopics: Ben Carson, Elections 2016, GOP primary, The Republican Party, News, Politics NewsIn a primary season that has seen the most unlikely of candidates, Donald Trump, surge to the head of the GOP pack, perhaps the least surprising development is the ascendance of another political outsider: Dr. Ben Carson.\nBut to understand why Carson\u2019s recent success in Republican polls makes so much sense, one must first take a closer look at the nature of the modern Republican Party.\nSubstantive politics centers on a belief in a person\u2019s values and policy positions as overriding other identity-based concerns about governance and political behavior."}
