Oh, there\u2019s the obligatory \u2014 passing \u2014 reference to it during speeches and debates, but little more. Indeed, GOP tax plans would make the debt much worse by trillions over the next decade and beyond.\n\nNow maybe one reason there\u2019s less debt talk is that budget deficits are way down, and the long-term fiscal outlook improved. On the latter front, the WSJ\u2019s Grep Ip highlights a new study \u2014 co-authored by former CBO boss Doug Elmendorf \u2014 that forecasts the US debt-GDP ratio won\u2019t hit 100% until 2032 vs. the CBO\u2019s 2009 forecast of 2023. (Thank low interest rates and slower healthcare inflation for that.)\n\nBut maybe another reason Republicans aren\u2019t talking about the debt is that it\u2019s hard to do so without also talking about deep Medicare and Social Security reform. And while entitlement reform was a pretty hot topic early in the Obama presidency, passion on the right has waned. Reforming entitlements is out, defending them is in. As Donald Trump has put it: \u201cEvery Republican wants to do a big number on Social Security, they want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it on Medicaid. And we can\u2019t do that. And it\u2019s not fair to the people that have been paying in for years and now all of the sudden they want [it] to be cut.\u201d Here\u2019s WSJ columnist Holman Jenkins:\n\nMr. Trump is a political harbinger here of a new strand of populist Republicanism, largely empowered by ObamaCare, in which the \u201cconservative\u201d position is to defend the existing entitlement programs from a perceived threat posed by a new-style Obama coalition of handout seekers that includes the chronically unemployed, students, immigrants, minorities and women.\n\nThis political rationale was emerging in the 2012 Obama- Mitt Romney race, though not yet fully formed. It surfaced again in the 2013 tea party fight over the debt limit, a Kabuki play that allegedly threatened national default. The Kabuki was driven, recall, by the demand of Mr. Cruz and other tea party types that ObamaCare be \u201cdefunded.\u201d \u2026 The tea party animus toward ObamaCare is something different: Implicitly, such means-tested new entitlements that benefit working-age folks and people (read minorities) who typically vote Democrat are viewed as a threat to the traditional, universal, \u201cearned,\u201d middle-class retirement programs of Social Security and Medicare. \u2026 The unspoken tea party stance of defending the good old-fashioned entitlements of \u201creal\u201d Americans is increasingly, in dog-whistle terms, what differentiates one Republican from another. Chris Christie, who went nowhere in Iowa, did himself no favor by dragging Social Security and Medicare into every debate, however much those programs need to be addressed. Marco Rubio was just as quick to modify any implication that Republicans therefore are entitlement reformers: \u201cWe are talking about reforms for future generations. Nothing has to change for current beneficiaries. My mother is on Medicare and Social Security. I\u2019m against anything that\u2019s bad for my mother.\u201d Welcome to an important new fault line in our slow-growth, resource-constrained America. Though many of us believe the entitlement programs need to be reformed, success will come increasingly to Republicans who pose as \u201cconservative\u201d defenders of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIn other words, government checks going to more likely GOP voters are \u201cearned benefits,\u201d those to Democratic voters, \u201cwelfare.\u201d Medicare and Social Security good, Medicaid, Obamacare and income supports bad. Or as Jenkins phrased it in an earlier column: \u201cThe new \u2018conservative\u2019 position will be to defend Social Security and Medicare, those middle-class rewards for a life of hard work and tax-paying, against Mr. Obama\u2019s vast expansion of the means-tested welfare state for working-age Americans.\u201d Certainly not every Republican is totally buying into this. Rubio, for instance, does support sweeping Med-SocSec reform \u2014 though I don\u2019t know how much he talks about it on the presidential campaign trail.\n\nA few economic policy notes: First, the future projected cost growth of middle-class entitlements will need to be reduced.\n\nSecond, a GOP Obamacare replacement plan may not spend as much as Obamacare is projected to, but it will spend more than than a return to the pre-Obamacare status quo. The 2017 Project has devised an ObamaCare alternative that would include refundable tax credits for individuals and the uninsured to buy private health insurance. The proposal would cost about a trillion bucks over ten years.\n\nThird, the globalized, technologically advanced US economy might require a broader array of income supports than many GOPers now consider wise. AEI\u2019s Charles Murray, a supporter of a government-guaranteed basic income \u2014 has argued thusly: \u201cMassive government redistribution is an inevitable feature of advanced postindustrial societies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not much talk about the national debt during this GOP primary season.
