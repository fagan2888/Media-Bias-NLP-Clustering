That\u2019s part of my game, though,\u201d Roby said. \u201cI should be doing stuff like that but the short stuff, I can get better. I just have to keep my eyes off the quarterback. I was staring too much. It was my first game, though. I\u2019ll be good. Just got to fix my mistakes and have better practices and have a better game (next Sunday).\u201d\n\nThe Broncos play their second preseason game on Sunday, Aug. 17 in Santa Clara, Calif., where they will help the San Francisco 49ers christen Levi\u2019s Stadium.\n\nOne of the quarterbacks Roby stared down Thursday was his former Ohio State teammate Terrelle Pryor. A starter for the Oakland Raiders last year, Pryor was the Seahawks\u2019 No. 3 quarterback Thursday. Pryor\u2019s last season at Ohio State was 2010, when Roby was redshirting.\n\n\u201cIt was fun laying against Terrelle,\u201d Roby said. \u201cHe was trying to get me, too. He saw me when I was playing off. It\u2019s all good. He gave me his shoes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bradley Roby,Denver Broncos,Oakland Raiders,San Francisco 49ers,Seattle Seahawks,Sports Authority Field at Mile High,Terrelle Pryor", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The preseason game Thursday against the Seahawks was the first chance Bronco fans got to see rookie cornerback and first-round draft pick Bradley Roby.", "title": "Bradley Roby plays against former Ohio State teammate Terrelle Pryor", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/08/terrelle-pryor-gives-old-buckeye-mate-bradley-roby-shoes/28642/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/bradley-roby-fumble.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The preseason game Thursday against the Seahawks was the first chance Bronco fans got to see rookie cornerback and first-round draft pick Bradley Roby.", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/08/terrelle-pryor-gives-old-buckeye-mate-bradley-roby-shoes/28642/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/bradley-roby-fumble.jpg", "title": "Bradley Roby takes on former Buckeye mate Terrelle Pryor in Broncos debut", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The preseason game Thursday against the Seahawks was the first chance Bronco fans got to see rookie cornerback and first-round draft pick Bradley Roby."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0055\"", "article_summary": "One of the quarterbacks Roby stared down Thursday was his former Ohio State teammate Terrelle Pryor.\n\u201cIt was fun laying against Terrelle,\u201d Roby said.\nThe preseason game Thursday against the Seattle Seahawks was the first chance Bronco fans got to see rookie cornerback and first-round draft pick Bradley Roby.\n\u201cI should be doing stuff like that but the short stuff, I can get better.\nPryor\u2019s last season at Ohio State was 2010, when Roby was redshirting."}
