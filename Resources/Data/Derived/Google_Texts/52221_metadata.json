County District Attorney Jackie Lacey (Credit: L.A. County DA\u2019s Office.)\n\n\u201cBeing anxious and afraid does not justify attempting to execute a man on his way to go surfing.\u201d\n\nExcept apparently it does, at least if you work in law enforcement. The quote is from the lawyer for David Perdue, one of three people police in Southern California mistakenly fired upon during last Ferbuary\u2019s manhunt for cop killer (and former cop) Christopher Dorner.\n\nThis week, the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced that it won\u2019t be filing charges against Brian McGee, the Torrance officer who rammed Perdue\u2019s truck, then opened fire on him. The DA found that McGee made a \u201creasonable mistake,\u201d even though Perdue is white and Dorner was black, and Perdue\u2019s truck wasn\u2019t the same color as that reported to have been driven by Dorner.\n\nPart of the reason why McGee\u2019s actions were deemed reasonable is that just blocks away, seven LAPD cops had just fired 100 bullets at a truck driven by Margie Carranza and her mother, Emma Hernandez, thinking they were Dorner. The two women were delivering newspapers. McGee apparently believed Perdue was Dorner, fleeing from that shooting. The seven LAPD cops shot up not only the women\u2019s truck, they also sent bullets flying all over the neighborhood, hitting \u201ccars, trees, roofs and garage doors.\u201d They too have been cleared of any wrongdoing. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck described that incident as \u201ca tragic misinterpretation\u201d by police officers dealing with \u201cincredible tension.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly understandable how police on heightened alert for a suspected cop killer might be a bit nervier than usual. That doesn\u2019t excuse unleashing swarms of bullets at innocent people. To contrast, consider a drug suspect who wakes up to a midnight drug raid. Maybe the police have made a mistake, and this particular suspect is innocent, in which case he\u2019d have no reason to suspect the home invaders might be cops. Maybe the suspect is actually a drug dealer, but mistakes the raiding cops for a rival dealer. The latter is of course less sympathetic. But in both cases, the suspects have every reason to be anxious and afraid. And in both cases, it would be understandable why they might want to defend themselves. In both cases, the decision to do so would be an honest mistake. Both of these scenarios have happened, numerous times. And in both scenarios, the suspects are almost always charged with one or more felonies, whether or not police subsequently find any significant quantity of drugs. If they kill a cop during the raid, they\u2019re going to be charged with murder.\n\nOr consider a hypothetical that\u2019s a bit more on-point: When the D.C. snipers were still at large several years ago, the police and press told the pubic to be on the lookout for a white van. Let\u2019s say you get off work, and return to your home in Virginia. You\u2019re a concealed carry permit holder. You pull into your driveway and notice a white van parked out front. There\u2019s a white man sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. (Remember, the prevailing theory at the time was that the sniper was a white loner.) Your family is in the house. You ask the man to identify himself. You can\u2019t see, but he\u2019s a repair man. He\u2019s filling out paperwork, so he doesn\u2019t see you. He has his radio turned up, so he doesn\u2019t hear you. You open fire.\n\nYou too had good reason to be anxious and afraid. You too were relying on bad information, and made a mistake about the identity of the driver. Do you think you\u2019d get the same consideration the DA\u2019s office has shown to the cops in Torrance and Los Angeles?\n\nOf course, police are authorized to use lethal force. The rest of us aren\u2019t, unless we believe ourselves or others to be in imminent danger of grave bodily harm. (That\u2019s a generalization; the specific legal standard varies by state.) But the police also have the benefit of training. To borrow from my former Cato Institute colleague Tim Lynch, there\u2019s a good argument that they should be held to a higher standard. And there\u2019s a good argument that they should be held to the same standard. It\u2019s hard to think of a convincing argument that they should be held to a lower one.\n\nA mindset that kicks in among police officers when a cop gets killed, particularly if the killer remains at large. Doors come down. Suspects get beaten, sometimes severely. Sometimes, it\u2019s the wrong suspect. As Perdue\u2019s attorney Christopher Driscoll put it in an interview, \u201c\u201dWhen an officer is injured, or goes down, or is threatened, the team mentality really steps up. You have that concern that individual citizens\u2019 rights are going to get trampled when the officers are attempting to get justice for their brothers.\u201d It\u2019s a mindset that\u2019s endorsed in the popular culture. We\u2019ve all seen TV cop dramas where, when a fellow cop is shot or killed, his colleagues get in a couple of extra kicks when arresting a suspect. There\u2019s a little more physicality in the interrogation room.\n\nAgain, this sentiment is perfectly human, and it\u2019s entirely understandable. But it\u2019s also dangerous, and it can\u2019t be encouraged. The lesson from the DA\u2019s decisions in Los Angeles\u2014as well as the failure to administer any significant professional punishment\u2014is that when a cop goes down, we suspend the Bill of Rights until the killer is apprehended. Perhaps if David Perdue, Margie Carranza, or Emma Hernandez had been killed in one of these incidents, the DA may have acted differently. Certainly there would be more public pressure for an indictment. But it shouldn\u2019t need to come to that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No charges for cops who shot at innocent people during the Dorner manhunt", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/radley.balko", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "No charges for cops who shot at innocent people during the Dorner manhunt", "title": "\u201cBeing anxious and afraid does not justify attempting to execute a man on his way to go surfing.\u201d", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2014/01/17/being-anxious-and-afraid-does-not-justify-attempting-to-execute-a-man-on-his-way-to-go-surfing/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/01/JL-189x300.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@radleybalko"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/opinions/wp/2014/01/17/being-anxious-and-afraid-does-not-justify-attempting-to-execute-a-man-on-his-way-to-go-surfing/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "christopher dorner, lapd, police shootings, police abuse, police brutality,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/radley.balko"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "christopher dorner, lapd, police shootings, police abuse, police brutality,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc238\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBeing anxious and afraid does not justify attempting to execute a man on his way to go surfing.\u201dExcept apparently it does, at least if you work in law enforcement.\nThere\u2019s a white man sitting in the driver\u2019s seat.\nBut in both cases, the suspects have every reason to be anxious and afraid.\nMaybe the suspect is actually a drug dealer, but mistakes the raiding cops for a rival dealer.\nA mindset that kicks in among police officers when a cop gets killed, particularly if the killer remains at large."}
