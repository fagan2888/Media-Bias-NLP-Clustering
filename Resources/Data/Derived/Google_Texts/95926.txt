Once again, the people of Hollywood Boulevard didn’t disappoint when Jimmy Kimmel’s Lie Witness News crew took to the sidewalks on Wednesday. The subject of the fake questions this time? President Bill Clinton, Kimmel’s guest for the evening.

The pedestrians were asked questions about things Clinton didn’t actually do, like ending the Korean War — a war that actually ended when Clinton was just a kid. The responses from the pedestrians were frightening and highlight the fact that some Americans have no clue about what’s going on in the country.

Will Clinton’s role as a judge on America’s Got Talent next year damage his legacy?

“No, because I think that it will make him even more popular,” the woman being interviewed said.

It’s probably true that a Clinton cameo on America’s Got Talent wouldn’t hurt, since the show is about to begin its ninth season in May. The problem? He’s not going to be on the show.

Two women apparently believed, without question, that the 42nd President had been called back into active duty as Commander-in-Chief due to President Barack Obama getting knee surgery.

Clinton even received some advice about his appearance from two men dressed up in costumes — get rid of the ponytail! (The former President doesn’t actually have a ponytail, of course.)
