In an effort to dispel this pernicious comparison, Cruz is making the case that Obama, as a senator, was a \u201cbackbencher who \u201cdid not engage in a whole lot of issues of consequence,\u201d while Ted Cruz has been on the front lines \u201cleading the fight on conservative principles.\u201d\n\nThis is mostly nonsense. Freshmen senators bear no burden or expectation of leadership and experience. You could actually make a credible case that no one has done more to hamstring conservative causes than Ted Cruz, given his propensity for sabotaging his own party\u2019s legislative agenda. Cruz is trusting that voters will confuse spotlight-attracting bombast and a flood of press releases for \u201cleadership.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s interesting that Cruz is trying so hard to claim he has \u201cexperience,\u201d at least compared to Obama. To the extent that the question of \u201cexperience\u201d matters for a young candidate depends largely on what they do to neutralize it in the face of opponents with longer r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. In that sense, the Obama comparison is instructive. Sen. Obama took active steps to defuse the \u201cexperience\u201d issue long before he ever became a candidate for president. Ted Cruz, on the other hand, is only now trying to deal with it, and he\u2019s doing so by denying that it\u2019s a problem.\n\nObama approached his time in the Senate with the understanding that his next step would be a run for the White House, and so he tailored his legislative pursuits to the type of campaign he wanted to run. Back in 2005 he was still doing the hope-and-change spiel and wanted to run as the consensus builder, the guy who could overcome partisanship and work with Republicans to cobble together happy little centrist compromises. And so when he got to the Senate he looked for Republicans to work with. In 2006, he and Richard Lugar wrote legislation curbing the proliferation of conventional weapons and WMD, which was later incorporated into a bill that passed into law. He teamed up with Tom Coburn to call for oversight of Hurricane Katrina relief spending. It wasn\u2019t exactly earth-shaking stuff, but it filled out an empty r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and allowed for him to credibly argue that he could work with the GOP.\n\nOne of the most important things Obama did was to keep a low profile early on \u2013 if he had come into the Senate and tried to use his burgeoning celebrity to force his will and vacuum up attention, he would have bred the sort of resentments that make legislating impossible. \u201cWhat Sen. Clinton did when she first came in was what any person would do when they come into a new environment, that is listen and learn before you speak and you act,\u201d Obama said in June 2005. \u201cI have tried to follow that same wisdom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz could have learned from Obama how to deal with \"experience\" questions.
