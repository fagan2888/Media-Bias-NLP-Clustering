In a statement at the time, the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance described the move as \u201ca preventative measure to support the long-term viability of CHA and the protection of Tennessee consumers.\u201d\n\nEven before CoOportunity\u2019s failure, Republican critics of the health law had pointed to the co-ops as a risky use of tax dollars. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa last month began an investigation into the federal government\u2019s role in CoOportunity\u2019s collapse. And on the floor of the House of Representatives recently, Representative Adrian Smith of Nebraska called the co-op\u2019s collapse \u201cone more example of Obamacare\u2019s failure.\u201d\n\nCoOportunity executives declined to be interviewed, referring questions to Mr. Gerhart.\n\nDr. Carlyle said a unique set of circumstances had weakened the co-op. In addition to selling private plans through the exchange, it had agreed to cover new Medicaid enrollees under Iowa\u2019s expansion of the program. The co-op pulled out of the Medicaid program in October, saying many of the 9,700 enrollees it covered had significant health needs and were too expensive.\n\nAnother problem was that Iowa and Nebraska, with the Obama administration\u2019s permission, allowed people to keep old insurance policies that did not meet Affordable Care Act standards through 2016. These people tended to be relatively healthy because before the law took effect, insurers could reject customers who were sick.\n\nThat left the two insurers selling plans through Iowa\u2019s online exchange, CoOportunity and Coventry Health, to take on a disproportionate number of customers with expensive health problems. Mr. Gerhart said CoOportunity had paid for 21 organ transplants over the last 13 months, for example, and had seen \u201chigher than anticipated\u201d claims across the board. The co-op had increased its premium rates by 19 percent for 2015, but \u201cat the end of the day, they needed capital,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Lovig was among the co-op\u2019s most expensive customers. She had been paying more than $1,200 a month for health insurance, but switched as soon as the exchange opened last year because her income was low enough to qualify for financial help under the Affordable Care Act. She and her husband, Barry, chose CoOportunity because of the price \u2014 their out-of-pocket maximum for Ms. Lovig\u2019s medical care would be $1,350 \u2014 and what seemed like generous benefits.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOver the year, the couple said, they grew to love the co-op\u2019s customer service, too.\n\n\u201cI would say they were the best insurance company we\u2019ve ever been with,\u201d Ms. Lovig said.\n\nMary Stuart, 63, of Omaha, had just signed up with CoOportunity in December when she learned of its financial crisis. Ms. Stuart had marveled at how many doctors and hospitals were in the co-op\u2019s network, she said.\n\n\u201cIt sounded like an awfully nice deal,\u201d she said, \u201cand I guess it was too good of a deal.\u201d\n\nMs. Lovig\u2019s switch to a new insurer, Coventry Health, has not been so smooth. Her new coverage did not start until Feb. 1, meaning she has to pay a new out-of-pocket maximum \u2014 $1,850 \u2014 before the new benefits kick in.\n\n\u201cThe timing of it was a real nasty surprise,\u201d said Mr. Lovig, who sat beside his wife in their living room here with a view of snowy cornfields.\n\nMr. Gerhart said the state guaranty associations in Iowa and Nebraska would cover outstanding medical claims for CoOportunity customers up to $500,000 a person. He and others, including brokers and enrollment counselors in the two states, had urged co-op customers to choose a new insurer by Sunday, when the latest open enrollment period ended. Roughly three-fourths had switched as of last week, he said.\n\nCoOportunity customers were wondering whom to blame. Mr. Gerhart said it had become clear last summer that the co-op would need more federal loan dollars to stay solvent. He urged the Obama administration to let CoOportunity use federal funds it was not due to receive until later this year as collateral to get a third-party loan, he said, but to no avail.\n\nThe administration did lend the co-op $32.7 million in solvency funds in September, on top of $112.6 million it had already received. But it rejected another CoOportunity request, for $50 million, in December, awarding loans to other co-ops instead.\n\nAsked why the co-op did not receive another loan in December, Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said only, \u201cAt the end of the day, the total funding requests we received from co-ops exceeded the amount available.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAny start-up business enters the market with inherent risks,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cNot all succeed.\u201d\n\nDr. Martin Hickey, chairman of the National Alliance of State Health Co-ops, said that based on the third-quarter results posted by the remaining co-ops, \u201cI honestly, honestly don\u2019t expect another co-op to be taken over by a state regulator in 2015.\u201d\n\nIowans, these days, have only one option on the exchange: Coventry Health. Mr. Gerhart said he was optimistic that more insurers would join before the next enrollment, which starts in October. Ms. Lovig, who was scrambling last week to confirm whether Coventry would cover the nurse who comes twice a month to refill her pain pump, said she hoped that would happen.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have felt quite so bad if there were half a dozen others to choose from, or even three,\u201d she said. \u201cIf there\u2019s absolutely nobody else doing it, then what you get is probably not going to be as good as it could be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150216111348, "twitter": {"description": "The insolvency of CoOportunity Health raised the question of whether a
