Students also would have to work 10 hours a week.\n\nFederal spending on higher education over the past 20 years has exploded, according to federal data analyzed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nFederal tax expenditures on higher education climbed from about $2.5 billion annually in the 1990s to north of $35 billion in 2012, although it has declined somewhat in the past few years.\n\nFederally sponsored lending meanwhile soared between 1994 and 2012, from about $20 billion a year to around $110 billion. That does not include state spending.\n\nIn fiscal 2011, according to Pew, state spending on higher education topped $170.4 billion, or 10.1 percent of total state spending.\n\nAll of that spending has done nothing to check the skyrocketing cost of tuition.\n\n\u201cDespite increased state spending and federal initiatives to make higher education more affordable, tuition and fees at many four-year public institutions continue a rapid rise,\u201d according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.\n\nTuition has significantly increased in several states. New Hampshire, which holds the distinction of having the highest tuition in the United States, saw average rates climb from $10,170 in 2004-05 to $14,712 in 2014-15, according to the College Board. The cheapest tuition nationally was in Wyoming, with rates going up from $4,079 annually to $4,646 over the same period. There was a lot of upward movement in between.\n\nThere is no doubt that student debt has exploded, hitting $1.2 trillion in the first three months of this year, according to the New York Federal Reserve. Around 43 million Americans now owe student debt, according to the Pew Research Center. Student debt for people younger than 40 rose from 22 percent in 2001 to 37 percent in 2010.\n\nBut is it the government\u2019s responsibility to absorb student debt?\n\n\u201cIt seems now that Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t think you can go to college unless the government pays for it,\u201d Matthews told Watchdog.\n\nClinton\u2019s plan might be popular with millennials and it might give her the kind of government-is-the-answer centerpiece proposal that will help her court the far-left vote. But, like Obamacare, the Clinton tuition plan is loaded with potential unintended consequences, Matthews said.\n\n\u201cOf course, taxpayers are going to ultimately pay for this,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hillary Clinton higher ed plan has all the trappings of Obamacare", "title": "Hillary Clinton's higher ed plan a Pandora's Box like Obamacare, expert says - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/Hillary-higher-ed.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-12T10:31:44+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/233510/hillary-clinton-higher-education-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "National", "tag": "College,Higher education,Hillary Clinton,Institute for Policy Innovation,Merrill Matthews,ObamaCare,Pew Charitable Trusts,tuition,Wall Street Journal", "published_time": "2015-08-12T08:24:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-12T10:31:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hillary Clinton higher ed plan has all the trappings of Obamacare", "title": "Hillary Clinton's higher ed plan a Pandora's Box like Obamacare, expert says - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/Hillary-higher-ed.jpg"}, "creator": "@wiswatchdog", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Hillary Clinton higher ed plan has all the trappings of Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s big higher education idea is \u201cdebt-free\u201d tuition for students attending public colleges and universities.\nIn a column headlined, \u201cHillary Wants to Do to Higher Education What Obama Did to Health Care,\u201d Matthews warns, buyer beware.\nBut, like Obamacare, the Clinton tuition plan is loaded with potential unintended consequences, Matthews said.\nFederal spending on higher education over the past 20 years has exploded, according to federal data analyzed by the Pew Charitable Trusts.\nIn fiscal 2011, according to Pew, state spending on higher education topped $170.4 billion, or 10.1 percent of total state spending."}
