The target closed at $2.66 on Nov. 10.\n\nLiberator is a direct to consumer distributor of home medical supplies, such as catheters. The target estimates that the durable medical equipment, which makes treatment products that can be used repeatedly at home, is expected to grow from $45.8 billion in 2015 to $71.3 billion in 2023.\n\n\u201cAs the population ages and more health care is expected to occur outside of the hospital setting, we believe that having direct access to the patient in the home is strategically important,\u201d says Bard CEO Timothy Ring.
