Small presents options Monday evening to the district's Board of Education in Memphis.\n\nCalling retiree benefits \u201ca huge gorilla around our neck,\u201d leaders of Shelby County Schools discussed options Monday evening to reduce the cash-strapped district\u2019s swelling $1.5 billion liability.\n\nAs dozens of retired educators listened, administrators presented the Board of Education for Tennessee\u2019s largest public school district with four main options \u2014 from cutting spouses from the plan to providing incentives to purchase health insurance through the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdministrators say the district must pay down its liability costs for Other Post Employment Benefits known as OPEB, which are retirement benefits such as health and life insurance but excluding pensions. Last year, the legislature passed a law that requires local governments to pay their OPEB actuarial costs by 2020.\n\nCurrently, the self-insured school district pays for retiree health insurance costs as they occur rather than paying actuarial costs that amount to $124 million annually.\n\nThe district, which already has cut $125 million from its 2015-16 budget and asked the Shelby County Commission last month for additional funding for operational costs, was told by commissioners that any extra money received should go toward paying down its OPEB liability.\n\nAdministrators say the debt, if not reduced, will become an impediment to achieving the district\u2019s mission of educating children and serving employees.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge gorilla around our neck and it\u2019s called OPEB liability,\u201d Superintendent Dorsey Hopson told board members. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make the best of some bad choices.\u201d\n\nAdministrators are asking current teachers and retirees for feedback on options outlined on the district\u2019s website including:\n\nWriting retirees a monthly check in the amount of $10 for every year served \u2014 to go toward private insurance or insurance purchased through the Affordable Care Act \u2014 reducing the debt by about $430 million;\n\nSwitching district employees and retirees to the state\u2019s employee health insurance plan at a cost savings to the district of $233 million. Administrators said the state plan provides better benefits than the district\u2019s current plan. A switch would have to be voted on and approved by a majority of the district\u2019s 10,000 employees;\n\nCutting all retirees\u2019 benefits in 2020, reducing the district\u2019s debt by $255 million;\n\nCutting district spouses from the plan, at a cost savings of $166 million\n\nBoard members questioned how the changes would affect teacher recruitment, how retirees would be impacted, and whether other options exist.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be crystal clear that this board will not kick the can down the road,\u201d said board member Kevin Woods.\n\nDaisy Cleaves, outgoing president of the 8,000-member Shelby County\u2019s Retired Teachers Association, said she was pleased that the latest proposed cuts aren\u2019t as drastic as earlier proposals that would have reduced the district\u2019s contribution to retirees\u2019 premium by almost 50 percent. She also noted that district administrators and board members recently have been more communicative with her and other association members about the challenges and options faced by the district.\n\n\u201cAt least they know that we\u2019re here and alive and we\u2019re going to fight,\u201d she said.\n\nMonday\u2019s meeting was informational and did not include public comment. Public hearings on the issue will be scheduled.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chalkbeat", "description": "Calling retiree health benefits \u201ca huge gorilla around our neck,\u201d Shelby County School leaders discuss options to reduce the district\u2019s swelling $1.5 billion liability.", "title": "Shelby County school board hears options for addressing ballooning retiree benefits liability", "url": "http://www.chalkbeat.org/posts/tn/2015/06/15/shelby-county-school-board-hears-options-for-addressing-ballooning-retiree-benefits-liability/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_1516.jpg?fit=1200%2C800", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-16T04:23:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T04:05:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.chalkbeat.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMG_1516.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Shelby County Schools Human Resources Director Trinette C.
