That\u2019s the very definition of paternalism.\n\nLastly, deception. The essence of the entitlement state is government giving away free stuff. Hence Obamacare would provide insurance for 30 million uninsured, while giving everybody tons of free medical services \u2014 without adding \u201cone dime to our deficits,\u201d promised Obama. This being inherently impossible, there had to be a catch. Now we know it: hidden subsidies. Toss millions of the insured off their plans and onto the Obamacare \u201cexchanges\u201d where they would be forced into more expensive insurance packed with coverage they don\u2019t want and don\u2019t need \u2014 so that the overcharge can be used to subsidize others.\n\nThe reaction to the incompetence, arrogance, and deception has ranged from ridicule to anger.

The more likely scenario, however, is that Obamacare does fail. It either fails politically, renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of Democrats. Or it succumbs to the financial complications (the insurance \u201cdeath spiral\u201d) of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it.\n\nIf it does fail, the effect will be historic.
