In typical Obama Administration fashion, the so-called \u201cforum\u201d is by invitation only. HHS has also not been transparent about how who is invited and only Thursday morning released the details on the panel speakers to the public.\n\nThe reality is that the rising cost of health care is an important and relevant issue that affects the lives of every American. And as HHS readily admits, this is a \u201cmulti-faceted problem with no one solution.\u201d\n\nIf we are going to have a meaningful conversation about the total cost of health care, then we must look at what is really driving the rising insurance costs that are hurting families in every state across the country.\n\nAccording to a study released this week by Avalere, the causes of health insurance premium increases in 2016 largely mirror the distribution of health care spending in the individual and small group market, with hospital and physician spending being the largest drivers of growth. The analysis also finds that premium increases for 2016 do not point to prescription drugs as having any sort of significant impact on premiums.\n\nIf the Obama Administration truly wants to address the heart of the issue of rising health care costs, why wouldn\u2019t they use this forum as an opportunity to take a look at every angle and hear from every voice on this issue?\n\nDespite promises from President Obama to keep health insurance companies \u201chonest\u201d and \u201caccountable,\u201d we continue to see the insurers padding profits and canceling coverage for the sick under Obamacare.\n\nFriday\u2019s forum is the latest example of the established coziness between the Obama Administration and health insurers. Even the New York Times has noted the relationship between insurers and the Administration has evolved \u201cinto a powerful, mutually beneficial partnership that has been a boon to the nation\u2019s largest private health plans.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the relationship between the government and insurers is so close that the Obama Administration is hiring directly from within the health insurance industry. Consider Andy Slavitt, a former executive at United Health. In July 2015, Slavitt was nominated to be Administrator at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) after a UnitedHealth group, called Optum, worked to help the Obama Administration repair the technical glitches of HealthCare.gov in the months after its launch.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Marilyn Tavenner, the former head of CMS, who led the Administration\u2019s efforts to enact Obamacare and was responsible for HealthCare.gov. In July 2015, Tavenner became the top lobbyist for the nation\u2019s health insurance industry as the new president and CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP). In her new position, Tavenner\u2019s duties include negotiating with Congress regarding the future of Obamacare from the voice of insurers. Many criticized the appointment, including Sen. John Barasso (R-WY), who said it shows how Obamacare has created a cozy and profitable relationship for some.\n\nIn another example, Joel Ario, the former Director of health insurance exchanges at HHS resigned in August 2011 to become Managing Director of Manatt Health Solutions, a Washington, D.C. firm that advises numerous health insurance companies. And Steve Larsen, who was running a key part of health reform as former head of HHS\u2019 Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, stepped down in June 2012 to go to work for Optum, the subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Larsen\u2019s involvement in approving UnitedHealth\u2019s government contract for QSSI later came under congressional scrutiny based on potential conflicts of interest surrounding the deal. QSSI is a technology company that was hired to build the federal insurance exchange where UnitedHealth competes with other insurance plans to sign up new enrollees.\n\nAs the revolving door keeps spinning and the alliance between the health insurance industry and the Obama Administration grows deeper, health care costs continue to rise and the real losers in the equation are consumers. Meanwhile, HHS is actively working to pile all of the blame on pharmaceutical companies for rising health care costs, which is the obvious objective of the forum this Friday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In another example of the Obama Administrations Friday afternoon news dump, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is holding what they call a Pharmaceutical Forum on November 20, the Friday before the Thanksgiving holiday..05/27/2016 1:53:49AM EST.", "author": "David Williams", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "In another example of the Obama Administrations Friday afternoon news dump, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is holding what they call a Pharmaceutical Forum on November 20, the Friday before the Thanksgiving holiday.", "title": "David Williams - The Deep, Complicated, and Expensive Web of Obamacare and Insurers", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/davidwilliams/2015/11/19/draft-n2082964", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/63/2015-03-05T011923Z_3_LYNXMPEB230Q5_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "In another example of the Obama Administrations Friday afternoon news dump, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is holding what they call a Pharmaceutical Forum on November 20, the Friday before the Thanksgiving holiday.", "title": "David Williams - The Deep, Complicated, and Expensive Web of Obamacare and Insurers", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/davidwilliams/2015/11/19/draft-n2082964", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/63/2015-03-05T011923Z_3_LYNXMPEB230Q5_RTROPTP_3_USA-COURT-HEALTHCARE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Deep, Complicated, and Expensive Web of Obamacare and Insurers, David Williams, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In July 2015, Tavenner became the top lobbyist for the nation\u2019s health insurance industry as the new president and CEO of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP).\nFriday\u2019s forum is the latest example of the established coziness between the Obama Administration and health insurers.\nThe reality is that the rising cost of health care is an important and relevant issue that affects the lives of every American.\nDespite promises from President Obama to keep health insurance companies \u201chonest\u201d and \u201caccountable,\u201d we continue to see the insurers padding profits and canceling coverage for the sick under Obamacare.\nIn her new position, Tavenner\u2019s duties include negotiating with Congress regarding the future of Obamacare from the voice of insurers."}
