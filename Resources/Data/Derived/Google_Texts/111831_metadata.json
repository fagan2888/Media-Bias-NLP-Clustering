More specifically in Pacific Beach. Okay, in Crown Point, if you must know. Happy now? He was once known as a \"somewhat popular blogger\" back when blogs were a 'thing'. He is writing the Great American Novel, minus the 'great' part.\n\nSen. John Thune (R)\n\nAre you familiar with Senator John Thune of South Dakota?\n\nOf course you are not.\n\nFirst of all, he is from South Dakota, a state you last randomly thought about [looks at watch, does some quick mental calculations, consults calendar] never.\n\nSecondly, he has been in the Senate since 2004, \u2014 preceded by six years in the House \u2014 with no major legislative accomplishments to his name, although I assume he has amassed quite the collection of \u201cParticipant\u201d ribbons in his trophy case just for showing up to vote.\n\nOccasionally you\u2019ll hear Thune\u2019s name pop up as a possible Presidential or Vice Presidential nominee, with him often being described as an \u201cattractive candidate,\u201d presumably because he has the bland good looks of a Montgomery Wards shirt and tie model circa 1967. Other than that, he smiles for the camera and stays out of the way of Tea Party arriviste Ted Cruz and surly middle school libertarian club president Rand Paul, trampling each other for a chance to bring the country back to its Constitutional origins \u2014 by which they mean when blacks were slaves and not presidents.\n\nUnfortunately for Thune, his career plan of remaining that guy you went to high school with whose name you don\u2019t remember \u2014 but he seemed kind of nice \u2014 took a turn for the dumb today because an intern left Thune\u2019s Twitter account open on a laptop and John decided to Twitter-twat something out to the folks back home on their kerosene-powered \u201cnew-fangled computer machines.\u201d\n\nThe guy Politico called \u201cA gaffe-free spokesman for Republicans\u201d wrote this:\n\nSix million people risk losing their health care subsidies, yet @POTUS continues to deny that Obamacare is bad for the American people. \u2014 Senator John Thune (@SenJohnThune) June 8, 2015\n\nSix million people have insurance today through the Affordable Care Act because of subsidies from \u2014 in Duggar buddy Mike Huckabee\u2019s term \u201cUncle Sugar\u201d \u2014 that they otherwise would not have. Those subsidies, as well as the underlying structure of the ACA, could collapse depending on how the Supreme Court decides King v. Burwell.\n\nDid I mention that these people pitched in to gut the ACA?\n\nSo , essentially, POTUS (the black guy) gave these people a life raft, Republicans are trying to take a knife to it in the middle of the ocean, and Thune wants to blame Obama if they drown.\n\nIs Thune evil, stupid, or mendacious?\n\nMagic 8-ball says: \u201cHe\u2019s dick.\u201d\n\nSo we\u2019ll go with all three, just to be safe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thune-copy-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "GOP Sen.
