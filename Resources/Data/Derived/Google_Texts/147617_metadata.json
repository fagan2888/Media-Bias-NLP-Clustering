And by publicly ruling out the possibility of deploying U.S. ground troops or substantially widening the war effect, Obama\u2019s relatively minimalist strategy has little chance of succeeding anytime soon \u2013 while opening the door to the spread of ISIS influence in other parts of the region.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\nMax Boot says his plan for defeating ISIS would cost $10 billion a year. But other experts warn the cost could go much higher \u2013 in the $15 billion to $20 billion a year range. Higher defense costs could squeeze out other domestic programs, including badly needed investments in infrastructure. These costs would also mean a higher national debt and more government borrowing.\n\nSo what to do? While many are taking pot shots at the president\u2019s approach, few have offered a detailed prescription for turning the war effort. Max Boot, a military historian and the Jeane J. Kirkpatrick national security senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, has just outlined a comprehensive plan for defeating ISIS that goes well beyond the commitments of Obama and U.S. allies. It might best be described as the \u201cFull Monty\u201d when contrasted with the administration's more limited approach.\n\nBoot\u2019s plan, published today by Defense One, sets out ten major initiatives that he claims would turn things around \u2013 including redefining the overall mission, greatly stepping up air strikes, increasing the size of the military force and broadening military alliances with other countries and factions. It doesn\u2019t call for the immediate deployment of U.S. ground troops, but urges the president to put that option back on the table to strip ISIS of any false sense of security.\n\nRelated: Mitt Romney and GOP Want \u2018Boots on the Ground\u2019 to Fight ISIS\n\nHere, according to Boot, is what Obama needs to do to beat ISIS:\n\n1) Redefine the mission. The current goal to first \u201cdegrade\u201d ISIS forces is too nebulous, and the ultimate goal of \u201cdestroying\u201d ISIS is too ambitious. It would be far better to declare as the goal \u201cdefeating\u201d or neutralizing the Islamic jihadists to end their ability to control significant territory or attract foreign fighters.\n\n2) Intensify the airstrikes. While the Obama administration can rightfully point to the successful use of jet fighters and drones to thwart ISIS forces, the intensity and frequency of the air attacks is a mere fraction of what the U.S. did after invading Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. For example, between August 8 and Oct. 23 of this year, the U.S. conducted 632 air strikes and dropped 1,700 munitions in Iraq against ISIS forces. By comparison, U.S. aircraft flew 6,500 strike sorties and dropped 17,500 munitions in attacks against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan in a similar time frame between Oct. 7 and Dec. 23, 2001.\n\nRelated: Boehner Says Defeating ISIS Means Using Ground Troops\n\n3) Lift the prohibition on U.S. boots on the ground and allow Special Forces and forward air controllers to embed with the Free Syrian Army, Iraqi security and Kurdish peshmerga. The absence of U.S. military \u201ceyes on the ground\u201d have impaired the accuracy and effectiveness of air strikes and to improve the combat capacity of U.S. proxies.\n\n4) Increase the size of the U.S. force. Actual military requirements \u2013 and not the arbitrary numbers dreamed up in Washington - should dictate the shape and size of the military force ultimately dispatched. The current total of 2,900, is inadequate. The actual need, according to military experts, probably ranges from 10,000 to 25,000 \u2013 and should include Special Forces teams and forward controllers.\n\n5) Work with all of Iraq\u2019s and Syria\u2019s moderate factions. The U.S. should work with the peshmerga, Sunni tribes, the Free Syrian Army, and elements of the Iraqi security forces (ISF) that have not been overtaken by Iran\u2019s Quds Force, rather than simply supplying weapons to the ISF. \u201cGiven Shiite militia infiltration, working exclusively through the ISF would risk empowering the Shiite sectarians whose attacks on Sunnis are ISIS\u2019 best recruiter,\u201d Boot said.\n\n6) Send in the Joint Special Operations Command. The JSOC, largely composed of units such as Seal Team Six and Delta Force, became skilled at targeting the networks of al-Qaeda in Iraq between 2003 and 2010. It was so effective because of its ability to gather intelligence by interrogating prisoners and scooping up computers and documents\u2014something that bombing alone cannot accomplish.\n\nRelated: ISIS Beheads Another American as 60 New Terror Groups Join\n\n7) Draw Turkey into the war. This is easier said than done, but President Obama should do what he can to increase Turkey\u2019s involvement in the anti-ISIS campaign. If the Turkish army were to roll across the frontier, it could push back ISIS and establish \u201csafe zones\u201d for more moderate Syrian opposition members.\n\n8) Impose a no-fly zone over part or all of Syria. While U.S. aircraft are flying over Syria, they are not bombing the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. This has led to a widespread suspicion among Sunnis that the United States is now willing to keep Assad in power \u2013 and more broadly accommodate Assad\u2019s backers in Tehran. \u201cA no-fly zone over part or all of Syria would address these concerns and pave the way for greater Turkish involvement,\u201d according to Boot.\n\n9) Mobilize Sunni tribes. So long as the Sunni tribes of Iraq and Syria continue to tacitly support ISIS, defeating ISIS will be almost impossible. But if the tribes turn against ISIS, as they did against al-Qaeda in Iraq in 2007, a rapid reversal of fortunes is likely.\n\n10) Prepare now for nation-building. The United States should lay the groundwork for a post-conflict settlement in both Iraq and Syria that does not necessarily require keeping both political entities intact. In Iraq, for example, that might mean offering greater autonomy to the Sunnis and guaranteeing the Kurds that their hard-won gains will not be jeopardized.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There\u2019s a growing sentiment in Washington that President Obama\u2019s plan to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d ISIS is not working, and that much more needs to be done.
