So it was a surprise to walk into Gillette Stadium and find no tarp on the field.\n\nBased on ESPN live shots and a time-stamped photo on NFL.com at 9:37 a.m., the field wasn\u2019t covered in the hours leading up to the 2:25 p.m. MT kickoff. The league office directed questions regarding the lack of tarp to the Patriots.\n\n\n\nThe explanation from a team official? The wind. It was blowing too hard, which would prevent the tarp from staying down even if sandbags, like they use in baseball, were employed.\n\nAs a result, a plow-equipped tractor pushed snow off with vertical laps down the field, while five employees used leaf blowers to clear the surface horizontally. They were still using the leaf blowers as a handful of Broncos players began going through drills.\n\nThe tractor and leaf blowers sprayed the black rubber pellets \u2014 turf bugs some athletes call them \u2014 throughout the field turf. Because this is a rivalry game, no element goes unnoticed. Will it create an advantage one way or the other? The players will ultimately provide the answer when asked afterward.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Denver Broncos,field turf,New England Patriots,tarp", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "The field wasn't covered in the hours leading up to the 2:25 p.m. MT kickoff of Broncos vs. Patriots.", "title": "Wind prevents tarping of Gillette Stadium field", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/02/wind-prevents-tarping-gillette-stadium-field/30713/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/11/458290884-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The field wasn't covered in the hours leading up to the 2:25 p.m. MT kickoff of Broncos vs. Patriots.", "creator": "@troyrenck", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/02/wind-prevents-tarping-gillette-stadium-field/30713/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/11/458290884-495x330.jpg", "title": "Wind prevents tarping of Gillette Stadium field", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The field wasn't covered in the hours leading up to the 2:25 p.m. MT kickoff of Broncos vs. Patriots."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04dc\"", "article_summary": "The tractor and leaf blowers sprayed the black rubber pellets \u2014 turf bugs some athletes call them \u2014 throughout the field turf.\nSo it was a surprise to walk into Gillette Stadium and find no tarp on the field.\nThey were still using the leaf blowers as a handful of Broncos players began going through drills.\nAs a result, a plow-equipped tractor pushed snow off with vertical laps down the field, while five employees used leaf blowers to clear the surface horizontally.\nBased on ESPN live shots and a time-stamped photo on NFL.com at 9:37 a.m., the field wasn\u2019t covered in the hours leading up to the 2:25 p.m. MT kickoff."}
