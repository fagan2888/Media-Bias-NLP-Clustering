The AHI describes its signature social event as a night for \u201cmembers of Congress and their staff \u2014 as well as friends of the animal health community \u2014 to gather to celebrate America\u2019s pets.\u201d Held in the ornate Caucus Room of the Cannon House Office Building, the party receives high marks from D.C. society columnists for its classy setting, loaded double bar and zoological star power. Recent guests of honor include the cat Lord Tubbington from \u201cGlee\u201d and the French bulldog from the Robert Downey Jr. buddy-flick bomb \u201cDue Date.\u201d\n\nAs the AHI tells it, these animal celebrities \u201cbring awareness to the connection between animal health and human health.\u201d In this way the evening functions as an extension of AHI\u2019s public relations campaign in defense of the factory farm system and the drugs it requires to function. Most people have never heard of that campaign, which is named \u201cHealthy People, Healthy Animals, Healthy Planet.\u201d But it\u2019s well known in the worlds of Big Ag, Big Pharma, and PR. In 2009, not long after Celebrity Pet Night featured Sprinkles the cat from \u201cThe Office,\u201d the League of American Communications Professionals awarded AHI\u2019s campaign its Magellan Award for \u201cbest community relations campaign under $1 billion.\u201d\n\nAmong independent experts who study the links between animal and human health, the AHI campaign doesn\u2019t evoke Magellan so much as Orwell.\n\nThere is a near consensus among public health experts that the bulk antibiotics produced by AHI\u2019s member companies are accelerating the approach of a post-antibiotics nightmare scenario, in which superbugs routinely emerge from our farms and wreak havoc on a human population living among the ruins of modern medicine. The bloc of skeptics who view AHI\u2019s mission with mounting anxiety includes Pet Night party poopers like the World Health Organization and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Not long ago these authorities joined the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics in pressing their concerns on Congress in the form of a letter. \u201cThe evidence is so strong of a link between misuse of antibiotics in food animals and human antibiotic resistance,\u201d it stated, \u201cthat FDA and Congress should be acting much more boldly and urgently to protect these vital drugs for human illness. Overuse and misuse of important antibiotics in food animals must end.\u201d\n\nEven before getting to the relationship between animal antibiotics and human health, the very need for bulk drugs in factory farms points to the inherent unhealthiness of penning industrial numbers of pigs, cows and chickens in filthy, high-density and stressful conditions. \u201cIf your production system makes animals sick in a predictable manner, then that system is broken,\u201d says Lance Price, an epidemiologist at George Washington University who studies the spread of foodborne bacteria. Price is at the forefront of researchers whose work is illuminating how Big Ag\u2019s answer to its own brokenness \u2014 sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics mixed in with daily feed \u2014 is fueling the spread of treatment-resistant bacteria through meat and produce tainted by bug-infused feces and fertilizer. Superbugs can also leave farms through the soil, air and water, threatening everybody, irrespective of their diet.\n\nIn recent years, a series of pathogenic outbreaks has generated loudening public chatter about agricultural antibiotics. The problem boils down to simple evolution: we are assisting in the mutation of bacterial defenses that make them resistant to our antibiotics.\n\n\u201cAnimals are crowded together in very dirty conditions and fed low dose antibiotics that eliminate susceptible bugs in the environment, but allow those that have developed resistance through spontaneous mutation to thrive,\u201d says Robert Lawrence, a professor of environmental health science at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \u201cBefore you know it, you have situations like Foster Farms.\u201d\n\nOver the last few months, chickens harvested at the high-density pens of Foster Farms in California have sickened nearly 400 people with a new strain of antibiotic-resistant salmonella known as Heidelberg. The rate of hospitalizations has been twice the norm. \u201cThis is just the latest example of the enormity of the problem,\u201d says Lawrence, who co-authored a multi-year study of foodborne bacteria for Johns Hopkins. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do something, we\u2019ll find ourselves back in the era where young people died of pneumonia. Industrial farming has created a perfect storm.\u201d\n\n*\n\nGovernment scientists first reported this storm as a radar blip in 1977. That was the year FDA scientists posted a formal notice in the federal register announcing they would hold hearings on the safety of agricultural antibiotics. If the meat and pharmaceutical industries could not prove during these hearings that the drugs posed no danger to public health, the FDA\u2019s charter required that the agency pull their licenses. The makers and users of bulk animal drugs did not like this. Big Ag and Big Pharma successfully lobbied to delay the hearings, arguing more research was needed. Thirty-six years later, those hearings have still not taken place. With government action held in check, the market for agricultural antibiotics ballooned. It is now a $13 billion trade accounting for 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in the U.S. (The human market, which has its own overuse problem contributing to antibiotic resistance, has held steady over the last decade.)\n\nThe scientific literature, meanwhile, has deepened in favor of the disco-era FDA whistleblowers. In recent years, studies have offered stronger evidence linking human cases of resistant E. coli and Salmonella to industrialized poultry and cattle farms. Among the findings of these studies is that bacteria are fast and fluid \u201clearners.\u201d Repeated exposure to one antibiotic quickly helps the resistant bacteria develop a gene mutation that provides resistance assistance to other classes of antibiotics. When mutations knock down our first line of antibiotic defense, the second and third sometimes fall, too, like dominoes. What worries observers is the lack of anything solid behind them. The development of new fourth- and fifth-line defenses has sputtered and stalled. Between 1982 and 1986, there were 16 new antibiotics brought to market. In 2008 and 2009, two new antibiotics were introduced. None of the treatments in development are effective against the kinds of highly adaptive germs (known as \u201cgram-negative\u201d) that make up a growing percentage of infections.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and \u201990s, the public health and scientific communities sounded their tocsins against a background of regulatory and political crickets. As evidence mounted that more pathogens were moving from factory farms to the human population, industry held the line against FDA hearings, often relying on friendly former executives ensconced high up in relevant government agencies. (As Mark Bittman noted last week, the FDA\u2019s current deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine is an ex-Monsanto executive.) The makers and users of animal antibiotics claimed, and continue to claim, that their science is sounder, and shows the drugs to be safe. They also maintain that their routine administration is essential to feeding the world at an affordable price. Yet when Denmark became the first country to strictly regulate agricultural antibiotics in the mid-1990s, its animal food industries not only didn\u2019t collapse, they saw benefits. The American National Academy of Sciences has estimated that similar reform in the U.S. would cost the average American grocery shopper between $5 and $10 annually.\n\nLast spring, word leaked that the FDA was preparing to act, at long last. But it soon became clear the regulations would amount to the thinnest of gruels. The proposed regime would discourage the use of certain antibiotics for growth-promotion purposes while allowing for the continued use of bulk antibiotics to prevent illness in healthy animals. What\u2019s more, these new guidelines, written with the cooperation of the affected companies, were just suggestions. They would arrive with no enforcement mechanism or penalties attached.\n\nThe new guidelines, known as Final Guidance 213, were officially released two weeks ago, just in time for Christmas.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirteen is an early holiday gift to industry,\u201d says Avinash Kar, a health attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \u201cThe FDA has essentially followed a voluntary approach for more than 35 years, but use of these drugs to raise animals has increased. There\u2019s no reason why voluntary recommendations will make a difference now, especially when FDA\u2019s policy covers only some of the many uses of antibiotics on animals that are not sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe effect will be to change the label, not the practice,\u201d says Kar\u2019s colleague Jonathan Kaplan, director of the NRDC\u2019s Food and Agriculture programs. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the agencies are extremely reluctant to challenge two of the most powerful lobbies in the country. Unwilling to pick that fight, they\u2019re trying to make progress with things like this voluntary system.\u201d\n\nMeat and vet pharma trade groups \u2014 who were alone among \u201cstakeholders\u201d in having advance notice of the exact timing of the official announcement \u2014 were ready with press releases. The National Chicken Council hailed the agency\u2019s \u201copen and collaborative process.\u201d In a press call organized by the Animal Health Institute, a rep from the National Pork Producers praised the FDA\u2019s sensitivities to the concerns of \u201cimpacted industries,\u201d though she declined to guess whether or how the new limits would actually reduce the use of farm antibiotics. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus on numbers,\u201d she said. Ron Phillips, the AHI\u2019s vice president for legislative and public affairs, lauded what he called the \u201corderly change\u201d brought about by the government\u2019s light touch. \u201cOne of the reasons that we have cooperated with the FDA,\u201d said Phillips, \u201cis because it\u2019s a regulatory approach, not a legislative one, and we hope to avoid the negative consequences of the sudden action [taken] in Europe.\u201d\n\nIf anything frightens the AHI\u2019s member companies, it\u2019s the strict mandatory regulations adopted by Denmark and now being considered throughout Europe. They dismiss the Danish approach as \u201cpolitically driven\u201d and say it has shown no benefit to human health. One AHI press release bemoans that the Danish law has led to an increase in \u201canimal sickness, suffering, and death.\u201d Leaving aside the spectacle of the Lords of Factory Farming wringing their hands over animal suffering and death, the World Health Organization has found much to recommend in the Danish approach. Which right now is the exact opposite of the American approach.\n\n*\n\n\u201cWe woke up a sleeping dragon over decades of overusing antibiotics,\u201d says Jason Newland, head of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cThe bacteria have had the same genetic material for eons, but these [resistant] genes were turned off. When someone is trying to kill them, they turn those suckers on. In 1965, we didn\u2019t see ceftriaxone-resistant E coli. Now we do. Because we started using antibiotics like crazy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Science only gets clearer: Factory farms are accelerating an antibiotics nightmare.
