You don \u2018t feel well, you\u2019re in an emotional turmoil, you can\u2019t think straight. To make matters worse, when the physician is taking a medical history and physical exam either in his office or in the hospital, he has his back to you most of the visit while he looks at the computer. The electronic medical record has shifted focus of the physician\u2019s attention on the computer rather than you, the patient.\n\nMichele Ross is fed up with the lack of doctors\u2019 personal skills. She receives her healthcare at a clinic and sees a different doctor each time. \u201cMany of the doctors just sit behind the laptop, don\u2019t make eye contact, and even forget to physically examine me when I complain of something,\u201d says Ms. Ross. \u201cThe whole point of a doctor visit is physical interaction. Otherwise, I\u2019d just use telemedicine. I\u2019m an educated woman and can use the Internet to self-diagnose. I depend on the doctor to use his judgment to confirm what is wrong and the best way to treat. Laptops and tablets should be banned from use during visits.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2014 Northwestern University study published in the International Journal of Medical Informatics, doctors who use electronic health records in the exam room spend about a third of their visits looking at a computer screen.\n\n\u201cMy worry has been for some years that the patient has become a mere icon\u2026the real patient is in the computer,\u201d says Abraham Verghese, M.D Verghese, the best-selling author of the book Cutting for Stone and a professor in the Department of Medicine at Stanford University).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve actually coined a term for that entity in the computer\u2013I call it the I-patient. Like your I-phone or your I-pad. The I-patient gets wonderful care all across America. The real patient often wonders, \u2018Where in hell is everyone? When are they going to tell me anything? What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Verghese believes physicians have been railroaded into a kind of care that\u2019s very technological, very expensive, and very unsatisfactory.\n\nCarole Leiberman, a Beverly Hills psychiatrist, argues doctors have become slaves to insurance companies and Obamacare, which require more bureaucratic paperwork than ever, causing more clicking than caring.\n\n\u201cTechnology has done more to ruin health care than to improve it,\u201d says Ms. Lieberman. \u201cThe close doctor-patient relationship, necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment, has become a distant doctor-computer-patient relationship. The friendly old family doctor, who once made house calls, has been replaced by a cold computer-obsessed doctor who doesn\u2019t even make eye contact. If a patient doesn\u2019t feel a connection to his doctor that encourages him to confide, and the doctor doesn\u2019t have time to ask enough questions about the patient\u2019s lifestyle, symptoms, and so on, then the proper diagnosis can\u2019t be made, and the proper treatment can\u2019t be prescribed.\u201d\n\nDespite that dire diagnosis, Mr. Verghese is optimistic. He sees that the young people who are going into medicine today are much more idealistic and they want to try to change the system. \u201cI am delighted that those who are going into medicine are doing so for the right reasons,\u201d he says. They recognize that if it\u2019s money they want to make, there are better ways to do that.\n\nMr. Verghese hopes the pendulum will swing back to the way it should be. \u201cTo me medicine is timeless and unchanging. The patient/physician relationship is sacred and unchanging,\u201d he says. \u201cThe unfortunate things that are happening in medicine will never alter the fundamental values of medicine.\u201d\n\nMichael Murphy, MD, CEO of ScribeAmerica, is banking on the premise that scribes, who collect and enter data, will be an essential part of our future healthcare team. \u201cDoctors can\u2019t continue to be data-entry clerks as it is hurting patient care and doctor/patient relationships,\u201d says Mr. Murphy. \u201cAt the end of the day, medical scribes are going to be the standard in healthcare and they will be part of the team: a physician, nurse, tech, and a medical scribe. As the EMR, federal, and insurance regulations continue to impact physician productivity, the need for assisted documentation will grow.\u201d\n\nPlease read Dr. Marc Siegel on the slow death of the doctor-patient relationship", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "Judy Mandell", "sailthru.author": "Judy Mandell", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-166789524.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-166789524.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "doctors, Healthcare technology, medicine, obsBusiness & Tech", "sailthru.section": "Business & Tech", "keywords": "doctors, healthcare technology, medicine, abraham verghese, scribeamerica, telemedicine,bedside manner, fixation on computers, doctor patient relationship, carole leiberman, cutting for stone,", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-166789524.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%, Abraham Verghese, ScribeAmerica, telemedicine, bedside manner, fixation on computers, doctor patient relationship, Carole Leiberman, Cutting for Stone,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Why Your Doctor Won\u2019t Even Look You in the Eyes", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "judy-mandell", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/gettyimages-166789524.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "Laptops and tablets should be banned from use during visits with patients.", "sailthru.byline_avatar_url": "http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=132", "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Politics, Culture, Art, Style, Real Estate, Movie Reviews, TV recaps", "fb": {"app_id": 132947390197809}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newyorkobserver-2014/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "F8C89E25D5233224541B1BB9B10BF573", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newyorkobserver", "published_time": "2015-08-10T11:37:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T21:52:40+00:00", "author": "http://observer.com/author/judy-mandell"}, "sailthru.description": "When you're sick, you face formidable problems.
