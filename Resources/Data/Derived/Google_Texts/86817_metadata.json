Increased efficiency would save money\u2014freeing up dollars that the Pentagon could plow back into rebuilding the capacity and capabilities needed to defend the country.\n\nSadly, talk about how to do this always starts in the wrong place. Some want to just shutter bases\u2014a process that can cost as much as it saves. Others harp on acquisition reform\u2014but that\u2019s a heavy, complicated lift that takes time. Congress and the executive branch also have a long track record of getting reform wrong.\n\nSo where should the next administration focus its attention to wring savings from and for defense? For its first few years in office, at least, the best answer is: consistent use of Performance Based Logistics.\n\nTo get the Pentagon running right, it is essential to sequence reforms properly, building on them systematically. In the long run, that approach will yield greater savings and wreak less havoc than embarking on \u201ctrophy hunts\u201d that garner headlines by slashing budgets, canceling programs and shutting down headquarters.\n\nAs Secretary of Defense, Bob Gates offered an object lesson in stupid management, engineering some $400 billion in cuts and calling them savings and efficiencies. In retrospect, the nicest words to be said about the Gates era is that his plan for higher \u201cfuture\u201d budgets, which was utterly ignored, was probably as low as defense spending should have gone. The recently released National Defense Panel report reaffirms that judgment.\n\nLikewise, big bloated bills from the Congress don\u2019t help much. For example, the Levin-McCain Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 was supposed to make everything way better. Good luck finding a quorum in Congress, the Pentagon, or the defense-industry community who would agree that, more than a half decade later, the acquisitions process is much improved.\n\nWhat just might work for the next team is to start by lining up competent leadership and sound processes for running the puzzle palace better. That effort might start with a management structure that would rationalize the operation and maintenance of all the Pentagon\u2019s real-estate holdings and facilities. There is also the need to rightsize the Pentagon\u2019s massive civilian workforce. Both initiatives can begin while leadership gears up to tackle the really heavy-duty reform challenges like military compensation and acquisition reform.\n\nIn the meanwhile, however, the Pentagon can start saving money by moving toward Performance Based Logistic practices in a consistent and disciplined manner. By one estimate, performance-based logistics could save the military $25-$30 billion a year.\n\nRather than focus on what the Pentagon buys, logistics focuses on how it sustains stuff\u2014in other words, how the military moves, fixes, supplies, repairs, maintains and fuels everything the military uses. What Performance Based Logistics accomplishes, explains defense expert Dan Goure, is craft maintenance and sustainment contracts that focus on\n\n\u201cmaximizing outcomes of interest to the customer (e.g. engine time on wing or hours of power delivered) rather than traditional maintenance measures such as the number and cost of repair activities. The company makes money by satisfying the customer\u2019s objective, generally the highest number of platforms and systems available for duty.\u201d\n\nPerformance Based Logistics is anything but a new idea. Built on proven commercial best practices, the Pentagon has toyed with the concept for over twenty years. For example, the Air Force uses it to help manage its C-17 aircraft fleet. So far, that program has yielded billions of dollars in cost savings or cost avoidance. The U.S. Navy has also used Performance Based Logistic contracts for part of its helicopter fleet.\n\nYet despite the fact that it works, Performance Based Logistics has not been systematically adopted as a best practice in defense management. The major inhibitors, Goure explains, are \u201cinstitutional resistance, an antagonistic acquisition culture, and lack of adequate training for government officials regarding the creation and maintenance\u201d contracts.\n\nTo reap the potential savings of Performance Based Logistics, all the next Pentagon team would have to do is tackle these problems systematically. All can be resolved by creating win-win, public-private partnerships that will garner the support\u2014instead of the anger\u2014of Congress.\n\nThere are several case studies that demonstrate how that strategy can work. \u201cThe example of the Letterkenny Army Depot in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania,\u201d notes Heritage Foundation defense analyst Michaela Dodge, \u201cpoints to an additional benefit of performance-based logistics\u2014building and advancing relationships between contractor employees and public staffers. Both can cooperate in a manner that is effective and mutually beneficial.\u201d\n\nAs Robert Willits, a union steward at Letterkenny, explained:\n\n\u201cThe depot and the contractor managers coordinate things effectively so that the depot managers can instruct their employees and contractor managers can instruct their employees in a way that avoids confusions, and I have been here for almost four years and have yet to run into a conflict in this area.\u201d\n\nThe contract works because, as Dodge notes, \u201cprivate contractors have an interest in building good relationships with public employees at the depot.\u201d This kind of cooperation in turn makes lawmakers happy, because the depot creates jobs, and contented workers in their district make for happy voters. Other members of Congress are happy, because the partnership is making the Pentagon work better.\n\nPerformance Based Logistics is not a silver bullet. It can\u2019t reduce all the waste in the Pentagon. But a consistent commitment to the practice would demonstrate that the administration is really interested in making the Pentagon work better\u2014not just in cutting budgets and capabilities.\n\nAs a systematic and disciplined step in running the Pentagon, it would be a very smart move for the next team to make.\n\nOriginally appeared in the National Interest.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Making defense operations more efficient is a natural common cause for Congress and the Pentagon.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Making defense operations more efficient is a natural common cause for Congress and the Pentagon.", "title": "Implementing This Reform Could Help Ax Waste at the Pentagon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/xnaphotos455292.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-14T11:30:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ws1oIL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Making defense operations more efficient is a natural common cause for Congress and the Pentagon.", "creator": "@JJCarafano", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/xnaphotos455292.jpg"}, "title": "Implementing This Reform Could Help Ax Waste at the Pentagon", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "homeland", "published_time": "2014-11-16T03:01:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-14T11:30:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "efficiency, Pentagon, military"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee19\"", "article_summary": "For its first few years in office, at least, the best answer is: consistent use of Performance Based Logistics.\nBut a consistent commitment to the practice would demonstrate that the administration is really interested in making the Pentagon work better\u2014not just in cutting budgets and capabilities.\nPerformance Based Logistics is not a silver bullet.\nTo reap the potential savings of Performance Based Logistics, all the next Pentagon team would have to do is tackle these problems systematically.\nThe U.S. Navy has also used Performance Based Logistic contracts for part of its helicopter fleet."}
