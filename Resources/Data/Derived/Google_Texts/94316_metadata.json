Credit Suisse Group AG, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays PLC are the firms most cited as being a \u201ctop five\u201d broker when it comes to overall commissions.\n\nOn average, those firms were a top five destination for commission dollars for 37.6% of respondents. In last year\u2019s survey, the firms most commonly mentioned as a \u201ctop five\u201d commission destination \u2013 Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a tie between Merrill and Liquidnet \u2013 garnered 45% of the vote.\n\nCompanies like Instinet, Jefferies Group LLC, Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and Sanford C. Bernstein & co. all captured a greater piece of the pie.\n\nTABB derives its broker ranking from a survey of 108 U.S. asset managers. Institutional investors direct stock trades and commissions based both on issues directly related to trading \u2013 such as how well a brokerage firm is able to execute a trade \u2013 and as compensation for stock research.\n\nOne investment firm quoted in the TABB report, described as a \u201cmid-sized account,\u201d put it this way: \u201cOur top tier, our top 10, losing ground to our second and third tier guys, it\u2019s just flattened out a little bit more for us.\u201d\n\nThe change comes at a time when overall stock trading volumes continue to decline in the U.S. That\u2019s been a source of pain for brokerages who execute trades, because they collect revenue\u2014and help cover the cost of other investment-banking services\u2014through trading commissions.\n\nAs a result, the bigger banks are ceding some ground to focus their efforts on more profitable areas, said Adam Sussman, TABB\u2019s director of research.\n\n\u201cThe smaller firms\u2026 have a little bit more flexibility, or they can take a little bit more risk, in terms of throwing money after these businesses, whereas other firms can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cFirms who are providing a more niche or specific service are rising up in that ranking over the years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Among Wall Street\u2019s stock trading desks, the playing field is getting more level.", "title": "TABB: Bulge Bracket Brokers Losing Ground In Stock Trading To Smaller Houses", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/05/tabb-bulge-bracket-brokers-losing-ground-in-stock-trading-to-smaller-houses/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BU019_0305ny_P_20140305023909.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "TABB: Bulge Bracket Brokers Losing Ground In Stock Trading To Smaller Houses", "description": "Among Wall Street\u2019s stock trading desks, the playing field is getting more level.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Dan Strumpf", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Among Wall Street\u2019s stock trading desks, the playing field is getting more level.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-05T11:54:50-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/05/tabb-bulge-bracket-brokers-losing-ground-in-stock-trading-to-smaller-houses/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-17476", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Among Wall Street\u2019s stock trading desks, the playing field is getting more level.", "title": "TABB: Bulge Bracket Brokers Losing Ground In Stock Trading To Smaller Houses", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/05/tabb-bulge-bracket-brokers-losing-ground-in-stock-trading-to-smaller-houses/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BU019_0305ny_P_20140305023909.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-17476", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-05T11:54:50-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdecf7\"", "article_summary": "The research firm\u2019s survey of the top stock trading desks shows that the heavyweight investment banks continue to command the most business.\nGetty ImagesAmong Wall Street\u2019s stock trading desks, the playing field is getting more level.\n\u201cThe smaller firms\u2026 have a little bit more flexibility, or they can take a little bit more risk, in terms of throwing money after these businesses, whereas other firms can\u2019t,\u201d he said.\nOver the past year the biggest stock brokerages on Wall Street have been losing ground to smaller competitors, according to a survey of big institutional investors from TABB Group.\n\u201cFirms who are providing a more niche or specific service are rising up in that ranking over the years.\u201d"}
