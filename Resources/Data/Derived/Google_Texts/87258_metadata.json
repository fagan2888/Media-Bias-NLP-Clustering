BMC Public Health\n\nThat scientists are borrowing methods used in landscape ecology to \u201cmap\u201d smokers throughout the city might alarm some of the more paranoid denizens of Wellington, New Zealand.\n\nResearchers at the University of Otago say they\u2019ve mapped the \u201cvisibility of smoking\u201d on the streets of Wellington, observing some 2,600 townspeople in their native environments \u2014 outdoor bars and cafes. Sixteen percent of those drinking and dining al fresco, visible to scientists creeping along a nearby footpath, were seen smoking cigarettes in research vaguely reminiscent of Jane Goodall\u2019s work with chimpanzees.\n\nResearcher Amber Pearson noted in a statement on Sunday the researchers had also observed a higher rate of cigarette smoking during evening hours. Though basic, such observations might help to convince policymakers to strive to stigmatize the behavior of smoking by introducing greater restrictions.\n\n\"Smokefree outdoor areas help smokers to quit, help those who have quit to stick with it, and reduce the normalisation of smoking for children and youth,\u201d Thomson said in a statement. \u201cThey also reduce litter, water pollution and cleaning costs for local authorities and ratepayers.\u201d\n\nThe researchers pointed to evolving public health policy in Canada and the United States with regard to indoor and outdoor public smoking bans, considered among the world\u2019s toughest. Indeed, new findings published this week in the journal Tobacco Control attribute declining rates of smoking in the U.S. to lowered visibility of smoking on television.\n\nDepictions of smoking on American prime-time television have fallen markedly since 1961, says Patrick E. Jamieson, a researcher with the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania. But most interestingly, he and his colleagues found a correlation between a declining visibility of smoking on television and the consumption of cigarettes. During the past half-century, depictions of smoking on television have fallen from nearly five per hour to one every three hours or so.\n\nEven after adjusting for the effects of higher cigarette prices today, the researchers said much of the decline in smoking rates might be attributable to lowered visibility on prime time television. Present trends on American airwaves indicate further reductions in the smoking rate, as U.S. adults smoke two packs of cigarettes less, on average, every year.\n\nHowever, the continued depiction of smoking on television \u2014 though much more rare \u2014 has prevented even further declines in the overall smoking rate, the researchers added.\n\nSmoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. with 480,000 deaths from related illnesses every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSource: Jamieson, Patrick E., Romer, Daniel.
