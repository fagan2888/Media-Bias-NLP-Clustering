Noam Chomsky: Hillary Clinton like Barack Obama, only 'more militant'

President Barack Obama is “an opportunist,” and a Hillary Clinton presidency would offer pretty much the same thing, “only more militant,” said Noam Chomsky, one of the world’s most prominent public leftist intellectuals, in an interview with conservative website WND.

Chomsky, assessing Obama’s performance, said he is not disappointed by the president because he “didn’t expect anything.”

“So, I’m not one of those who was disillusioned,” he said in the interview from his office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

“I wrote about him before the primaries in 2008, simply using his Web page — the way he was presenting himself — and he seemed to me like an opportunist,” he added.

Chomsky also railed against the American health care system, calling the Affordable Care Act “a small step” forward, voicing support for a nationalized, government-paid system.

He has been vocal in his criticism of Obama’s use of drones against terrorist targets in the Middle East, saying the president “has essentially rescinded the principle that was established in the Magna Carta 800 years ago.”

In March, he told Brazilian television that the drone strikes are “the most extensive global terrorism campaign the world has yet seen.”

As to whether Hillary Clinton would be any better, Chomsky said she would be the same, “only more militant.”

Often described as the “father of modern linguistics,” Chomsky said in the interview that he had “no interest whatsoever” in the revelation that Osama bin Laden had two of his books at his compound at the time of his death.

“Why do I care what books Osama bin Laden was reading?” he asked, noting that the Al Qaeda leader had a large variety of material, including CIA publications.
