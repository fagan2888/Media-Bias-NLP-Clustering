It's been a rough week for the Obama administration, as pundits on both sides of the aisle have been lampooning the Affordable Care Act and the faulty website meant to help implement it. If the banter from conservative hosts wasn't enough, Jon Stewart and The Daily Show crew stepped up to the plate and skewered President Obama and the Democrats for rolling out a site that hardly functioned.

Then, on Wednesday's episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert took a trip to a New Jersey food kitchen to try to sign up for Obamacare in person. He turned the segment into a mini horror film that's as hilarious as it is scary.

Basically, places like food banks have been turned into beacons of hope in the Obamacare process, providing "navigators" who can help citizens sign up for the Affordable Care Act. Colbert talks to a guy who runs one of these food banks and then trolls the hell out of one of the "navigators" by overusing their safety word "pumpkin patch."

I'm a deeply religious Catholic and I don't believe in contraception. Can you guarantee me the money that I give Obamacare will not go to provide contraception for... sluts?
