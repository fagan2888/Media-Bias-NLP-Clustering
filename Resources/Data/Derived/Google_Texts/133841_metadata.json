Jeff Sessions and Rep. Mo Brooks call it a practice in double-counting to produce a better budget score. Democrats did the same thing with the Affordable Care Act in an effort to generate a budget score that didn\u2019t increase the deficit, the two Alabama Republicans claim.\n\nDuring the Obamacare debate, Democrats argued about $500 billion would be used for two things\u2014shoring up Medicare and covering the cost of the new health care law. \u201cOf course,\u201d say Sessions and Brooks, \u201cthe same dollar cannot be spent in two different places.\u201d\n\nThe Boehner-Obama budget deal would increase the debt limit by $1.5 trillion to an estimated $19.6 trillion. It also boosts spending by $80 billion beyond spending caps set in 2011.\n\nIn an effort to offset that spending, congressional leaders have pointed to future savings in the Social Security disability program. But according to Sessions and Brooks, those \u201creforms\u201d aren\u2019t actually going to save any money in the future because they\u2019re being spent today on federal government agencies.\n\n\u201cThis is not \u2018entitlement reform,\u2019 this is an accounting gimmick: any savings to be captured in the future from disability insurance are being spent instantly, today, on boosting bureaucratic budgets for federal departments like the [Environmental Protection Agency] and the Department of Labor\u2014making government bigger and more expensive,\u201d Sessions and Brooks say.\n\nPaul Winfree, director of the Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, agrees. \u201cThey\u2019re double counting the savings to Social Security,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just conservatives who are pointing out the maneuver. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, criticized the Boehner-Obama budget deal for having too many gimmicks.\n\n\u201c[T]he bill uses a pension smoothing gimmick that is little more than a timing shift and double-counts the small savings from Social Security Disability Insurance both toward sequester relief and toward improving the solvency of its trust fund,\u201d MacGuineas says.\n\nThat\u2019s not all, say Sessions and Brooks: \u201cAnother accounting trick is removing today\u2019s spending limits and then counting savings from new spending limits that are supposed to be put in place a decade from now.\u201d\n\nThe budget deal was approved by the House on a 266-167 vote Wednesday. It moves to the Senate next, where Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has vowed to filibuster the measure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That's the claim of two Republican lawmakers.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "That's the claim of two Republican lawmakers.", "title": "Budget Deal Uses Same Accounting Gimmick as Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1028obama2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-28T21:35:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1M2sxxZ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "That's the claim of two Republican lawmakers.", "title": "Budget Deal Uses Same Accounting Gimmick as Obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1028obama2.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "budget", "published_time": "2015-10-28T18:03:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-28T21:35:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Two conservative lawmakers are accusing Republican leaders of using an accounting gimmick in their budget deal\u2014a \u201ctrick\u201d that mimics a tactic Democrats employed to pass Obamacare.\nMaya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, criticized the Boehner-Obama budget deal for having too many gimmicks.\nIn an effort to offset that spending, congressional leaders have pointed to future savings in the Social Security disability program.\nSen.
