Mulcahy, director of the CMS enforcement group for Medicare Advantage and drug plans. He wrote that in a December 2013 review, CMS determined that the plan had delayed or denied some patients' access to their medications. Also, some of the HMOs' members who filed complaints or appeals faced inappropriate delays or denials of the right to access a health service, the letter said.\n\nMolina was not in charge at the time of the December audit. She was brought in by investors to turn the HMO around in January.\n\nThe accounting error, which occurred this summer, involved a duplicate listing of a capital contribution on a quarterly report to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, Molina said. \"They caught it; we didn't, unfortunately,\" she said.\n\nThe error caused the HMO to fall below the required amount in capital reserves by a small amount, which was quickly rectified, Molina said. But the damage was done.\n\n\"The state of Florida asked us to stop enrolling until they can complete an investigation of our financials to make sure everything is okay,\" Molina said. She said the review would start next week and that OIR officials would be on-site Sept. 15.\n\nOIR spokesman Harvey Bennett said the agency cannot confirm or comment on any ongoing reviews.\n\nThe enrollment freeze will have only a minor impact unless it lasts more than a month. Open-enrollment season for Medicare plans begins Oct. 15. Florida Healthcare Plus has only 11,000 members.\n\n\"We're small but we believe we can make it through this,\" Molina said.\n\nThe plan has been in trouble with CMS before, as Health News Florida reported in April. The federal agency fined the plan more than $40,000 that month for failing to notify its members in the fall of 2013 of the changes in the plan for 2014.\n\nAside from its headquarters in Miami-Dade County, Florida Healthcare Plus also has an office in Tampa.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
