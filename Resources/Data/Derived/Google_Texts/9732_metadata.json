The condition, which was made famous by Gabriel Garcia Marquez\u2019s One Hundred Years of Solitude, manifests as an inability to distinguish between edible and inedible objects. Over the past few years, the British six-year-old has worked his way through moss, rocks, and soil in his family\u2019s backyard as well as the window blinds in his bedroom. Now, his mother has raised \u00a37,100 to fortify her garden left-overs with tough artificial grass and teeth-resistant material.\n\nThe Daily Mail reports that Zach, who is also autistic, is now able to play outside without the temptation of leaves, flowers and grass. The new, safer garden was built with money his mother raised through a charity comedy night. It comes equipped with a slide, trampoline, fake grass, and a wood deck \u2013 none of which can be eaten.\n\n\u201cBefore it was slushy and muddy so we couldn\u2019t go out there, particularly as Zach is particularly keen on eating moss,\u201d Rachel Holt, Zach\u2019s mother, told reporters. \u201cIf a leaf falls down before I\u2019ve had time to get rid of it then he might try and eat that but otherwise I can feel so much happier about him being outside.\u201d\n\nThe new garden is the latest in a series of renovations designed to accommodate Zach\u2019s dietary habits. A few months ago, the family saw now choice but to remodel his bedroom after he started to eat his way through the walls. According to Holt, there\u2019s no limit to what he will try to eat.\n\n\u201cHe likes things that are textured, and moss has always been his favorite, as he can mull them around and chew on them for a while,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s very worrying for me as a parent, because you never know what kind of germs he could be taking in.\n\n\u201cBut in the garden, he can\u2019t get to the street and he\u2019s completely safe,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, various degrees of pica are observed in ten to 30 percent of children aged one to six. The disorder, which also occurs in pregnant women, has been linked to malnutrition in the form of anemia, iron deficiency, and zinc deficiency. While there is no comprehensive treatment program, cognitive therapy and certain medication may help control the symptoms.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pica, zach tahir inedible garden, zach tahir bedroom, eating moss, eating inedible objects, rachel holt, eating disorder pica", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Zach Tahir, British six-year-old who suffers from pica, is set to get a brand new backyard playground after he ate his old one.", "title": "'Pica,' Rare Disorder, Causes 6-Year-Old Zach To Eat Moss, Window Blinds", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pica-rare-disorder-causes-6-year-old-zach-eat-moss-window-blinds-gets-new-garden-because-he-ate", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/12/backyard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Zach Tahir, British six-year-old who suffers from pica, is set to get a brand new backyard playground after he ate his old one.", "title": "'Pica,' Rare Disorder, Causes 6-Year-Old Zach To Eat Moss, Window Blinds", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pica-rare-disorder-causes-6-year-old-zach-eat-moss-window-blinds-gets-new-garden-because-he-ate", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/12/backyard.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/12/backyard.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2013-09-12T17:15:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T02:24:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Zach Tahir, British six-year-old who suffers from pica, is set to get a brand new backyard playground after he ate his old one."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9bb1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBefore it was slushy and muddy so we couldn\u2019t go out there, particularly as Zach is particularly keen on eating moss,\u201d Rachel Holt, Zach\u2019s mother, told reporters.\nJack W.
