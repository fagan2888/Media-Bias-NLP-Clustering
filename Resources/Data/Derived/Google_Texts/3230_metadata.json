Congress and the president recently reached a compromise on more spending and suspended the debt ceiling. Our federal budget is $4 trillion, debt passed $19 trillion. Politicians from both parties share in fueling this fiscal crisis.\n\n\n\nDemocrats think higher taxes on the rich will solve everything. Republicans think relying on cuts to discretionary programs is the panacea. Both fall short of dealing with this fiscal crisis and, left unchecked, increase our probability of default.\n\n\n\nSeventy percent of all federal spending goes to entitlements, which are growing. Over 50 percent of the population receive some form of government benefit (Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare) and reforming these mandatory programs is political suicide because people now expect it.\n\n\n\nSen. Lankford, R-Oklahoma, published \u0093Federal Fumbles\u0094 which exposes wasteful discretionary spending that Congress can control. For example, the Department of Defense spent $43 million building a compressed natural gas station in Afghanistan that\u0092s rarely used. The DOD spent $48 million on military supplies for Yemen that never made it out of the Virginia warehouse. The National Park Service spent $65,000 to demonstrate what happens to bugs when the lights go out.\n\n\n\nTax dollars aren\u0092t free dollars. Congress must pass a constitutional amendment to limit spending to essential services and protection. Our financial crisis is too serious a matter to be left to irresponsible politicians who lack \u0093Profiles in Courage\u0094 to do the right thing.\n\n\n\nYou get what you accept.\n\n\n\nFrank Mazur\n\n\n\nSouth Burlington\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "newspaper, timesargus, montpelier, barre, vermont, election results, news, daily news, sports, obituaries, editorial, events, community, calendar, headlines, classifieds, real estate", "google-site-verification": "Gy2TvJVOPRCmiGNmQzTV43qo8_S1H7alfF6MwpfcLhM", "y_key": "a158acb4f2ab39b3", "Description": "Times Argus Online  -  Vermont news, Vermont election results, Barre News, Montpelier News, Central Vermont News, local news, Vermont government, Vermont sports, Vermont classifieds, Jobs in Vermont", "Subject": "Vermont Election News & Information"}, "article_summary": "Rising federal debt is a major threat to our country.\nOur federal budget is $4 trillion, debt passed $19 trillion.\nSeventy percent of all federal spending goes to entitlements, which are growing.\nCongress and the president recently reached a compromise on more spending and suspended the debt ceiling.\nFor example, the Department of Defense spent $43 million building a compressed natural gas station in Afghanistan that\u0092s rarely used."}
