To a lesser extent, the revision reflects profitability concerns derived from health exchange sourced membership.\n\n'Fitch expects acquisition-related leverage to transform balance sheets in 2016 as the U.S. health insurers strive to grow earnings, improve their competitive positions and cope with changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act and consolidation in the hospital and pharmaceutical industries,' said Mark Rouck, Senior Director, Health Insurance at Fitch Ratings.\n\nIn the report, Fitch discusses expectations for acquisitions expected to close in 2016 to add roughly $55 billion of new debt to acquirers' balance sheets.\n\nUnder its 'base-case' scenario Fitch projects that the aggregate debt-to-EBITDA of the nine publicly-traded health insurers it follows will increase to 3.0x in 2016 compared with 1.8x at year-end 2015. Similarly, EBITDA interest coverage is projected to deteriorate to 9.6x compared with 2015's 14.3x. EBITDA-based margins are projected to be flat at approximately 8% in 2016.\n\nFitch also notes the comparatively poor financial results emanating from many of health insurance exchanges formed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health insurers' balance sheet exposures to the ACA's risk Corridor program.\n\nNegative outlooks and watches assigned to U.S. health insurers in Fitch's coverage universe outweigh positive outlooks and watches by more than two-to-one. As a result, Fitch expects more downgrades than upgrades over the next 12 - 24 months with affirmations the most common rating action.\n\nThe full report '2016 Outlook: U.S. Health Insurance' is available at 'www.fitchratings.com.'\n\nAdditional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.\n\nApplicable Criteria and Related Research:\n\n--'Insurance Rating Methodology' (Sept. 16, 2015);\n\n--'Health Insurance and Managed Care (U.S.) Sector Credit Factors' (Jan. 21, 2015).\n\n2016 Outlook: U.S. Health Insurance (Acquisitions Are a Ratings Negative)\n\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=874985\n\nApplicable Criteria\n\nInsurance Rating Methodology (pub. 16 Sep 2015)\n\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=871172\n\nRelated Research\n\nHealth Insurance and Managed Care (U.S.) Sector Credit Factors\n\nhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=686930\n\nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
