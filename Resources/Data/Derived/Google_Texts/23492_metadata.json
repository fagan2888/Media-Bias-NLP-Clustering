He says bigger is better for consumers. It's an outrageous position for the head of an agency Californians counted on to negotiate with health plans.\n\nIn his op-ed, Lee neglected to mention that 75% of the California policies he negotiated have narrow physician networks - defined as including 25% or fewer physicians in an area. By contrast, nationally, 41% of plan networks were considered narrow.\n\nNarrow networks are the new premium hikes. Patients in them often don't get to use their health insurance because they can't get an appointment with an in-network doctor, so they have to pay out of pocket for care.\n\nPremium increases may be smaller in California, but what Californians are getting for their money is cut-rate coverage because there's so little competiton. And 44% of Covered California policyholders find it difficult to pay their monthly premiums for coverage.\n\nLee's pimping for the Big 4 health insurance companies that control 94% of the Covered California market shows how little \"negotiation\" goes on at Covered California.\n\nWhat kind of negotiator would want fewer entities to negotiate with?\n\nFour big companies constitute an oligopoly, and Californians are suffering under it.\n\nLee's shilling for the Big Four in the Journal today included misleading readers about competition in his exchange and shows that Covered California is little more than an insurance broker advocating the insurance industry's snake oil.\n\nJamie Court is a founder of www.CapitolWatchdog.org\n\nFollow Jamie Court on Twitter: www.twitter.com/RaisingHellNow\n\nFOLLOW LOS ANGELES\n\nGET THE NEWSLETTER Enter your email address to get top stories and blog posts emailed to you each day.
