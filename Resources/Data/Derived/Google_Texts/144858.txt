Republic Plaza, Denver’s tallest skyscraper, has a new co-owner.

Brookfield Office Properties said this week that it has entered into a 50-50 joint venture with MetLife to share ownership of the 56-story building. Brookfield will continue to manage and lease the property, built in 1984. The deal values the property at $480 million, and Brookfield said its net proceeds from the transaction are $98 million.

Republic Plaza, which has 1.2 million square feet of office space, is 95.2 percent leased, with its two largest tenants, Encana Corp. and DCP Midstream, occupying just under half the office tower on long-term leases.

“Republic Plaza is a trophy office tower in a core real estate market,” Robert Merck, global head of real estate for MetLife, said in a statement. “Brookfield is an experienced and successful owner and operator of office properties, and we are looking forward to expanding our partnership with them.”

MetLife, based in Manhattan, is one of the world’s largest providers of insurance, annuities and employee benefit services. Brookfield Office, also based in New York, has a portfolio of 113 properties across the globe, including 1801 California, where it recently completed a $50 million renovation.

Back in 2006, Brookfield purchased two buildings right next to Republic Plaza, including one that housed Duffy’s Shamrock Bar, a popular eatery. Brookfield at the time said it planned to build a 1,000-car parking garage, but hasn’t done so.
