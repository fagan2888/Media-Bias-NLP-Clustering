Young academics were warned that joining the field could kill their careers. And the odd study that got published went through linguistic gymnastics to hide any connection to firearms. The long stalemate continued until shortly after the December 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, when Obama announced several proposals, including reversing the CDC research ban. Done by executive order, ending the ban appeared to have broad support from a scientific community upset that gun violence as a public health problem was being ignored.\n\n\u201cA lot of people thought it would make a big difference,\u201d recalled Jeffrey Swanson, a Duke University psychiatry professor who studies gun violence and mental health. But today the CDC still avoids gun-violence research.\n\nThe roots of the ban go back to 1996, when the NRA accused the public health agency of lobbying for gun control. Wording was inserted into the CDC\u2019s appropriations bill that, \u201cNone of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control.\u201d\n\nThe CDC took this to mean it should avoid studying guns in any fashion.\n\n\u201cIt basically was a shot across the bow by Congress on the part of the NRA,\u201d said Mark Rosenberg, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Injury Control and Prevention when the ban went into effect.\n\n\u201cAll federally funded research was shut down.\u201d\n\nTimothy Wheeler, director of the group Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, said Congress had good reason to stop the CDC\u2019s firearm inquiries.\n\n\u201cIt was what we call advocacy research,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cIt was research done with a preordained goal, and that goal was gun control.\u201d\n\nBut gun deaths and injuries are a major public health problem, researchers say.\n\nMore than 100 scientists signed a 2013 letter calling on the CDC to resume research to identify effective ways of reducing gun violence.\n\n\u201cI see no upside to ignorance,\u201d said Richard Berk, a criminology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, who signed the letter.\n\nPrivate nonprofits \u2014 with some exceptions such as the Joyce Foundation \u2014 have skipped over gun-related research proposals.\n\n\u201cSponsors were spooked to fund stuff that had to do with guns,\u201d said Swanson at Duke. He said younger colleagues got the message: Studying firearms was a field without a future.\n\nThe few gun studies that received funding took steps to avoid detection. In 2011, the National Science Foundation awarded Swanson $300,000 for a study it described as \u201cTesting Competing Theories of Violence.\u201d But Swanson said the study evaluates the effectiveness of mental health firearm restrictions. He titled the same study: \u201cFirearms Laws, Mental Disorder, and Violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be optimistic,\u201d Swanson said. But, he said, the CDC needs to stop being terrified of gun research.\n\n\u201cNo one can make up the role of the CDC,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a legitimacy there that no one else can provide.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Todd C.
