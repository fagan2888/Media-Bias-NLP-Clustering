And the economy was naturally the place to start.\n\nHere is a portion of our nearly hour-long conversation.\n\nI\u2019m going to plunge right in, because one of the interesting conversations we have been having lately in Washington and around the world is about inequality. It\u2019s back again.\n\nI went back and looked at a conversation we had on this stage three years ago, and we were talking about it then. Why do you think now? Why is Thomas Piketty suddenly such a big deal?\n\nFMR. PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Well, first of all, it is severe constraint on growth for the country.\n\nAnd it is evidence of a loss of social mobility. The median real middle income, adjusted for inflation, is still slightly lower than it was the day I left office. And the cost of education and health care and other things has gone up.\n\nThe average walking-around person is having a pretty tough time. And it\u2019s also really put a crimp in the whole idea of the American dream, that, if you work hard, you can do better than your parents did.\n\nWhat we should be trying to do is make sure that we\u2019re all growing in real terms together. And having the right budget for the government and the right investment strategy is a part of it. But the end goal has got to be more vigorous job growth, a tighter labor market, which will raise incomes.\n\nI\u2019m all for these raising the minimum wage. That will help you in the bottom. And it will levitate above a little higher than the people covered by the minimum wage.\n\nGWEN IFILL: But, Mr. President, you left office 14 years ago. We\u2019re now in the second term of a Democratic president. I\u2019m just curious about why we\u2019re talking about this now. Why is inequality more on people\u2019s minds than it was during \u2014 even during the recession?\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, because I think, during the recession, if you\u2019re in the middle of the ocean, and you think you\u2019re drowning, nobody wants to have a discussion about how you should have a better swimming pool in your backyard.\n\nIn other words, I think we were just so glad the wheels didn\u2019t run off, and they could have. So, I \u2014 you know, I think it\u2019s healthy we\u2019re worried about inequity now, but we have got to figure out how to fix it.\n\nAnd how to fix it is, it\u2019s people like me, people in the upper-income groups should pay the lion\u2019s share of taxes, for the same reason Willie Sutton robbed banks. That\u2019s where the money is. And if you have prolonged inequity, you\u2019re going to concentrate wealth. And then if you have to get tax money, that\u2019s where you have to go to get the tax money.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Mr. President, you and I have been talking about health care in one form or another for 20 years probably, Hillarycare, Obamacare, you name it.\n\nSo, here we are in the middle of another midterm election, where, as far as I can tell, Democrats are running as far as possible in the opposite direction from embracing the improvements you say that the Affordable Care Act have yielded. What is your advice to them?\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, the one \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t do it, but there may be some places where the well\u2019s been so poisoned, they have to do it.\n\nWhat I think \u2014 what I advise the Democrats to do is talk about the good things that have happened under the bill, acknowledge the problems, and say, let\u2019s do what sensible people would do. We had a problem we had to deal with. Albert Einstein couldn\u2019t have done it perfectly the first time. Now let\u2019s set a long-term repair process.\n\nNobody could have done this perfectly.\n\nGWEN IFILL: It doesn\u2019t sound like much of a bumper sticker, nobody could have done this perfectly.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBILL CLINTON: Maybe, but I find people are pretty smart about it.\n\nYou know, when you remind people that you got 100 million people now who can afford insurance because their preexisting condition can\u2019t be used against them, you got 100 million people who get preventive benefits in their health insurance policies that they couldn\u2019t before, you got 3.5 million young people under 26 getting covered on their parents\u2019 policies, you have got the doughnut hole in the senior citizens\u2019 drug program has been closed \u2014 and they saved $10 billion in drug purchases already, seniors have.\n\nYou have, I think, around four million people already in the Medicaid expansion, and, eventually, these other states I think will come along. It\u2019s crazy not to do it. It\u2019s a beginning. And I think that people can handle the truth. Talk about what\u2019s good about it. Talk about the remaining problem. Commit to fix the problem. That\u2019s the best political position.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Can I ask you about a couple of issues on the foreign policy front? Because, if you were president now in the second half of your second term and you were facing down the Russian bear, and there was a humanitarian crisis in Syria, and terrorism on the rise in Nigeria, and the Middle East peace talks had just collapsed, and they were raising Benghazi again as a foreign policy issue, in what order would you try to tackle them?\n\nAnd is any of it leave room for growth or hope or possibility?\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, I don\u2019t think \u2014 Benghazi is a whole different deal.\n\nGWEN IFILL: I know, but I just threw it in there.\n\nBILL CLINTON: We did \u2014 in my opinion, Hillary did what she should have done.\n\nShe impaneled a very high-level review committee, with the immediate past chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen, who is backstage, and Tom Pickering, our state\u2019s most \u2014 I mean, our country\u2019s most distinguished senior diplomatic who has worked for more Republicans than Democrats in his life.\n\nAnd they looked into what was wrong. They gave 29 recommendations. She took them and started implementing them. And they established the fact that, whether it was right or wrong in the past, secretaries of state never were involved directly in these security decisions.\n\nAnd they also have untangled what was an early mystery at Benghazi, when all we knew was that four people were killed. And we know now two of them were heavily armed CIA contractors who were military combat veterans. And they were part of a group of 20 authorized to provide security, among other things, where they were in Benghazi.\n\nAnd it\u2019s nowhere \u2014 and the last time we had one of these things made public was when I did it after the Africa embassy bombings in 1998. And so most Americans don\u2019t even know how many American diplomatic personnel were killed when President Bush was president.\n\nThey don\u2019t know what, if any, after-action review was done, what, if any, recommendations were made, what, if any, action was taken to implement those.\n\nSo I think my advice to everybody involved is to be not defensive and realize what this is and just answer the questions.\n\nGWEN IFILL: What is it? What is it?\n\nBILL CLINTON: You just want me to get into a political fight. I\u2019m not running for anything. I\u2019m not doing that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBILL CLINTON: Now, these other things are very different.\n\nPutin wants to reestablish Russian greatness, not as the Cold War, but in 19th century empire terms. He believes Russia was badly damaged and humiliated by the collapse of communism, the end of the Warsaw Pact, the loss of control near, abroad.\n\nAnd he sees all these things in zero-sum terms. The Ukrainian reformers had a different idea. And most of the Western Ukrainians seem to agree with them. They said, you know, we really want to be friends with Russia. We want to get along with them.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t think they do, look at the map. I mean, would you want to have a healthy relationship with Russia if you were located where Ukraine is?\n\nBut they said, we want to be a bridge between Europe and Russia. And it was just outside of his imagination zone. And so we are where we are. It\u2019s not the end of the world. He invaded Georgia too and took part of that. I don\u2019t agree with this. And I think we have to be firm against it. But it\u2019s not the end of the world.\n\nGWEN IFILL: You know, I asked you about a lot of things in one question. But I guess the overarching question for all of them, all of these issues is, what does a U.S. president or a U.S. government do in these situations anymore?\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, first of all, I think what we should recognize is, we\u2019re living in a world with much more diffuse power centers, in which we\u2019re in this catch-22, because there are very few problems we can solve by ourselves and very few problems that can be solved without our involvement.\n\nSo, we\u2019re always being pressed to be more and more involved, knowing that, depending on who else goes along for the ride, we will succeed or not, and knowing that the span of our control is subject to being undermined.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Final question, depending on how you answer it. It has to do with health, but it\u2019s about your wife\u2019s health.\n\nKarl Rove asked yesterday or raised the question over the weekend, I guess, about whether Hillary Clinton is well enough to run for president in 2016, and whether in fact she had suffered a brain injury.\n\nDr. Rove wants to know as much as we do whether that\u2019s true and whether it will affect her decision-making.\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, first of all, I have got to give him credit, you know, that he \u2014 that embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBILL CLINTON: First, they said she faked her concussion, and now they say she\u2019s auditioning for a part on \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBILL CLINTON: I mean, you know, whatever it takes.\n\nLook, she works out every week. She is strong. She\u2019s doing great. As far as I can tell, she\u2019s in better shape than I am. She certainly seems to have more stamina now. And there\u2019s nothing to it.\n\nIt \u2014 it \u2014 I didn\u2019t even \u2014 I was sort of dumbfounded. They went to all this trouble to say that she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over, something she never lowballed with the American people, never tried to pretend didn\u2019t happen.\n\nNow they say she\u2019s really got brain damage.\n\nBILL CLINTON: Well, if she does, then I must be in really tough shape, because she\u2019s still quicker than I am.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGWEN IFILL: Do you think this is their way of inserting her age or her physical capabilities into the 2016 debate?\n\nBILL CLINTON: I don\u2019t know, but, if it is, you can\u2019t be too upset about it. It\u2019s just the beginning. They will get better and better at it.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBILL CLINTON: I mean, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 I\u2019m still waiting for them to admit there was nothing to Whitewater.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\nBILL CLINTON: Thank you.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGWEN IFILL: You can watch my entire conversation with President Clinton, which also touched on immigration and Democratic prospects in the midterm elections, online.
