Getting the right bacteria into babies\u2019 guts is important for their future health, and it\u2019s within the first two years that this is crucial \u2014 this time frame is when many conditions, like allergies and asthma, can be prevented. Whereas breastfeeding seems to be one way to get a healthy gut microbiota, new research from the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia shows that taking some antibiotics is not.\n\nThe research found that kids younger than 2, who were given broad-spectrum antibiotics, the kind that kills all types of bacteria, were more likely to be obese by age 5. It makes sense; their digestive tracts are sensitive during their first two years, and with a weak immune system, they develop infections in the ear or sinuses at a higher frequency. The antibiotics the doctor prescribes them with then goes on to kill some gut bacteria, causing imbalances in the variety of bacteria, and altering metabolic function.\n\nFor the study, the researchers looked at health records from over 64,000 children who went to a primary care physician within their first 24 months of life, following up with them every year until they turned 5. They found that 41 percent of the children had been exposed to the broad-spectrum antibiotics at least once, compared to 62 percent who\u2019d been exposed to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, the kind that target certain families of bacteria.\n\nWhen the children turned 5, they found that those who were treated four or more times with any kind of antibiotic were 11 percent more likely to be obese. Those treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics were even more likely, with a 16 percent higher risk. In their study, the researchers wrote that \u201crepeated use of antibiotics may have an impact on intestinal flora that alters\u201d the way energy is metabolized. They also suggest that physiological, environmental, and socioeconomic factors may also contribute to a child\u2019s obesity.\n\nThe findings support another study from last year, which found that children exposed to antibiotics had higher body mass indexes at age 7. Roughly one in five kids under 5 will be overweight or obese before they begin kindergarten, according to an Institute of Medicine report. Although it\u2019s a cause for concern, parents, and eventually the kids themselves, may be able to take steps to reduce their weight anyway. Studies have shown that gut bacteria changes with a person\u2019s diet, so it could be possible that altering a kid\u2019s diet may help the right bacteria grow.\n\nSource: Bailey LC, Forrest C, Zhang P, Richards T, Livshits A, DeRusso P.
