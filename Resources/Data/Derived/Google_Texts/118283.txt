In 2014, Montgomery County schools removed all religious references to holidays on the official calendar, in response to controversy over demands from Muslims that schools be closed on certain Islamic holidays.

Officials hoped the compromise would end the dispute, but that hasn't been the case.

Tuesday, the county board of education will set the official calendar for the next school year. The same coalition that asked for schools to close on Eid Ul-Adha the last few years is doing so again.

But with the deletion of all religious references from the calendar, the coalition is asking the board to declare that Eid Al-Udha a "professional day." That means students would not have to report to school, but teachers would.

Students in Montgomery County already get most Christian and Jewish holidays off. Two years ago, the school system tracked the absentee rate on Eid Ul-Adha to see whether it was high enough to merit it being a holiday. It was around 5 percent, which officials ruled insufficient.

Many Muslim parents argue the number isn't wholly accurate because they send their kids to class out of fear they'll fall behind on schoolwork and be punished. They say making Eid Ul-Adha a holiday — even if it isn't officially the reason — gives the Muslim community in Montgomery County a sign it is welcome.
