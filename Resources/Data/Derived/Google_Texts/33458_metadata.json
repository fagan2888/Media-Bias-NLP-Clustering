Clinton\u2019s new narrative, included in her campaign kickoff book \u201cHard Choices,\u201d attacks Republican-led investigations, praises her own response, defends President Obama\u2019s decisions and laments in a chronological account of the attack, the confusion that surrounded the incident. Not so, says America Rising.\n\nMinute-by-minute - From the soon-to-be-released America Rising book, with full footnotes at the link: \u201cOn the night of the attack, as armed assailants overran the State Department\u2019s Benghazi facility, those under assault were not only outmanned, they were left with a facility that \u2018was also severely under-resourced with regard to weapons, ammunition, [non-lethal deterrents], and fire safety equipment, including escape masks.\u2019 Both men who were killed at the State Department facility, Ambassador Stevens and Sean Smith, died of smoke inhalation, making the lack of basic security materials like escape masks even more unfortunate and disappointing in retrospect. A Libyan doctor who treated Ambassador Stevens reportedly said asphyxiation suffered from smoke inhalation was his only injury. Evacuating personnel fled to the CIA's Annex facility nearby. At 10:15 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, mortars began to hit the annex and heavy fighting began. At 10:08 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Secretary Clinton put out a written statement on the attack. In it, she assigned a motivation for the attack: anger toward \u2018inflammatory material posted on the Internet...\u2019 Secretary Clinton had already provided a suggested motive for the assailants in a statement to the press before the second attack was even over, with two of the American victims from that night still defending themselves.\u201d\n\nHillary knocks Taliban releases in new book - In excerpts of her forthcoming memoir \u201cHard Choices\u201d provided to CBS News, Clinton writes that the chief concern of the Taliban was the fate of their fighters held at Guantanamo Bay but any negotiations with the terrorist group would not sit well with the American Public. \u201cI acknowledged, as I had many times before, that opening the door to negotiations with the Taliban would be hard to swallow for many Americans after so many years of war,\u201d Clinton states.\n\nKELLY FILE: BERGDAHL PLATOON DEFENDS AGAINST TEAM OBAMA CLAIMS\n\nOn the same day that President Obama dismissed growing concerns over the deal to release five senior Islamist militant commanders from U.S. custody in exchange for one American hostage accused of deserting his platoon, six soldiers who served alongside Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in Afghanistan denounced claims that their criticism of the deal was politically motivated. Appearing on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d the men expressed anger, sadness and outrage over the alleged desertion, the deal to free him and the heroic treatment he received from the Obama administration. In a stark moment, anchor Megyn Kelly asked if they thought Bergdahl was a deserter, and all six men silently raised their hands. The veterans also addressed new evidence obtained by Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent James Rosen that Bergdahl may have collaborated with the enemy against his former American comrades.\n\n[Watch Thursday\u2019s interview from \u201cThe Kelly File\u201d and don\u2019t miss the second-half of the exclusive on the Fox News Channel tonight at 9 p.m. ET.]\n\n\u2018We would all die for him, and he left\u2019 - \u201cHere is the thing. When you\u2019re in combat it doesn\u2019t matter, left, right, independent, Jedi, whatever you want to be,\u201d one of the soldiers, Cody Full, said. \u201cWe\u2019ll all ride together, we\u2019ll all die together. I don\u2019t know how he felt about us, but we would all die for him, and he left.\u201d The soldiers also responded to criticism that they\u2019re coming forward was motivated by a desire to harm Obama\u2019s political standing, as administration defenders have claimed. One of the soldiers, Gordon Sutton, said he was \u201cflattered\u201d the administration was acknowledging their complaints, but said they are speaking out in order to get to the truth and to express their outrage at Bergdahl\u2019s release being celebrated at a Rose Garden event with Obama. Evan Beutow, another platoon member, said the Rose Garden appearance made him so upset, he had to leave the room. \u201c[Bergdahl] did not serve with distinction. That\u2019s a spit in the face to everyone who joined the Army and anyone who died looking for him. What do you think their families think?\u201d he asked.\n\nObama includes media swipe in D-Day memorial speech - As President Obama was memorializing the heroes of June 6, 1944 in France today, he also offered a version of his frequent complaint about the press: \u201cIn our age of instant commentary, the invasion would have been swiftly and roundly declared, as it was by one officer, \u2018a debacle.\u2019\u201d The president also touched on some of his other pet domestic issues, highlighting immigration, his push for women in combat roles and made a point to laud the World War II generation for creating \u201cthe greatest middle class the world has ever known.\u201d\n\nTeam Obama sorry for \u2018psycho\u2019 charge - Fox News: \u201cAn Obama administration official apologized Thursday after suggesting on Twitter that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl\u2019s platoon might have been filled with \u2018psychopaths\u2019 \u2013 in an apparent attempt to defend Bergdahl against criticism from his fellow soldiers.\u201d\n\nReid recycles from Hillary - \u201cThe whole deal, is it Friday or Saturday? What difference does it make? What difference does it make?\u2014Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid when asked by reporters when he was briefed on the Taliban swap.\n\nAdministration official cites race, gender to explain Rice criticism - National Security Adviser Susan Rice\u2019s reputation has taken another pasting for her claim that an American soldier accused of deserting his comrades on the battlefield \u201cserved with honor and distinction.\u201d But an administration official told Time Magazine that Rice\u2019s praise for the alleged collaborator was simply \u2018taken a half-notch out of context\u2019 and that Rice is a victim: \u201c\u2018She sort of brings out this craziness in a certain crowd,\u201d says one [a]dministration official\u2026 \u2018I\u2019m not here to suggest it\u2019s because she\u2019s a woman or a minority or what it is,\u2019 the official continues. \u2018But other principals in the national-security team don\u2019t come under this kind of attack.\u2019\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Yes they do.]\n\nOn Fox News Sunday - Host Chris Wallace will talk with former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who has called the deal to free five Taliban leaders a \u201cghastly transaction.\u201d Plus, Cheryl Brandes, the mother of Army Pfc. Matthew Martinek, who says her son was killed in the search for alleged deserter Bowe Bergdahl, will also provide her reaction to the deal. \u201cFox News Sunday with Chris Wallace\u201d airs at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET on Fox News.

The CBO has consistently projected that President Obama\u2019s overhaul will reduce the deficit, and the agency estimated that the Republicans\u2019 2011 effort to repeal the legislation would increase deficits by $210 billion from 2010 to 2021. In April, the agency quietly signaled that it can no longer make that projection; that the law had been changed and delayed so much that there is no longer a credible way to estimate the long-term effects on the deficit of all elements of the program taken together. In a little noticed footnote to a report updating estimates of the effects of the insurance coverage provisions of the law, the agency headed by Douglas Elmendorf acknowledged that neither CBO nor the Joint Committee on Taxation could determine precisely how scores of provisions other than the insurance coverage would impact long term government spending.\u201d\n\n[The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s latest forecast says the government next year will fine 4 million Americans for not complying with ObamaCare.]\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nSpace.com\u2019s Tanya Lewis reports that the folks at SpaceX think humanity needs to reach and colonize Mars to survive. \u201c[E]xploration isn\u2019t the only reason to visit the Earth\u2019s rouge neighbor. Creating a settlement on Mars also constitutes \u2018risk management\u2019 for the human race, [SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell] said. \u2018The probability of a significant [disastrous] event happening on Earth is very high,\u2019 Shotwell said. Though she said she doesn\u2019t know when it might happen, \u2018it would be nice to have humans living in more than one spot.\u2019\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

A newly-formed group called \u2018Protect Colorado Values\u2019 is about to hit the airwaves with two different ads focused on the two Republican front-runners, Tom Tancredo and Bob Beauprez. Both appear to be attack ads, but a single viewing of the two spots makes it clear what the group, a partnership between the independent expenditure committee of the Democratic Governors Association and other Colorado-based progressive donor organizations, is trying to do. Simply put, the one-two punch is a thinly-veiled effort to help Tom Tancredo win the GOP gubernatorial nomination. The 30-second spot focused on Beauprez, titled \u2018Both Ways\u2019, hits the former congressman for voting for \u2018earmarks and spending bills while the national debt ballooned\u2019 and for supporting \u2018the individual mandate that\u2019s the cornerstone of Obamacare\u2019, two lines of attack that are likely to turn off conservative primary voters. The 30-second spot focused on Tancredo labels him \u2018one of the country\u2019s strongest opponents of Obamacare\u2019, notes he called the Affordable Care Act \u2018a scam\u2019 and concludes with this: \u2018Tom Tancredo: He\u2019s just too conservative for Colorado.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n$100 million for Democrats, $2 million for victims - SF Chronicle: \u201cBillionaire Tom Steyer, the leading financial underwriter of campaigns to combat climate change, says he is putting up $2 million to start a fund for victims of wildfires and other \u2018extreme weather events.\u2019 Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, are announcing the establishment of the Climate Disaster Relief Fund on Friday. They said the fund, managed by the San Francisco Foundation, will provide grants to organizations serving the victims of \u2018climate-related disasters\u2019 in the United States, starting with wildfires in the West states during the last year.\u201d\n\nGRAHAM MAKES CLOSING CASE\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s six-way Republican Senate primary, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is hitting the airwaves to tout his conservative record. The six-figure radio and television ads point to his fight against unions, support for the Keystone XL Pipeline and opposition to ObamaCare. From the ad: \u201cMy job is to ask tough questions, find answers, and be that conservative leader you can count on to get things done.\u201d\n\nSULLIVAN: RIGHT BACK AT YOU\n\nAlaska Republican Senate hopeful Dan Sullivan has released an ad hitting back at Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, who jabbed him for filming an ad on a building that Begich worked to secure funding for. Sullivan appears in the ad saying, \u201cIt must be election time. Mark Begich is pretending to ride snow machines, and taking credit for other people\u2019s work,\u201d He continues the slam adding, \u201cNow, he\u2019s even giving me advice on political ads! I\u2019m not a career politician like Mark, but I thought I\u2019d return the favor. Mark, in your next ad, tell us why you vote with Barack Obama 97 percent of the time.\u201d\n\nCASSIDY SPORTS SCRUBS TO SMACK OBAMACARE\n\nRep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., is using his experience as a doctor to attack ObamaCare. In his first TV ad Cassidy appears in a white lab coat and scrubs saying, \u201cMost in Congress who voted for Obamacare never read the bill.\u201d Cassidy goes on to say, \u201cIt affects your job, your pocketbook, your life. And they didn\u2019t read it. I read the bill. It was clear there would be canceled plans, expensive premiums, no guarantee you could keep your doctor. I voted no.\u201d Cassidy is looking to unseat Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who voted for the president\u2019s health law.\n\nELDRIDGE BLASTS BUSINESSES HIS SPOUSE HAS A HAND IN\n\nOn the campaign trail New York, Democratic Congressional hopeful Sean Eldridge has railed against big business and big banks, oil companies and health care giants. Despite the criticism, his recent financial disclosures reveal he and his husband, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, have invested millions into the industries he has been blasting. The report reveals investments between $15,000 and $50,000 listed under Hughes\u2019 name in some of the nation\u2019s largest health care companies including Aetna, Wellpoint, and Humana. Hughes is also listed as having investments of nearly $1 million in Exxon Mobile and General Electric.\n\n[The latest Fox News poll finds that if the 2014 midterm elections were held today, 43 percent of voters would back the Republican candidate in their House district, while 39 percent would vote for the Democrat.]\n\nFIRST LADY EYEING A SENATE SEAT IN 2016?\n\nA Thursday report from Reuters is fueling speculation that first lady Michelle Obama could make a play against Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., in 2016. The report points to her willingness to take on Congressional Republicans on the merits of her school lunch regulations, her recent trip to China, and her public push to free kidnapped Nigerian school girls as efforts to raise her profile. Additionally, Reuters observers, her star power as first lady could make her a formidable opponent, \u201cNo Illinois Democratic candidate would bring the star power and nationwide fundraising capacity that Obama would\u201d, adding, \u201cShe would quickly become the most recognizable face in the Senate. Her fame and fundraising ability would command deference in a body that normally operates on seniority. Whether the recent elevation of her profile suggests a plan to run is unclear, but she will be well positioned should she jump in.\u201d\n\nYOU DON\u2019T HAVE TO BE HIGH TO GIVE TO THE DEMOCRACY ALLIANCE, BUT\u2026\n\nWashington Free Beacon: \u201cA group of attendees at conferences held by a secretive left-wing dark money group frequently hold \u2018informal late-night weed smoking sessions,\u2019 according to a new report on the group\u2026Democracy Alliance gatherings feature \u2018after-dinner dancing like the oft-discussed night when George Soros boogied away with a much younger woman he was dating at the time. [From the report:] \u2018There\u2019s also a crowd of donors known for doing tequila shots at the conferences, not to mention the group that partakes in informal late-night weed-smoking sessions.\u2019\u201d\n\n#mediabuzz: SOMETHING SPECIAL\n\nIn addition to his discussion of the media news of the week, host Howard Kurtz makes time for Bret Baier and the \u201cSpecial Report\u201d anchor\u2019s new book, \u201cA Special Heart,\u201d which chronicles his son\u2019s winning fight to live and thrive despite congenital heart defects. Watch \u201c#mediabuzz\u201d Sunday at 11 a.m. ET, with a second airing at 5 p.m.\n\n\u201c\u2026AND LEFT THE VIVID AIR SIGNED WITH YOUR HONOR\u201d\n\nFrom President Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1984 speech commemorating the 40th anniversary of D-Day: \u201cYou were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you. Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief. It was loyalty and love. The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead, or on the next. It was the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.\u201d Watch his speech here.\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
