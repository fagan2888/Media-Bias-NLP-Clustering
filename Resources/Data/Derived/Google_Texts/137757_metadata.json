I don\u2019t hear that phrase as often since George W. broached the subject of privatizing Social Security, and was, well, at least not tarred and feathered. W. was hated for his foreign policy more than domestic anyway.\n\nBut there\u2019s a third rail in religion, as well, and it\u2019s called \u201cpolitics.\u201d Now, interestingly enough, my generation used to say \u201ceverything\u2019s political,\u201d but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about. Mainly it\u2019s partisan, presidential politics that raises problems. When I came here in 2007, I had an old bumper sticker on my car for a candidate who wasn\u2019t even running in 2008, but a couple in church told me I shouldn\u2019t have even that on my bumper. The sticker stayed.\n\nWith the rise of the civil rights movement, Nixon\u2019s southern strategy, Carter\u2019s Year of the Evangelical, and the Reagan fueled rise and fall of the Moral Majority, the Christian Coalition and their successor avatars, we\u2019ve seen a lot of religious, even, ministerial involvement in politics. There\u2019s even a group of ministers who deliberately preach partisan sermons in an effort to draw the IRS into litigation over the Johnson Amendment (yes, that Johnson, LBJ). It was this amendment which first said a church can have tax-exempt status only if it eschews \u201csignificant\u201d use of its time or resources in partisan political activity.\n\nNow I know what I said a few weeks ago about ad hominem arguments, but if you\u2019ve read any of Robert Caro\u2019s LBJ biography you know LBJ never took a breath that wasn\u2019t for partisan purposes, and this makes me at least suspicious that maybe, just maybe, the jurisprudential aspects of the (1954) Amendment are, let\u2019s say, murky. Less than Madisonian in constitutional fidelity.\n\nSo while I may not think the amendment is constitutionally valid, if I had the magic wand to make it disappear, I don\u2019t think I would. The pre-World War II environment in this country was less divided politically within its geographic segments, its states, cities, towns, neighborhoods. The South was Democratic, New England and the Midwest (except big cities) were Republican and the West, well, it flipped and it flopped. Within a given community though, you knew pretty much what people\u2019s politics were and they were more \u201csectional\u201d let\u2019s say. More based on the interests of the miners, or the farmers, or the factory workers, or the shop owners, or the stockholders. So while Kansas City might be machine politics Democratic (think Pendergast and that crowd, or Boss Tweed in NYC) the rest of Missouri was more Republican, just like they\u2019d been since Teddy Roosevelt.\n\nMy point is, that is not our world. We live in hyper-partisan times. And to tell you the truth my opinion of the political judgment of my American colleagues, the preachers, generally is not high. I don\u2019t believe one can, or should, move straight from the Sermon on the Mount to the Legislative floor. There needs to be some intervening, I don\u2019t know, rasslin\u2019, some fermenting, some aging, maybe. I do believe the Bible and the church in general speak to what\u2019s right and just and moral, but I don\u2019t think we can sit down and just paste the Bible into the law books. Heck, the Affordable Care Act is 7 feet tall if you just stack up the pages. Maybe we need less laws, not more ...\n\nThere are issues upon which the church has labored for centuries to gain understanding and persuade others, but unfortunately those issues that churches often wish to speak to most directly are the issues on which we\u2019re most divided nationally, issues of abortion, bio-ethics, sexuality, etc., issues that seem to stir up the most partisan rancor.\n\nThe focus on politics from the pulpit that a repeal of the Johnson Amendment would open the door to would also distort what I think the church\u2019s true message is. Many people, I think, even (especially?) those who are in favor of a relatively high profile for religion in modern policy questions, see the raison d\u2019etre of the church to be morals, ethics. Right and wrong. And while a broad church liberality re: behavior is probably the last thing I would ever be accused of, I think the image of the church as primarily the propagator and defender of morality proper is essentially misguided, and false.\n\nOf course, the Bible does have laws and ethical teaching. After all, Thou Shalt Not. We can\u2019t and don\u2019t want to do without that. And I believe heedless, slipshod immorality, individually and in terms of public policy, damages people and harms those who live as if there aren\u2019t any laws inherent in the fabric of the universe.\n\nBut the church has a prior word, a higher word than telling people how to live. It\u2019s more like telling people why to live, for whom to live. Morality comes out of character and habit. And those come out of identity, and it\u2019s identity that is closer to the church\u2019s call and purpose. I am a child of God, God come to earth as one of us, to bless and to love us in his body, the body of Christ, and having died, to offer that body to us as the building-blocks of the new world, the world that will one day (this is our hope) be his gift to all who call upon His name.
