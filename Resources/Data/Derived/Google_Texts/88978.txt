Police searched a landfill in Menomonee Falls Saturday for evidence related to the disappearance of Kelly Dwyer, a Milwaukee woman who went missing two weeks ago, according to a press release from Milwaukee police.

Because the investigation is ongoing, police aren't sharing additional details at this time, spokesman Mark Stanmeyer said in an email.

The 27-year-old's mother reported Dwyer missing after she didn't show up for work at Lululemon in the Third Ward, and hadn't been in her apartment or using her cell phone.

Her boyfriend, Kris Zocco, has been arrested twice in recent days by Milwaukee police, once for keeping a drug house and another on possession of child pornography.

Saturday night, police said their search had found nothing related to the disappearance of Dwyer. Detectives will resume the search of the landfill Sunday.
