(CBS SF) \u2014 During a one-on-one interview with the President Obama Wednesday, KPIX 5\u2019s Allen Martin discussed the President\u2019s push for residents Oakland to sign up for the Affordable Health Care Act ahead of this Sunday\u2019s deadline.\n\nA good portion of Allen\u2019s conversation focused how Obamacare has worked in the Bay Area and particularly in Oakland. Health care reform, he says, is working but could work better.\n\n\u201cHealthcare inflation has gone up at the slowest rate over the last three or four years,\u201d said President Obama. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the strongest job growth since 1990s since this law passed. So all the horror stories about how this was going to be terrible for the economy or the American people haven\u2019t come to pass.\u201d\n\nThe President is pushing 20 cities \u2014 two in California, including Oakland \u2014 to rise to his challenge and sign up more people for the Affordable Care Act before the January 31 deadline on Sunday.\n\nWhite House figures show there are 134,000 residents in the East Bay who are eligible for health care but simply haven\u2019t signed up.\n\n\u201cSeven out of ten people, they\u2019re going to be able to get good quality health insurance for $75 a month. That means they can get health insurance for less than their cell phone bill,\u201d said the president.\n\nBut Bay Area Republican and former Chair of the state GOP Tom Del Beccaro disagreed, saying it really does come down to people not being able to afford coverage.\n\n\u201cPremiums are rising in the Bay area. My premium alone is doubled in the last five years,\u201d said Del Beccaro. \u201cAnd so the question really is, are people getting healthcare not insurance? Because it\u2019s okay to have insurance but if you have really high deductibles you\u2019re not actually getting healthcare.\u201d\n\nOakland is being targeted because it has lagged behind in participants in the Affordable Care Act. During the interview, Martin pointed out to the President that some would insist they still cant afford subsidized health care.\n\n\u201cThere are people in Oakland who have a legitimate argument \u2014 I think \u2014 when they say, Look, gentrification is real in Oakland now. Tech companies are moving in. I can barely afford a roof over my head and food, how am I supposed to afford health care, even if it is through Obamacare?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI am saying that if you get sick, if you get \u2013 heaven forbid \u2013 in a serious accident, you want that financial security,\u201d explained the President.\n\nBut Beccaro argued Republicans can \u2014 and he believes will \u2013come up with something better.\n\n\u201cI think the Republicans need to come forward with a plan that actually helps people and there\u2019s a variety of ways to do that,\u201d said Del Beccero. \u201cThrough a flat tax which I proposed, or they could do it through health savings accounts.\u201d\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell also told KPIX 5 that boosting enrollment numbers is not just about the President\u2019s legacy.\n\n\u201cOne thing it is about is reducing the number of uninsured,\u201d said Burwell. \u201cWe agree with that and \u2014 whether that\u2019s through better unemployment rates, better unemployment rates \u2014 that we\u2019ve seen lower unemployment rates as a nation where people are getting coverage through their jobs or through the Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\nInterested parties can sign up for the Affordable Health Care Act through the Covered California website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a  one-on-one interview with the President Obama Wednesday, KPIX 5's Allen Martin discussed the President's push for residents Oakland to sign up for the Affordable Health Care Act ahead of this Sunday's deadline.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/01/27/president-encourages-east-bay-residents-to-sign-up-for-health-care/", "image": {"width": 800, "secure_url": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/obama-int.jpg?w=800", "identifier": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/obama-int.jpg?w=800", "height": 450}, "type": "article", "description": "During a  one-on-one interview with the President Obama Wednesday, KPIX 5's Allen Martin discussed the President's push for residents Oakland to sign up for the Affordable Health Care Act ahead of this Sunday's deadline.", "title": "President Encourages Oakland Residents To Sign Up For Health Care"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbssanfran.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/obama-int.jpg?w=800", "description": "During a  one-on-one interview with the President Obama Wednesday, KPIX 5's Allen Martin discussed the President's push for residents Oakland to sign up for the Affordable Health Care Act ahead of this Sunday's deadline.", "site": "cbssf", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "President Encourages Oakland Residents To Sign Up For Health Care"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of SF", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS San Francisco", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/CBSSanFrancisco"}, "keywords": "affordable health care act, president obama, obama care, oakland", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/73943609873d357bc6a7462619ad7be9?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable health care act, oakland, obamacare, president barack"}, "article_summary": "White House figures show there are 134,000 residents in the East Bay who are eligible for health care but simply haven\u2019t signed up.\n\u201cSeven out of ten people, they\u2019re going to be able to get good quality health insurance for $75 a month.\nI can barely afford a roof over my head and food, how am I supposed to afford health care, even if it is through Obamacare?\u201d he asked.\nDuring the interview, Martin pointed out to the President that some would insist they still cant afford subsidized health care.\nHealth care reform, he says, is working but could work better."}
