Mark this day on your calendars, folks. For today, Chris Hayes has some harsh words for the Obama administration:

This is seriously some shameful sh*t: http://t.co/08vHa1vHwT — Christopher Hayes (@chrislhayes) February 7, 2014

From Talking Points Memo:

A bundler for President Barack Obama who is nominated as the next U.S. ambassador to Argentina said Thursday that he’s never actually been to that country.

During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearing for political consultant Noah Mamet, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) asked “Mr. Mamet, have you been to Argentina?” “Senator, I haven’t had the opportunity yet to be there,” Mamet replied. “I’ve traveled pretty extensively around the world, but I haven’t yet had a chance.”

Sounds like Mamet, echoing Max Baucus, might be “no real expert” on Argentina. Yeah, he’s totally qualified for the job.

@chrislhayes I mean, he couldn't have gone there the weekend after he was nominated? — John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) February 7, 2014

In all fairness, Obama couldn't find Argentina on a map, so… @RBPundit @chrislhayes — Jim Branch (@jamesbranch3) February 7, 2014

Heh.

Thank you for pointing this out. RT @chrislhayes: This is seriously some shameful sh*t: http://t.co/vQbkgH8GtB — John (@johninUT) February 7, 2014

Obama picked him. RT @chrislhayes This is seriously some shameful sh*t: http://t.co/XqRvyz3EbP … — RB (@RBPundit) February 7, 2014

Yep. Obama has a knack for wanting to reward his bundlers with plum positions, regardless of their qualifications.

.@RBPundit Just be thankful he is actually saying something about it. Credit where credit due @chrislhayes — John (@johninUT) February 7, 2014

That’s fair, but how about some perspective?

More shameful: You still defending this President. RT @chrislhayes: This is seriously some shameful sh*t: http://t.co/fUycTyC6vV — eric (@eriContrarian) February 7, 2014

We’ll take Hayes more seriously when he’s willing to turn in his lapdog collar.
