ASPEN, Colo. (AP) — The former owner of a dog-sledding business in Aspen has pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of animal cruelty and will likely avoid a jail sentence.

The Aspen Daily News reports (http://bit.ly/1NBc0Oi ) Dan MacEachen entered his plea Tuesday and is scheduled to be sentenced April 13. As part of a plea deal that calls for no jail time, seven other misdemeanors are to be dismissed.

MacEachen was charged in December 2013, a few days after officials seized eight dogs from his business, called Krabloonik, that were underweight or in need of emergency veterinarian care.

MacEachen has since sold the business to new owners who have implemented a host of changes.
