Kennedy\n\nThe state of Louisiana has \u201cObamacared\u201d its own employees\u2019 health insurance plan. Here\u2019s how.\n\nOne of the problems with the federal Affordable Care Act (called \u201cObamacare\u201d by the President himself) is the way it\u2019s paid for: with $700 billion of taxpayer money taken from Medicare. Many Louisiana officials, myself included, have criticized this. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so disappointing and more than a little ironic that the state has done the same thing to its own State Group Benefits health insurance plan for 230,000 active and retired state employees, their spouses and children.\n\nAccording to a July 18 report by the nonpartisan Louisiana Legislative Fiscal Office two years ago, OGB had built up a reserve fund, or savings account, of $540 million to pay its members\u2019 health insurance claims. This money came from premiums paid by employees and employer contributions paid by the state. Then OGB, which is run by the state Division of Administration, began spending $16.1 million more per month to pay claims than it was collecting in premium revenue.\n\nIf this continues, by the end of Fiscal Year 2015, the reserve fund will contain only $5.6 million, according to the LFO.\n\nWhat happened? Why is OGB suddenly living off its reserve fund? According to the LFO, the state has \u201cindirectly utilize(d) OGB\u2019s fund balance to support the FY13 and FY14 operating budgets.\u201d (LFO Report, page 3). The state did this by reducing premiums, which helped employees financially but which helped the state even more by reducing the amount of the state\u2019s legally-required employer contribution to OGB, which in turn freed up money to spend elsewhere in the budget.\n\nIn other words, the state in effect took the money from the OGB reserve account to pay for the state\u2019s operating budgets in 2013 and 2014, just like Congress took the money from Medicare to pay for Obamacare.\n\nThe OGB reserve account is not the only trust fund the state has drained recently. The Louisiana Medicaid Trust Fund for the Elderly was established with federal dollars in 2000 to provide a permanent source of money for health care for our elderly. We were supposed to invest the money, spend the interest and leave the principal in tact. In 2012 the trust fund contained $519.2 million. At the end of this fiscal year, it will contain zero. The state has spent the interest and the principal.\n\nSimilarly, in 2011, the state capped the amount of the Millennium Trust Fund \u2014 better known as the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund \u2014 whose earnings are used to pay for health care, education and the TOPS college scholarship fund, and redirected the tobacco settlement monies flowing into the trust fund to the operating budget to pay for TOPS, which frees up money to spend elsewhere. This maneuver thus effectively uses the trust fund money to pay for balancing the budget.\n\nLouisiana state government finances must be stabilized. The way to do it is not especially complicated:\n\n\u2022 Stop draining the state\u2019s savings accounts and trust funds.\n\n\u2022 Stop spending more money than we take in.\n\n\u2022 When we do spend money, spend it on things citizens need, not things politicians want.\n\nJohn Neely Kennedy is the treasurer of Louisiana.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1olOUnj", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "State Treasurer John N.
