Male doctor rates were 50 to 70 percent higher. The trends have been increasing recently according to Texas doctors, new medical profession data, and news stories released the last few days.\n\nThis coincides with data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and American Journal of Preventive Medicine information about national trends. Rates for suicides on the job were 1.2 per million at the end of the George W. Bush administration. By 2010, the rate jumped up to 1.8 per million.\n\nCauses and opinions vary among experts, but doctors who will talk about it are fairly certain they know why the rates are increasing.\n\n\u201cThe burdens and stresses of dealing with \u201cfragmented\u201d and \u201cassembly-line medicine,\u201d the harsh demands of being on call day and night, programming demands, and the over growing and changing battles with the insurance companies are more than enough to depress anyone in any discipline,\u201d one Corpus Christi, Texas doctor, who, with two other physicians, agreed to talk about the subject Tuesday, explained. \u201cIt was difficult enough, and it is difficult to talk about it publicly, but the mounting regulations, control over coding by the government or their co-harts, they are just growing.\"\n\n\u201cThe one common denominator of why this is becoming more stressful is the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the doctor emphasized. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder we lose at least a doctor a day.\u201d\n\n\"This fast expanding knowledge in the medicine and science world, the demands of taking continuous education on topics we don\u2019t even deal with--so we are forced to pay for the literature to keep up to speed--and the consistent worries of covering our asses because of malpractice suits always hangs over our heads,\u201d a second doctor added.\n\nObamacare has caused most doctors in America to be outraged about the changing laws and adjustments in health care. Startling information coming from the nation\u2019s physicians are showing a pessimistic trend. Many are beginning to unite against the \u201cpolitically driven government takeover of our healthcare, passed by overt bribery and coercion.\u201d\n\nThe Obama Administration has used \u201chalf-truths and misleading statements disparaging physicians and our American health care system,\u201d says San Antonio, Texas physician Dr. Kristin Story Held, and \u201cnow that we have seen what is in the law, we know it is not the right solution.\u201d\n\nThe United Physicians and Surgeons of America (UPSA) have founded the movement \u201cLet My Doctor Practice\u201d to \u201crestore the voice of the doctor to the practice of medicine.\u201d\n\nPhysician members of UPSA say they \u201cbelieve in the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship, the autonomy to practice medicine without restraint imposed by overreaching government and corporate entities, and, above all, that patient care and safety should never be compromised.\u201d\n\nUPSA are uniting to \u201crestore the practice of medicine to those who actually practice medicine\u201d and has planned a major \u201cSummit at the Summit Conference and Interactive Webcast\u2013A National Grand Rounds on the State of American Medicine\u201d on July 20-26, 2015 in Keystone, Colorado.\n\n\"It's important to realize that even though a high percentage, compared to the average American, of doctors commit suicide, don't forget there are still 96 to 98 percent out there working every day, doing a fine job, and being very professional,\" the third doctor added. \"Some doctors feel they can't get the help they should if they are suffering depression or stress because of time constraints, or things like worrying about their license and ability to practice.\"\n\nThe following alarming facts represent the state of the medical profession, according to American doctors:\n\nOnly 13 percent of the nation\u2019s 400,000 licensed physicians are still members of the American Medical Association (AMA). AMA was long the advocate for the nation\u2019s doctors and \u201cabandoned the needs of the physician years ago and has its own agenda,\u201d states Dr. John Tedeschi, a primary-family care doctor in Robbinsville, New Jersey. The AMA spends about $22 million a year since 2010 lobbying for Obamacare.\n\nOver 84% of doctors believe the medical profession is in decline. \u201cDoctoring just isn\u2019t the same,\u201d say Dr. Tedeschi. \u201cThe practice of medicine, its costs and medical policies, are now dictated and controlled by groups that don\u2019t know the first thing about medicine, nor the people it serves.\u201d\n\n82% of doctors think physicians have very little ability to change the healthcare system. \u201cWe\u2019re moving away from the mission of medicine and more towards the business of healthcare, and these two endeavors are not the same thing,\u201d Twila Brase, President of the Citizens\u2019 Council For Health Freedom states. \u201cWe\u2019re moving in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\n57% of physicians would not recommend a career in medicine to their children or other young people. \u201cWhen other people hold the dollars, the mission of medicine is compromised,\u201d Brase reminds people frequently. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the government, or an insurance company, the agendas of the people with the money ultimately take precedence over the needs of the patient.\u201d\n\nAlmost 60% of doctors will strongly consider retiring by 2019 because of the destructive health plan changes of the last few years, and the known changes coming up. \u201cWe are now told how much time we can spend with each patient,\u201d Dr. Tedeschi explains. Doctor are mandated \u201cwhat tests we can and cannot request. We are now forced to re-certify more frequently and answer questions, in many cases, unethically, just to serve their (Obamacare) financial needs.\u201d\n\nMillions of Americans will lose their doctors to suicide each year. The average caseload for family practitioners is close to 2,300 patients in the US. With over 500 doctors dying annually, then about a million patients lose their doctor with each death.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Since Obamacare was passed and signed by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010, about 2,000 American doctors have committed suicide, according to physicians", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "Millions of Americans suffer from depression, and some choose to end their lives.
