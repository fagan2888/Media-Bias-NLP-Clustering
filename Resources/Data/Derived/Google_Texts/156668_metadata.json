But the coming week could mark the beginning of a genuinely substantive debate between Republicans and Democrats over how to define the nation\u2019s economic problems and relieve its economic anxieties.\n\nClinton is making a major bid on Monday to shape the conversation with an economic speech in New York that will be followed over the next two months with rollouts of specific proposals in nearly a dozen policy areas. Her campaign knows that she still has work to do on her personal image. But like her husband two decades ago, she is betting that when the majority of voters tune in to the election next year, they will be focused primarily on their household balance sheets.\n\nThe turn toward economics was accelerated, inadvertently, by Jeb Bush when he told the Union Leader in New Hampshire that spurring the economy means, among other things, that \u201cpeople need to work longer hours.\u201d\n\nBush explained afterward that he was talking about part-time workers who wanted to work full time getting the chance to do so. But his comment will nonetheless allow Clinton to highlight the contrast between her economic aspirations and the approach taken by Bush and the other Republicans. Bush and his GOP rivals preach tax cuts for the wealthy as a way to spark growth; Bush has promised a hard-to-achieve 4 percent annual growth rate. Clinton will argue that wage stagnation is the country\u2019s central economic problem.\n\nOf course she, too, is for rapid growth. But Clinton will tout, as a campaign official put it, \u201cfaster, fairer, more sustainable growth,\u201d courtesy of increased purchasing power among middle- and lower-income Americans. Working longer hours for wages that continue to stagnate is not a particularly attractive solution for most Americans, especially in households where both members of a couple are already working full time.\n\nIn the process, Clinton will cast the Republicans as advancing policies rooted in the past \u2014 \u201cthe same old proposals that every Republican presidential candidate has been offering since Reagan,\u201d as a campaign official put it. Her package includes new benefits for individuals (family leave, child care, more affordable access to college) and new incentives to encourage companies to think long term, not short term, while also improving rewards to their workers.\n\nOther incentives will promote profit-sharing, and her adviser said that she will, over time, make proposals on executive compensation along the lines of a bill introduced by Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). It would give chief executives less favorable tax treatment for their bonus packages unless they offered wage hikes to their workers matching increases in productivity and the cost of living.\n\nClinton\u2019s ideas reflect a wide center-left consensus on behalf of bottom-up or, as many progressives call it, \u201cmiddle-out\u201d economics. They also underscore how the nomination challenge she faces from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) differs from the problem created for Republicans by Trump.\n\nBy pulling the political conversation to the left generally and toward specific benefits government could confer on Americans in particular, Sanders is creating new political space for Democrats and highlighting issues that most of them (including Clinton, if she wins the nomination) want at the heart of the campaign next fall.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is pulling Republicans far off message, and his offensive comments on Mexican immigrants threaten to aggravate the GOP\u2019s large deficit among Latino voters.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Clinton is broadly trying to re-create the electoral alignment that won President Obama majorities in two elections. But the Obama coalition is often misunderstood as excluding working-class whites. In fact, winning a substantial share of their votes \u2014 42 percent in Ohio, 45 percent in Wisconsin \u2014 was essential to his 2012 victory. The white working class may be out of the Democrats\u2019 reach in most of the states of the Deep South (Obama won only 11 percent of its ballots in Alabama and 10 percent in Mississippi), but it is vital elsewhere.\n\nHillaryeconomics is a wager that voters across racial and ethnic lines, very much including members of the white working class, want a raise and better benefits. And it\u2019s a sharp challenge to Republicans. To be competitive in 2016, the GOP needs to make a plausible counteroffer. It\u2019s the bidding war an economy mired in inequality and stalled mobility needs \u2014 and it\u2019s one Clinton thinks she can win.\n\nRead more from E.J.
