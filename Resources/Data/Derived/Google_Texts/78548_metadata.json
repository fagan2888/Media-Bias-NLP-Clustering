(RELATED: Ed Schultz Uses Glenn Beck\u2019s Illness To Push For Obamacare [VIDEO])\n\n\u201cGlenn Beck recently came out on his own show and pretty much admitted he was crazy,\u201d Uygur began. Throughout the segment he continually referred to Beck as having admitted to being crazy, despite Beck actually saying his disorder \u201cmake me look like I was crazy.\u201d\n\nUygur said he found Beck\u2019s claims \u201cquestionable\u201d and was more explicit at one point: \u201cLet me be on the record here: not buying it.\u201d (RELATED: Cool Kid Cenk Uygur Announces To World: \u2018I\u2019m Wasted\u2019)\n\nThe real reason Beck was making this announcement, according to Uygur, was to get attention. \u201cHe\u2019s been going on a series of these little rants\u2026 to get more attention. Like, \u2018Oh my god, how do I get attention? When I say crazy conservative stuff, people don\u2019t pay attention to me. So I have to go over-the-top. I have to do things like say \u2018OK you were right, I was crazy.\u2019\u2019\u201d\n\nThe underlying need for this attention was finances, he claimed, saying Beck would go \u201cbankrupt.\u201d But as Mediaite\u2019s Matt Wilstein points out, Beck makes an estimated $90 million a year.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry, Uygur did feel bad for Beck. \u201cAs a progressive, I genuinely feel bad for him, even though I shouldn\u2019t, because he\u2019s caused so much damage in the world, right?\u201d Heartwarming.

He backed him up.\n\nYou can watch the video below, but each click puts money in Uygur\u2019s pocket.
