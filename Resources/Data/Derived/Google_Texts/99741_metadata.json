In return, the producers agreed to tape a two-hour episode of the show at various locations in the state capital this fall.\n\nThe Santa Fe City Council originally committed up to $100,000 for the effort, but Randy Randall, director of the city\u2019s Convention and Visitors Bureau,told the Santa Fe New Mexican the city won\u2019t pay more than $50,000.\n\nAll told, $100,000 in public money from New Mexico will be spent.\n\n\u201cA 30-second ad during \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 would run about $200,000, and we really feel it\u2019s a steal to get it at $50,000 in front of a huge prime-time viewership for two hours,\u201d Latham told New Mexico Watchdog.\n\nThe $50,000 purchase will not include any commercials promoting New Mexico tourism, but Latham said the exposure makes the expenditure of taxpayers dollars a good investment.
