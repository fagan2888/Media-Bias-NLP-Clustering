With the aging U.S. population and the Affordable Care Act in place, there are many transitional aspects in the healthcare industry today. But there are still many people looking to have a positive impact as a nurse. Some states seem to be more welcoming and accommodating in the field than others, though.

WalletHub put together a report that takes a close look at what the nursing industry looks like in terms of finding jobs, and more specifically, ones that pay well. This is put in the context of many people finishing their education and trying to figure out what is the best direction to go in for what is coming next in life.

That concern is not unique among recent graduates, regardless of industry. However, both the magnitude of the issue – the nursing industry is expected to grow far faster than the average occupation through 2022 – and the various day-to-day demands placed on nursing professionals – from overstaffing and mandatory overtime to unionization and allegations of systematic disrespect – are indeed profession-specific.

They ranked each state individually – Washington taking the number one spot.
