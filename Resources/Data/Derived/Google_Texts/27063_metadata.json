Overly generous government subsidies that must be paid back. A special extension for certain taxpayers who are unaware of the rules. Surprise penalties. Sticker shock in premiums. And deductibles.\n\nObamacare already looks as inefficient and mistake-prone as the Department of Motor Vehicles, according to one leading physician who has served as the president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.\n\n\u201c[Health care] is not something that government should be involved in to begin with,\u201d said Dr. Lee Hieb, an orthopedic surgeon. \u201cThey\u2019ve never done it before, it\u2019s a huge experiment \u2013 it just doesn\u2019t work. And, you know, this is just medicine run by the DMV. If you want efficiency, don\u2019t look to the government.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration admitted Friday that the federal government sent the wrong tax information to roughly 800,000 people who bought health insurance last year on HealthCare.gov. Administration officials asked those people \u2013 who represent about 15 percent of all of last year\u2019s HealthCare.gov enrollees \u2013 to delay filing their tax returns for two or three weeks.\n\nAs a result of the mistake, about 50,000 people who have already filed their 2014 returns will likely have to file again with updated numbers, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHieb, author of \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamcare,\u201d said the error provides evidence of the incompetence of bureaucracies.\n\n\u201cIt just reinforces everything that we\u2019ve always known about government getting involved in anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey make it complicated, they make it costly, and it ultimately doesn\u2019t work better than a person could do on their own.\u201d\n\nJane Orient, M.D., the current executive director of AAPS, agrees with Hieb.\n\n\u201cThis is yet another example of the pervasive incompetence in the implementation of Obamacare, and by the very agency in charge of enforcement,\u201d Orient said. \u201cIt is one more reason to shun everything connected with the program. Pay the penalty if you must (if the IRS can figure it out and you are not covered by an exemption).\u201d\n\nOrient runs a private consulting practice in which she neither contracts with third-party payers nor provides covered services to beneficiaries of government programs. She advises people to explore alternatives to traditional insurance.\n\n\u201cBest to ditch \u2018insurance\u2019 altogether \u2013 a guaranteed money sink with no guarantee of care \u2013 and sign up for a health-sharing ministry (exempt from penalty by statute) and possibly a direct-pay primary care practice,\u201d she said.\n\nAs further evidence of government\u2019s incompetence in the medical field, Hieb pointed to a 2002 GAO study of Medicare customer service representatives who answer phone calls from confused doctors and insurers about Medicare billing rules. The study found that the customer service representatives gave incorrect advice 85 percent of the time.\n\nThe government tried to solve the problem, but in a new study two years later, the Medicare representative gave wrong advice a whopping 96 percent of the time.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect the tax guys to do better,\u201d Hieb warned of the IRS, which is charged with much of the work of enforcing Obamacare rules. \u201cNow you\u2019re mixing medical advice and insurance with the tax code. What could be worse?\u201d\n\nTax preparation company H&R Block found that in the first six weeks of tax filings, 52 percent of Obamacare subsidy recipients were forced to pay back some of their subsidies this tax season.\n\nThat is because when these customers signed up for their subsidies, they had to forecast their 2014 income to determine the proper subsidy amount. Customers who underestimated their earnings will have to pay back part of their subsidy, either by receiving a smaller refund or actually sending the IRS money.\n\nBig deal, says Dr. Hieb. To people who make estimated tax payments or deal with Medicare, like she does, the concept of handing back government money is nothing new.\n\n\u201cWelcome to the tax world,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cIf these people have never paid taxes before, it\u2019ll be a shocker, but to anybody who\u2019s ever paid taxes, they know what this is like. I think it\u2019s probably good that we\u2019re distributing this information to people that have never been punched in the face by the government\u2019s tax man before.\u201d\n\nIt appears the government\u2019s tax man is showing a bit more mercy in another area. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced last Friday that most of the 6 million people who owe a penalty for being uninsured will receive a \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d in which to sign up for health insurance.\n\nThe original deadline was Feb. 15, but the government will now allow the uninsured to sign up from March 15 to April 30 as well. The special sign-up period is available to those who attest they first learned of the tax penalty after open enrollment ended, while they were preparing their taxes. These people will still owe a penalty for the months they were uninsured without an exemption in 2014, but the new period is meant to give them the chance to get covered for the rest of this year and avoid future penalties.\n\nHieb thinks it\u2019s silly to even have a specified enrollment period at all.\n\n\u201cIn the land of the free, why should you only be able to buy insurance between November and February?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat\u2019s insane to begin with. So why have an enrollment period?\u201d\n\nThe surgeon sees it as more evidence the government is trying to micromanage its citizens\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cThe system becomes more and more authoritarian, statist, \u2018You must do this, now you\u2019ve gotta do this, now you\u2019ve gotta do this. We\u2019ve gotta force people to do this because we want this outcome,'\u201d Hieb said. \u201cAt some point, we just keep going down the road to more and more authoritarian control by the government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Incorrect tax information.
