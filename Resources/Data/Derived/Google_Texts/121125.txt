Indiana Governor Mike Pence today declared a public health emergency in one of the state’s southern counties. More than 70 cases of HIV have been confirmed there since January.

Health officials are calling it an HIV outbreak, and say it stems from the use of shared needles to inject the narcotic pain reliever Opana (oxymorphone). Gov. Pence has authorized a short-term needle exchange program for Scott County, despite his opposition to using that program statewide.

Brittany Combs, the public health nurse for Scott County, joins Here & Now’s Jeremy Hobson to discuss the outbreak.
