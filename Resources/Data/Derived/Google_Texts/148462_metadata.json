It\u2019s a benefit for all of us. Welcoming a child into the world is a crucial time in one\u2019s life that deserves our full attention, and we know that when parents get to spend time with their children early on, all of society benefits,\u201d Rudiak said.\n\nShe said the proposal makes good business sense because the majority of workers who take the leave will be retained. The health benefits are also far reaching, Rudiak said.\n\n\u201cStudies show that parental leave policies are the most cost-effective ways to reduce infant mortality, improve successful nursing of newborns and shorten hospital stays,\u201d she said.\n\nRight now, employees are eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\nSupporters of the bill said too many women face an agonizing choice of going back to work before bonding with their babies or staying home and watching their savings evaporate.\n\n\u201cThat is a horrible, horrible, cruel choice, and we can\u2019t be doing that to our city employees,\u201d said Susan Frietsche of the Women\u2019s Law Project.\n\nFrietsche said 16 other cities and three states have passed similar measures, which have led to increased productivity and higher lifetime earnings for parents and children.\n\n\u201cPaid parental leave is not only compassionate; it is really good for the infant, for the health of the new mother. It\u2019s an essential step on the road to women\u2019s workplace equality and it\u2019s good for the father, too,\u201d Frietsche said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 18:00:49 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Mike Clark", "og": {"site_name": "WTAE", "description": "Mayor Bill Peduto said he supports a new bill aimed at giving city employees six weeks of paid parental leave.", "title": "6 weeks of paid family leave proposed for Pittsburgh employees", "url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/6-weeks-of-paid-family-leave-proposed-for-pittsburgh-employees/30950702", "image": "http://www.wtae.com/image/view/-/9683062/highRes/5/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/1vfwy3z/-/site-Facebook-logo---jpg-for-Facebook-like-recommend.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wtae.com/news/6-weeks-of-paid-family-leave-proposed-for-pittsburgh-employees/30950702", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wtae://content/article/30950702", "iphone": "wtae://content/article/30950702", "googleplay": "wtae://content/article/30950702"}, "name": {"ipad": "wtae", "iphone": "wtae", "googleplay": "wtae"}, "id": {"ipad": 506053781, "iphone": 506053781, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}}, "site": "@WTAE", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wtae://content/article/30950702", "app_name": "wtae", "package": "com.hearst.android.wtae"}, "ios": {"url": "wtae://content/article/30950702", "app_store_id": 506053781, "app_name": "wtae"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 103664079013}, "google-site-verification": "yDb1_gOPiN1BUVxthVho7DtUbsFNoHF1JMM4A1Pldk8", "keywords": "Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, paid parental leave, Natalia Rudiak", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/MikeClarkWTAE"}, "news_keywords": "Pittsburgh, Mayor Bill Peduto, paid parental leave, Natalia Rudiak", "description": "Mayor Bill Peduto said he supports a new bill aimed at giving city employees six weeks of paid parental leave."}, "article_summary": "Mayor Bill Peduto said he supports a new bill aimed at giving city employees six weeks of paid parental leave.\nRight now, employees are eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.\n\u201cPaid parental leave is not only compassionate; it is really good for the infant, for the health of the new mother.\nIf it becomes law, city workers would be eligible for up to six weeks of paid leave when they have a baby, adopt or foster a child.\n\u201cStudies show that parental leave policies are the most cost-effective ways to reduce infant mortality, improve successful nursing of newborns and shorten hospital stays,\u201d she said."}
