(Lillian Cunningham, Randolph Smith and Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post)\n\nAnne-Marie Slaughter has come to regret that her site-crashingly popular Atlantic piece had the title \u201cWhy Women Still Can\u2019t Have It All.\" For one, she has since decided it's not just women who can't have it all. What's more, she says, \"having it all\" isn't even the point.\n\nIn her new book, Unfinished Business, she asserts that the real problem isn't about work-life balance\u2014it's that we utterly devalue the importance of caregiving roles in our society. The conversation with Slaughter, who now leads the Washington-based think tank New America, has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ. This book began as an extension of your 2012 article. How different did it end up being from what you originally envisioned?\n\nA. This book is very different from the article. I couldn\u2019t have written this book three years ago, because I didn\u2019t believe then what I now write about. What I\u2019m really now talking about is the work that we do investing in other people\u2014as mothers, as fathers, as children taking care of our own parents, as someone taking care of anybody who is disabled or ill.\n\nThat work of investing in others is actually just as important as the work we do for money. I now look at my mother\u2019s work as a homemaker as well as her work as an artist, and I say, \u201cThose things are equal.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe that three years ago.\n\nQ. What shifted your views?\n\nI started thinking my way through the women\u2019s movement and how we had come to define equality\u2014that women are equal to men only as long as they are doing the work that men have traditionally done.\n\nThat\u2019s not a full gender revolution. That\u2019s saying, \u201cMen were the ones who earned the income, and now women can be men.\u201d When women do that, they\u2019re equal; but women who are caring for others are still very much devalued. If you\u2019re really going to have equality, you\u2019ve got to value both kinds of work.\n\nQ. Part of what you suggest is switching the conversation from \u201cwork-life balance\u201d to \u201ccaregiving.\u201d Why do you think making that change is important?\n\nA. The first thing it does is it widens our lens to all women. When we talk about work-life balance, we\u2019re talking about a narrow slice of women at the top, right? Because balance is a luxury. Yes, we have too few women at the top, but we also have far too many women at the bottom.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening here is not just about gender. If you are a woman who doesn\u2019t have caregiving obligations, you\u2019re earning somewhere between 92 and 96 percent on every male dollar. If you are a woman with caregiving obligations, you\u2019re earning closer to 70 to 72 percent on the male dollar.\n\nWhat\u2019s really going on here is we are discriminating against people who have to care for others, which is a role that society needs people to play. Right now we\u2019re focusing on the problem that, if you\u2019re at the top and take time out to take care of others, you\u2019re knocked off your leadership track. But much more important is that, if you are a woman in the middle class or a low-income woman and you take even a day or two off to care for others, you could lose your job. You get docked pay. You don\u2019t have access to affordable day care.\n\nQ. I imagine your conclusion that caregiving is a better construct must have come partly out of the feedback on your original piece, including some of the criticism that the work-life balance conversation caters mostly to those who are privileged, white and suburban.\n\nA. Yes, I was accused of trickle-down feminism. I knew I was writing for The Atlantic, right? I never had any doubt that I was talking to a fairly narrow slice of women. But yes, I took that criticism on board and thought much much harder about the condition of all women.\n\nThe other criticism that I really took on board came from men. Men wrote to me, including gay men, and said, \u201cHow dare you frame this as a woman\u2019s issue?\u201d They were right. They also said, \u201cI am not any happier with my role as a mandated breadwinner than women used to be as the mandated caregiver. I want to be able to spend more time with my children.\u201d So I really changed my views of what men want but don\u2019t dare say. And also, if we don\u2019t change those roles for men, we will never get to real equality.\n\nQ. Why is the title of your book Unfinished Business? The heart of the book is so much about caregiving\u2014is the fact that the word is not in the title anywhere partly proof that the concept isn\u2019t de-stigmatized enough yet?\n\nA. You put your finger on it. If you call this book anything with care in the title, most people will not want to read about it. They just won\u2019t. So part of it is exactly a problem I\u2019m attacking, but I have to accept that change comes slowly.\n\nThe reason behind \u201cunfinished business\u201d is: That describes most working caregivers' lives, certainly working mothers'. If you talk to a woman between 30 and 50 who is taking care of kids and holding down a job, she will say, \u201cMy entire life is unfinished business. I never get to finish anything. I never feel like I\u2019m ever doing anything all the way.\u201d\n\nThen on the more meta level, this is the unfinished business of the women\u2019s movement. We\u2019ve made enormous progress. There\u2019s no question that lives of women have been transformed; but lives of men have been transformed much less, and you can\u2019t have a halfway revolution.\n\nQ. You write about how language in our workplace, such as the questions we ask and the labels we use, are actually holding back our progress. What is some of the worst language we need to ditch and replace?\n\nA. We should get rid of \u201cstay-at-home mom\u201d and \u201cstay-at-home dad.\u201d I find that to be very offensive. It says that the place you\u2019re supposed to be is the workplace. If you\u2019re at home, you need an adjective.\n\nWe should also talk about \u201cworking fathers\u201d as well as \u201cworking mothers,\u201d right? We constantly say a woman has two jobs: She\u2019s working and she\u2019s a mother. But we don\u2019t say that about men. We need to make clear that they have a dual identity the same way women have a dual identity.\n\nAnd let\u2019s get rid of the word \u201chelp.\u201d Let\u2019s stop saying, \"My husband helps\"\u2014because that is really saying, \"It is my job to run the household, but he helps me do it.\" No, no, no, no, no.\n\nQ. Aside from some of these language shifts, what are one or two big changes you would love to see in workplaces?\n\nA. Where do I start? There\u2019s a long list. What I want to see is: How do we work flexibly enough so that people who have children or parents or spouses, or who want to care for themselves, have time? It\u2019s not about how many hours you\u2019re in the office. It\u2019s about getting the work done on time with the quality that is demanded of you.\n\nAnd then if you take advantage of flexibility policies, you shouldn\u2019t be stigmatized for it. Some companies have all these really progressive policies, but, the minute you use them, you\u2019re not a player. Somebody just told me they were taken out of the bonus pool the minute they started working part time. That\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nQ. You and Sheryl Sandberg have been two of the strongest contemporary voices on women\u2019s issues, and there are some differences between your views. If her boiled-down advice is \"lean in,\" what\u2019s yours?\n\nA. To boil it down, my advice is break the mold. Do not accept the hierarchies you are given. Do not accept the assumptions about the workplace that you are given. Do not accept the ideas about male and female roles you are given.\n\nQ. In the course of the past three years of writing this book, what personal lesson have you taken away?\n\nA. I now try very hard when I meet somebody to not say immediately, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d That\u2019s such a classic American thing. I try to ask a question that will let me see the whole person. \u201cHave you read a good book lately?\u201d or \u201cWhat did you do last weekend?\u201d I ask something that says we are more than our work.\n\nHow many women were journalists, prosecutors, doctors, then took time out for care and dropped off the screen because all anybody wants to know is what they do? And when they say something like, \u201cI\u2019m caring for my parents,\u201d that doesn\u2019t seem to count.\n\nSo it\u2019s really changed how I approach other people. When I meet somebody who is caring for someone else, I think to myself, \u201cThat\u2019s fabulous. Let me find out more about this person.\u201d And also, when I meet a teacher or a nurse or a therapist or a coach, I immediately think, \u201cThis person is doing the most important work in our society.\u201d\n\n@lily_cunningham\n\nRead also:\n\nIs 'having it all' as simple as getting men to demand that, too?\n\nExhaustion is not a status symbol\n\nLike On Leadership?
