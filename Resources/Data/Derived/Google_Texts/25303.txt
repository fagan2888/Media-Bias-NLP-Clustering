NEW YORK (AP) â€” Through her own story, Diane Guerrero wants to change the lives of others.

Henry Holt and Company announced Thursday that the Colombian-American actress known for "Orange is the New Black" and "Jane the Virgin" is working on a memoir scheduled for early 2016.

The book is called "In the Country We Love," and will tell of her family's ordeal when her parents and older brother were taken from their home in Boston and deported to Colombia in 2000. Guerrero was 14 at the time and continued to live in the U.S., attending the Boston Arts Academy high school. She now volunteers for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, which advocates for immigrants' rights.

According to Holt, Guerrero will "cast a much-needed light" on the fears of deportation faced by many immigrant families.
