So it\u2019s only fitting that Colorado\u2019s greatest race horse has his own intriguing back story.\n\nIn 2011, longtime owner Annette Bishop was at the Silver Cup horse sale at Arapahoe Park with trainer Kenneth \u201cButch\u201d Gleason when a handsome thoroughbred caught Gleason\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cWe were sitting in the back row of the auction, with everybody in front of us, and this horse came into the ring,\u201d Bishop recalled. \u201cThey started bidding, and Butch gets all nervous. He says, \u2018Who is bidding on this horse?\u2019 I said, \u2018Butch, why? Do you want this horse?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 I said, \u2018Then you better get happy, mister.\u2019 That\u2019s how he got his name.\u201d\n\nThe horse was sold to Bishop that day for $46,000, and Get Happy Mister has spread plenty of joy since, galloping into more uncharted territory for a Colorado thoroughbred with each thundering stride.\n\nClearly, the name fits.\n\n\u201cHe loves what he does,\u201d said Bishop, a 76-year-old Colorado native who began purchasing race horses 15 years ago. \u201cHe\u2019s sweet, and he\u2019s an easy horse to be around.\u201d\n\nGet Happy Mister\u2019s $384,928 in career earnings are tops for a Colorado-bred, and the 5-year-old gelding\u2019s heart-pounding victory last month at the $100,000 San Simeon Stakes race at Santa Anita Park is believed to be the first graded stakes win for a Colorado-bred horse in talent-rich California.\n\nAs Arapahoe Park track announcer Jonathan Horowitz once bellowed during one of Get Happy Mister\u2019s races last season, \u201che\u2019s miles ahead of any horse in the Mile High City!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been riding for 28 years now, and this is the best horse I\u2019ve ever rode,\u201d said Mike Ziegler, the horse\u2019s Colorado jockey.\n\nBefore he toppled high-level competition in California, Get Happy Mister swept up a cult following at Arapahoe Park. During his first racing season as a 2-year-old in 2012, he sprinted his way to victory in all four races he started.\n\nAfter resting most of his 3-year-old year, the horse starred at the Aurora track again last season, winning all five of his races \u2014 all of varying distances \u2014 in dominating fashion. His coming-out party was the $100,000 Arapahoe Park Classic last August, a 1 -mile journey around the dirt track that offered a chance to cement a growing legacy.\n\n\u201cHe had won his first four races at Arapahoe Park (in 2014), but those were against local competition,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201c(For the Classic), horses came from out of state, and good ones, to race him. And Get Happy Mister wasn\u2019t favored to win.\u201d\n\nWhen the gates lifted, two of those out-of-state horses stormed to the front. Around the first turn, Get Happy Mister sat in third, 5 lengths behind the leaders.\n\n\u201cWe wanted him to sit back,\u201d Ziegler said. \u201cAs Butch told me, \u2018You\u2019d better save some horse for the end.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThere was plenty of horse left. In a flash, Get Happy Mister closed on the leaders. By the time he turned for the homestretch, it was time to celebrate his second perfect season on the Arapahoe track.\n\n\u201cColorado can rejoice in its hometown hero!\u201d Horowitz boomed to the crowd from his booth high above the track.\n\nBishop treats her horses well. A look inside her Lakewood home, adorned with pictures of her dozens of horses hanging on nearly every wall, provides a portrait of the love she has for them. She doesn\u2019t push them into races just to collect purses.\n\n\u201cI take care of my horses and I give them time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhereas a lot of people don\u2019t have the time, I do. \u2026 It\u2019s not about the money.\u201d\n\nIn April, eight months after the stirring Arapahoe Classic victory, a well-rested Get Happy Mister was at Santa Anita, training with Bishop\u2019s son-in-law, Mark Tsagalakis, and preparing to race on turf for the first time. He was a 12-1 longshot by the time the race began. It didn\u2019t matter.\n\nFuriously kicking up grass in his path, Get Happy Mister stormed down the stretch to grab victory in his biggest race yet. It was an emotional moment for Bishop, who won her first graded stakes race while celebrating the achievement with her son-in-law.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have asked to have a better horse or a better ride,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to give Mark a lot of credit. He was ready.\u201d\n\nGet Happy Mister will stay at Santa Anita this season. The original plan had been to bring the horse back here to race the Arapahoe Park circuit once again, but with new frontiers left to reach, Bishop\u2019s horse will spend the summer getting happy in the California sun.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickkosmider\n\nWin, place, showtime\n\nGet Happy Mister has had more success than any other horse from the state.
