Looks like the kinks aren’t completely out of the government’s shoddy Healthcare.gov website just yet, as a CNN reporter had the ‘updated’ Healthcare.gov website crash on her while trying to launch a demonstration on how to use the site.

The crash occurred during Sunday morning’s broadcast of “New Day,” and it wasn’t the first time Sunday that the site produced an error message, either.

“New Day” host George Howell: “We know the first thing you have to do when you go to this website you have to select your state. Is that working?” CNN business correspondent Alison Kosik: “And what’s funny is I was talking with Matt, and, yeah, that seemed to work, right, when you logged on. But then came the road blocks. So tell me about what happened, because we’re getting another error message here, and it’s supposed to be running smoothly. We’re just not seeing that.” CNN medical producer Matt Sloane: “Yeah, so, you know, we’ve been trying to get into the site since October 1 on and off again. I have to say it did work a lot more smoothly this morning. I got through. I picked my state. I put in all of my information and I got through the whole process in eight minutes. And then it said my status was in progress. So I went to refresh it and I got the error message.”

The White House had announced last month that the website, which was designed to help Americans sign up for the healthcare exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act and had been bogged down with problems since the site’s release on Oct. 1, would be fully functional by Sunday.

“The bottom line is health care.gov on December first is night and day from where it was October first,” Jeffrey Zients, the president’s appointee to fix the website’s problems, said Sunday. “The site is now stable and operating at its intended capacity at greatly improved performance.”

Clearly, however, it wasn’t.
