A new scientific poll sanctioned by Young America's Foundation and conducted by Inc./Woman Trend shows the majority of college students reject the "microaggression," politically correct culture plaguing campuses around the country. Specifically, the poll shows college students rejecting the use of gender pronouns.

Sixty two percent of students disagreed that professors should have the right to downgrade students for failing to use "gender inclusive" language like "mankind" instead of "humankind" in reference to men and women.

Not even half (49%) of LIBERAL students agree with implementing the use of pronouns like "ze," "zir," and "xyr" on their campus.



The data also shows a rejection of Black Lives Matter.

Nearly 7-in-10 students agreed that "given recent acts of violence against police officers, the Black Lives Matter movement has cultivated an anti-police culture."



Further, the poll shows students heavily favor free enterprise over socialism.

It turns out students aren't as liberal as we thought they were.
