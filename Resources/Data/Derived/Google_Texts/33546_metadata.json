Third-party sites embedded on HealthCare.gov can\u2019t see your name, birth date or Social Security number. But they may be able to correlate the fact that your computer accessed the government website with your other Internet activities. Have you been researching a chronic illness like coronary artery blockage? Do you shop online for smoking-cessation aids? Are you investigating genetic markers for a certain type of breast cancer? Are you seeking help for financial problems, or for an addiction?\n\nWhile HHS officials claim that these outside firms are barred from using \u201cpersonally identifiable information,\u201d the fact that this information is out there is alarming to the experts tapped by the AP. \u201cPersonally, I look at this \u2026 and I don\u2019t know what is going on between the government and Facebook, and Google, and Twitter,\u201d said Mehdi Daoudi, CEO of Catchpoint Systems, who discovered at least 50 third-party connections embedded on the website. \u201cWhy is that there?\u201d\n\nRead the rest of the report below.\n\n[AP]\n\n[Image via screenshot]\n\n\u2014\n\n>> Follow Tina Nguyen (@Tina_Nguyen) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent investigation by the Associated Press revealed that HealthCare.gov, the website that asks you to give them your medical and personal history in", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-11.39.57-AM.png", "title": "Healthcare.gov Reportedly Sends Private Medical Info to Third-Party Advertisers"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent investigation by the Associated Press revealed that HealthCare.gov, the website that asks you to give them your medical and personal history in exchange for health insurance you are legally obligated to have, is sending that information to third parties to do god knows what with it.", "title": "Healthcare.gov Reportedly Sends Private Medical Info to Third-Party Advertisers", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-21-at-11.39.57-AM.png", "creator": "@tina_nguyen", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-01-21T12:24:26+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcd29\"", "article_summary": "Third-party sites embedded on HealthCare.gov can\u2019t see your name, birth date or Social Security number.\nBut they may be able to correlate the fact that your computer accessed the government website with your other Internet activities.\nAnd according to the report, the information gets rather specific:Tracking consumers\u2019 Internet searches is a lucrative business, helping Google, Facebook and others tailor ads to customers\u2019 interests.\nBecause your computer and mobile devices can be assigned an individual signature, profiles of Internet users can be pieced together, generating lists that have commercial value.\n\u201cWhy is that there?\u201dRead the rest of the report below."}
