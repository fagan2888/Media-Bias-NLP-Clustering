A new study by the National Bureau of Economic Research determined the Obamacare provision allowing dependents to stay on their parentsâ€™ health insurance until the age of 26 has led to millennials spending more time socializing and searching for jobs they find more rewarding.

The Federal Register said by extending the age limit, it would allow the 19- to 25-year-old demographic to have more job mobility since they would no longer be tied to their employer or student status for coverage. The study found around 5 percent of those younger than 26 dropped out of the workforce after the provision was implemented in 2010.

Gregory Colman and Dhaval Dav, the economists who authored the working paper, used the American Time Use Survey to collect data to look at how different age groups utilized their time before and after the Affordable Care Act took effect.
