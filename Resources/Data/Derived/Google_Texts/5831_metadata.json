So when the subject of the economy and jobs would come up, politicians and policymakers on all sides could repeat bromides like \u201cwe need to educate our way to a better economy\u201d and no one \u2013 at least among the pundit class \u2013 would give this nonsense the least bit of scrutiny. (Japan had one of the most educated workforces in the world during all those years the country\u2019s economy was in the toilet. In the U.S., college attendance has increased dramatically while personal income has stagnated for years.)\n\nThis lack of attention gave politicians a break, so other than espousing conventional pap about how much they \u201crespected teachers\u201d and wanted to \u201cmake sure every kid has a shot,\u201d what they could mostly do is neglect education while lobbyists and think tanks funded by big business and private foundations continued to press an agenda for more and more standardization and harsh punishments for \u201cfailure.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s beginning to look like 2014 may be an election year when some politicians pay for that neglect. How many will be Democrats?\n\nAccording to the latest midterm poll, \u201cRepublicans have a slight edge over Democrats going into this year\u2019s midterm elections,\u201d and Democratic candidates may need to take their campaigns to new ground to find the votes they need to win.\n\nAn Education Election?\n\nIt\u2019s hard, for sure, to see education rising above the economy, Obamacare and immigration. And polling data on the public\u2019s motivation to vote based on education issues is scarce \u2013 most surveys don\u2019t even bother to ask about voter interest in the topic.\n\nNevertheless, one of the few surveys of voter interest in education, conducted by the College Board in 2012, found that voters believed education was a \u201ctop-tier issue\u201d in that year\u2019s election. This held true for Democrats, Republicans and Independents.\n\nReporting from Education Week, Andrew Ujifusa contends that a number of education topics will most likely get time in the spotlight and on the stump in election 2014. He mentions \u201cthe Common Core State Standards, school choice, collective bargaining, and early education,\u201d only one of which \u2013 early education programs \u2013 seems a sure deal to pitch to voters.\n\nUjifusa notes that the last midterm elections, in 2010, gave Republicans dominance in most state governments nationwide and lots of leeway to move aggressively on a lot of education policies, including \u201cschool accountability, teacher evaluation, and school employment\u201d \u2013 all hallmarks of the education reform agenda. So if Democratic candidates have a prayer of taking these seats back, don\u2019t they have to take these issues on?\n\nIn an anonymous survey of a \u201csmall group of key education influentials,\u201d Whiteboard Advisors, a \u201cpolicy-oriented consulting practice,\u201d found that these \u201cinfluentials\u201d \u2013 mostly Beltway operatives with some top-level state leadership \u2013 believe education will be an important issue in a number of gubernatorial races, most importantly in Florida, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nWhiteboard\u2019s email newsletter quoted from a New York Times story which observed that for education policy, \u201cthe differences between the parties are not always so stark,\u201d with very few if any Democratic candidates distinguishing themselves on the issues so far.\n\nFurther, 2014 is a midterm, with state and local contests hogging the limelight \u2013 including three dozen governorships and more than 6,000 legislative seats up for grabs. So local issues, including education, will be more prominent in voters\u2019 minds.\n\nAnother factor at work is the decision by each party to rally its base. For Democrats, according to The Wall Street Journal, President Obama\u2019s decision to keep Social Security cuts \u2013 the \u201cchained CPI\u201d \u2013 off the table is just \u201cthe latest signal\u201d that the White House is intent on unifying the party base ahead of the November elections. The strategy, according to The Washington Post, is \u201cto maximize the enthusiasm of the party stalwarts who are most likely to show up at the polls.\u201d\n\nBut if Democratic candidates intend to make education reform part of their campaigns, they are likely to find the \u201cbase\u201d for it just isn\u2019t there.\n\nWhere\u2019s the \u2018Base\u2019?\n\nIn reality, politicians and policymakers from both parties have never really brought the mass of American opinion on board with the \u201ceducation reform\u201d agenda.\n\nA plethora of surveys have found a growing disillusionment among Americans with the education policy agenda that has been in place for nearly 20 years.\n\nWhen Stephanie Simon at Politico reviewed some of those surveys, she found a \u201cmixed report card for education reforms,\u201d with parents giving confusing signals on where they stand on reform faves, such as standardized testing, school choice and teacher accountability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Defenders of charter schools and Common Core cast critics as ignorant skeptics.
