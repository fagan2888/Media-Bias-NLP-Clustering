According to them, Utah leaders have failed to address their needs in the state.\n\n\u201cRight now, we have 1,900 people waiting for services,\u201d said Jerry Costlay, who joined the rally.\n\nCostlay and others argue that the state has been forcing disabled Utahns into state-run nursing homes to receive care, rather than allowing them to choose to stay in their own homes and receive treatment there.\n\nWhile that is an option for some, Costlay said it takes years to get through a waitlist.\n\n\u201cThey have disabilities. They have significant needs. Some of them are dying and their wait could be over a decade,\u201d he explained.\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video\n\nTo address the issue, they want the governor to adopt what is called the Community First Choice Option.\n\nIt is a Medicaid option made available under the Affordable Care Act that provides in-home care and support to those who qualify. Proponents contend it\u2019s more cost effective than nursing homes, as it offers a 6 percent federal match.\n\nHowever, nationally, only five states have moved forward to implement the option, while several other states await approval.\n\nStill, ADAPT is hopeful they can add Utah to that list.\n\n\u201cThis is a win-win. It\u2019s a win for the fiscal conservatives who want to save money,\u201d Costlay said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a win for the people who want to be able to live normal lives, get married, have children and not be forced into nursing facilities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Protesters stormed the Gov.
