Jenkins, a HealthPlus employee for 32 years, took over for Bruce Hill, who resigned last October after five years at the helm.\n\nSmith predicted HealthPlus will break even this year with a risk-based capital ratio of 300 and \u201csignificant capital in the bank.\u201d Risk-based capital is a ratio that compares a company\u2019s reserve capital to its risk exposures.\n\nOn March 9, the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services placed HealthPlus under state financial supervision because losses in 2014 lowered its capital reserves below the required state minimum.\n\nIn May, for-profit Molina announced it would acquire the Medicaid and MIChild business units of HealthPlus for an unspecified price. Molina\u2019s parent company is based on Long Beach, Calif.\n\nGenord, who will become the first physician CEO of HealthPlus in its 36-year history, said the past six months have been difficult for the nonprofit health plan as it transitions to a \u201cflatter and leaner organization.\u201d\n\nBy the end of this year, HealthPlus will become a 70,000-member company with $500 million in revenue and about 200 employees, Genord said. In 2014, HealthPlus generated nearly $1 billion in revenue with more than 221,000 covered lives and 500 employees.\n\nGenord said HealthPlus downsized its workforce by a combination of 80 employees leaving by attrition, 100 by voluntary separation with outplacement services and the remainder by layoffs. It has closed its Troy office and will close Saginaw Oct. 1.\n\nThe unspecified amount of capital infusion from Molina will allow HealthPlus to restructure and focus on strengthening and increasing its 52,000-member commercial HMO and 18,000-member Medicare Advantage service lines, Genord said.\n\nGenord, who conducted the due diligence on the business unit sale process, said HealthPlus looked at about 13 offers from competing health insurers based in Michigan and from outside the state before selecting Molina.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t predetermine the outcome.\" he said. \"We evaluated the potential offers and chose the best one to secure the future\u201d of HealthPlus.\n\nBecause of the Healthy Michigan expansion and other changes brought about by a rebid of contracts this year under Medicaid, HealthPlus\u2019 Medicaid business was a \u201cvery positive asset. Some saw our 95,000 members and the value in that,\u201d Genord said.\n\nHe said HealthPlus selected the Molina financial package over the other bids because of the amount and because of the insurer\u2019s ability to work with them in the transition phase.\n\n\u201cThis was the best offer to retain jobs and allow us to move forward with our core HMO and Medicare Advantage business,\u201d Genord said. \u201cWe have worked hand in hand with Molina on (information technology) and case management. It has been a smooth transition.\u201d\n\nHow HealthPlus' financial problems developed\n\nA variety of actuarial miscalculations, higher than expected medical utilization and a flood of new PPO clients led to HealthPlus underpricing its various products the past two years, Genord said.\n\n\u201cThere were multiple factors,\u201d he said. \u201cPast financial models didn\u2019t serve us well in the future market. We had new membership, (many of whom) were underwritten for the first time, (which) led to significant losses we didn\u2019t predict.\u201d\n\nGenord said HealthPlus\u2019 various preferred provider organization products with employers and individuals haven\u2019t performed well for several years.\n\n\u201cAt year end, we expect to be out of the PPO market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe (Affordable Care Act) market didn\u2019t serve us well the past years.\u201d\n\nGenord said HealthPlus also is phasing out its PPO contracts with employers at the end of this year. HealthPlus has about 43,000 PPO members.\n\n\u201cWe have informed out customers and are looking to move to self-funded options for our PPO customers and offer PPO projects with other health insurers,\u201d Genord said.\n\nBefore joining HealthPlus in 2013, Genord, an obstetrician-gynecologist, was in private practice for 17 years and affiliated with William Beaumont Hospital and United Physicians Inc., a Bingham Farms-based physician organization.\n\n\u201cI joined HealthPlus because I see them as a leader in value-based medicine,\u201d said Genord.\n\n\u201cI am excited about the turnaround we had this year with the executive team, employers, community and employees all going forward,\u201d said Genord. \"We have a new strength in marketplace. \u2026 We have paid our bills, taken care of our employees and are proud of what we went through. We have grown as an organization.\u201d\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "By the end of this year the Flint-based commercial HMO and Medicare Advantage business will achieve a $20 million turnaround, incoming CEO Mike Genord said.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "By the end of this year the Flint-based commercial HMO and Medicare Advantage business will achieve a $20 million turnaround, incoming CEO Mike Genord said.", "title": "HealthPlus nears turnaround as it prepares for business unit sale to Molina", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20150819/NEWS/150819847/healthplus-nears-turnaround-as-it-prepares-for-business-unit-sale-to", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CD/20150819/NEWS/150819847/AR/0/AR-150819847.jpg&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "tag": "Health Care", "published_time": "2015-08-19T11:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T09:57:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/staff/JAYGRE"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b16\"", "article_summary": "Because of the Healthy Michigan expansion and other changes brought about by a rebid of contracts this year under Medicaid, HealthPlus\u2019 Medicaid business was a \u201cvery positive asset.\nIn May, for-profit Molina announced it would acquire the Medicaid and MIChild business units of HealthPlus for an unspecified price.\n\u201cThis was the best offer to retain jobs and allow us to move forward with our core HMO and Medicare Advantage business,\u201d Genord said.\nHealthPlus nears turnaround as it prepares for business unit sale to MolinaHealthPlus of Michigan, a Flint-based HMO under state supervision for financial losses since March, expects to complete its turnaround on Sept. 1 when it closes on the sale of its Medicaid plan to Troy-based Molina Healthcare of Michigan.\nOver the past two years, HealthPlus lost $60 million in its Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and commercial HMO and PPO business, according to state regulatory filings and interviews."}
