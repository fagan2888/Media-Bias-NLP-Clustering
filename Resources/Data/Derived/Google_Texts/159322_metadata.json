It is an election about insurgency,\u201d longtime pollster Pat Caddell told host Alex Marlow today on Breitbart News Daily.\n\nThe real paradigm in this race is a race between those who think that the political class has raped the country \u2013 and done it for their own benefit while most Americans suffer \u2026 who believe their country is in decline, who want it reversed, that is the real issue in this campaign. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nCaddell went on to further discuss the election and to also lambaste Congress at length, saying he is \u201coutraged\u201d by Congress\u2019s \u201clatest version of the people are stupid. Let\u2019s have a vote on Obamacare we can send to his desk so he\u2019ll veto it. Knowing that that\u2019s going to happen, playing out this charade when they have just voted in December to fully fund every piece of Obamacare, to give the Unions a break on their high-value plans.\u201d\n\nCaddell characterized it by saying, \u201cWhat do we give the peasants so we can calm them down?\u201d indicating that Republicans genuinely believe their voters are stupid.\n\nAgain, speaking of Republicans, said Caddell, \u201cThey have done none of the things that they could have done to punish Obama for executive actions.\u201d Caddell pointed out that Republicans could have denied Obama appointments, along with other actions to push back on his use of executive orders. \u201cThey\u2019ve done nothing at all to hamper him and they could. They have the power of the purse,\u201d he added.\n\nThe rest of the brief but compelling interview is available below.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pat Caddell: This is An Election About Insurgency, Not Ideology", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Pat Caddell: This is An Election About Insurgency, Not Ideology", "title": "Pat Caddell: This is An Election About Insurgency, Not Ideology - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Caddell-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/08/pat-caddell-this-is-an-election-about-insurgency-not-ideology/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pat Caddell: This is An Election About Insurgency, Not Ideology", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Caddell-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Pat Caddell: This is An Election About Insurgency, Not Ideology - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Radio,Pat Caddell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-01-08T06:04:38-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Radio"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "It is an election about insurgency,\u201d longtime pollster Pat Caddell told host Alex Marlow today on Breitbart News Daily.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cThere is no evidence that this is an election about ideology.\nLet\u2019s have a vote on Obamacare we can send to his desk so he\u2019ll veto it.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERCaddell went on to further discuss the election and to also lambaste Congress at length, saying he is \u201coutraged\u201d by Congress\u2019s \u201clatest version of the people are stupid.\nAgain, speaking of Republicans, said Caddell, \u201cThey have done none of the things that they could have done to punish Obama for executive actions.\u201d Caddell pointed out that Republicans could have denied Obama appointments, along with other actions to push back on his use of executive orders."}
