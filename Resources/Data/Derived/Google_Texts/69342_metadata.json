Mark Udall for \u201cbullying\u201d the state\u2019s Department of Insurance to revise its estimate that nearly 250,000 Coloradans had their health insurance policies cancelled as a result of Obamacare.\n\nThe allegation stems from emails sent by Udall\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Joe Britton, to the insurance division\u2019s director of external affairs, Jo Donlin, back in November.\n\nThe emails, first published by the conservative news website \u201cComplete Colorado,\u201d center around the department\u2019s estimate that 249,000 Coloradans saw their policies cancelled as a result of the new health care law.\n\n\u201cSen. Udall says our numbers were wrong. They are not wrong,\u201d Donlin wrote in the Nov. 14 email to Vincent Plymell, a spokesman for the Dept. of Insurance. \u201cCancellation notices affected 249,199 people. They want to trash our numbers. I\u2019m holding strong while we get more details. Many have already done early renewals. Regardless, they received cancellation notices.\u201d\n\nA subsequent email from Britton to Plymell expressed a sense of urgency of revising the number because it could be misleading to the public.\n\n\u201cWe need to move on this ASAP \u2013 or we\u2019ll be forced to challenge the 249K number ourselves,\u201d Britton wrote. \u201cIt is wildly off or at least very misleading and reporters keep repeating it.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Nov. 15, a Denver Post story appeared that highlighted Udall\u2019s contention that most of the people categorized as having had their plans cancelled had actually been offered renewals.\n\n\u201cWe reached out to the Dept. of Insurance because 250,000 cancellations was radically different than the number we were hearing from the insurance industry,\u201d Udall spokesman Mike Saccone told FOX31 Denver on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn fact, 96 percent of Coloradans who received \u2018cancellation letters\u2019 were offered an opportunity to renew their current coverage. To the average Coloradan, that is not a cancellation.\u201d\n\nRepublicans, whose strategy of beating Udall in November revolves around tying him to problems with Obamacare, allege that the senator was \u201cbullying\u201d the Dept. of Insurance to revise its numbers out of political concern.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s downright shameful that Sen. Udall would attempt to intimidate state employees to give him political cover after he was caught lying to Coloradans,\u201d Colorado Republican Committee Ryan Call said, alluding to President Obama\u2019s claim, repeated by Udall and other Democrats, that people who liked their existing insurance plans could keep them.\n\n\u201cColoradans want an honest senator who will do what\u2019s best for the people of our state. Sadly, today\u2019s news is just further proof that Mark Udall will say or do anything to save his political career.\u201d\n\nFormer GOP Chairman Dick Wadhams, who is supporting and advising one of Udall\u2019s possible opponents, state Rep. Amy Stephens, told FOX31 Denver that this \u201cscandal\u201d is worse than this week\u2019s revelations that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s staff created a traffic jam simply to pay back a Democratic official who didn\u2019t support the governor\u2019s reelection bid.\n\n\u201cThis deserves a full investigation by federal and state authorities along with the Senate Ethics Committee,\u201d Wadhams said. \u201cWhat did Senator Udall know and when did he know it when his staff tried to force Colorado insurance officials to falsify their numbers to suit his political purposes?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- Colorado Republicans are attacking Democratic Sen.
