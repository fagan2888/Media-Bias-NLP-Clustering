The Staten Island Not-for-Profit Association will hold its annual conference on March 28, to help the borough's not-for-profit organizations navigate New York City's changing landscape.

Keynote speakers include Mitchell L. Moss, Henry Hart Rice Professor of Urban Policy and Planning and Director of the Rudin Center for Transportation at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and United Way of New York City President and CEO Sheena Wright.

The daylong program will feature panel discussions as well as informal roundtable conversations.

"The Staten Island Not-For-Profit Conference is a great place to learn about best practices and changes in the not-for-profit field," Conference Chair Melanie Cohn of Staten Island Arts said in a statement.

Panel discussions include new state tax regulations for nonprofits, the impacts of the Affordable Care Act on nonprofit management and administration, transferring disaster volunteer management techniques to non-disaster volunteer operations, how nonprofits can maximize use of traditional and social media and evaluating nonprofits' IT needs.
