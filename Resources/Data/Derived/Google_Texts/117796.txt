Hartford, SD

In the last 21 years, West Central football has appeared in 14 state title games, and captured 12 crowns. It's a South Dakota record since the playoff system began in 1981, and a number they would like to add to this season.

"Personally, I don't think it's a success unless we win it, and I think most of guys on the team feel that way," said Michael Wagner.

In three games this season, the Trojans have been impressive. With a dual threat QB and spread offense, their offensive is averaging 52 points per game. But it's the comradery and communication between teammates that makes this team special.

"It's what you need to win a state championship. The connection between the backs and the line. I know I would give up anything for the line, and they would give up anything for me," said Seth Titus.

Although they only returned four starters on offense, you wouldn't know it. Head coach Kent Mueller can call on any number of guys to step up.



"I think right now it's our diversity and our depth that I'm most pleased with. If that continues to develop, it will be really hard to take everything away from us offensively," said Mueller.

The Blue and Gold are getting it done on both sides of the ball. West Central takes pride in their defense, and it's evident on the scoreboard. The Trojans have only allowed two scores in 12 quarters.

"Our defensive line is doing a tremendous job in getting pressure to the quarterback. That helps us with our coverage. If our coverage is good. If we get good pressure and good coverage on the other quarterback, then the other pass teams can't do a whole lot," said Keegan Peters.

West Central Football is confident they can make it back to the dome for the title game. Regardless, one thing is certain; they will certainly enjoy the road along the way.

"This team has a chance, but there are some great programs out there and some very good team. So it will be fun. It will be a fun year and a great challenge," said Mueller.
