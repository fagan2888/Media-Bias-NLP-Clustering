Like the Chapmans, hundreds of thousands of people have received notices that their existing plans are being canceled and that they must now pay more for new coverage.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to address that frustration, the Obama administration announced on Thursday that it would permit people whose plans had been canceled to buy bare-bones catastrophic plans, which are less expensive but offer minimal coverage. Those plans have always been available to people under 30 and to those who can prove that the least expensive plan in their area is not affordable. But the announcement does not address the concerns of those who would like to buy better coverage, yet find premiums in their area too expensive.\n\n\n\nDavid Oscar, an insurance broker in New Jersey, another high-cost state, said many of his clients had been disappointed to learn that the premiums were much more expensive than they had expected.\n\n\n\n\"They're frustrated,\" he said. \"Everybody was thinking that Obamacare was going to come in with more affordable rates. Well, they're not more affordable.\"\n\n\n\nMany of the biggest provisions of the Affordable Care Act are aimed squarely at the poorest of Americans. Under the law, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to a larger pool of people with the lowest incomes. To those earning more, the law provides subsidies to people earning up to four times the federal poverty level, or $45,960 for an individual and $62,040 for a couple.\n\n\n\nNinety percent of the country's uninsured population have incomes that fall below that level, according to one recent analysis. As a result, the subsidies \"are well targeted for people who are uninsured or underinsured,\" said Sara R. Collins, an executive with the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that finances health policy research. \"That is really where the firepower of the law is focused.\"\n\n\n\nFederal assistance is based on the cost of premiums for the second-cheapest silver, or midlevel, plan in a person's geographic area and are set so the amount the person must pay for coverage does not exceed a certain percentage of income, ranging from 2 to 9.5 percent.\n\n\n\nEven before the announcement on Thursday giving people with canceled plans the option of buying catastrophic coverage, the law permitted people to select such plans if the price of premiums in their area exceeded 8 percent of their income. The catastrophic plans are often less expensive and include three doctor visits and free preventive care, but require someone to pay almost all of the medical bills up to a certain amount, which is usually several thousand dollars.\n\n\n\nThat is the option that the Chapmans say they are likely to choose when their current insurance plan, which costs $665 a month, expires in September. Anthem is the only insurer offering plans in the marketplace in New Hampshire, and prices there are higher than in many other parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "partnerstory", "description": "An analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country.", "author": "Katie Thomas, Reed Abelson and Jo Craven McGinty", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "An analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country.", "title": "Obamacare's biggest losers: The middle class", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/21/new-health-law-frustrates-many-in-middle-class.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/12/18/101283414-455167135r.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An analysis by The New York Times shows the cost of premiums for people who just miss qualifying for subsidies varies widely across the country.", "title": "New health law frustrates many in middle class", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2013/12/21/new-health-law-frustrates-many-in-middle-class.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/12/18/101283414-455167135r.1910x1000.jpg"}, "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Obamacare, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2013-12-21T10:10:04-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2013-12-21T10:11:39-0500", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 101291264, "news_keywords": "Obamacare subsidies, Obamacare costs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd175a\"", "article_summary": "Under the law, states have the option of expanding Medicaid to a larger pool of people with the lowest incomes.\nThose plans have always been available to people under 30 and to those who can prove that the least expensive plan in their area is not affordable.\nBut the announcement does not address the concerns of those who would like to buy better coverage, yet find premiums in their area too expensive.\nTo those earning more, the law provides subsidies to people earning up to four times the federal poverty level, or $45,960 for an individual and $62,040 for a couple.\nWhile the number of people who just miss qualifying for subsidies is unclear, many of them have made their frustration known, helping fuel criticism of the law in recent weeks."}
