President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, have welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping (shee jihn-peeng) and his wife, Peng Liyuan (puhng LEE'-yoo-en), to the White House for a state dinner.

The black-tie dinner is being held in honor of Xi, who is in Washington on a state visit. China's leader and Obama met for several hours at the White House earlier Friday.

A 21-gun salute heralded his arrival for those talks. Xi was also treated to a State Department lunch with Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and others.

A state dinner is the glitzy end to a state visit.
