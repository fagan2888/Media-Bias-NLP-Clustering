Business leaders are opposed, while liberal groups say the move would benefit approximately 400,000 workers in the state.\n\nTuesday\u2019s rally is set to begin at 5 p.m. outside the Journal Square PATH station on Kennedy Boulevard.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bayonne City Council approved the Mayor Smith-supported Resolution CR-3, which asks residents to vote yes on Question 2.\n\n\u201cPaying a living wage should be the cornerstone of our economic recovery plan,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHelping people make a decent living and provide for their families strengthens our communities and actually helps business by fostering increased economic activity.\u201d\n\nCommunity labor leader and Bayonne\u2019s Third Ward Council Member Ray Greaves said that the raise would provide some relief to families struggling to make ends meet and encourage greater consumer spending.\n\nBut Francis Scklarski, owner of Amici\u2019s Fine Dining at 184 Broadway, said if the resolution passes, his business and others in Bayonne will suffer from having less money for payroll, effectively shrinking their work force through layoffs and a reduced likelihood for new hires.\n\n\u201cBy raising the minimum wage, you\u2019re kind of strangling the smaller business owners that need that labor force,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you cut the funding of small business, there\u2019s less for payroll.\u201d\n\nJournal staff writer Joseph Vena contributed to this report.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "bayonne,hoboken,jersey-city", "title": "Mayors of Jersey City, Hoboken, Bayonne to speak at minimum wage rally Tuesday", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Mayors of Jersey City, Hoboken, Bayonne to speak at minimum wage rally Tuesday\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/10/mayors_of_jersey_city_hoboken.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/journal-square-pathjpg-07863b1b88a594d6.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11459928\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-19T07:03:32Z\", \"author\": \"Terrence T.
