The one who, when asked about his view on the situation on Iraq, said he needed more time? Who said he couldn\u2019t answer questions about the situation at the Mexican border because \u201conly 11 days ago I was painting my storm windows\u201d?\n\nOf course you didn\u2019t. Because he is a she, and a Democrat. Her name is Amanda Curtis.\n\nYou certainly would have heard about a Republican candidate like that, though. He would have been banner-headline material on The Huffington Post, Salon, and other liberal redoubts. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert would have given him the business. Op/ed columnists around the country would have held him up as an example of how radical wingnuts had seized control of the GOP.\n\nAfter all: Any time some random Republican somewhere says something idiotic, you can pretty much count on it making national news. If he or she says something especially stupid (see: Akin, Todd) it\u2019s likely to launch a national debate, in the sense of \u201cdebate\u201d meaning \u201cweeks of discussion in which everyone agrees the comment was heinous and keeps saying so, over and over.\u201d\n\nThis happens with such regularity there\u2019s even a term for it (coined by Slate\u2019s David Weigel): the Republican Lawmaker Principle. There is, however, no corresponding Democratic Lawmaker Principle\u2014though not because Democrats never say outrageous things. They do, and the conservative blogosphere delights in raking them over the coals for it.\n\nBut the broader media generally don\u2019t pick up on Democratic inanities because, viewed through the filter of unconscious liberal bias, the comments are just unfortunate isolated incidents, rather than what dumb Republican comments are seen as: yet more data points supporting the thesis that Those People Are Swivel-Eyed Lunatics. This is true of every dumb Democratic remark, no matter how many occur.\n\nThis brings us back to Curtis, a state lawmaker in Montana. Democrats chose her to run for the Senate after the six-month incumbent, John Walsh, was busted for plagiarism.\n\nCurtis has said some unflattering things about gun rights, and Christians, and her desire to punch other lawmakers in the face\u2014all of them in YouTube diaries she broadcast as commentaries on the Montana legislative session. Nothing terribly far-out there. The far-out part is her association with the Wobblies.\n\nThe Wobblies are the Industrial Workers of the World, a hard-left union of historical vintage that let the 20th century pass it by. \u201cThe working class and the employing class have nothing in common,\u201d the group proclaims. \u201cBetween these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.\u201d\n\nNothing says \u201cmodern, forward-thinking progressive\u201d like warmed-over Lenin.\n\nCurtis\u2019 husband is more active in the IWW than she, but her admiration for communist economics doesn\u2019t stop there. Not long ago she replaced her Facebook profile picture with a photo of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, the former chairwoman of the Communist Party USA.\n\nQuestion: If a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate signified his admiration for the president of the American Nazi Party\u2014or even the John Birch Society\u2014do you think the media would find that at all newsworthy? Sure they would. What if a Republican had written for a newsletter of the Ku Klux Klan, as Curtis has written for the IWW? Ditto. Yet on the rare occasions when news outlets have seen fit to mention such details, they have done so in terms of conservatives \u201cpouncing on\u201d them. Man, those critics have some nerve, don\u2019t they?\n\nCurtis might be a fallback candidate, but that did not stop Montana Democrats from nominating her at a convention\u2014just as Virginia Republicans last year nominated E.W. Jackson, a fire-and-brimstone minister, to be the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. Jackson\u2019s off-the-wall ravings about the sickness inherent in homosexuality, the satanic peril of yoga and so forth turned him into an object of national sport\u2014and he wasn\u2019t even seeking national office.\n\nCurtis, however, is. Will she wind up getting the Jackson treatment before November? It\u2019s possible\u2014but don\u2019t sit on a hot stove while you wait.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/09/03/meet-the-left-wing-extremist-running-for", "type": "article", "site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Amanda Curtis seeks to replace plagiarist Democrat John Walsh.", "title": "Meet the Left-Wing Extremist Running for U.S. Senate"}, "twitter": {"title": "Meet the Left-Wing Extremist Running for U.S. Senate", "description": "Did you hear about the Republican candidate for Senate out West\nwho wants to overthrow the entire American economic system?
