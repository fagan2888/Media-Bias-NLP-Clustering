Pierre, SD

Prosecutors say a survey of county residents about a South Dakota murder case has been put on hold.



Seventeen-year-old Braiden McCahren, of Pierre, has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and other charges in the December 2012 shooting death of 16-year-old Dalton Williams. A trial date has been tentatively set for June. McCahren will be tried as an adult.



The survey seeking opinions on the case from Hughes County residents has been stopped until Judge John Brown can rule on the issue.



Beadle County State's Attorney Michael Moore, who is prosecuting the case, says his office did not authorize the survey. Calls to a defense attorney were not returned.



A status hearing on the case is scheduled April 8.
