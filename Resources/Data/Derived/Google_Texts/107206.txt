Students who attend Flatiron School for coding have a 99 percent chance of landing a job after completion, with an average starting salary of $70,000.

Go to college for four years, take out tens of thousands in student loans and hope that someone will hire you so you can pay off your debt. It may not be the American dream, but it has become the American standard. Flatiron School is hoping to change that.

Students at the New York City-based school pay $15,000 for four months of coding instruction. They leave with the ability to develop software, and according to Flatiron School, 99 percent of students get a job with an average starting salary of $70,000 a year.

Flatiron founders Adam Enbar and Avi Flombaum said they believe coding will be a form of literacy in the future.



"Just like you need to learn how to read and write, even if you're not going to be a journalist, you need to learn how to code and wield technology if you're going to be successful in the world," said Enbar.
