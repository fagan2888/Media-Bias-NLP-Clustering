According to Time, this extended recall follows Blue Bell\u2019s suspension of all operations at its Oklahoma production facilities after it was discovered as the site of a deadly form of food poisoning.\n\nThe company announced Tuesday, after FDA investigation, that several of its products tested positive for listeria monocytogenes, a potentially fatal bacterium. This form of foodborne bacteria can be found in improperly processed deli meats, or unpasteurized milk products and is particularly dangerous to pregnant women, the elderly, children, and individuals with a weakened immune system. Notably, this form of bacteria can survive refrigeration, and even freezing. Listeria sickens 1,600 people annually within the United States, but can be treated by antibiotics if taken soon after contracting the illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe recall has been extended to include Blue Bell\u2019s banana pudding ice cream, as well as all pints produced between Feb. 12 and March 27, 2015. These pints will be marked with O, P,Q, R, S, or T at the bottom of the carton. To be safe, the CDC cautions to refrain from consuming any of Blue Bell\u2019s products at this time until the situation has been rectified.\n\nFor a more extensive listing of recall items, visit Blue Bell Creameries\u2019 website.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "listeria, food poisoning, ice cream, blue bell", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Blue Bell extends recall on ice cream products after three die of food poisoning.", "title": "Blue Bell Recalls Ice Cream After 3 Food Poisoning Deaths", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blue-bell-issues-ice-cream-recall-after-3-die-listeria-food-poisoning-328528", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/ice-cream.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blue Bell extends recall on ice cream products after three die of food poisoning.", "title": "Blue Bell Recalls Ice Cream After 3 Food Poisoning Deaths", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/blue-bell-issues-ice-cream-recall-after-3-die-listeria-food-poisoning-328528", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/ice-cream.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/ice-cream.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-08T15:46:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T15:46:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Blue Bell extends recall on ice cream products after three die of food poisoning."}, "article_summary": "For a more extensive listing of recall items, visit Blue Bell Creameries\u2019 website.\nTo be safe, the CDC cautions to refrain from consuming any of Blue Bell\u2019s products at this time until the situation has been rectified.\nBlue Bell Creameries has expanded its recall on several of its products after three people died in Kansas last Friday upon eating their product.\nAccording to Time, this extended recall follows Blue Bell\u2019s suspension of all operations at its Oklahoma production facilities after it was discovered as the site of a deadly form of food poisoning.\nThe recall has been extended to include Blue Bell\u2019s banana pudding ice cream, as well as all pints produced between Feb. 12 and March 27, 2015."}
