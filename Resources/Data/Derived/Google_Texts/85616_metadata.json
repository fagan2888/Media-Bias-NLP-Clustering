They note that Indiana doesn\u2019t currently have any laws prohibiting discrimination against gay people.\n\nNBA, WNBA, Indiana Pacers and Indiana Fever: \u201cThe game of basketball is grounded in long established principles of inclusion and mutual respect. We will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome at all NBA and WNBA events in Indiana and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nPacers and Fever owner Herb Simon added: \u201cThe Indiana Pacers, Indiana Fever and Bankers Life Fieldhouse have the strongest possible commitment to inclusion and non-discrimination on any basis. Everyone is always welcome at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That has always been the policy from the very beginning of the Simon family\u2019s involvement and it always will be.\u201d\n\nApple: CEO Tim Cook tweeted that \u201cApple is open for everyone. We are deeply disappointed in Indiana\u2019s new law\u2026 Around the world, we strive to treat every customer the same \u2014 regardless of where they come from, how they worship or who they love.\u201d\n\nIndiana Chamber of Commerce: \u201cIn our eyes, the law is entirely unnecessary. Passing the law was always going to bring the state unwanted attention.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly: \u201cWe certainly understand the implications this legislation has on our ability to attract and retain employees. Simply put, we believe discriminatory legislation is bad for Indiana and for business.\u201d\n\nEli Lilly employs more than 11,700 workers in Indiana, mostly in Indianapolis.\n\nNCAA: \u201cWe are especially concerned about how this legislation could affect our student-athletes and employees.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis is a major destination for conventions and sporting events, including the upcoming NCAA Final Four college basketball tournament.\n\nNCAA President Mark Emmert said the NCAA will \u201cwork diligently\u201d to ensure competitors and visitors at next week\u2019s Final Four are not \u201cnegatively impacted by this bill.\u201d\n\nGen Con, the video game convention: The law would \u201cfactor into our decision making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.\u201d\n\nThe convention brought 56,000 people to the state last year, according to Gen Con CEO Adrian Swartout.\n\nSalesforce: CEO Marc Benioff said on Twitter that his company will \u201cdramatically reduce our investments\u201d in Indiana, calling the law an \u201coutrage.\u201d Benioff called on other CEOs in the tech industry to follow suit.\n\nYelp: CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said the company will \u201cmake every effort\u201d to expand its corporate operations in states that do not have such laws on the books. \u201cThese laws set a terrible precedent that will likely harm the broader economic health of the states where they have been adopted, the businesses currently operating in those states and, most importantly, the consumers who could be victimized under these laws.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "40.267194;-86.134902", "description": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Add Angie's List to the roster of companies and business interests taking a stand against Indiana's new anti-gay law.
