About a third of its business is insuring individuals, a third is small-group policies and a third is large-group insurance policies, he said.\n\nThat diversity, Lalime said, makes HealthyCT less vulnerable to changes impacting the state insurance exchanges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe acknowledged, though, that several things add \u201csome level of variability into the mix,\u201d including ongoing changes to the ACA.\n\nLike most health co-ops, HealthyCT is funded in part by a federal grant and loan program. It received its initial funding in 2012, as did 22 co-ops in other states. HealthyCT began its first open enrollment period Nov. 1, 2013, and insured its first members in January 2014, according to Lalime.\n\nSo far, it has lost money every year. It reported a $27 million loss for 2015 in its Annual Health Statement filed with the Connecticut Department of Insurance. The trend nationally has been similar with most co-ops reporting losses.\n\nBut Lalime said that, like many startups, HealthyCT was not expected to be immediately profitable.\n\n\u201cThis is not an easy business or there\u2019d be more people in it,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of those losses are because you\u2019re building scale. The first couple years, you\u2019re just trying to find your footing.\u201d\n\nHe expects the co-op to become profitable early in 2017, but wouldn\u2019t venture an estimate on what that profit would be.\n\nAnd, despite its losses, HealthyCT\u2019s Annual Statement showed the co-op had $92.2 million in cash and invested assets last year, which Lalime said means it\u2019s able to pay all of its obligations.\n\n\u201cWe expect this to be a good turnaround year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are on track, based on our business plan.\u201d\n\nConsumers shouldn\u2019t be scared off from co-ops that aren\u2019t profitable, especially this early, according to Kelly Crowe, CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based National Alliance of State Health Co-Ops. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that they are under oversight not only from the federal government but their state regulators as well,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cRegulators ultimately decide to license and allow insurers on the exchange, and these decisions are made with the best interests of the consumer in mind.\u201d\n\nIn its first year, 2014, HealthyCT had 8,116 members. That number surged to 41,238 at the end of 2015, and at the end of March had dipped to 39,375, Lalime said.\n\nHe attributed the recent drop to higher HealthyCT premiums, but said the co-op is expected to end 2016 with 10 percent more members than 2015.\n\nSome new members likely will migrate to HealthyCT once UnitedHealthcare makes its planned exit from Connecticut\u2019s insurance exchange, he said.\n\nNationwide, health insurance co-ops have disappeared in Iowa, Nebraska, New York and other states.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that most of these health care co-ops have failed,\u201d said Angela Mattie, professor of management and chair of health care management and organizational leadership at Quinnipiac University\u2019s School of Business and Engineering in Hamden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated business; it\u2019s very dependent on getting the right pool of applicants,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need to spread the risk, and if you\u2019re unable to spread the risk then you get hit with some large catastrophic losses.\u201d\n\nHealthyCT, she said, has benefitted from having the right leaders who know how to navigate changes in health care and make smart business decisions.\n\n\u201cConnecticut has been lucky,\u201d she said.\n\nMany of the co-ops that failed grew too quickly, Lalime said. A lot also suffered, he said, from a change in the so-called \u201crisk corridor.\u201d\n\nThe risk corridor, a provision of the ACA, initially let co-ops that record major losses tap into funds that were a combination of federal dollars and money that had been contributed by the co-ops, he said. Due to changes in the law, however, co-ops have never received the full amount they expected from the government, Lalime said.\n\n\u201cThat one event did cause many issues with co-ops,\u201d he said.\n\nHealthyCT attributed $4 million of its 2015 loss in part to the impact of the risk corridor change.\n\n\u201cThe things we can\u2019t control are the ones that can cause a little bit of variability,\u201d Lalime said.\n\nAmid some struggles, there are \u201csigns of financial strength\u201d among co-ops, said Crowe, noting Maryland\u2019s co-op, Evergreen Health, announced in April it turned its first quarterly profit.\n\n\u201cBut the fact that a co-op\u2019s financial health can change from quarter to quarter is yet another indication that the promises of the risk programs still need to be fulfilled, and additional time is needed to fully judge the success of the co-op model,\u201d Crowe added. \u201cWe see reasons for optimism based on early results.\u201d\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (www.c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "title": "Connecticut\u2019s health insurance co-op projects profit in 2017", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20160524/connecticuts-health-insurance-co-op-projects-profit-in-2017", "image": {"width": "807px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160524/NEWS/160529784/AR/0/AR-160529784.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1008px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Connecticut\u2019s health insurance co-op projects profit in 2017"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "More than a dozen of the cooperative health insurers that started under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have failed, but leaders of Connecticut\u2019s co-op say it is on track to turn a profit next year.", "title": "Connecticut\u2019s health insurance co-op projects profit in 2017", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20160524/connecticuts-health-insurance-co-op-projects-profit-in-2017", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160524/NEWS/160529784/AR/0/AR-160529784.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "News, New Haven news, CT news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "More than a dozen of the cooperative health insurers that started under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) have failed, but leaders of Connecticut\u2019s co-op say it is on track to turn a profit next year."}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re very viable,\u201d said Ken Lalime, CEO of Wallingford-based HealthyCT, a member-run, nonprofit health insurance co-op.\nNationwide, health insurance co-ops have disappeared in Iowa, Nebraska, New York and other states.\nLike most health co-ops, HealthyCT is funded in part by a federal grant and loan program.\nAmid some struggles, there are \u201csigns of financial strength\u201d among co-ops, said Crowe, noting Maryland\u2019s co-op, Evergreen Health, announced in April it turned its first quarterly profit.\nSome new members likely will migrate to HealthyCT once UnitedHealthcare makes its planned exit from Connecticut\u2019s insurance exchange, he said."}
