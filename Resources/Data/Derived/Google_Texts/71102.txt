Today, with just over four weeks until World AIDS Day (December 1), we are honored to provide an important video message about World AIDS Day that introduces this yearâ€™s theme: Focus. Partner. Achieve: An AIDS-free Generation.

In this video, Dr. Ronald Valdiserri, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health, Infectious Diseases and Director of the Office of HIV/AIDS and Infectious Disease Policy for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, highlights the importance of targeted work, and collaborative efforts. He reiterates our shared goals related to responding to the epidemic and speaks to how our combined efforts will improve outcomes along the HIV care continuum, moving us toward the end of the epidemic.

We hope you will view this video, and share it with your colleagues, friends, family and clients.

As you prepare to commemorate World AIDS Day, how will you focus, partner and achieve?
