Those George W. Bush ornaments \u2013 or rather, the ornaments by the artist known as \u201c43\u201d \u2013 not quite cutting it?\n\nThe Senate Conservatives Fund has a solution. Those who donate $10 now, not only help the group repeal Obamacare, but also receive a \u201cTed Cruz Was Right\u201d bumper sticker.\n\nThe sticker is meant to refer to Cruz\u2019s call to defund the health care act, but it also works if the gift recipient agrees with any of Cruz\u2019s commentary on the reality TV show Duck Dynasty, which was a part of his 21-hour speech denouncing Obamacare. Do you think most things can be fixed with duck tape and extension cords? You agree with Ted Cruz!\n\nFor the young and young at heart, the Really Big Coloring Books company has the perfect present \u2013 a coloring book starring none other than Texas\u2019 junior senator.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to parents around the country and they really enjoy seeing modern day people in children\u2019s literature,\u201d said the company\u2019s founder Wayne Bell, in a YouTube video.\n\nThe books contains snippets of Cruz trivia, the Ten Commandments and commentary on Cruz\u2019s talk-a-thon. An excerpt:\n\n\u201cA lot of the career establishment politicians are far too out of shape, old or overweight to even perform such a magnificent feat, God bless them all.\u201d\n\nBell did not speak with Cruz before writing the book nor did he donate to his Senate campaign, so if you\u2019re going for Cruz authenticity, get the bumper stickers.\n\nThe Really Big Coloring Books company also carries an Occupy Wall Street coloring book and a 9/11 coloring book, where youngsters can color in a picture of Osama bin Laden\u2019s assassination.\n\nHappy Holidays!", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMi9oYXZlLWEtbWVycnktY3J1ei1tYXMtd2l0aC1jb2xvcmluZy1ib29rcy1hbmQtYnVtcGVyLXN0aWNrZXJzLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Emily Wilkins", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "Update 12:08 p.m. : The coloring book is currently the top seller among\u00a0children's coloring books\u00a0at Amazon.com.
