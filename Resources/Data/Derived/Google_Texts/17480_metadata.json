We've seen Russian markets go down substantially, the ruble go down and investors sitting on the fence,\u201d Blinken said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cRussia is paying a price for this.\u201d\n\nBut Obama really is weak: But Republican adversaries aren\u2019t buying it.\n\n\u201cThe administration thought if we just act nice, everyone will act nice with us. That's not way that Putin and the Russian Federation sees the rest of the world,\u201d Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d\n\nOn CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Rep. Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and potential 2016 presidential candidate, criticized the United States\u2019 \u201creset\u201d policy with Russia as \u201cwishful, na\u00efve thinking\u201d \u2013 a targeted jab at fellow potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who led that policy as secretary of state.\n\nAnd former Vice President Dick Cheney, a foreign policy hawk, was the most pointed: \u201cWe have created an image around the world - not just for the Russians - of weakness, of indecisiveness,\u201d he told CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d guest host Charlie Rose.\n\nCheney said the world is \u201ca safer, more stable place when the United States leads, when we have significant military capability, and when people know we will use it if necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey no longer fear us,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe Syrian situation is a classic - we got all ready to do something, but \u2026 at the last minute, Obama backed off.\u201d\n\nSyria is not Ukraine: When CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley asked Blinken whether Putin sensed weakness after watching the United States deal with Syria, Blinken said the civil war in Syria and the United States\u2019 policy there had no bearing on Ukraine.\n\n\u201cThe notion that this is somehow a result of Syria makes very little sense to me. This is about Ukraine,\u201d he said, adding that Obama and the United States are \u201cdoing the leading\u201d against Putin.\n\nBob Gates, former defense secretary for both Obama\u2019s and President George W. Bush\u2019s administrations, defended the President on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\nHe said criticism of the President \u201cought to be toned down while he\u2019s trying to handle the crisis,\u201d Gates said.\n\nRemember Georgia? Rogers, of Michigan, said Russia\u2019s actions in Crimea are similar to what Russia did in Georgia in 2008.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this story before, and when we didn\u2019t react \u2026 we ended up buying into bigger trouble later, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing happening,\u201d he said.\n\nGates said President Bush didn\u2019t receive the same criticism then as Obama is receiving now.\n\n\u201cMy own view is, after all, Putin invaded Georgia when George W. Bush was President. Nobody ever accused George W. Bush of being weak or unwilling to use military force.\u201d\n\nCheney addressed that, saying the Bush administration did respond to Russia\u2019s invasion of Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe did take some steps in terms of providing assistance to Georgia. We had ships in the region and so forth,\u201d Cheney told Rose.\n\nTwo paths \u2013 for Russia and for the United States: Blinken laid out the Obama administration\u2019s plan:\n\n\u201cWhat Putin is seeing is the President mobilizing the international community, both in support of Ukraine and isolate Russia for its actions in Ukraine,\u201d Blinken said. He added that Russia has a choice to make: continue to push forward in Ukraine and face economic repercussions, or retreat.\n\nBlinken on @CNNsotu: \"The door is clearly open to resolving this diplomatically.\" #Ukraine \u2192 http://t.co/XhPGB4Gbum, pic.twitter.com/PilvGpkjsw \u2014 Andrea Purse (@Purse44) March 9, 2014\n\n\u201cThe President made it very clear in announcing our sanctions, as did the Europeans the other day, that this was a first step,\u201d Blinken said.\n\nBut some Republicans outline a different path for Obama to take.\n\nCheney said the ballistic missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland should be put back on the table. He also said the United States should conduct joint military training exercises in Poland and provide equipment and training to the Ukrainian military.\n\nOil and natural gas: Republicans, who have been pushing the Obama administration to expand domestic oil and natural gas production, read from similar scripts Sunday, saying American energy production is critical to minimizing Putin\u2019s international influence.\n\nRyan: \u201cWe're a nation with vast energy reserve and potential but with a government that's seen as hostile toward developing those energy reserves. If our government changed its tune on that, if we told Europe we are going to green light the languishing permit applications for exporting natural gas to Europe, that could do a lot to send signals that we're intent on loosening Russia's grip on its energy to Europe.\u201d\n\nRep. Peter King of New York on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d: \u201cWe have to increase exports of liquefied natural gas. These countries like England and others and Germany cannot be forced to rely on Russia. \u2026 The natural gas - we have enough to supply so many countries in the world. And we should right now start lifting restrictions. We should begin exporting as quickly as we can.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d: I \u201cwould immediately get every obstacle out of the way for our export of oil and gas, and I would begin drilling in every possible conceivable place within our territories in order to have production that we could supply Europe with if it's interrupted from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nCheney: \u201cEnergy is also a weakness for Russia. They depend on Petroleum for 50% of their GDP. Price of oil drops a few dollars, they go into recession.\u201d\n\nRand Paul is not weak, either: Paul pushed back on criticism from fellow Republicans that he is an isolationist, saying those who criticize him do so for \u201ctheir own person political gain.\u201d\n\nPaul recently said the United States needs to have a \u201crespectful - sometimes adversarial but a respectful \u2013 relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, what Ronald Reagan said in about one sentence sums up a lot of what I believe. He said to our potential adversary, \u2018Don't mistake our reluctance for war for a lack of resolve,\u2019\u201d Paul said.\n\nNow for some politics: The annual Conservative Political Action Conference wrapped up Sunday with Sarah Palin reading a parody of Dr. Seuss\u2019 children\u2019s book \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham.\u201d\n\nBut the real headline- grabbers from the conference were the nearly dozen possible 2016 presidential contenders who addressed the activist crowd and the fact that Paul was the overwhelming winner of the straw poll.\n\nAs Paul put it, CPAC is a friendly crowd because it is \u201cchock full of young people\u201d who share his concern over privacy rights even though he is also reaching out to Attorney General Eric Holder to repeal felon voting bans.\n\n\u201cI don't mind saying that I agree with the President or Eric Holder on this because I think the people who know me know that I will stand up to the President when he's wrong, which I think is quite a bit of the time,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul joked that at a friendly lunch to talk about felon voting, Paul said to Holder, \"I'll see you in court,\" referring to his suit against he Obama administration's surveillance program.\n\nHis statements are a contrast to those of fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been a major pain to many of his colleagues because he doesn\u2019t play by the rules and holds little regard for taking one for the team.\n\nCruz told the CPAC crowd that Republicans who \u201cdon't stand and draw a clear distinction\u201d or don\u2019t stand for principle don\u2019t win.\n\nSen. Paul says he\u2019s focused on making GOP bigger, not taking Cruz\u2019s approach http://t.co/ycpggS9WxE \u2014 CNN Political Ticker (@PoliticalTicker) March 9, 2014\n\nRyan said Republican Party disagreements aren\u2019t a civil war but rather show that the party has a \u201cbig tent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we're a party with a vibrant debate adding ideas, solving problems. We're going to be OK,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new Democrat has some words for the old Democrats: Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running to win his job back - this time as a Democrat - had loads of praise for Obama.\n\nHe said Obama has \u201ca compassionate heart,\u201d is \u201cleading well\u201d and that Democrats need to \u201csupport him.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod bless him,\u201d Crist said about Obama twice during the interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nAs for the endangered Democrats up for re-election who are running from the Affordable Care Act, Crist said they need to \u201cstrengthen up.\u201d\n\nThe kicker: Ryan and Paul both enlightened us one more time about their plans for a 2016 presidential run. They both are considering.\n\nRyan also said House Speaker John Boehner is \u201ccontroversial but doing a very good job.\u201d But Ryan has no interest in taking on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Sunday political talk shows were stacked with Republicans, and most of them said President Barack Obama has repeatedly showed weakness in his foreign policy, bolstering Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s resolve and agenda in Ukraine.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Sunday Chatter: GOP hold up \u2018Obama-is-weak\u2019 card; GOP angling", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/03/09/sunday-chatter-gop-hold-up-obama-is-weak-card-gop-angling/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140309095016-exp-sotu-crowley-tony-blinken-ukraine-russia-00002001-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Sunday political talk shows were stacked with Republicans, and most of them said President Barack Obama has repeatedly showed weakness in his foreign policy, bolstering Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s resolve and agenda in Ukraine.", "title": "Sunday Chatter: GOP hold up \u2018Obama-is-weak\u2019 card; GOP angling"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "dick cheney, obama administration, paul ryan, rand paul, russia, ted cruz, ukraine, uncategorized, vladimir putin, by cnn's leigh ann caldwell", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca4f7\"", "article_summary": "He also said the United States should conduct joint military training exercises in Poland and provide equipment and training to the Ukrainian military.\nThis is about Ukraine,\u201d he said, adding that Obama and the United States are \u201cdoing the leading\u201d against Putin.\nCheney said the world is \u201ca safer, more stable place when the United States leads, when we have significant military capability, and when people know we will use it if necessary.\u201d\u201cThey no longer fear us,\u201d he added.\nCharlie Crist, who is running to win his job back - this time as a Democrat - had loads of praise for Obama.\nHe added that Russia has a choice to make: continue to push forward in Ukraine and face economic repercussions, or retreat."}
