Dudzinsky Jr., Michael A. Hepburn and Paul R. Lang; counsel Meredith O\u2019Leary; and senior attorney Andrea Gehman, their new firm announced this week in a press release.\n\n\u201cSutherland has long advised leading cable and telecommunications companies on their tax and benefits matters, and these lawyers enhance our tax and benefits services while expanding our range of industry service across all facets of transactional work, employment law and litigation,\u201d said W. Mark Smith, who heads the Sutherland employee benefits and executive compensation practice group. \u201cIt\u2019s a meaningful expansion of service into an important and rapidly evolving sector.\u201d\n\nWith other recent attorney additions to the firm, its tech, media and telecommunications practice group now has some 50 attorneys, managing partner Mark D. Wasserman notes in the release.\n\nFour lawyers from the Atlanta office of Dow Lohnes also recently joined Sutherland Asbill, as a Daily Report article last month detailed.\n\nThey are Matt Block, a corporate practitioner, and litigator Jason McCarter, both partners; corporate associate J.D. Shipman; and litigation attorney Stephanie Philips.\n\nA decision by a major Dow Lohnes client, Cox Enterprises, to spread its work among more law firms prompted that move, the Daily Report says.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping a number of folks transition their practices elsewhere,\u201d Peter Canfield of Dow Lohnes told the publication. \u201cMatt and Jason and J.D. and Stephanie are all great lawyers. We\u2019re glad they\u2019re at Sutherland, and we wish them the best.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "dcterms.description": "A five-lawyer group with a tech, media and telecommunications focus has leapt from Dow Lohnes to the Washington, D.C., office of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan.It includes partners William &quot;Bill&quot; S.", "description": "A five-lawyer group with a tech, media and telecommunications focus has leapt from Dow Lohnes to the Washington, D.C., office of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan.It includes partners William &quot;Bill&quot; S.", "application-name": "ABA Journal", "author": "Martha Neil", "og": {"site_name": "ABA Journal", "description": "A five-lawyer group with a tech, media and telecommunications focus has leapt from Dow Lohnes to the Washington, D.C., office of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan.It includes partners William &quot;Bill&quot; S.", "title": "5-lawyer tech, media and telecom group exits Dow Lohnes for Sutherland Asbill", "url": "http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/5-lawyer_tech_media_and_telecom_group_exits_dow_lohnes_for_sutherland_asbil/", "image": "http://www.abajournal.com/images/topic_images/law_firms.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.rights": "\u00a9 2004-2016", "twitter": {"description": "A five-lawyer group with a tech, media and telecommunications focus has leapt from Dow Lohnes to the Washington, D.C., office of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan.It includes partners William &quot;Bill&quot; S.", "title": "5-lawyer tech, media and telecom group exits Dow Lohnes for Sutherland Asbill"}, "robots": "All", "dcterms.creator": "ABA Journal", "keywords": "ABA Journal, legal news, law, States, Media & Communications Law, Law Firms, Science & Technology Law, Georgia, Partners, Associates, District of Columbia", "dcterms.contributor": "Martha Neil", "dcterms.title": "5-lawyer tech, media and telecom group exits Dow Lohnes for Sutherland Asbill"}, "article_summary": "Home Daily News 5-lawyer tech, media and telecom group exits\u2026Law Firms5-lawyer tech, media and telecom group exits Dow Lohnes for Sutherland AsbillA five-lawyer group with a tech, media and telecommunications focus has leapt from Dow Lohnes to the Washington, D.C., office of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan.\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping a number of folks transition their practices elsewhere,\u201d Peter Canfield of Dow Lohnes told the publication.\nFour lawyers from the Atlanta office of Dow Lohnes also recently joined Sutherland Asbill, as a Daily Report article last month detailed.\nA decision by a major Dow Lohnes client, Cox Enterprises, to spread its work among more law firms prompted that move, the Daily Report says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a meaningful expansion of service into an important and rapidly evolving sector.\u201dWith other recent attorney additions to the firm, its tech, media and telecommunications practice group now has some 50 attorneys, managing partner Mark D.
