They are disruptive,\u201d Gregory Poland, lead of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group told Forbes in 2015. Putative costs include medical treatment and lost wages/time at work. Disneyland also lost potential profits and visitors as a result of public concern.Treatment for one measles patient is over $10,000 according to the Fiscal Times. In comparison, the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is listed as only $99.99 per dose at Walgreens and is also covered under the Affordable Care Act.Emily Webb, Alaska mother whose vaccinated infant daughter tested positive for measles after a visit to Disneyland told CBS News that she wants \u201cpeople to be aware and to vaccinate their kids because that\u2019s the whole reason that she got sick in the first place.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider sums up t he value of vaccines, saying that the vaccinations that the 4.1 million children born in the US in 2009 received is estimated to have saved $13.5 billion in potential treatment costs and another $70 billion in costs to society.Some still remain skeptical despite the high costs of the Disneyland outbreak and relatively low costs of vaccines. The National Vaccine Information Center, a nonprofit organization that monitors negative outcomes and problems with vaccination, has stated that many of those involved in the Disneyland outbreak had been vaccinated. The group suggests that the hype over the outbreak may have \u201cmore to do with covering up vaccine failures\u201d to profit pharmaceutical companies than with public health.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "disneyland, measles, outbreak", "pubdate": "2015-05-29T08:22:49", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The measles outbreak in Disneyland at the end of 2014 and early 2015 caused 147 people to fall ill, spread to 12 states, Mexico, and Canada \u2014 and had financial blowback.", "title": "Financial Impact of Measles Outbreak at Disneyland", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/disneyland-measles-outbreak/2015/05/29/id/647438/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/disneyland-measles-outbreak/2015/05/29/id/647438/", "title": "Financial Impact of Measles Outbreak at Disneyland", "description": "The measles outbreak in Disneyland at the end of 2014 and early 2015 caused 147 people to fall ill, spread to 12 states, Mexico, and Canada \u2014 and had financial blowback.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1432887769, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "disneyland, measles, outbreak", "article": {"section": "FastFeatures", "published_time": "2015-05-29T08:22:49"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/disneyland-measles-outbreak/2015/05/29/id/647438/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The measles outbreak in Disneyland at the end of 2014 and early 2015 caused 147 people to fall ill, spread to 12 states, Mexico, and Canada \u2014 and had financial blowback."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17dc\"", "article_summary": "The measles outbreak in Disneyland at the end of 2014 and early 2015 caused 147 people to fall ill, spread to 12 states, Mexico, and Canada \u2014 and had financial blowback.\u201cThese outbreaks have economic costs.\nThe National Vaccine Information Center, a nonprofit organization that monitors negative outcomes and problems with vaccination, has stated that many of those involved in the Disneyland outbreak had been vaccinated.\nDisneyland also lost potential profits and visitors as a result of public concern.Treatment for one measles patient is over $10,000 according to the Fiscal Times.\nThe group suggests that the hype over the outbreak may have \u201cmore to do with covering up vaccine failures\u201d to profit pharmaceutical companies than with public health.\nThey are disruptive,\u201d Gregory Poland, lead of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Vaccine Research Group told Forbes in 2015."}
