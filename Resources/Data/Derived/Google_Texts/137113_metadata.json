I suspect you do already, but if not, go ahead and do a Google image search for that phrase: \u201cWoman in a bikini.\u201d Save a few preggos of the \u201cswallowed a basketball\u201d variety, there\u2019s almost no variation in body type among the top results. Women in bikinis are thin, and young. They are usually white, but tan. Their breasts are between a generous B-cup and a modest D-cup. Their hips are just a bit wider than their waists.\n\nEven Bethany Townsend, the 23-year-old English woman with Crohn\u2019s disease who recently made international news after posting a shot of herself in a bikini with her colostomy bag visible, otherwise adheres quite closely to the \u201cWoman in a bikini\u201d formula. Young and conventionally beautiful, she told ABC News she\u2019s considering a modeling career, after receiving so much praise for the viral photo.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201c\u2018I Don\u2019t Want to Be a Girl'\u201d\n\nThe woman who keeps popping up in my newsfeed, though, is not thin, tan, or easily contained by a few scraps of fabric. She\u2019s Jenny Trout, who wrote the marvelous essay, \u201cI Wore a Bikini and Nothing Happened,\u201d and she looks basically like I would in a bikini, if I ever wore one.\n\nI will never wear one.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: I adore Trout\u2019s essay, and shared it moments after I read it. She\u2019s hilarious, and absolutely correct in her assessment of why people respond negatively to the thought\u2014let alone the sight\u2014of a fat woman in a bikini. \u201cThe reason these people do not want to see a fat body in a bikini is because traditionally, that garment is something a woman earns by proving herself attractive enough to exist. If fat women begin wearing them without shame or fear, what\u2019s next? Will they have self-esteem? Will they demand respect? Then what will keep them in their proper place?\u201d\n\nExactly. The culture tells us that women\u2019s job is to be sexy according to a very narrow set of standards, and to hide in shame if we fail. The \u201cfatkini\u201d is a hearty fuck-you to that job description, and I love it for that. I hope Jenny Trout\u2019s post, like Gabi Gregg\u2019s collaboration with Swimsuits for All, will inspire hundreds, thousands, millions of women to be their own bosses when it comes to hotness.\n\nI still don\u2019t want to wear a bikini.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m ashamed of my fat, wrinkly, blemished, pale, veiny, scarred, bug-bitten, normal, human body. I spent years getting to the point where I\u2019m perfectly happy walking around in said body, and even co-wrote a book about how to do that. The reason I don\u2019t want to wear a bikini has nothing to do with fear of strangers\u2019 judgment or any residual self-hatred; it\u2019s that\u2014I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed this\u2014wearing a bikini is exactly like wearing your bra and undies in public.\n\nMore from DAME: \u201cIs Melissa McCarthy a Big Sellout?\u201d\n\nThere are people of all sizes and shapes who would walk around in their underwear if local laws and customs permitted it. I am not one of those people. I like my shorts bermuda-length, my tank-top straps wide, and my necklines at least high enough to keep crumbs from dropping into my bra. Even with all those limits in place, every year, when I transition to summer clothes, I feel like a blinky, befuddled infant for the first few days. There\u2019s sun touching my calves! And upper arms!
