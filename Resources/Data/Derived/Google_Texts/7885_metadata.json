Their presence in Peru is, in a way, a surprise; vociferous and sometimes violent activists have occasionally rebuffed Chinese resource-extraction projects in the country. Many local residents are concerned about negative environmental consequences and worried that they won\u2019t reap any real benefits from the projects. Nevertheless the investment continues: In 2010, the Chinese mining companies Minmetals, Chinalco, Shougang and Zijing Mining Group announced plans to invest more than $7 billion in Peruvian mining projects by 2017. And as each mineral-laden ship chugs out of the harbor in Lima to cross the Pacific, China further solidifies its status as an important strategic partner for Peru.\n\nThe two countries are separated by more than 10,000 miles, but China has a long history with Peru. In the mid-1800s, more than 100,000 Chinese laborers braved months-long journeys to move to the South American country in order to work as indentured servants, and today, a sizable portion of Peru\u2019s residents trace part of their ancestry back to China. Peru is currently home to the largest ethnic Chinese population in Latin America, and over the last two centuries the Asian country\u2019s immigrants have influenced Peru\u2019s culture, cuisine, and community life. As the Peruvian government has pushed forward with pro-export economic policies and China has sought to tap into Peru\u2019s natural resource wealth, the relationship between the two countries has grown. When Lima started privatizing mining companies in the early 1990s, Shougang was one of the first companies to invest in the market, and the two countries signed a bilateral free trade pact in 2009. The relationship shows no sign of abating. After an April 2013 meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Peru\u2019s President Ollanta Humala said, \u201cFor us, China is today a major trading partner and we believe that, as the events are developing, Peru may be the primary center of Chinese investment in Latin America.\u201d Xi Jinping was no less effusive, saying that upcoming meetings between the two leaders \u201cwill give a major boost to the strategic partnership between China and Peru.\u201d However, slowing Chinese manufacturing activity, combined with rising discontent among Peruvian indigenous groups, may threaten the China-Peru investment boom. Lima recently announced that the country\u2019s economy grew at 5 percent in May, well below Peru\u2019s average rate of growth over the last decade, a drop caused by cooling mineral exports to China, which is experiencing a slowdown of its own. Between April and June 2013, China\u2019s year-on-year GDP growth dipped to 7.5 percent, down from 7.7 percent for the period between January and Marc, and in July, China\u2019s manufacturing growth rate fell to an 11 month low due to weak export demand from the U.S. and Europe. The economy is expected to cool further by the year\u2019s end, a trend that will have a ripple effect on Peru.\n\nIn addition to problems caused by the economic slowdown, a new phenomenon is now testing the China-Peru relationship: anti-mining projects led by rural residents and indigenous groups. Alana Tummino, a Latin America researcher from the Americas Society, told me that \u201cMany of Peru\u2019s mines are located in poor areas often close to indigenous communities, and the number of social conflicts in Peru has risen drastically in the past few years involving mining concessions and investment.\u201d Slowing growth in Peru could force the government to reduce the budget for social spending and pressure President Humala to pay more attention to the protesters\u2019 demands. In 2011, Lima created a new law adhering to the International Labor Organization\u2019s Convention 169, a legally binding international statue that gives indigenous communities a voice in approving extractive projects that affect their communities. And this May, after several years of heated demonstrations against mining projects, Peru\u2019s government passed a new \u201cPrior Consultation\u201d law that gives certain indigenous groups the right to a non-binding vote of approval on any project that affects their communities. More symbolically President Humala also attended a ceremony in an isolated Amazon town where 33 people died in protests in 2009. Nevertheless, protests by indigenous groups still present a serious, disruptive risk to mining projects. Chinese companies in Peru continue to feel the pressure from the protests. The Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) has faced bitter opposition to a project in the Morococha district of Peru that entails relocating and housing 5,000 residents. And in January 2013 Lumina Copper, another Chinese company, put a $2.5 billion project in Peru\u2019s Cajamarca region on hold after facing ongoing protests and fervent opposition from local community groups. Is general anti-Chinese sentiment the issue? Keith Slack, the Global Program Manager of the NGO Oxfam\u2019s Americas Extractive Industries program, doesn\u2019t think so. \u201cThere isn\u2019t specific hostility to Chinese companies per se. Communities in Chinese company project areas in some cases might not even be aware that a project is Chinese-owned,\u201d he said. Indeed, protests against the mining interests of other countries\u2014such as Canada\u2014have even turned violent in recent years.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Eager to invest in the South American country, Chinese companies have struggled to overcome environmental protests led by indigenous groups.", "author": "Nathaniel Parish Flannery", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Eager to invest in the South American country, Chinese companies have struggled to overcome environmental protests led by indigenous groups.", "title": "How China's Relations With Peru Explain its Approach to Diplomacy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/09/rtxyd3q/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/09/how-chinas-relations-with-peru-explain-its-approach-to-diplomacy/279618/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Nevertheless the investment continues: In 2010, the Chinese mining companies Minmetals, Chinalco, Shougang and Zijing Mining Group announced plans to invest more than $7 billion in Peruvian mining projects by 2017.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t specific hostility to Chinese companies per se.\nChinese companies in Peru continue to feel the pressure from the protests.\nTheir presence in Peru is, in a way, a surprise; vociferous and sometimes violent activists have occasionally rebuffed Chinese resource-extraction projects in the country.\nCommunities in Chinese company project areas in some cases might not even be aware that a project is Chinese-owned,\u201d he said."}
