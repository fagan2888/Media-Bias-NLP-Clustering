According to Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey, 70 percent of employers said PPACA has made them rethink their employee benefit offerings, compared to 30 percent who said the health care reform law hadn\u2019t had any impact on their offerings.

However, in 2016, Orica plans to launch a new expanded program that includes the use of biometrics to enable employees to receive discounted premiums. Slightly half (52 percent) of the survey respondents offered flexible working benefits, compared to 48 percent that did not. However, 68 percent offered retirement benefits, as opposed to 32 percent that did not.\n\nThe survey also delved into how employers felt about their brokers\u2019 service, though 24 percent said they did not use a benefits broker or an agent. Of those who did use a broker or an agent, the vast majority (84 percent) were commission-based, as opposed to 16 percent who were fee-based.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Katie Kuehner-Hebert", "description": "According to Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey, 70 percent of employers said PPACA has made them rethink their employee benefit offerings, compared to 30 percent who said the health care reform law hadn\u2019t had any impact on their offerings.", "og": {"url": "http://www.benefitspro.com/2014/09/23/benefits-sellings-2014-employer-survey", "image": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/09/23/q882.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "According to Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey, 70 percent of employers said PPACA has made them rethink their employee benefit offerings, compared to 30 percent who said the health care reform law hadn\u2019t had any impact on their offerings.", "title": "Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey, 70 percent of employers said PPACA has made them rethink their employee benefit offerings, compared to 30 percent who said the health care reform law hadn\u2019t had any impact on their offerings.", "title": "Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey", "image": {"src": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/09/26/benefits-sellings-2014-employer-survey-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "creator": "@Benefits_Pro", "site": "@Benefits_Pro", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-23", "sailthru.tags": "benefitspro, article, 54209852140ba0d5078b458f, In-Depth, Core/Group,Voluntary,Executive", "keywords": "Core/Group, Voluntary, life insurance, Executive, manufacturing, Aon, long-term care insurance, health care reform law, health care insurance, similar medical payment products, increased employer-paid life insurance, Loretta Camp, Maggie Peabody, Orica, travel accident plans", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/09/23/q882.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "According to Benefits Selling\u2019s 2014 Employer Survey, 70 percent of employers said PPACA has made them rethink their employee benefit offerings, compared to 30 percent who said the health care reform law hadn\u2019t had any impact on their offerings.\nSlightly half (52 percent) of the survey respondents offered flexible working benefits, compared to 48 percent that did not.\nThe survey also delved into how employers felt about their brokers\u2019 service, though 24 percent said they did not use a benefits broker or an agent.\nHowever, 68 percent offered retirement benefits, as opposed to 32 percent that did not.\nComplete your profile to continue reading and get FREE access to BenefitsPRO.com, part of your ALM digital membership."}
