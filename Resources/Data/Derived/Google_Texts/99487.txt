The Tupelo mayor's office says that police Corporal Gale Stauffer, 38, has died after a shooting Monday. Stauffer had responded to a bank robbery.

Another officer was also shot during the robbery and remains in critical and guarded condition.

Mayor Jason Shelton said a bystander used a fallen officer's radio to report the shooting.

A surveillance photo was retrieved from a bank camera during the hold-up at the Bancorp South branch at Gloster Creek Village.

Authorities say the suspect is 5' 9" to 6', has a thin build, light complexion, possibly African American, and was wearing khaki or cargo pants.

Witnesses said a heavily armed suspect approached the officers and shot them at point-blank range. They said at least one of the officers was shot in the head.

Authorities were looking for a dark gray Dodge Stratus Monday evening, which was believed to be the getaway vehicle. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reported Tuesday the FBI says the killer may have driven a charcoal colored, medium-sized, four-door sedan, possibly a Chrysler 200 or a Honda of some type.

A $100,000 reward is being offered for information on the suspects' whereabouts. The investigation has been turned over to the FBI.

Officials are asking citizens to report any information about the suspects' whereabouts to 1-800-773-TIPS or the Tupelo Police Department at 662-841-6491.

Stauffer leaves behind a wife and two children, ages 2 and 6.
