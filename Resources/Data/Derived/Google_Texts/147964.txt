Former Georgetown coach John Thompson Jr. had intestinal surgery less than two weeks ago, and the school says he is recovering “beautifully.”

Georgetown said in a statement Sunday the 74-year-old Hall of Famer who led the Hoyas to the 1984 national title had corrective surgery for a benign twisted intestine.

The school adds that Thompson is “unfortunately unable to travel extensively for the next few weeks. Otherwise, he would be in his favorite spot on the sidelines for March Madness.”

Thompson, the father of current Georgetown coach John Thompson III, wasn’t at the Big East Tournament this week, an event he has worked for Westwood One as a radio analyst. The Hoyas lost in the semifinals but are considered a sure at-large pick for the NCAA Tournament.

Thompson had a 596-239 record in 27 seasons at Georgetown, reaching the NCAA Tournament 20 times. He retired during the 1998-99 season and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in 2006.
