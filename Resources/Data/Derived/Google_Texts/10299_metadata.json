It includes wanting regulators to remember their \u201cphenomenal cosmic power\u201d is confined, as the Genie would say, into an \u201citty bitty living space.\u201d\n\nFirst, we will require regulators to live within a budget \u2013 for every one dollar of regulatory cost they propose, they will need to also propose ways to save an equivalent dollar through regulatory relief. We will implement a \u201cone in, one out\u201d regulatory budget. A rule like this would have avoided roughly $99 billion in regulatory costs over the Obama presidency.\n\nThe \u201cone in, one out\u201d proposal isn\u2019t bad, but Rand Paul\u2019s is better. He wants it to be two regulations out for every one in. This would stunt the regulatory growth and possibly would put some of the more fetid regulations, like the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, in the landfill where they belong. Bush also promises to sign the REINS Act into law, which would require Congress to issue a joint resolution on major new regulations before they can take effect. What\u2019s interesting is Rand Paul is the primary sponsor of the REINS Act, and both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were co-sponsors. Those three should probably point out how Bush is just following their lead.\n\nOne thing Bush does do a good job at is pointing out how regulations aren\u2019t just hurting large businesses, but everyday Americans.\n\nThe Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule subjects nearly all private land use to review by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The rule, which is inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent, requires farmers to cater to the EPA in order to obtain permission to build a fence, apply fertilizer, pull weeds, or spray for insects. The rule expands federal authority to virtually all wet areas (and temporarily wet areas) \u2014ditches, drains, seasonal puddle-like depressions, and large \u201cbuffer areas\u201d of land adjacent to waterways. For example, the rule subjects 99 percent of Pennsylvania\u2019s acreage to federal jurisdiction. The WOTUS rule unnecessarily and arbitrarily increases the cost and uncertainty of many industrial, commercial, and farming operations. And those who fail to comply face stiff penalties of roughly $40,000 per violation.\n\nRegulators shouldn\u2019t have power over private land. If a homeowner wants to put in a gas well, trailer park, skate park, or a castle with a moat they ought to be able to do it. It\u2019s nice to see Bush point out how the WOTUS rule can hurt land owners, but the question is whether it will resonate with people who don\u2019t live in the country. The only way it can is if it\u2019s messaged right and Bush isn\u2019t always the best messenger. It\u2019s too bad the private land part wasn\u2019t in the outline of Bush\u2019s regulatory proposal because not everyone is going to read the full, 3500+ word document.\n\nThe problem is voters will have to take Bush at his word, which may not be possible because of history. President Barack Obama promised to review regulations in 2011, but the Competitive Enterprise Institute pointed out the Administration is still averaging 81 new major regulations each year and the fact the 2014 Federal Register is the sixth highest in its history. There\u2019s also the question if Jeb Bush will be any better of a reformer than George W. Bush. Veronique de Rugy wrote in Reason in 2009 how George W. was one of the biggest regulators since Nixon (emphasis mine).\n\nSince Bush took office in 2001, there has been a 13 percent decrease in the annual number of new rules. But the new regulations\u2019 cost to the economy will be much higher than it was before 2001. Of the new rules, 159 are \u201ceconomically significant,\u201d meaning they will cost at least $100 million a year. That\u2019s a 10 percent increase in the number of high-cost rules since 2006, and a 70 percent increase since 2001. And at the end of 2007, another 3,882 rules were already at different stages of implementation, 757 of them targeting small businesses. Overall, the final outcome of this Republican regulation has been a significant increase in regulatory activity and cost since 2001. The number of pages added to the Federal Register, which lists all new regulations, reached an all-time high of 78,090 in 2007, up from 64,438 in 2001.\n\nDe Rugy also points out George W.\u2019s approval of Sarbanes-Oxley and McCain-Feingold are why the GOP can\u2019t be trusted. Jeb Bush is NOT Barack Obama. But there\u2019s no guarantee Jeb Bush won\u2019t be his brother because one of Jeb\u2019s top economic advisers was an adviser to George W. Peter Suderman at Reason also notes how regulatory growth is something Democrats and Republicans do.\n\nBut the growth in regulation is an old and bipartisan problem. As Chris DeMuth of the American Enterprise Institute wrote in a compelling 2012 essay on the regulatory state for National Affairs, \u201cThe modern regulatory state is a bipartisan enterprise: During the half-century before President Obama\u2019s election, the greatest growth in regulation came under Presidents Richard Nixon and George W. Bush.\u201d Indeed, many major Obama-era regulations were primed by Bush-era legislation and rule changes. Rather than a partisan or political issue, the growth of the regulatory state is, as DeMuth argues, an institutional issue\u2014which is to say that it\u2019s a cultural issue, pervasive in Washington, in which it\u2019s become the norm for Congress to effectively hand over its legislative power to federal agencies.Instead of a Congress that makes law itself, we have a system of what DeMuth refers to as \u201cdelegated lawmaking,\u201d or \u201claw-by-regulation,\u201d in which Congress provides regulators with goals and then essentially gives them carte blanche to institute whatever rules\u2014which is to say whatever laws\u2014they want in service of those goals.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s regulatory framework isn\u2019t bad, but it needs to go further to get rid of regulations. It\u2019s nice he\u2019s saying businesses should be focused on business, not whether their counter is five inches too short or too long. It could be more aggressive in trying to crack down on regulations, but that may be too inside baseball for non-political or business junkies. Americans don\u2019t really think about regulations until a crisis pops up or jobs start getting lost. If there was a way to message this better, maybe it would resonate more with the generic voter.\n\nIt\u2019s always nice when politicians move past the rhetoric of \u201cjobs\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d and \u201cnational security\u201d and actually bother to submit an actual platform. It was nice to see Donald Trump\u2019s policy outline on the Second Amendment and his desire to have conceal carry licenses work in all 50 states. His push for mandatory minimums and how he wants to do mental health care leave more to be desired, but it\u2019s pleasing Trump put out a detailed position. It\u2019s nice Chris Christie is talking entitlement reform and has a plan on that. The same goes for Bush on this regulation reform proposal. This doesn\u2019t mean voters should go flocking to Bush to be the GOP nominee (he\u2019s not even in my top 10 of preferred candidates). It\u2019s just nice when candidates are more than just soundbites.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The GOP is just as bad at regulatory power as Democrats are.", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s regulation reform plan isn\u2019t bad, but can he be trusted?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/22/jeb-bushs-regulation-reform-plan-isnt-bad-but-can-he-be-trusted/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-23T01:21:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-22T23:25:10+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 election, economy, Jeb Bush, regulation,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c41\"", "article_summary": "Jeb Bush\u2019s regulation reform plan isn\u2019t bad, but can he be trusted?\nThe only way it can is if it\u2019s messaged right and Bush isn\u2019t always the best messenger.\nposted at 9:21 pm on September 22, 2015 by Taylor MillardJeb Bush is unveiling a new regulation reform plan which actually isn\u2019t that bad.\nJeb Bush\u2019s regulatory framework isn\u2019t bad, but it needs to go further to get rid of regulations.\nThis would stunt the regulatory growth and possibly would put some of the more fetid regulations, like the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, in the landfill where they belong."}
