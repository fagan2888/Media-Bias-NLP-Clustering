He\u2019s as well-known as Janet Yellen and that might complicate people\u2019s perceptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got stature with the markets and people around the world that I think will be an asset.\" - Jeffrey Shafer\n\nSigns that Fischer has agreed to be Yellen\u2019s No. 2 have been greeted mostly positively by Fed watchers and market participants alike. It shows Yellen is comfortable working with another high-powered policymaker and strengthens the debate over future Fed action.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut Fischer\u2019s nomination could also create problems down the line as Fed officials debate the delicate task of unwinding quantitative easing.\n\n\u201cWhat if they disagreed on policy and Yellen went one way and Fischer went the other? Which way would the market go?\u201d Matus asked.\n\nNicholas Colas, chief market strategist at ConvergEx, said \u201cany visible public disagreement at the Fed would cause the market concern\u201d and make it appear that \u201cJanet Yellen is not starting her tenure with a cohesive policy.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wonderful Addition to the Family\u2019\n\nPeople who have worked with Yellen and Fischer believe these concerns are overblown. Both have a track record for working to build consensus in a collegial manner (read: not Larry Summers).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a No.1 and a No. 2. He knows how to handle himself,\u201d said Edwin Truman, who has known both Fischer and Yellen for more than 25 years. \u201cAs long as the place runs in a collegial way there will be no problem. I\u2019m sure he will be a wonderful addition to the family.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Shafer, who helped recruit Fischer to Citigroup (C) last decade, said he doesn\u2019t believe appointing Fischer \u201cundercuts the choice\u201d of Yellen at all.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they would not have done this without her blessing. I think it says something about Janet that she is comfortable with someone on her team with his eminence. I think they will get along and make a very good team,\u201d said Shafer, who previously worked at the Fed and the Treasury Department.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, Fischer and Yellen have far more to agree on than not.\n\nThey have both been supporters of the Fed\u2019s controversial $85 billion bond buying exercise and super low interest rates. In fact, Fischer oversaw a QE program of his own at the Bank of Israel.\n\n\u201cWe see little daylight between Fischer and the current core FOMC leadership with respect to their basic paradigm for thinking about the economy,\u201d Goldman Sachs (GS) economists Jon Hatzius and Kris Dawsey wrote in a note to clients this week.\n\nForward Guidance Fight?\n\nIn a lecture, Fischer said the QE experiment shows that \u201cthere is a lot that the central bank can do to run an expansionary monetary policy even when it has cut\u201d rates essentially to zero. He said asset purchases \u201cincrease liquidity\u201d and longer-term asset purchases, such as in QE2, may help central banks boost private sector demand for long-term assets like mortgages and corporate investment.\n\nOne possible area of contention could be over forward guidance, for which Fischer recently expressed some skepticism. \u201cIf you give too much forward guidance you do take away flexibility,\u201d Fischer said in September. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll be doing a year from now. It\u2019s a mistake to try and get too precise.\u201d\n\nWhile Fischer is skeptical about calendar-based forward guidance, Yellen has been one of its biggest proponents. As the Fed begins to dial back QE, it is expected to lean heavily on forward guidance, which indicates the expected path of monetary policy in the future.\n\nStill, this isn\u2019t seen as a major stumbling block for the likely new Fed leadership.\n\n\u201cWe have little doubt that Yellen and Fischer would see eye to eye on the need to prevent a large tightening of financial conditions anytime soon, so the slightly greater uncertainty that might result from his nomination is mainly about tactics, not strategy,\u201d Hatzius and Dawsey wrote.\n\nMaking the Fed More Democratic?\n\nAdding Fischer to the Fed would seemingly only enhance the central bank\u2019s reputation, especially overseas where the former Israeli central banker carries great weight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got stature with the markets and people around the world that I think will be an asset,\u201d said Shafer.\n\nFischer\u2019s appointment has yet to be announced by the White House and he would still need to be approved by the Senate.\n\nWhile relations in Congress have improved dramatically in recent weeks (see: budget compromise), Matus wondered whether some lawmakers will object.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very senior government appointment in the United States and he\u2019s a dual citizen. I don\u2019t know how that will fly,\u201d said Matus.\n\nGoldman said it\u2019s \u201cvery likely\u201d Fischer would be confirmed, noting the recent change in Senate rules means he would only need a simple majority.\n\nColas sees another benefit in adding someone of Fischer\u2019s status to the Fed to sit alongside the equally well-respected Yellen.\n\n\u201cIt does make the Federal Reserve look a little more democratic. At least you have the optics of real debate and not autocratic\u201d rule like under former Fed chiefs Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, said Colas.\n\n\u201cThis might make it more complex (for the markets), but I think it does make it look more consistent with American values,\u201d said Colas.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 10:36:25 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/13/will-fischer-cramp-yellens-style-at-fed.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2013/12/13/will-fischer-cramp-yellens-style-at-fed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452098674530.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Stanley Fischer is a rock star in the central banking world and some wonder whether his likely appointment to the Fed could overshadow Janet Yellen.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Will Fischer Cramp Yellen\u2019s Style at the Fed?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Matt Egan\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Will Fischer Cramp Yellen\\u2019s Style at the Fed?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2013/12/13/will-fischer-cramp-yellens-style-at-fed/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452098674530.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-13T18:15:31Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/13/will-fischer-cramp-yellens-style-at-fed.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"893aa217-1c8d-48b1-a7db-43c77ec08d7d\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "Stanley Fischer is a rock star in the central banking world and some wonder whether his likely appointment to the Fed could overshadow Janet Yellen.", "dc.description": "Stanley Fischer is a rock star in the central banking world and some wonder whether his likely appointment to the Fed could overshadow Janet Yellen.", "dc.identifier": "893aa217-1c8d-48b1-a7db-43c77ec08d7d", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "prism.channel": "fbn", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Will Fischer Cramp Yellen\u2019s Style At The Fed?", "dcterms.created": "2016-03-02 10:36:25 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Stanley Fischer is a rock star in the central banking world and some wonder whether his likely appointment to the Fed could overshadow Janet Yellen.", "title": "Will Fischer Cramp Yellen\u2019s Style at the Fed?
