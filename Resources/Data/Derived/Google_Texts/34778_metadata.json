But when workers unloaded the cargo of bananas on Monday, they found that two of the three compartments had ripened too much.\n\nJay Jones, director of the South Jersey Port in Camden, said he couldn\u2019t remember a similar dispute in his 20 years working at the port.\n\n\u201cThe fruit that comes in here is the fruit that goes straight to supermarkets,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI don\u2019t recall ever an issue like this.\u201d\n\nThe rotting cargo of bananas isn\u2019t the only strange story involving a surprise shipment of fruit. Earlier this year, grocery store employees opened up boxes of bananas and discovered that there was actually a shipment of 100 kilograms of cocaine inside. Police investigated the shipment but weren\u2019t able to make any arrests.\n\nA judge in New Jersey has ordered the over-ripe cargo of bananas to be held in port until the dispute is settled.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A cargo of bananas carrying 110,000 cartons filled with overripe fruit is stuck in a New Jersey port thanks to a dispute between the shipping company and Del", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "A cargo of bananas carrying 110,000 cartons filled with overripe fruit is stuck in a New Jersey port thanks to a dispute between the shipping company and Del", "title": "Cargo Of Bananas Stuck In New Jersey Port, Going Rotten Due To Dispute", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1069510/cargo-of-bananas-stuck-in-new-jersey-port-going-rotten-due-to-dispute/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Cargo-Of-Bananas.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-21T09:15:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-21T09:38:49+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Cargo-Of-Bananas.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2013-12-21T09:15:26+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "cargo of bananas,cargo of bananas stuck,odd news", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Cargo-Of-Bananas.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A cargo of bananas carrying 110,000 cartons filled with overripe fruit is stuck in a New Jersey port thanks to a dispute between the shipping company and Del"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7de\"", "article_summary": "A judge in New Jersey has ordered the over-ripe cargo of bananas to be held in port until the dispute is settled.\nA cargo of bananas carrying 110,000 cartons filled with overripe fruit is stuck in a New Jersey port thanks to a dispute between the shipping company and Del Monte.\nJay Jones, director of the South Jersey Port in Camden, said he couldn\u2019t remember a similar dispute in his 20 years working at the port.\nBut when workers unloaded the cargo of bananas on Monday, they found that two of the three compartments had ripened too much.\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall ever an issue like this.\u201dThe rotting cargo of bananas isn\u2019t the only strange story involving a surprise shipment of fruit."}
