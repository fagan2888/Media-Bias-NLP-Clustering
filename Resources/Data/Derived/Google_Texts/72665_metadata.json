Thanks, Bernie Sanders.\n\n3 On the Shameful and Skewed \u2018Redskins\u2019 Poll\n\n4 Clinton Needs Sanders Supporters to Win, But Sanders Needs Clinton Supporters to Change the System\n\n5 Benjamin Netanyahu Just Formed the Most Right-Wing Government in Israeli History\n\nDemocrats in other swing states are highlighting these kinds of attacks on women as an illustration of the GOP\u2019s extremism, but so far Landrieu has not made gender an issue in her campaign. In North Carolina, Kay Hagan is targeting female voters in her race against Tom Tillis, the speaker of the North Carolina House whose accomplishments include the infamous \u201cmotorcycle abortion bill.\u201d Colorado senator Mark Udall has a new ad out highlighting his opponent\u2019s anti-choice record. In Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes hammered Mitch McConnell for being \u201con the wrong side of every woman\u2019s issue out there.\u201d In turn, the Democrats\u2019 bid to keep the Senate is getting a boost from liberal women\u2019s groups like Planned Parenthood Action Fund and EMILY\u2019s LIST, who are putting millions behind female candidates, Hagan in particular.\n\nThe political landscape is very different for Landrieu. \u201cIn other circumstances, she could make inroads with conservative women who care about women\u2019s issues. But if she can be construed as part of establishment that is pro-choice, that trumps everything,\u201d said Pearson Cross, a political scientist at the University of Louisiana in Lafayette.\n\nCross credits Louisiana\u2019s sharp rightward turn in the last decade not only to anti-Obama sentiment but also to the GOP\u2019s leveraging of religion to flip voters in the heavily Catholic south- and central-western parishes known as French Acadiana, formerly a blue stronghold.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party picked that lock by appealing to voters on the basis of abortion,\u201d said Cross. \u201cCatholics [in Louisiana] are now voting in majorities for Republicans, which is something they had never done before.\u201d That switch was evident in the 2008 presidential election, in which 70 percent of Louisiana Catholics voted for John McCain.\n\nIn this context, it makes sense that Landrieu would try to avoid a conversation about abortion. She describes her own stance as centrist; she supported a late-term abortion ban, but otherwise has defended abortion rights on the principle of separation of church and state. It was on that basis that she called the new restrictions signed by Jindal \u201cvery troubling,\u201d arguing that \u201cthe last place the government needs to be is in the church, in the doctor\u2019s office or in the bedroom.\u201d\n\nStill, given that Democrats see women as being key to the control of the Senate, it\u2019s notable that Landrieu isn\u2019t yet aggressively courting female voters via her record on less controversial issues like equal pay legislation, which she has pushed for. So far she\u2019s chosen instead to paint herself strictly as a gender-neutral champion of the oil and gas industry, and the black sheep of the Democratic Party. As a result, she is not drawing on the support of the liberal groups playing heavily in other states. She is the only female Democratic incumbent in the Senate who has not been endorsed by EMILY\u2019s list. Planned Parenthood Action is also not supporting her campaign at this point, though a spokesperson said the group is \u201ckeeping an eye\u201d on the race.\n\nMeanwhile, conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity are trying to speak to Louisiana\u2019s women via targeted ads, and Cassidy has indicated that he\u2019ll put abortion front and center. One recent poll showed Landrieu losing ground among white female Democrats. As the race picks up, it will be interesting to see whether Landrieu engages in a fiercer fight for this constituency.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mary_landrieu_la_ap_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Zo\u00eb Carpenter", "description": "In Louisiana, women\u2019s health could prove a meaningful point of divergence between the Democratic incumbent and her Republican challengers.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "In Louisiana, women\u2019s health could prove a meaningful point of divergence between the Democratic incumbent and her Republican challengers.", "title": "Will Mary Landrieu Engage the \u2018War on Women\u2019 in the Louisiana Senate Race?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/will-mary-landrieu-engage-war-women-louisiana-senate-race/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mary_landrieu_la_ap_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:29+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Louisiana, women\u2019s health could prove a meaningful point of divergence between the Democratic incumbent and her Republican challengers.", "title": "Will Mary Landrieu Engage the \u2018War on Women\u2019 in the Louisiana Senate Race?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/will-mary-landrieu-engage-war-women-louisiana-senate-race/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mary_landrieu_la_ap_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mary_landrieu_la_ap_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "June 23rd, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Will Mary Landrieu Engage the \u2018War on Women\u2019 in the Louisiana Senate Race?", "keywords": "Mary Landrieu, Louisiana, Midterm elections, Bill Cassidy, Abortion, Women's health, Zo\u00eb Carpenter, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 111935, "sailthru.tags": "Congress,Elections,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2014-06-23T16:50:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:29+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/zcarpenter/"}, "sailthru.description": "In Louisiana, women\u2019s health could prove a meaningful point of divergence between the Democratic incumbent and her Republican challengers.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mary_landrieu_la_ap_img-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "One recent poll showed Landrieu losing ground among white female Democrats.\nAs the race picks up, it will be interesting to see whether Landrieu engages in a fiercer fight for this constituency.\nShe is the only female Democratic incumbent in the Senate who has not been endorsed by EMILY\u2019s list.\nIn this context, it makes sense that Landrieu would try to avoid a conversation about abortion.\n\u201cIn other circumstances, she could make inroads with conservative women who care about women\u2019s issues."}
