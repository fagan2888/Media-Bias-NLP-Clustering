Screenshot, Youtube/ Barcroft TV\n\nWhen some people are so emotionally close, they are often dubbed as being, \u201cattached at the hip.\u201d Well, brothers Shivanath and Shivram Sahu, 12, are actually that close emotionally and physically, too. As conjoined twins, the boys, who live in a village near Raipur in India, have spent every moment of their lives together, and they plan on staying that way.\n\n\"We don't wish to get separated,\" Shivram told Barcroft TV. \"We will stay like this even when we grow old. We want to live as we are.\u201d\n\nThe boys were born joined at the waist, and they share two legs, but they have independent lungs, brains, and hearts. They have also learned to shower, eat, and go about their daily chores.\n\n\u201cWe have taught ourselves everything. We ride to school on a bicycle and playing cricket is no problem,\u201d Shivanath said.\n\nTheir father, Raj Kumar, 45, is very protective over his sons. \u201cFor everyone it is good fun to watch my children, but only I understand all the problems they have,\u201d he said, the Daily Mail reported. \u201cDuring rainy season it becomes difficult for them to walk and when one wants to sit the other has to lie down.\"\n\nDespite their setbacks, Kumar says he wouldn\u2019t change his sons for the world. \"God has created them like this so they have to walk like they do. They will remain like this. I don't want anything else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "conjoined twins", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Shivanath and Shivram say they can do the same things other people can, and they don't want to be separated.", "title": "These Cute Conjoined Twins Don\u2019t Want To Be Separated [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/conjoined-twins-india-dont-want-be-separated-doctors-say-thats-ok-boys-could-lead-normal-lives", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/conjoined-twins.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shivanath and Shivram say they can do the same things other people can, and they don't want to be separated.", "title": "These Cute Conjoined Twins Don\u2019t Want To Be Separated [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/conjoined-twins-india-dont-want-be-separated-doctors-say-thats-ok-boys-could-lead-normal-lives", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/conjoined-twins.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/04/11/conjoined-twins.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-04-11T16:21:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-11T16:56:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Shivanath and Shivram say they can do the same things other people can, and they don't want to be separated."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8f8\"", "article_summary": "Shivanath and Shivram say they can do the same things other people can, and they don't want to be separated.\n\"We don't wish to get separated,\" Shivram told Barcroft TV.\nAs conjoined twins, the boys, who live in a village near Raipur in India, have spent every moment of their lives together, and they plan on staying that way.\n\u201cDuring rainy season it becomes difficult for them to walk and when one wants to sit the other has to lie down.\"\nWe want to live as we are.\u201dThe boys were born joined at the waist, and they share two legs, but they have independent lungs, brains, and hearts."}
