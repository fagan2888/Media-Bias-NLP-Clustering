Brian Sandoval, a Republican, has risen as a rumored Supreme Court successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, but conservative lawyers say the \u201cunqualified\u201d governor\u2019s nomination is highly unlikely.\n\n\u201cThis guy is a lightweight,\u201d Ed Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told The Daily Signal. \u201cHe\u2019s not remotely qualified to fill any seat, much less Justice Scalia\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSandoval, a former federal judge, spoke to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., over the weekend regarding the high court\u2019s vacant seat, according to Morning Consult.\n\nWhile beating back speculation that he had landed on President Barack Obama\u2019s short list, Sandoval told reporters Saturday he was \u201chonored\u201d his name had surfaced among potential nominees.\n\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel and policy director at the Judicial Crisis Network, told The Daily Signal there is \u201czero chance\u201d Obama would nominate anyone other than an \u201cextreme\u201d liberal, calling Sandoval\u2019s Capitol Hill meeting a \u201ctypical duplicitous charade\u201d by Reid.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush appointed Sandoval to Nevada\u2019s U.S. District Court in 2005. The Senate unanimously confirmed him to the post, 89-0.\n\nFour years later, he resigned to run for governor, smoothly winning against the state\u2019s incumbent. But he has always expressed interest in returning to the judicial branch, the Morning Consult reported.\n\nThough he\u2019s dubbed a moderate, Sandoval has often pivoted himself in opposition to Republicans on the national level, making his confirmation even among GOP senators questionable.\n\nSince becoming governor in January 2011, Sandoval has been outspoken in his support for pro-choice policies and halted Nevada\u2019s fight against same-sex marriage. After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the issue last year, he said his state\u2019s \u201carguments against marriage equality are no longer defensible.\u201d\n\nIn April 2015, he proposed the steepest tax hike in the state\u2019s history, conceding to the Associated Press that the move was \u201cnot orthodox\u201d for a Republican.\n\nHe also worked with the state legislature in 2013 to expand Nevada\u2019s Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act and was one of three GOP governors to establish a state-based exchange.\n\nIlya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the Cato Institute, told The Daily Signal Sandoval has become known as a \u201csquish\u201d since taking office and called the Democrats\u2019 potential plan to place pressure on GOP senators by nominating a Republican \u201ccute.\u201d\n\nSeverino, who formerly served as a law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, said it\u2019s a \u201cdistraction\u201d to discuss Sandoval\u2019s qualifications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way he will get this nomination,\u201d Severino said. \u201cThe president is going to nominate an extreme liberal. He\u2019s not going to nominate anyone who, for example, would have any chance fighting his unconstitutional executive actions on immigration.\u201d\n\nBut regardless of who is ultimately nominated, she said confirmation should wait until after the presidential election so that Americans can have a say in the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is too important to rush through on the last year of a presidency,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t introduce a major piece of legislation at this time. This is not the time to discuss this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Nevada governor has has often veered left on policies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Nevada governor has has often veered left on policies.", "title": "Meet Pro-Choice Republican Campaigning to Suceed Scalia", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160222_Sandoval_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-25T11:48:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1TvXr4V"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Nevada governor has has often veered left on policies.", "title": "Meet Pro-Choice Republican Campaigning to Suceed Scalia", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160222_Sandoval_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "supreme court", "published_time": "2016-02-22T18:08:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-25T11:48:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Brian Sandoval, Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia, Ed Whelan, Carrie Severino, Harry Reid, Dean Heller"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis guy is a lightweight,\u201d Ed Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told The Daily Signal.\nWhile beating back speculation that he had landed on President Barack Obama\u2019s short list, Sandoval told reporters Saturday he was \u201chonored\u201d his name had surfaced among potential nominees.\nBrian Sandoval, a Republican, has risen as a rumored Supreme Court successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, but conservative lawyers say the \u201cunqualified\u201d governor\u2019s nomination is highly unlikely.\nSince becoming governor in January 2011, Sandoval has been outspoken in his support for pro-choice policies and halted Nevada\u2019s fight against same-sex marriage.\nFormer President George W.
