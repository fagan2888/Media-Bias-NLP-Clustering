Lobaton connected against Nick Masset.\n\nMiami had consecutive home runs in the third against Doug Fister, with Marcell Ozuna hitting a two-run drive followed by Jarrod Saltalamacchia\u2019s homer. Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer in the third, his third home run of spring training.\n\nAfter the game, Stanton declared he was ready for the regular season.\n\n\u201cYeah, this is the point where it\u2019s time to get the kinks out the last couple of days and let \u2018er rip,\u201d he said.\n\nFister gave up six runs and eight hits in four innings, and has allowed five homers in his past two starts. He said he was actually starting to feel \u201ca lot more like myself\u201d and blamed himself for not keeping the ball down.\n\n\u201cI left the ball up and that\u2019s what definitely allowed them to get good contact on the ball,\u201d he said.\n\nKoehler was not happy with his outing, but like Fister, he put more of the onus on himself for not keeping the ball down.\n\n\u201cHave them hit the ball on the ground and they can\u2019t hit a home run,\u201d Koehler said. \u201cI just [need] to do a better job of sticking the fastball down on both sides of the plate.\u201d\n\nTaylor Jordan will get the start for the Nationals on the road on Monday against St. Louis and Michael Wacha, while Dan Haren takes the mound as the Marlins visit the Mets. Rafael Montero is scheduled to throw for New York.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Harper homered for the second consecutive day and Jose Lobaton hit a three-run home run in the eighth inning, one of seven home runs on a windy afternoon, as the Nationals beat the Marlins, 11-7, on Sunday.", "Author": "Carl Kotala", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Harper homered for the second consecutive day and Jose Lobaton hit a three-run home run in the eighth inning, one of seven home runs on a windy afternoon, as the Nationals beat the Marlins, 11-7, on Sunday.", "title": "Bryce Harper hits one of seven home runs as Nationals defeat Marlins", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/29/bryce-harper-hits-one-seven-home-runs-nationals-de/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/23/b8ecc23036869b0d710f6a706700b43d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/23/b8ecc23036869b0d710f6a706700b43d.jpg", "title": "Bryce Harper hits one of seven home runs as Nationals defeat Marlins", "description": "Harper homered for the second consecutive day and Jose Lobaton hit a three-run home run in the eighth inning, one of seven home runs on a windy afternoon, as the Nationals beat the Marlins, 11-7, on S", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Ted Koehler, Doug Fister"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde288\"", "article_summary": "Giancarlo Stanton hit a two-run homer in the third, his third home run of spring training.\n\u201cHave them hit the ball on the ground and they can\u2019t hit a home run,\u201d Koehler said.\nWilson Ramos hit a solo homer in the third off Koehler, who gave up six runs and 10 hits in four innings.\n\u201cBalls were hit, but it\u2019s difficult for both sides to have control in wind like that,\u201d Nationals manager Matt Williams said.\nFister gave up six runs and eight hits in four innings, and has allowed five homers in his past two starts."}
