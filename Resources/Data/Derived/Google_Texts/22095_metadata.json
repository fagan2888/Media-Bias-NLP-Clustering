He had Abe give high fives to every player before he addressed the team about winning the game.\"\n\nPictures with the team followed. Abe also got the arm sleeve of star Sooner Buddy Hield.\n\n\"It\u2019s just truly amazing,\u201d the 11-year-old said.\n\nSo amazing that Barry Randle was compelled to put pen to paper.\n\nIn his letter to Kruger he explained that his own parents, who had passed away, were Kansas State alums like Kruger.\n\nHe explained how excited they would have been for Abe to meet the coach.\n\nHis thank you letter went in the mail on Monday.\n\nJust four days later, Barry Randle received his own \"handwritten\" thank you from Kruger.\n\n\u201cI remember Abe. Big smile that makes everyone feel great,\u201d Kruger said earlier this week in Norman.\n\nCoach said he occasionally invites youngsters back to the locker room because his players love it.\n\nThe same can obviously be said about the lucky fans themselves that get such an invite from the coach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a day that goes by that he hasn\u2019t talked about the experience that happened in January,\u201d Barry Randle said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to show to my kids, my kids\u2019 kids, my kids\u2019 kids\u2019 kids,\u201d Abe raved about the letter and arm sleeve, which now hangs on his wall.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Barry Randle and his son 11-year-old son Abe were all smiles in Waco earlier this season.", "author": "Karl Torp", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31623781/red-dirt-diaries-invite-makes-for-special-moment-for-young-sooner-fan", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10237526_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Barry Randle and his son 11-year-old son Abe were all smiles in Waco earlier this season.", "title": "Red Dirt Diaries: Invite Makes For Special Moment For Young Sooner Fan"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10237526_G.jpg", "description": "Barry Randle and his son 11-year-old son Abe were all smiles in Waco earlier this season.", "card": "summary", "title": "Red Dirt Diaries: Invite Makes For Special Moment For Young Sooner Fan"}, "wnreadableurl": "red-dirt-diaries-invite-makes-for-special-moment-for-young-sooner-fan", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2016/04/01", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,kwtv,Oklahoma Men's Basketball, sooners, basketball, ou, lon kruger, buddy hield", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS31", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,kwtv,Oklahoma Men's Basketball, sooners, basketball, ou, lon kruger, buddy hield"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m going to show to my kids, my kids\u2019 kids, my kids\u2019 kids\u2019 kids,\u201d Abe raved about the letter and arm sleeve, which now hangs on his wall.\nBarry Randle and his son 11-year-old son Abe were all smiles in Waco earlier this season.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a day that goes by that he hasn\u2019t talked about the experience that happened in January,\u201d Barry Randle said.\n\u201cI was the only kid up there,\u201d Abe Randle said.\n\u201cI was almost tackling Able to get in there first,\u201d Barry Randle said."}
