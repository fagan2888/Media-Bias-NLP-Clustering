Providers who fail to heed the 60-day reporting and return window can face civil monetary penalties and incur False Claims Act liability.\n\nThe review was completed Feb. 5, according to the OMB's reginfo.gov website, and is the final step before the rule is published. The proposed version was published in February 2012.\n\nIn addition to addressing how quickly providers and suppliers have to repay identified Medicare overpayments, the final rule would also establish a look-back period. The proposed rule included a 10-year look-back period, meaning that the CMS could review 10 years of claims for any additional overpayments on top of the original overpayment identified by the provider or supplier\n\nThe CMS was scheduled to release the final rule in February 2015 but delayed it a year due to the rule's complex nature .\n\nIn announcing the delay, the CMS stressed that providers could still face potential FCA Act liability and penalties for failing to report and return Medicare overpayments, despite the lack of a final rule.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: James Swann in Washington at jswann1@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Janey Cohen at jcohen@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/medicare-overpayment-final-n57982067116/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The White House Office of Management and Budget has finished reviewing a final rule that establishes a time line for the reporting and return of Medicare overpayments.", "title": "Medicare Overpayment Final Rule Clears OMB Review Process"}, "csrf-token": "oOgaC-QrA155Lkt2FeMoc5PkjMylDgelVDiZiPaji_2FlxAI1qm3_xAtSGWnugsKfrCCUbb40h1ArhEQJlS_pM3vEmqBnECLAfu8zxB61rQ1:SIY236tp7qGuAhXAuk9m5zcJdS93PBpyego3nsffNGtCUCWBYhy5p-tniC3TsJBqh8-oKfphnmxV7GOnS7RN8LM--e5nbTikUbMo_LOexsw1", "description": "The White House Office of Management and Budget has finished reviewing a final rule that establishes a time line for the reporting and return of Medicare overpayments", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "The final rule is intended to provide clarity on when providers must report and return Medicare overpayments once they've been identified.\nIn addition to addressing how quickly providers and suppliers have to repay identified Medicare overpayments, the final rule would also establish a look-back period.\nBy James SwannFeb. 8 \u2014 The White House Office of Management and Budget has finished reviewing a final rule that establishes a time line for the reporting and return of Medicare overpayments.\nThe review was completed Feb. 5, according to the OMB's reginfo.gov website, and is the final step before the rule is published.\nIn announcing the delay, the CMS stressed that providers could still face potential FCA Act liability and penalties for failing to report and return Medicare overpayments, despite the lack of a final rule."}
