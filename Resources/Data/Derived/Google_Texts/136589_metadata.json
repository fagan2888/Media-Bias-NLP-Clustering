they are trying to change a lifestyle,\u201d explained Adam Hodges, Director of Anderson\u2019s Fitness Center, \u201cGet healthier and more fit and possibly lose weight, I will get them moving first, I will get them set up at our fitness center with a workout program and then we will start working on that diet.\u201d\n\nWhen gearing up to start working out during the New Year, there are few tips that you can keep in mind to make sure you stay successful when you hit the gym.\n\n\u201cIf we can make fun and we can make it effective and start seeing those results and have either your trainer or your friends hold you accountable, you are much more likely to succeed and stay with the workout program,\u201d said Hodges.\n\nBy working out with friends or a trainer and by having fun while exercising, it can help make the resolution a habit, and by knowing that progress takes time and results won\u2019t happen overnight is key.\n\n\u201cThe more variability that you have in your workout program the more effective it is going to be,\u201d stated Hodges, so if you can and have no limitations and you can do some strength training, you can do cardio by running or elliptical machine or rowing, the best results will come from doing all of those in some combination.\u201d\n\nBy finding what fitness routine works for you and keeping a good schedule, it can help you keep the resolution you made for 2016.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that you need to go in and work out for two hours in order to get results and you have to do that every day but you really don\u2019t,\u201d explained Hodges, \u201cThere are very effective ways to work out where you can go in for thirty minutes, get your work out, a very good workout in and go on with your daily activities.\u201d\n\nNewscenter 11's own John Johnson will sit down with Adam Hodges, Director of Anderson Health and Fitness center during On The Record that will air this Sunday at 5:30 pm on WTOK-TV, to talk more about how you can
