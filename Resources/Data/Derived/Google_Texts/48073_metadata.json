The Wrap interestingly did not note the site is unabashedly left-wing and consistently churns out videos promoting liberal agendas, such as this particularly stupid one of Billy Eichner and Olivia Wilde playing a game called \u201cObamacare or Shut Up.\u201d Watch and see if you crack a smile.\n\nNow that Will Ferrell and Adam McKay have decided making liberals feel good about themselves is more important than entertaining people, check out the hilarity the site has in store for us once it hits D.C.:\n\nIn addition to creating new content, under Jenkins\u2019 direction, Funny or Die D.C. will also provide consulting services on social media, talent outreach, writing and branding strategies for a range of clients. Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to Obama, said in a statement that Jenkins \u201cserved as a key link to creative executives, artists, advocacy leaders and more.\u201d Funny or Die president of production Mike Farrah said that Jenkins was \u201cthe perfect person to lead our D.C. office because he understands how we work and how we can make a difference.\u201d\n\nNothing sounds more fun than a former Obama liaison linking advocacy leaders and creative executives to \u201cmake a difference.\u201d\n\nFunny or Die\u2019s recent attempts at political humor include a painfully bad attempt to mock states with lax gun laws, the popular \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d show giving President Obama a platform to sell Healthcare.gov, and any number of dynamite tweets about Ted Cruz, a Republican who must be stopped.\n\nTed Cruz is shaping up to be a real frontrunner in the 1952 presidential election. \u2014 Funny Or Die (@funnyordie) March 23, 2015\n\nTed Cruz honest presidential campaign ad: http://t.co/vj3EKQVgPz pic.twitter.com/6TIn1Dk7jC \u2014 Funny Or Die (@funnyordie) March 24, 2015\n\nHelpful chart comparing Rafael \u201cTed\u201d Cruz with Raphael the Ninja Turtle pic.twitter.com/Qy1ztWBXhR \u2014 Funny Or Die (@funnyordie) March 24, 2015\n\nWhere do they get this materal?
