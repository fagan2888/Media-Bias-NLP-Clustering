It means they have a voice, better understand their treatment and are engaged in their care.\"\n\nNurses have traditionally shared patient information during shift changes via tape recordings or verbal briefings. But researchers say bedside handover ensures that patients are present during the information-sharing. The team conducted qualitative interviews with 45 patients for the study and found the handover gives patients the opportunity to clarify information and ask questions with both nurses present, which has a documented effect on both patient satisfaction and anxiety, according to the statement.\n\n\"When we did handover at the nursing station, we had to begin prioritizing our patients' care before we'd ever met them,\" said Terri Irwin, St. Michael's Hospital's professional practice leader in nursing, in the statement. \"By seeing patients right away, nurses can assess all their patients' conditions and prioritize care within the first 15 minutes of our shift.\"\n\nInvolving patients in their care can have a positive effect on readmission rates. An October study found that patients with substantial knowledge, skills and confidence about their condition were significantly less likely to be readmitted within 30 days, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract and announcement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nPatient activation influences readmission rates\n\n5 steps hospitals can take to promote patient engagement\n\nStudy: Patients' Internet use a predictor for participation in their own care\n\nHospitals and communities: Understand the patient population\n\nCommunity engagement boosts hospital revenue, quality", "article_metadata": {"description": "When incoming and outgoing nurses actively involve their patients in shift changes--a practice known as bedside handover--it can reduce medical errors and improve outcomes and\u00a0patient experience,\u00a0according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of Nursing Care Quality.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "When incoming and outgoing nurses actively involve their patients in shift changes--a practice known as bedside handover--it can reduce medical errors and improve outcomes and\u00a0patient experience,\u00a0according to a new\u00a0study\u00a0published in the\u00a0Journal of Nursing Care Quality.", "title": "Study: Involving patients in nurses' shift change improves outcomes, prevents errors", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/study-involving-patients-nurses-shift-change-improves-outcomes-prevents-err/2013-11-21", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "bedside care,Nursing,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient engagement", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a2d\"", "article_summary": "\"By seeing patients right away, nurses can assess all their patients' conditions and prioritize care within the first 15 minutes of our shift.\"\n\"Having handover take place at the bedside with patients is better for everyone, but especially for our patients.\nBut researchers say bedside handover ensures that patients are present during the information-sharing.\n\"The start and end of a nurse's shift are critical moments,\" lead author Lianne Jeffs, Ph.D., volunteer association chair in nursing research at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, said in a statement.\nWhen incoming and outgoing nurses actively involve their patients in shift changes--a practice known as bedside handover--it can reduce medical errors and improve outcomes and patient experience, according to a new study published in the Journal of Nursing Care Quality."}
