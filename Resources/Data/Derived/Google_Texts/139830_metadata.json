President Ram Raju said Tuesday.\n\nIn a speech to hundreds of hospital workers, Raju pledged to increase the number of patients using the system\u2019s 11 hospitals and other facilities to 2 million annually by 2020 from the current 1.4 million. And he said the hospitals corporation would double the number of people enrolled in its MetroPlus health insurance plan to 1 million during the same period.\n\n\u201cThe Health and Hospitals Corp. must and will survive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are essential because immigrants, the uninsured and the undocumented have never stopped coming to New York. And it is absolutely essential that there be a place that welcomes them as they seek care and treatment.\u201d\n\nThe hospital system has been bleeding cash for years, and faces a $753 million deficit next year, which will balloon to $1.5 billion by 2019.\n\nThe hospital system has been bleeding cash for years, and faces a $753 million deficit next year, which will balloon to $1.5 billion by 2019.

(Jeff Bachner/for New York Daily News)\n\nAnd because of Obamacare, the agency faces deep cuts to federal aid traditionally funneled to hospitals that care for large numbers of uninsured patients. Under that law, the Health and Hospitals Corp. expects to lose $180 million in 2017, and a total of $3 billion by 2024.\n\nAt the same time, hospital officials expect they\u2019ll still have to care for many people who can\u2019t get insurance despite Obamacare, particularly undocumented immigrants.\n\nBringing in more patients who have insurance or can pay for care will help offset those cuts, Raju said.\n\nHe said Obamacare had an upside, because many of the city hospitals\u2019 uninsured patients now have insurance to cover their care \u2014 yet that also means they have the option to go to other hospitals and the city system will have to fight to keep them.

He proposed changes like cutting wait times for appointments and adding more night and weekend hours.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Erin Durkin", "twitter": {"description": "NYC's public hospital system needs patients to overcome money troubles, Health and Hospitals Corp.
