Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn is running in a red state in what is looking like a good year for Republicans nationally.

So, what do you do when you want a bump from the White House, but the president has sinking poll numbers? You bring in the First Lady.

Michelle Obama served up a 25-minute red meat speech for Georgia Democrats on Monday.



"The longterm unemployment rate has dropped by more than half in the past four years, more than half," said the First Lady.

Of course, Michelle Obama was in Georgia to support Michelle Nunn for Senate and Jason Carter for governor, but with both of their resumes relatively thin on policy, the First Lady made it personal with her husband's policies.

"Today, millions of Americans, millions of families finally have health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act," Obama said.

She said that even in red state Georgia, "let's delve a little deeper in the numbers."

"If we increase the voter rolls by just three percent by adding Democratic voters, and we get those folks out to vote, then we will be soon swearing in Senator Michelle Nunn and Governor Jason Carter."

Ebenezer Baptist Church minister Raphael Warnock put it more bluntly: "Our opponents are defeating us by the margin of our apathy and disagreement."

Democrats know they'll need high turnout in every age and every ethnic demographic statewide.

CBS46 has a new poll that shows that Michelle Nunn has her work cut out for her. The CBS News-New York Times poll has David Perdue up six points. Perdue is at 47 percent, while Nunn is at 41 percent.
