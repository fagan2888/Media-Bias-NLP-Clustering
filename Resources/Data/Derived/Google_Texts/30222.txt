The male primate went missing from Yagiyama Zoological Park and was seen roaming in a neighborhood in Sendai.

Video footage showed the 24-year old chimp atop an electricity pole, then swinging from power lines in between buildings.

A veterinarian was lifted up in a cherry picker to shoot him with a tranquilizer gun.

The chimp made his way to another pole, before loosing his grip and dangling from the lines as the sedative kicked in. He eventually fell to the ground where rescue workers had gathered with sheets.

Chacha has since made a full recovery, local media reported.
