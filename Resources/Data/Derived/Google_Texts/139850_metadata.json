He supported unconstitutionally \u201cnullifying\u201d Obamacare. He rejected climate science, calling it \u201cAl Gore\u2019s climate porn.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s an intellectual successor to former Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN), it\u2019s Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), who was elected in November to fill her seat.\n\nGiven his unimpeachable Tea Party credentials, it was particularly shocking to see Emmer make a full-throated defense of foreign aid, a government program under attack from right-wing voters, during a tele-town hall this week.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAcknowledging his own past opposition to foreign aid \u2014 for example, he floated the idea of pulling U.S. foreign aid in a 2012 Facebook post \u2014 Emmer told viewers that his mind had changed on the matter after a recent trip to visit beneficiaries of foreign aid in Ethiopia and Kenya. \u201cI have made the statement in the past that a dollar that we are spending for instance in Africa, in Kenya, is a dollar that we could probably be using at home to build a road or a bridge,\u201d Emmer said. \u201cWell it\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\n\nInstead, Emmer now argues, foreign aid can be a win-win. It helps pave the way for development in other countries, boosting their economies and in turn creating demand for American exports in the future. He recounted how an encounter with a dairy co-op in Kenya that has been boosted by funding from the United States Agency for International Development helped show him the light. \u201cA dollar spent on [foreign aid] is a dollar that we won\u2019t have to spend on additional bombs and bullets and God forbid boots on the ground in the future,\u201d Emmer noted.\n\nWatch it (relevant portion from 17:00-21:00):\n\nLarge swaths of Republicans, especially those aligned with the Tea Party wing, have called for reducing, if not outright eliminating, foreign aid as a way to save money. GOP presidential aspirants both past ( Mitt Romney and much of the 2012 field) and current ( Rand Paul and Rick Perry ) have called for zeroing out foreign assistance, for instance.\n\nHowever, Emmer\u2019s got a response to these critics: foreign aid \u201cfrankly is less than one percent of our overall budget.\u201d Indeed, part of the opposition to foreign aid likely stems from the fact that Americans mistakenly believe it comprises over a quarter of the federal budget, not the one percent it actually does. When people\u2019s mistaken perceptions were corrected, pollsters found that their support for spending on foreign aid soared.\n\nThis is the challenge that Emmer now faces in trying to convince his fellow Tea Party followers about the wisdom of foreign assistance. However, he won\u2019t be alone in that fight. He\u2019s joined in his support by a handful of presidential hopefuls, including Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham, and Mike Huckabee, who called eliminating foreign aid \u201coutrightly foolish\u201d and \u201cun-Christian.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published by Think Progess, a project of the Center for American Progress Action Fund.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tom Emmer argues foreign aid can help pave the way for development in other countries, creating demand for American exports in the future.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Scott Keyes for Think Progress", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Tom Emmer argues foreign aid can help pave the way for development in other countries, creating demand for American exports in the future.", "title": "After Trip To Africa, Tea Party Congressman Returns With Stunning Defense Of Foreign Aid", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/after-trip-to-africa-tea-party-congressman-returns-with-stunning-defense-of-foreign-aid/205635/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/16590741554_fb8037a36f_k.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tom Emmer argues foreign aid can help pave the way for development in other countries, creating demand for American exports in the future.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/16590741554_fb8037a36f_k.jpg", "title": "After Trip To Africa, Tea Party Congressman Returns With Stunning Defense Of Foreign Aid", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Tom Emmer", "published_time": "2015-05-14T08:49:31-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd90ae\"", "article_summary": "After Trip To Africa, Tea Party Congressman Returns With Stunning Defense Of Foreign AidIf he can change his mind on the wisdom of foreign aid, anyone can.\nTom Emmer greeted on a 2015 trip to Africa that has the GOP congressman reconsidering his earlier stance on foreign aid.\nWhen people\u2019s mistaken perceptions were corrected, pollsters found that their support for spending on foreign aid soared.\nWatch it (relevant portion from 17:00-21:00):Large swaths of Republicans, especially those aligned with the Tea Party wing, have called for reducing, if not outright eliminating, foreign aid as a way to save money.\nHowever, Emmer\u2019s got a response to these critics: foreign aid \u201cfrankly is less than one percent of our overall budget.\u201d Indeed, part of the opposition to foreign aid likely stems from the fact that Americans mistakenly believe it comprises over a quarter of the federal budget, not the one percent it actually does."}
