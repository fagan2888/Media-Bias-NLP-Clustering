The site is designed to look like a non-partisan guide, but actually mirrors Republican talking points and criticisms of the law:\n\n\u2014 IRS WILL SINGLE OUT CONSERVATIVES. \u201cIn light of the recent revelation of questionable processes at the IRS for approving the tax-exempt status of certain groups, several members of the State Legislature, led by Assemblyman Dan Logue, introduced Assembly Joint Resolution 23 to urge Congress and the President to remove any financial oversight responsibilities of the IRS with regard to the administration of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d \u2014 YOUNG PEOPLE ARE SCREWED. \u201cYoung invincibles or healthy adults visit the doctor very seldom and are money makers for insurers and medical groups that contract to provide them services. As low-cost additions to insurance pools, young adults would help dilute the expense of covering older, sicker people. Depending on how Congress requires insurers to price their policies, this group could even wind up paying disproportionately hefty premiums \u2014 effectively subsidizing coverage for the less healthy.\u201d \u2014 EMPLOYERS WILL STOP HIRING. \u201cThere are subsidies in the program for health insurance. However, there is an argument that the Affordable Care Act provides strong incentives for firms to avoid hiring workers from low-income households. \u2026 Many economists believe that the employer mandate contained in the federal law has resulted in many employers who currently have fewer than 50 employees from deciding not to hire new workers so that they are not subject to the new mandate or penalty provisions. News stories are beginning to confirm these concerns.\u201d \u2014 SENIORS WILL EXPERIENCE RATIONING. \u201cFor seniors that use Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program, the Affordable Care Act gradually closes the \u201cdonut hole\u201d until its complete elimination in 2020. To pay for other components of the Affordable Care Act such as expanding Medicaid and creating state health exchanges, Medicare providers will see rate cuts near $200 billion over the next decade. These cuts could potentially result in the exodus of doctors from the Medicare system and force Medicare recipients to find new providers, possibly facing longer wait times for care as that pool of doctors shrinks.\u201d\n\nDespite the GOP\u2019s effort to dissuade Californians from purchasing coverage, however, nearly 80,000 people signed up for health insurance in the state\u2019s new exchange as of late November, with approximately 2,7000 people enrolling daily.\n\nA disclaimer on the site \u2014 which is situated next to a link to the Assembly Republican Caucus \u2014 notes that \u201cThe California State Assembly does not warrant or make any representations as to the quality, content, accuracy, or completeness of the information, text, graphics, links and other items contained on this server or any other server.\u201d Indeed.\n\n(HT: Crooks and Liars)", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The site is designed to look like a non-partisan guide, but actually mirrors Republican talking points and criticisms of the law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The site is designed to look like a non-partisan guide, but actually mirrors Republican talking points and criticisms of the law.", "title": "The Fake Obamacare Site That Is Trying To Trick Californians", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/12/03/3012281/california-republicans-trick-voters-fake-obamacare-site/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CAGOPflyers.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The site is designed to look like a non-partisan guide, but actually mirrors Republican talking points and criticisms of the law.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CAGOPflyers-321x214.png", "title": "The Fake Obamacare Site That Is Trying To Trick Californians", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CAGOPflyers.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/CAGOPflyers.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-03T11:57:16+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2356\"", "article_summary": "Health The Fake Obamacare Site That Is Trying To Trick Californians CREDIT:Republican members of the California Assembly are distributing seemingly innocuous guides about the coverage options available under the Affordable Care Act that downplay the law\u2019s benefits and misinform voters.\nHowever, there is an argument that the Affordable Care Act provides strong incentives for firms to avoid hiring workers from low-income households.\n\u201cFor seniors that use Medicare\u2019s prescription drug program, the Affordable Care Act gradually closes the \u201cdonut hole\u201d until its complete elimination in 2020.\n\u201cThere are subsidies in the program for health insurance.\nTo pay for other components of the Affordable Care Act such as expanding Medicaid and creating state health exchanges, Medicare providers will see rate cuts near $200 billion over the next decade."}
