So, one local group is making sure those children have a way to cope with their grief and connect with a coach or instructor who can mentor them.\n\nIt\u2019s called \u201cAngels of America\u2019s Fallen\u201d and they give kids of fallen military or first responders the opportunity to shine through the activities they love. 11 News Reporter Katie Pelton has the story of one little girl who has blossomed thanks to this program.\n\nFour year-old Emma Loughmiller loves to twirl.\n\n\"Her little face lights up when she's dancing,\u201d said Adri Loughmiller, Emma\u2019s mother.\n\nIt\u2019s something her mom Adri is grateful to see after a tough road.\n\n\"She was only four months old when her daddy died while on active duty in the Army,\u201d said Loughmiller.\n\nEmma\u2019s dad died by suicide while he was stationed at Fort Bragg a few years ago.\n\n\"The first couple years were definitely just, I call it being in a box, or if I say, just being in a fog that just lifts eventually,\u201d said Loughmiller.\n\nAngels of America\u2019s Fallen helped lift that fog. The Colorado Springs based program supports Emma\u2019s passion for dance.\n\n\"She's just a happy little girl and she just, her dad's memory basically lives on,\u201d said Loughmiller.\n\n\"It makes me feel fun because of all the dancing,\u201d said Emma.\n\nFounder Joe Lewis came up with the idea when he retired from the military.\n\n\"I lost friends in every service and many of those friends had very young children, some even children on the way who they would never get to meet,\u201d said Joe Lewis, Founder and President of Angels of America's Fallen. \u201cAnd so when I retired, I found myself blessed to be here for my two sons and really felt a calling.\"\n\nWith his wife\u2019s support, they launched the program about three years ago.\n\n\"At the end of this year, we'll be serving 300 children nationwide,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cWe've got 35 kids that are in El Paso County and 41 in total in Colorado.\"\n\nThat doesn\u2019t include the 120 kids on the wait list and the hundreds of others trying to get on it. The group pays for activities, like dance, until they turn 18.\n\n\"We're about getting the kids out of being withdrawn, or maybe fighting invisible wounds themselves but instead go out and write a story of success,\u201d said Lewis.\n\nAllowing this little ballerina to shine.\n\n\"It's seeing resiliency and it's seeing a child overcoming a really difficult piece of their life,\u201d said Lewis.\n\n\"Honestly, it just almost brings me to tears every time I see her on the stage,\u201d said Loughmiller.\n\nThis holiday season, there are 120 kids on the wait list for the Angels of America\u2019s Fallen program.
