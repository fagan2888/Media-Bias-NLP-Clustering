We know that the number of uninsured has dropped sharply; we also know that there are still a lot of uninsured. So how are we doing?\n\nThere are three issues that, I find, most reporting on the program\u2019s progress tend to ignore. The first is that the ACA was never intended to cover everyone \u2013 undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t eligible, yet account for several percent of the population. Second, because signup isn\u2019t automatic, there will always be some leakage, some eligible people who fall through the cracks. Finally, of course, a large number of states are refusing to expand Medicaid and in general trying to obstruct the law.\n\nSo it seems to me that to evaluate the program we should (a) look at states that have implemented the law as it was intended to work and (b) compare with a realistic benchmark. For the latter, I\u2019d suggest Massachusetts, where Romneycare has been in operation for almost a decade \u2013 and which still has 5 percent of adults age 18-64 uninsured, probably about half undocumented immigrants and half eligible residents falling through the cracks.\n\nHow is Obamacare doing relative to that benchmark in its second year of operation? The answer is, pretty well. In Medicare expansion states, it\u2019s already around 80 percent of the way there:\n\nPhoto\n\nAnd notice that this been achieved while the deficit has been shrinking and we\u2019ve been having the best job growth since the 1990s. Folks, this program works; not perfectly, but every single claim by its opponents \u2014 it won\u2019t reduce the number of uninsured, it will cause soaring rates, it will explode the deficit, it will kill jobs \u2014 has been proved false.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150624103451, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 24, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Most of the Way With Obamacare ( 20150624 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "Big progress on the uninsured.", "title": "Most of the Way With Obamacare", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/most-of-the-way-with-obamacare/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "Big progress on the uninsured.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 24, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1435156491, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-06-24T14:34:51-04:00"}, "utime": 20150624143451, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150624, "pdate": 20150624, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "Big progress on the uninsured.", "title": "Most of the Way With Obamacare", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/most-of-the-way-with-obamacare/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/most-of-the-way-with-obamacare/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Most of the Way With Obamacare", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf37\"", "article_summary": "\u2013 one question I found myself wondering about was how much of its original goal Obamacare has achieved.\nHow is Obamacare doing relative to that benchmark in its second year of operation?\nWe know that the number of uninsured has dropped sharply; we also know that there are still a lot of uninsured.\nFinally, of course, a large number of states are refusing to expand Medicaid and in general trying to obstruct the law.\nIn Medicare expansion states, it\u2019s already around 80 percent of the way there:PhotoAnd notice that this been achieved while the deficit has been shrinking and we\u2019ve been having the best job growth since the 1990s."}
