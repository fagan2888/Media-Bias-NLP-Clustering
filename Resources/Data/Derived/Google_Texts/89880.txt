[T]he media may have bitten off more than they can chew here: Marco’s been to the dentist and he’s ready to sink his teeth back into the policy questions voters care about.”

TOP TWEETS: @murphymike: “Source I trust sends these SC tracking numbers from a non-Jeb campaign; Trump 34, Cruz 17, Jeb 12, Rubio 10. Kasich in single digits” ... @jonathanalter: “Hillary is right. Bernie trashed Obama’s policies routinely to me and other reporters, especially in 2011-2013 period” ...@JuddLegum: “If you could force Donald Trump to read one book, what would it be?”

SHOTS FIRED -- @realDonaldTrump: “If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.”

“[W]hen CBS’s Washington bureau chief, Christopher Isham, tried to recruit him to be a part-time analyst about eight years ago, Mr. Dickerson, then working at Slate, flatly told him no. ‘He liked new media, but I think he was a little scared that television was not a sincere or deep medium,’ said Walter Isaacson, Mr. Dickerson’s former editor at Time. ‘He was worried about television being trivializing.’” http://nyti.ms/1ThKAnT

--“CBSN (http://www.cbsnews.com/live) will offer a ... stream ... with ... real-time Google Trends data and a curated Twitter stream. ... Nancy Cordes will anchor the pre-debate show beginning at 6:00 PM ... live from the Peace Center and ... post-debate coverage at 11:00 PM.”

MADELEINE ALBRIGHT on N.Y. Times Op-Ed page, “My Undiplomatic Moment: I should know better than to tell a group of women to go to hell”: “[L]ast Saturday, in the excitement of a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire, ... I delivered a line I have uttered a thousand times to applause, nodding heads and laughter: ‘There’s a special place in hell for women who don’t help each other.’ It is a phrase I first used almost 25 years ago, when I was the United States ambassador to the United Nations and worked closely with the six other female U.N. ambassadors. But this time, to my surprise, it went viral. ...

“I understand that I came across as condemning those who disagree with my political preferences. If heaven were open only to those who agreed on politics, I imagine it would be largely unoccupied.” http://nyti.ms/1TYxuLC

THE CONVERSATION – Barron’s cover, “TRUMP, SANDERS: Are they killing the market? The rise of these two extreme candidates has correlated closely with the decline in stocks the past eight months,” by Barrons.com Executive Editor John Kimelman: “Trump ... could ... punish China and other trading partners with tariffs to level the playing field. ... And that’s when he isn’t trying to deport millions of undocumented immigrants—a view that most Republicans view as highly impractical and likely to cause tremendous civil strife. ...

“If ... Sanders ... were to win, ... the U.S. would have a professed democratic socialist at the helm, with a long list of ambitious but expensive goals, such as single-payer national health care, free tuition at public colleges, and a major federal bridge- and highway-construction effort. ...

“Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research and a longtime market commentator, [says] that when investors are in a bearish mood, ‘they keep adding to their worry list. ... [A] nonestablishment figure in the West Wing might not be such a bad thing in the long run ... [I]nvestors ... have long been comfortable with political gridlock.” http://bit.ly/1WiY9BD

TOP TALKER – “Philippe Reines rips Beltway media, Erik Wemple Blog for ‘hypocrisy,’” by WashPost’s Erik Wemple, who posts this email from Philippe: “Hi Erik ... The media on media violence triggered by the ongoing release of my inbox from the four years I served in the Administration has led me to emerge from my self-imposed hibernation (for one night only). ... [Y]ou can’t throw a dart at the White House Correspondents Dinner without hitting someone who has been involved in quote approval, ground rule negotiation, source obfuscation — and every other routine thing that goes on every day ...

“While it will take until late 2018 or even 2019 for all of my 80,000+ email to be out there, I have a well informed source who already knows what’s in my email: Me. I wrote them. I read them. And right or wrong, this is the norm. It’s the norm in every newsroom — including your own — and every communications shop in the city. So anyone shocked by the gambling going on in the casino is being disingenuous at best. And they are setting themselves up for a fall when their email is outed. ... Best, Philippe.” http://wapo.st/1TYwUxJ

PETER HAMBY in the news -- NYT A13, “Capturing the Campaign In 10-Second Increments: Snapchat places a big bet as it enters the news business, by Nick Corasaniti in Bedford, N.H.: “Hamby, a former CNN reporter, was the first splashy hire. He brought on Katy Byron, a former CNBC producer and two-time Peabody Award winner, as his managing editor. They hired from CBS, ABC, cable networks and colleges for a team of roughly six journalists. ... [T]hey are already finding an audience, with more than one million viewers on every political story that they have produced.” http://nyti.ms/1RwSI2F

MOOD MUSIC -- MICHAEL GRUNWALD, “Clinton Backs Into a New Corner: If she thinks America is such a mess, why wouldn’t we want something different?”: “[O]nly one quarter of Americans believe the country is on the right track. Still, it was striking that after a record 71 months of employment growth that have created 14 million new jobs, at a time when gasoline is cheap and health care inflation is at the lowest level in half a century and the federal deficit has dropped by more than two thirds, the party in power was essentially embracing the Republican view of America as a dumpster fire.” http://politi.co/1Wi1fWw

Anthony List ... said Trump cannot be trusted.” http://bit.ly/1QdDock

--The (Columbia) State front page, above fold, “Clinton in SC touts plan for poor, rural communities,” by Jamie Self in Denmark: “Invoking the names of President Barack Obama and U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, Clinton pitched pitch herself as a better candidate than Sanders, a Vermont independent who has not been to South Carolina since the Martin Luther King weekend. ‘(Sanders) does not support, the way I do, building on the progress that the president has made, and that includes building on the Affordable Care Act.’” http://bit.ly/1ThDsYN

WORTH THE CLICK -- “Watch The Funniest Ad Of The 2016 Campaign,” by HuffPost’s Christina Willkie: “On Friday, the Cruz campaign ... releas[ed] a spoof of the iconic printer beating scene from the 1990s cult classic movie ‘Office Space.’ Originally set to the Geto Boys’ ‘Damn It Feels Good to be a Gangsta,’ the Cruz version of the scene borrows the music and changes the lyrics to ‘Damn it feels good to be a Clinton.’” http://huff.to/1Ps4itf ...

THE NEW GILDED AGE – N.Y. Times A1, above fold, “Disparity in Life Spans of the Rich and the Poor Is Growing,” by Sabrina Tavernise: “Looking at the extreme ends of the income spectrum, economists at the Brookings Institution found that for men born in 1920, there was a six-year difference in life expectancy between the top 10 percent of earners and the bottom 10 percent. For men born in 1950, that difference had more than doubled, to 14 years. For women, the gap grew to 13 years, from 4.7 years.” http://nyti.ms/1KL7tNK
