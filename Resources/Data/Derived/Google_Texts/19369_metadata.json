Nearly three dozen states use the federal exchange, and the case is whether subsidies used in those states are valid.\n\nTo illustrate some of the concerns at stake, we spoke to three people now receiving Affordable Care Act coverage about how the Supreme Court decision might change their lives.\n\nJULIE HAMILTON, Resident of Virginia: My name is Julie Hamilton. I live in Richmond, Virginia. And I\u2019m currently receiving a subsidy through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe subsidy is very important to me, because, about a year ago, I was diagnosed with mesothelioma, which is a very serious form of cancer and, in my case, affected my lungs. I had to see an expert at Duke University. And he prescribed treatment, which included chemotherapy and an operation to remove my left lung.\n\nSince the treatment was prolonged, and I was sick during my chemotherapy, I was receiving short-term disability. But when that ran out, my company was forced to let me go. And I went on disability insurance.\n\nI decided to keep my company\u2019s insurance through COBRA, but I was having a hard time affording the premium. In November, I went to a workshop that explained the Affordable Care Act. And there were counselors there that helped me get signed up and choose a plan.\n\nThey also explained to me the subsidy that I qualified for. With my $498 subsidy, the premium comes down to $137 a month, which I can afford.\n\nAs I\u2019m watching the Supreme Court as they\u2019re making their decision, I\u2019m feeling very anxious about losing my health care, because I will need follow-up care for the rest of my life.\n\nMICHAEL KOLE, Resident of Detroit: My name is Michael Kole. I live here in Belleville, Michigan, which is a suburb of either Ann Arbor or Detroit, depending on how you look at it.\n\nThe ACA has affected me a negative way. My premiums have gone up from 300-some-odd dollars a month back in 2010, when the law was started, up to $850 a month now, for actually less insurance than I had previously. I had to make some tough decisions. And one of them was to close my office in Belleville here and move to my home office, saving about $4,000 or $5,000 in rent, insurance and utilities, so I could pay the additional premiums.\n\nI don\u2019t have the same choices of doctors that I used to have, can\u2019t use the same labs for blood testing that I used to. I\u2019m covered for things that I don\u2019t need. And I\u2019m paying almost $400 a month, or $5,000 a year.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling that is coming out soon, what I\u2019m hoping for that \u2014 out of that decision is that the Congress and the president actually sit down and negotiate a bipartisan fix for all of this.\n\nVANITA JOHNSON, Resident of Michigan: My name is Vanita Johnson. I live in Highland Park, Michigan, along with my daughter, Candace Walker (ph). I\u2019m a security officer at the College of Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nAnd I receive subsidies from the Affordable Health Care. I worked for Detroit Public Schools for 10 years. And I had Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which my employer paid for. I had very \u2014 I had full coverage. I had very good health care insurance, not only for myself, but also for my children.\n\nAnd as of July the 30th, 2010, my employment was terminated, and I lost all my health care insurance, not only for myself, but for my children also. I couldn\u2019t afford the COBRA. So I had to go without insurance for three years.\n\nIt was devastating. I couldn\u2019t go to the doctor. I needed medication to control my high blood pressure, my allergies and my acid reflux. And I couldn\u2019t afford to go to the doctor.\n\nWhen Affordable Health Care started, I signed up right away. I called the number. And they walked me all the way through it. I was able to go to the doctor on a regular basis. I was able to get my medication. I was also \u2014 and my daughter was able to have her surgery. She had this \u2014 they discovered a lump on her breast.\n\nSo she was able to get that done. So it was liberating, you know? It took a weight off of me. As I look at this, the King vs. Burwell and how it will affect me and my child, if they decide to stop the subsidies, I won\u2019t have insurance. I will be back at step one, like I was back in 2010.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Now joining us for a broader view of the stakes for millions of Americans is Julie Rovner, who covers this for Kaiser Health News.\n\nSo, Julie, start by telling us what those voices we just listened to are basically telling us.\n\nJULIE ROVNER, Kaiser Health News: Well, they are representative of a couple of things.\n\nOne is that there have been winners and losers with the Affordable Care Act, and that if the Supreme Court were to strike down the subsidies in the states that are using healthcare.gov, the federal exchange, there will be a different set of winners and losers. So it would definitely shake things up quite a lot.\n\nGWEN IFILL: So we\u2019re talking about three basic issues here, preexisting conditions, which, of course, is the part that the administration likes to talk about, subsidies, support for people who can\u2019t otherwise afford to pay, and then the concern about the premiums, whether premiums are becoming too expensive.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: That\u2019s right.\n\nI mean, this has always been sort of seen as a three-legged stool, as they say, that in order to allow people who have preexisting conditions to get coverage, you have to get a bigger pool. You have to get healthy people. In order to get healthy people, to be able to afford insurance, you have to give them the premium subsidies.\n\nIf you knock out any one of those, it makes the other two work not so well.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Let\u2019s talk \u2014 take a couple of additional questions those folks we just heard from. The first is Julie Hamilton. We just heard her talking about subsidies. Let\u2019s hear her question.\n\nJULIE HAMILTON: If the Supreme Court decides that subsidies can\u2019t continue in states like Virginia, how soon will my subsidy end?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: This is the source of a lot of debate. Generally, Supreme Court decisions take effect 25 days after they\u2019re issued. That gives the losing party time to basically go back and ask them to reconsider.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of talk about there has been a 90-day grace period for some people. But those are people with subsidies. So if you have a subsidy, then you get 90 days before they can end your insurance. In this case, though, these people won\u2019t have subsidies anymore.\n\nSo most of them will only get whatever their state allows. That is normally 30 days. So, basically 30 days after you don\u2019t pay your premium, which, for most people in this case would be August 1, then insurance companies would start to cancel policies. That would be September 1.\n\nGWEN IFILL: We have an additional question from Michael Kole, the man who wasn\u2019t so thrilled with the way this has been working.\n\nMICHAEL KOLE: If the Supreme Court rules against the subsidies, when will the system balance out? Will it \u2014 will my premiums go down? Will somebody else\u2019s premiums go up? Do you see an end to this, or will it create chaos?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Well, I think there\u2019s pretty much a consensus that there would be chaos in the markets that would be affected by this. In the states that have their own exchanges, everything would pretty much go along as it is now.\n\nBut in states, including Mr. Kole\u2019s state, there would be quite a mess. Most of the premiums would go up. I\u2019m not sure anybody\u2019s premiums would go down. What would happen is that people who could no longer afford insurance would mostly drop out. People who were sick and really need their insurance would stay in. So the group of people who are insured would be more expensive overall .\n\nAnd so everybody who remains in that pool, their premiums would go up. It is hard to see whose premiums would go down in that situation. I think what people hope might happen is that Congress might get together with the president and work something out.\n\nBut even the Republicans by themselves haven\u2019t been able to come to any consensus on what they should do if the Supreme Court acts for the challengers. The idea that they could get something they would agree on with President Obama, I think, everybody agrees may be a little farfetched.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Vanita Johnson also had another question.\n\nVANITA JOHNSON: Do the individual states have a plan if they decide to stop the subsidies?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Well, a couple of them do. But it\u2019s not clear how quickly that could take effect.\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty about whether states could just write a one-page letter to the federal government saying, we establish an exchange on paper, and we still want to use healthcare.gov and we will lease it. There are those who say that if states try to do that, that they will go back and sue and they will say, no, that\u2019s not right.\n\nSo there is a lot of uncertainty, there\u2019s, of course, uncertainty about what exactly the court will do, what they will say, which states in particular will be affected, but generally nobody has a very good contingency plan.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Well, that\u2019s what I was going to ask you. She asked about the states. I\u2019m curious about the federal government. We have all had conversations with the secretary of health and human services, and the one question she stopped short of saying, what is their plan B?\n\nAny better indication of that?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: No. And she\u2019s been asked several times, including at a congressional hearing last week. The administration\u2019s official line is, we don\u2019t think the Supreme Court will rule for the challengers, so we don\u2019t have a contingency plan.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s really the case. But, certainly, there\u2019s not very much they could do legally in this situation. The only \u2014 It would really be up to Congress to fix it. Congress could fix it with a one-line bill, but nobody thinks they\u2019re going to. So the question is what Congress will then do.\n\nBut it will be, I think, more in Congress\u2019 court than it will be in the administration and the states.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Once again, how many people are we talking about affected by this outcome?\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Well, we\u2019re talking about 6.5 million people in those states that could be affected who have subsidies. The Urban Institute said that there is another million-and-a-half people or so who could be affected indirectly, because they have their own insurance in those states whose premiums could spike.\n\nGWEN IFILL: Huge consequences at the end of the Supreme Court term, as always.\n\nJulie Rovner, thank you for helping us explain it.\n\nJULIE ROVNER: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on healthcare subsidies soon.
