At the annual Cañon City Workforce Center Job Fair, 29 employers are expected to participate.

The businesses are currently hiring or will be hiring in the near future, according the event's flyer.

Bill Strutton, regional supervisor of Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, said this may be the most employers the fair has ever seen.

Some of the businesses participating are: Royal Gorge Bridge and Park, Bruce McCandless Colorado State Veterans Home, Colorado Department of Corrections, Mile High Youth Corps and St. Thomas More Hospital. Strutton said many of the job openings are in Cañon City.

He said at least a few employers will be conducting interviews on the spot.

"I would wear business-appropriate clothing," he said. "It would be to the job seeker's advantage to be prepared ... and I would get there as soon as I could. It's kind of the early bird gets the worm kind of thing."

The fair includes full and part-time positions.

"All job seekers are invited to attend," he said. "The jobs aren't just entry level."

He said staff will assist those who are looking for a job.

"We'll have staff at the front door that will make copies of resumes and copies of applications so that the job seekers ... can go to table to table and talk to the employers to see if there's any interest," Strutton said. "If there is, they can hand them an application and a resume."

He said the local work force center helps to make a connection between employers looking to fill positions and people looking for jobs.

3224 Independence Road.

The event will be from 8 a.m. to noon Wednesday at The Abbey Events Complex, 2951 E. U.S. 50.
