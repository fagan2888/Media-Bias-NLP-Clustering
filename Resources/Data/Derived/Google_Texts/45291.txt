Anthem and Harvard Pilgrim continue to sell individual exchange plans in Maine.

The only Consumer Operated and Oriented Plan (CO-OP) carrier that earned a profit in 2014 will stop selling individual and family coverage for 2016 after Dec. 26.

Community Health Options, the Maine-based CO-OP that serves Maine and New Hampshire, will freeze non-group enrollment at the year-end level because of concerns about higher-than-expected claims, according to Maine Insurance Commissioner Eric Cioppa and New Hampshire Insurance Commissioner Roger Sevigny.
