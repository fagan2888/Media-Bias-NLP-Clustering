The jury also convicted Cross of three counts of attempted murder for shooting at three other people.\n\nCross said during the trial he shot them because he thought they were Jewish but none of those killed were in fact Jewish.\n\nCross, 74, gave a Nazi salute to the jury, and declared \u201cDeath to the Jews\u201d at the end of his closing statement before the jury retired to consider his sentence.\n\nAt his two-week-long trial, Cross admitted he committed the killings, and said he had wanted to kill as many Jews as he could.\n\nCross, also known as Glenn Miller, said Jews control the media, financial institutions and the movie industry and he blamed Jewish women for backing a movement that led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1973 to legalize abortion.\n\nAt the end of his closing statement on Tuesday, Cross glared at jurors over his reading glasses as he sat in a wheelchair and dared them to give him the death penalty.\n\n\u201cI voluntarily sacrificed my freedom for my people,\u201d Cross said. \u201cDo you see fear in me? You see a proud white man.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Jewish, Kansas City, KKK, Nazi", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Frazier Glenn Cross, 74, a former senior member of the Ku Klux Klan, shouted", "title": "Kansas Jewish centers shooter gets the death penalty", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/08/kansas-jewish-centers-shooter-gets-the-death-penalty/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Frazier-Glenn-Cross.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/08/kansas-jewish-centers-shooter-gets-the-death-penalty/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/09/08/kansas-jewish-centers-shooter-gets-the-death-penalty/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Frazier Glenn Cross, 74, a former senior member of the Ku Klux Klan, shouted"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5df\"", "article_summary": "KANSAS CITY, Kan., (Reuters) \u2013 A Kansas jury on Tuesday said a white supremacist who shot three people to death outside two Jewish centers last year should be put to death for the crimes.\nCross said during the trial he shot them because he thought they were Jewish but none of those killed were in fact Jewish.\nAt his two-week-long trial, Cross admitted he committed the killings, and said he had wanted to kill as many Jews as he could.\nThe jury also convicted Cross of three counts of attempted murder for shooting at three other people.\nCross, 74, gave a Nazi salute to the jury, and declared \u201cDeath to the Jews\u201d at the end of his closing statement before the jury retired to consider his sentence."}
