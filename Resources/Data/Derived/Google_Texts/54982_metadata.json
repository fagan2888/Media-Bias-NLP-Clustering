Not any modern kiddie-winkies, that\u2019s for sure.\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf has been de-fanged. He is now a modern, new-age wolf and he\u2019s not even moderately scary.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t eat Grandma. He doesn\u2019t stalk Little Red Riding Hood. He\u2019s not very big and he\u2019s about as bad as the faux-lumberjack barista at your local Gloria Jeans.\n\nHe\u2019s a vegan scaredy-wolf.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a bit of time lately reading our baby the Ladybird Books edition of the classic Little Red Riding Hood and I\u2019ve discovered the story has been reimagined \u2014 and completely de-fanged \u2014 to suit the sensitive modern poppet.\n\nThat\u2019s a modern fable for you. No axes, no breaches of the RSPCA guidelines and definitely no moral. No tiny tots are having nightmares after that little bedtime read.\n\nIn the bleak, tough-love Grimm brothers\u2019 1812 telling of the traditional folk tale, the Big Bad Wolf follows Red through the forest, then sneaks ahead of her to Grandma\u2019s house, swallows Grandma whole and waits in her bed, dressed in Granny\u2019s nightie and curlers.\n\nRed is starting to get suspicious about Granny\u2019s gleaming fangs and beady little eyes, and Wolf is just about to scoff the annoying little trollop and her frumpy hood in one gulp when \u2014 aha! \u2014 a manly local woodsman shows up and slashes the wolf\u2019s belly open with his axe.\n\nThe wolf is not dead yet, just comatose. Sweet old Granny and little Red fill his body with heavy stones and then stand around chortling while the wolf attempts to flee.\n\nThe wolf eventually collapses and dies under the weight of the stones.\n\nIn early 19th century Germany, that was seen as a happy ending.\n\nThe moral of the story? I guess it was that dangers lurk in the darkness, that you should stay close to home, and that wild carnivores in drag cannot be trusted under any circumstances.\n\nIn 2014, happy endings apparently do not involve death, harm to animals or morals.\n\nThe Ladybird version has Riding Hood arriving to visit Grandma, and observing that she seems terribly hairy and bad-breathed.\n\nThen she feels a tug at her skirt \u2014 it\u2019s Grandma, hiding under the bed! Riding Hood scampers under the bed too \u2014 and then, just in the nick of time, Riding Hood\u2019s dad shows up and the wolf is \u201cso frightened he ran right out of the door.\n\nHe never came back. And Granny, Little Red Riding Hood and her father all had a big hug!\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a modern fable for you. No axes, no breaches of the RSPCA guidelines and definitely no moral. No tiny tots are having nightmares after that little bedtime read.\n\nHere\u2019s a confession. I secretly like the sanitised version better. I know, I know.\n\nYou\u2019ll say children are too sheltered these days; it never did us any harm to hear scary stories; it\u2019s terrible that our cultural heritage is being corrupted like this; modern kids have no idea about hardship or the realities of life; it\u2019s time the little punks toughened up and learnt to survive in the world.\n\nThe Big Bad Wolf has been de-fanged. He is now a modern, new-age wolf and he\u2019s not even moderately scary.\n\nI agree. It would be a shame if modern children never feel the thrill of a scary story.\n\nBut I also think one of the great joys of being a parent is that you can dictate the outcome. It\u2019s the one time in life when you can clean things up a bit and take out the unpleasant parts.\n\nYou can postpone the arrival of woodland justice for as long as you think appropriate \u2014 and I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m going to leave the judgment call about that to two dead German sadomasochists.\n\nCensorship is part of a proud Harvey family tradition.\n\nAs a tiny girl, I remember sobbing in despair when my mother read me the story of Babar the little elephant.\n\nEarly in the book, Babar\u2019s mother gets shot by hunters and he is orphaned. I howled. I wept. I was so upset for poor little Babar.\n\nI wanted Babar\u2019s mum to stay alive. I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the adventures Babar was going to have later. I couldn\u2019t get over the dreadful idea that someone could murder a mummy.\n\nSo my own mummy fixed it. She got out a bottle of White-Out and painted over the offending words, and in her neat handwriting retold the story.\n\n\u201cBabar\u2019s mother lay down and pretended to be dead until the hunters went away,\u201d Mum wrote.\n\nI remember \u2014 or it might be an embellishment of my imagination \u2014 her blowing softly on the White-Out to dry it while I looked on, sniffling. I can still picture her handwriting underneath the picture of the mummy elephant lying on the ground.\n\nAnd that made it all better. I instantly and wholly believed Mum\u2019s new, improved version of the story, completely accepting her flagrant act of censorship.\n\nIt was as if the old version had never existed. We continued reading, me all safe and snugly in bed with my head nestled on Mum\u2019s lap, and then I went to sleep completely nightmare-free.\n\nI\u2019ve never forgotten that moment; the extraordinary power of a mother to make everything right.\n\nYeah, it was disrespectful to the original text. It prevented me from learning a valuable life lesson \u2014 death is real and even mummies will die one day.\n\nBut I was three. I didn\u2019t need to know it. And when I go out and buy my own copy of Babar to read to little people some time soon, I\u2019ll be buying a bottle of White-Out and a biro at the same time.\n\nAs for Bambi \u2014 forget it. Not in our house. We don\u2019t do mothers getting shot at bedtime. Not yet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who&#8217;s afraid of the big, bad wolf?
