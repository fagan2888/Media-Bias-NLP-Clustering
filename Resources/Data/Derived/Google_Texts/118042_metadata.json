The mayor and his son are charged with hacking into and bringing down an anti-Roque website \u2014 recallroque.com \u2014 that was created by Munoz early last year. The hacking trial is scheduled to get under way Thursday.\n\nA court document related to the case that was released Wednesday says \u201cfrom February 2011 to the present Jose Munoz was a confidential source of information to the FBI\u201d and \u201cduring that time, Mr. Munoz provided information on other matters.\u201d\n\nRomano said the revelation will have no impact of the board, which operates in an open and transparent manner and with the consent of counsel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that would even come before the board,\u201d said Romano, adding that he did not know Munoz was a confidential informant for the FBI.\n\nFreeholder Bill O\u2019Dea said he too was unaware Munoz was working with the FBI until it was published in The Jersey Journal and that he thinks of him as a whistleblower.\n\n\u201cElected officials take an oath that if they know about corruption or illegal activity, they have an obligation to report it,\u201d O\u2019Dea said. \u201cThe truth of the matter is we are held to a higher level of responsibility than the average citizen.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say that on Feb. 8, 2012, Joseph Roque hacked into online accounts connected to the website and used that access to disable the website. Mayor Roque then harassed and attempted to intimidate several people associated with the website, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nRoque declined to comment on the new information regarding Munoz. Freeholder Tilo Rivas declined to comment on Munoz.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "hudson county,jersey-city", "title": "2 colleagues praise West New York Freeholder Jose Munoz for being FBI informant", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"2 colleagues praise West New York Freeholder Jose Munoz for being FBI informant\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/2_colleagues_praise_west_new_y.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/hudson_voices_impact/photo/9712079-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11194358\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-07T07:03:46Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"hudson county\",\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.nj.com/hudson_voices_impact/photo/9712079-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Two Hudson County freeholders praised fellow Freeholder Jose Munoz yesterday for cooperating with the FBI after court documents revealed Munoz has been a confidential federal informant since 2011.", "card": "summary", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  8:31 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/hudson_voices_impact/photo/josemunozjpg-3b2695898b7055bf.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Two Hudson County freeholders praised fellow Freeholder Jose Munoz yesterday for cooperating with the FBI after court documents revealed Munoz has been a confidential federal informant since 2011.", "title": "2 colleagues praise West New York Freeholder Jose Munoz for being FBI informant", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2013/09/2_colleagues_praise_west_new_y.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 07, 2013,  8:30 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Two Hudson County freeholders praised fellow Freeholder Jose Munoz yesterday for cooperating with the FBI after court documents revealed Munoz has been a confidential federal informant since 2011."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde00\"", "article_summary": "Two Hudson County freeholders praised fellow Freeholder Jose Munoz yesterday for cooperating with the FBI after court documents revealed Munoz has been a confidential federal informant since 2011.\nMayor Roque then harassed and attempted to intimidate several people associated with the website, according to a criminal complaint.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that would even come before the board,\u201d said Romano, adding that he did not know Munoz was a confidential informant for the FBI.\n\u201cI full support any investigation by our law enforcement agencies,\u201d said Freeholder Chairman Anthony Romano, who is a Hoboken police captain.\nRoque declined to comment on the new information regarding Munoz."}
