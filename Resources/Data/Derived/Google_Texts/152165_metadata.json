When asked how long the hospital might be closed, he said: \u201cI\u2019m uncertain, but I hope not very long. I hope it will be a matter of days.\u201d\n\nManagement is focused on two things, Furniss said: the introduction of capital into the business and preserving the hospital\u2019s license.\n\nOn Friday, the hospital transferred about 20 patients to other facilities and furloughed about 150 employees, he said. It did not pay all of those employees, he said.\n\nForest Park reflects a growing trend of high-end, for-profit, doctor-owned hospitals. It has five facilities across Texas, and at least two others are troubled. The Dallas hospital, which opened in 2009, specializes in bariatric, orthopedic and certain pediatric surgeries.\n\nForest Park\u2019s San Antonio hospital closed Oct. 15 and has not reopened. In September, its Frisco hospital filed for bankruptcy reorganization to restructure more than $12 million in debt, but it\u2019s still open.\n\n\u201cThe hospital has been under distress for several months and has been actively seeking additional capital to allow continued operations,\u201d FPMC Services, the Dallas-based operator of Forest Park, said in an Oct. 15 letter to state officials. \u201cIt has become apparent that the hospital will not be able to secure the additional capital.\u201d\n\nLast week in Dallas, the hospital\u2019s lender did not fund a drawdown on its revolving line of credit for just over $1 million, Furniss said. He declined to name the lender but said the $10 million-plus credit line had \u201cplenty\u201d of borrowing capacity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re disappointed,\u201d Furniss said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re trying to do everything we can to solve the problem right now and not do things counterproductive to that.\u201d\n\nFinancing is just one of the issues facing for-profit, physician-owned hospitals under the new health care model.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re looking at is a symptom and not the underlying disease or problem,\u201d Furniss said. \u201cThis all is arising out of the perhaps unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThe health care law bars physician-owned hospitals from expanding, and those that do can\u2019t receive Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements. Forest Park doctors must split their time at different facilities to handle such cases, creating \u201cdownward pressure on revenue,\u201d he said.\n\nConsolidation in health care is another complication for smaller hospital systems like Forest Park, Furniss said. For example, UT Southwestern Medical Center last month announced a collaboration with Texas Health Resources, and Baylor Health Care System merged with Scott & White Healthcare in 2013.\n\n\u201cThe ACA as well as the way the market is moving toward value-based care puts increasing pressure on providers to understand health risk and cost-of-care delivery in a new way,\u201d said Mark Chronister, head of health and benefits practice at Mercer in Dallas. \u201cThe challenge is access to the data necessary to manage their practice under the new reimbursement models. One of the advantages of consolidation is the critical mass necessary to fund access to that data.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Dallas, Frisco and San Antonio, Forest Park operates hospitals in Fort Worth and Southlake. One in Austin is under construction.\n\nCould the Fort Worth and Southlake hospitals also shut down? \u201cI have no reason to believe that will occur,\u201d because their financing position is much different, Furniss said.\n\nTwitter: @SJeanDallas", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Dallas hospital closed suddenly Friday due to lending complications but is looking for ways to resolve the problem.", "og": {"description": "The Dallas hospital closed suddenly Friday due to lending complications but is looking for ways to resolve the problem.", "title": "Management working to reopen Forest Park Medical Center", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151103-management-working-to-reopen-forest-park-medical-center.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151103-business_nb_5creforestlane_05_16639111.ece/BINARY/original/BUSINESS_NB_5CREFORESTLANE_05_16639111", "height": 850}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-11-03T16:49:04Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-11-03T16:46:18Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Management working to reopen Forest Park Medical Center\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151103-management-working-to-reopen-forest-park-medical-center.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151103-business_nb_5creforestlane_05_16639111.ece/BINARY/original/BUSINESS_NB_5CREFORESTLANE_05_16639111\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2515586\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-11-03T16:46:18Z\", \"section\": \"Health Care\", \"author\": \"SHERYL JEAN\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/health-care/20151103-business_nb_5creforestlane_05_16639111.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/BUSINESS_NB_5CREFORESTLANE_05_16639111", "publishtime": "2015-11-03T16:46:18Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The management company for Forest Park Medical Center in Dallas, which closed suddenly Friday because of lending complications, is looking for ways to resolve the problem but isn\u2019t exactly sure when it will reopen.\nConsolidation in health care is another complication for smaller hospital systems like Forest Park, Furniss said.\nTodd Furniss, chairman of the management company for the Forest Park chain of luxury hospitals, said the \u201cpause\u201d in Dallas operations is temporary.\nFor example, UT Southwestern Medical Center last month announced a collaboration with Texas Health Resources, and Baylor Health Care System merged with Scott & White Healthcare in 2013.\nForest Park doctors must split their time at different facilities to handle such cases, creating \u201cdownward pressure on revenue,\u201d he said."}
