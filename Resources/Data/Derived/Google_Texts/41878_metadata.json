Heck, just stepping into a batting cage puts a smile on his face.\n\nBut, for now, the Rockies\u2019 star shortstop must put all of that aside as he continues to rehabilitate from August hip surgery.\n\nWhile Tulo said he\u2019s making progress and is optimistic he will be ready for the 2015 season, he has yet to begin baseball activities.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m itching to get back to baseball, but as long as I\u2019m ready for the season opener, that\u2019s all I\u2019m focused on,\u201d he said during a phone interview from his off- season home in Las Vegas. \u201cIf (doctors and trainers) say not to rush it, then I\u2019m not going to jeopardize things.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely excited to start the baseball activity, but at the same time I know that my best chance to start the season is by playing it safe. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nAs for trade rumors that continue to swirl \u2014 most of them linking him to the New York Mets \u2014 Tulo said only that the Rockies have \u201cbeen good keeping me in the loop.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been talking to the Rockies throughout the process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have respect for each other. But my concentration right now is just on getting healthy.\u201d\n\nAt the winter meetings this month, new Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich said it would take a lot in return for the club to trade Tulowitzki or star outfielder Carlo Gonzalez.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to move them, and we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the right move to trade either one or both of those players who are all-stars \u2014 perennial all-stars,\u201d Bridich said. \u201c(Tulowitzki) plays a premium position and is the best shortstop in the game when he\u2019s healthy. That\u2019s not an easy bit to swallow for us.\u201d\n\nSo for now, none of the trade talk appears to have legs.\n\nTulowitzki has begun light running and continues a rigorous program to increase flexibility in his hips.\n\n\u201cMy bottom line is to try to get healthy to play games and play a lot of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously something that I haven\u2019t been very good at, for whatever reason. So I am trying to find that recipe for success.\u201d\n\nTulo hit .340, with 21 home runs and 52 RBIs, in 90 games last season before he injured his left hip. He had surgery Aug. 16 to repair a torn labrum. Over the past three seasons, he has played in only 264 games. In eight full seasons, he has played in more than 130 games just three times.\n\nTulo is confident that if he sticks to his rehab, he can get rid of the qualifier that says he\u2019s the best shortstop in baseball \u2014 when healthy.\n\n\u201cI feel good, but I think no matter what you say, people want to see it out on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cMe saying that I\u2019m healthy is one thing, but me going out there and proving it is another thing. In spring training, I plan to be as good as I can be and let people judge for themselves.\u201d\n\nTulo hasn\u2019t paid a lot of attention to the minor moves Bridich has made thus far this offseason. Nor did he want to get into particulars about which moves the Rockies should be making to improve after a 96-loss season.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not my job,\u201d he said. \u201cMy job is to get ready to play.\u201d\n\nBut he does know what the Rockies\u2019 top priority must be in 2015.\n\n\u201cI think we all know that we need to address the road issue,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be better on the road. \u2026 Hopefully we will all realize what it means to take a professional at-bat on the road. I think we will work on that and talk about that, and hopefully there will be some improvement.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies were 21-60 on the road this past season, where they hit only .228 and scored 255 runs, worst in the majors and the fewest in franchise history.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Troy Tulowitzki: \u201cI\u2019m itching to get back\u201d", "title": "Troy Tulowitzki: \u201cI\u2019m itching to get back\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/troy-tulowitzki-im-itching-to-get-back/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140814__troy-tulowitzki-fields-baseballp1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140814__troy-tulowitzki-fields-baseballp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T16:40:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T07:51:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Troy Tulowitzki"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb252\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYeah, I\u2019m itching to get back to baseball, but as long as I\u2019m ready for the season opener, that\u2019s all I\u2019m focused on,\u201d he said during a phone interview from his off- season home in Las Vegas.\n\u201cMe saying that I\u2019m healthy is one thing, but me going out there and proving it is another thing.\n\u201cIf (doctors and trainers) say not to rush it, then I\u2019m not going to jeopardize things.\n\u201cMy job is to get ready to play.\u201dBut he does know what the Rockies\u2019 top priority must be in 2015.\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely excited to start the baseball activity, but at the same time I know that my best chance to start the season is by playing it safe."}
