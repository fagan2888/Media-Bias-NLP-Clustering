Bismarck, N.D. Burlington-South Burlington, Vt. College Station-Bryan, Texas Columbus, Ohio El Paso, Texas Fairbanks, Alaska Fargo, N.D.-Minn. Grand Forks, N.D.-Minn. Grand Rapids-Wyoming, Mich. Greeley, Colo. Greenville-Anderson-Mauldin, S.C. Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas Laredo, Texas Lincoln, Neb. Lubbock, Texas Mankato-North Manktao, Minn. Midland, Texas Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minn. Odessa, Texas Oklahoma City, Okla. Omaha-Council Bluffs, Neb.-Iowa Rochester, Minn. San Angelo, Texas Sherman-Denison, Texas Sioux Falls, S.D. Spartanburg, S.C. St. Cloud, Minn. Sumter, S.C. Topeka, Kan.\n\nIn 22 of those 33 cities, wage growth still \u201cremains unusually low,\u201d lingering below its prerecession rate. (See the full chart for details.)\n\nColumbus, Houston, Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and Topeka are listed as cities that have restored their employment rate to \u201cat or below its prerecession level,\u201d but have failed to grow workers\u2019 wages.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal called this lack of growth \u201ca sign that something remains amiss even in the nation\u2019s healthiest cities.\u201d\n\nThere are 11 cities where both the employment rate and wages have recovered since the recession, including Midland, Texas, and Bismarck, N.D.\n\nJames Sherk, the senior policy analyst in labor economics at The Heritage Foundation, said The Wall Street Journal report has flaws.\n\n\u201cThe Journal only looked at nominal wage growth\u2014changes in wages that do not adjust for inflation,\u201d Sherk said. \u201cEconomists would expect wage growth to slow when inflation slowed. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the real wage growth, adjusting for inflation, has slowed.\u201d\n\nSherk added that \u201cwage growth has been generally slow during this recovery,\u201d but in recent months \u201cappears to have picked up.\u201d\n\nSalim Furth, the senior policy analyst in macroeconomics at The Heritage Foundation, wrote in a recent issue brief that \u201cwage growth over the past two years has been typical of historical averages.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy examining several measures of aggregate wage growth, one gains a more complete picture of historical and recent trends. Although the historical data are well-known and recent data are widely available, many pundits have written about \u2018stagnant wages.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThat description of the recent trends has the risk of giving the false impression that the recovery, although delayed and incomplete elsewhere, is absent in wages. A better conclusion is that wage growth is mediocre but real; the same can be said of GDP and employment growth.\n\n\u201cPolicymakers need not be satisfied with wage growth of less than 1 percent per year. Regulatory reforms that lower the cost of living, especially in the major consumer spending categories, can help to stretch each hour\u2019s wage further, effectively raising real wages,\u201d concluded Furth.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans might have jobs, but they probably aren\u2019t getting raises.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Americans might have jobs, but they probably aren\u2019t getting raises.", "title": "Study: Only 33 U.S. Cities Have Recovered From Recession", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150604_WageGrowth.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-04T22:59:07+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1dhYYdt"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Americans might have jobs, but they probably aren\u2019t getting raises.", "title": "Study: Only 33 U.S. Cities Have Recovered From Recession", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150604_WageGrowth.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs", "published_time": "2015-06-04T16:52:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T22:59:07+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Wages, employment, job growth, wage growth"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca33e\"", "article_summary": "In 22 of those 33 cities, wage growth still \u201cremains unusually low,\u201d lingering below its prerecession rate.\nA better conclusion is that wage growth is mediocre but real; the same can be said of GDP and employment growth.\nLubbock, Texas Mankato-North Manktao, Minn.
