And very few people respond and try to ask about it. We\u2019re here to tell the people they can ask about it, and they can get their bills lowered.\u201d\n\nFranchini says one of the most common places this happens is in emergency rooms, when they see a doctor who contracts with the hospital, but isn\u2019t licensed with their health maintenance carrier.\n\n\u201cThey usually go to an emergency room,\u201d Franchini said. \u201cAnd they have a co-pay, and a deductible, so they pay it and then they come back and they think their done with their health maintenance plan, and they find out they get a bill for $2,000 over what they paid, and most of them say well that must be what I owe, it isn\u2019t what they owe, it\u2019s extra billing.\u201d\n\nFranchini says some bills like this can be extreme, like one couple in Albuquerque that were rushed to the emergency room to have an emergency delivery of triplets.\n\n\u201cThat couple ended up getting a $3.5 million bill for their care,\u201d Franchini said. \u201cAnd ultimately, after we helped them, and we went back to the institutions that were charging these bills, they paid $25,000 for their co-pay and $1,000 for their deductible, and the rest was paid for by the hospitals and the doctors involved in the operations.\u201d\n\nFranchini says if you are confused by a medical bill, try calling your doctor or insurance company, and if you don\u2019t like the answer you can call the superintendent of insurance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to help them solve that,\u201d Franchini said. \u201cThey can call the Department of Insurance and ask for managed health care, and our managed health care department is designed to help people with this very problem.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit osi.state.nm.us.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Regional", "description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, more New Mexicans have health insurance than ever before, and that means more people are also falling victim to a common", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://krwg.org/post/surprise-medical-bills-are-common-problem-new-mexico", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/krwg/files/styles/medium/public/201603/Supterintendent.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Under the Affordable Care Act, more New Mexicans have health insurance than ever before, and that means more people are also falling victim to a common", "title": "Surprise Medical Bills Are A Common Problem In New Mexico"}, "story_id": 471832152, "twitter": {"site": "@krwg", "card": "summary", "creator": "@krwg"}, "author": "Samantha Sonner", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Surprise Medical Bills Are A Common Problem In New Mexico"}, "nid": 111537, "datePublished": "2016-03-25", "wordCount": 421, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Under the Affordable Care Act, more New Mexicans have health insurance than ever before, and that means more people are also falling victim to a common problem\u2026 surprise medical bills.\n\u201cWe know that 35% of all the medical bills in this country are sent out with high then expected costs to the billings,\u201d Franchini said.\n\u201cThey can call the Department of Insurance and ask for managed health care, and our managed health care department is designed to help people with this very problem.\u201dFor more information, visit osi.state.nm.us.\n\u201cThat couple ended up getting a $3.5 million bill for their care,\u201d Franchini said.\nIf you\u2019ve gone to the Doctor thinking you were covered by insurance, and then received another bill in the mail weeks later, John Franchini, Superintendent of Insurance in New Mexico, says your not alone."}
