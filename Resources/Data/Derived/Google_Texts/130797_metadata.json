You can recreate that scene now, thanks to a Canadian company.\n\nMinus the pull tab and signature crack of opening an aluminum can, anyway. Vitality Air uses aluminum bottles to package their wares, and they\u2019re packaging at an increasingly rapid pace these days. That\u2019s because the company is doing a very brisk trade in China, which doesn\u2019t come as a complete surprise. Their next shipment is expected to be around 4,000 bottles.\n\nThe air quality in China has been a major problem for its residents for decades. Some of its more well-off citizens have, like President Scroob, discovered the delights of artisinal fresh air. How well-off? Presumably these are folks with plenty of disposable income, because Vitality charges around $14 for a vial that contains just three liters of compressed Alberta air.\n\nThey say that\u2019s enough for 80 breaths. While at rest, the average adult takes between 12 and 20 breaths every minute. Presumably you\u2019re not supposed to just suck it all up in one go like Scroob does, but if you did you\u2019d burn through your $14 purchase in just four minutes. Fortunately, smog sufferers can cut their pre-breath costs by buying in bulk. A 7.7-liter bottle goes for about $23.\n\nVitality doesn\u2019t sell just any old air. They\u2019re bottling up the same pure, Rocky Mountain air from Banff and Lake Louise that native Albertans and tourists from around the globe have been enjoying for ages. Not mixed, mind you. They\u2019re two separate products, because the discerning respiratory system demands it.", "article_metadata": {"zdid": 1642442, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "@geekdotcom", "description": "Remember that scene in Spaceballs where President Scroob pulls a can of Perri-Air out of his desk drawer and cracks it open?
