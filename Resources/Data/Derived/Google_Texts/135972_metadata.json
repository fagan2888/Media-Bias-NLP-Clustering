Bob Martinez, now a policy analyst with the Holland & Knight law firm. Martinez has taken up the cause and will advocate in Tallahassee for the former boys home residents known as the \u201cWhite House Boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm familiar with the issues. I knew it was a troubled site historically,\u201d Martinez said Friday.\n\nIn fact, the former governor once took action against administrators at the former Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, also known as the Florida School for Boys in Marianna, dismissing some of the center's administrators during his tenure as governor from 1987-1991.\n\nOne of his predecessors, Gov. Claude Kirk, who served from 1967-1971, paid a visit to the school and concluded that if parents knew the circumstances their children were in they would \u201cbe up there with rifles.\u201d\n\nMartinez will help lawyers from the Masterson Law Group navigate the state Capitol, where their best hopes lie to win formal recognition of atrocities described by former wards of the school.\n\nTom Masterson says he is representing some 500 men who were ordered to the school as boys, many to suffer cruel abuse and beatings in a cottage known as the White House.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe White House Boys tried and failed in the courts, with a civil suit in 2009 dismissed because of statutes of limitations. They've tried the Legislature through its claims bill process but were rebuffed because such actions typically require a court judgment and award.\n\nMasterson said Friday the best strategy might be to mimic the path taken by advocates for victims of the Rosewood massacre.\n\nIn that case, 70 years after a white mob killed four black men and burned the black hamlet near Cedar Key to the ground, lawmakers submitted legislation to compensate victims. Then-speaker Bolly \u201cBo\u201d Johnson, a Democrat from Milton, convened an academic research team made up of professors from the state's major universities to investigate Rosewood and report its findings to the Legislature.\n\nA special master reviewed the evidence and concluded that it was \u201cclear that government officials were responsible for some of the damages sustained by the claimants,\u201d and recommended a bill favorably to the Legislature.\n\nIn their next session, in 1994, lawmakers approved $2.1 million in reparations for those displaced and survivors.\n\nFollowing the Rosewood road map \u201cto me, would be the logical thing to do at this stage,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nIn order to accomplish that, the White House Boys will have to have some champions in Tallahassee. That's where Martinez and his years of influence come in.\n\nIn addition to his role as former governor, he was Tampa's mayor from 1979 to 1986. He held a Cabinet-level office as the nation's second drug czar under President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe White House Boys welcomed the news that Martinez was on board.\n\n\u201cThis is a good thing. He's a man with a lot of power. I'm very glad that he has taken up our cause,\u201d said Robert Staley of Clearwater, a Dozier ward from 1963 to 1964. \u201cEverybody who walked through that door should get something. I think they should get something that shows them the state of Florida cares enough to make them feel better, and give them an apology, and maybe help them out of a financial situation that they're in. A lot of people are in a bad way.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nMasterson said many of those who spent time at Dozier have physical disabilities relating to their treatment and show signs of post-traumatic stress, anger, and depression. Many have been unable to maintain friendships and relationships.\n\nThe lawyer isn't talking about financial terms yet. A class of 500 plaintiffs dwarfs the 10 or so that survived the Rosewood massacre and split the reparations, not counting families who were run out of town and those who received college scholarships.\n\n\u201cIf nothing happens financially, if they just acknowledge it \u2014 and I'd like to see them do something to memorialize it \u2014 it would be a step in the right direction,\u201d Masterson said.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers from the University of South Florida continue to examine the site.\n\nAnthropology professor Erin Kimmerle and a team of USF professors and graduate students turned their attention to Dozier after the allegations of the White House Boys caught the ear of then-Gov. Charlie Crist in 2008. Crist ordered the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate the complaints of abuse and the status of a cemetery on the school grounds.\n\nFDLE concluded there was no evidence of foul play and 31 graves on the premises were legitimate and documented.\n\nKimmerle's group, conducting much more advanced research, has since found 55 graves at the site. jstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 15 Feb 2014 01:00:00 -0400", "Description": "For the state to compensate victims of abuse at a notorious Panhandle boys\u2019 home, advocates say they\u2019ll have to frame the campaign as another Rosewood \u2014 the town burned to the ground in a fatal 1923 racist melee.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "For the state to compensate victims of abuse at a notorious Panhandle boys\u2019 home, advocates say they\u2019ll have to frame the campaign as another Rosewood \u2014 the town burned to the ground in a fatal 1923 racist melee.", "title": "Bob Martinez takes up fight to get reparations for Dozier victims", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/education/martinez-takes-up-fight-to-get-reparations-for-dozier-victims-20140215/", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140215/ARTICLE/140219500/AR/0/AR-140219500.jpg", "height": 448}, "updated_time": "2014-02-15T09:33:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "For the state to compensate victims of abuse at a notorious Panhandle boys\u2019 home, advocates say they\u2019ll have to frame the campaign as another Rosewood \u2014 the town burned to the ground in a fatal 1923 racist melee.", "title": "Bob Martinez takes up fight to get reparations for Dozier victims", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140215/ARTICLE/140219500/AR/0/AR-140219500.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-15T01:00:00Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-15T09:33:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bob Martinez,dozier"}, "article_summary": "\u2756 \u2756 \u2756The White House Boys tried and failed in the courts, with a civil suit in 2009 dismissed because of statutes of limitations.\nIn order to accomplish that, the White House Boys will have to have some champions in Tallahassee.\nThe White House Boys welcomed the news that Martinez was on board.\nMartinez has taken up the cause and will advocate in Tallahassee for the former boys home residents known as the \u201cWhite House Boys.\u201d\u201cI'm familiar with the issues.\nAnthropology professor Erin Kimmerle and a team of USF professors and graduate students turned their attention to Dozier after the allegations of the White House Boys caught the ear of then-Gov."}
