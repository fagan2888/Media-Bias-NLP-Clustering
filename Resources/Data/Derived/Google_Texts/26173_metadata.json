Norcross.\n\nThe measure, which won unanimous approval in the state Assembly on Monday and appears headed for approval in the Senate next week, could bring big changes in how hundreds of small and midsize companies furnish health-insurance coverage for their employees.\n\nThe new law would encourage smaller firms to band together in large pools to spread out risk and share health care costs. But if passed and signed into law by Governor Christie, the bill also could create a lucrative market for brokers and for third-party administrators who manage the new pools.\n\nSupporters of the bill said the idea was heavily promoted by Joseph Buckelew, a former Ocean County Republican leader who is also the chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew, the South Jersey insurance brokerage owned by Norcross.\n\nThrough a subsidiary, Conner Strong already manages a number of insurance pools that provide health care coverage and other types of insurance to New Jersey towns and local agencies.\n\n\u201cJoe thought it would be a great idea if we could take the same concept and apply it to the private sector,\u201d said one the bill\u2019s sponsors, Assemblyman Ronald Dancer, a Republican whose district includes parts of Ocean and Monmouth counties. \u201cIn this economy, small businesses need a break, especially with health care costs that keep going up.\u201d\n\nDancer said both Buckelew and William Harla, a lobbyist whose firm has been hired by Conner Strong, contributed provisions of what would emerge as the final bill package. Neither Buckelew nor Harla, who works for the Teaneck law firm DeCotiis, FitzPatrick & Cole, returned calls seeking comment.\n\nSen. Robert Singer, another Republican sponsor of the bill who also represents Ocean and Monmouth residents, said he was contacted by Buckelew about the legislation. Singer said it was his understanding that Conner Strong and firms like it would compete to manage the new private insurance pools envisioned in the measure.\n\nHe also said Conner Strong and others might seek to invest money in the pools. Under the bill, third-party investors would be allowed to make \u201cunderwriting profits\u201d through their investments in some circumstances.\n\nAlthough such private pools have been legal in New Jersey for a number of years, Singer said, investors and profits were not allowed. As a result, he said, there are currently only two or three groups, providing coverage to about 20,000 workers.\n\n\u201cWe see a big expansion,\u201d he said.\n\nSinger dismissed the suggestion the bill is tailored to political players like Norcross, the Camden-born Democrat who influences a wide voting bloc in Trenton and has become one of the state\u2019s most powerful figures through alliances with Christie and Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester.\n\nThe bill had been on the voting agenda for the Senate this week, but Sweeney, who did not return calls seeking comment, held it due to the objection of Senate Democrats who described it as a Republican measure catering to special interests.\n\nLast week the Legislature took quick action on a bill that gives special benefits to a Camden \u201crenaissance\u201d school partly backed by Norcross. That bill, which Christie is expected to sign, also provides expanded pensions for 600 Camden public employees.\n\nSinger said of the latest measure, \u201cIf this becomes law, Norcross will be just one of many companies competing in this market.\u201d\n\nDaniel Fee, a spokesman for Norcross, said Norcross was unavailable for comment Tuesday.\n\n\u201cConner Strong & Buckelew has always supported expanding the number of affordable options for insurance purchasers,\u201d Fee said in a statement. \u201cThese vehicles are promoted by many other states because they provide broad benefit to small- and medium-sized businesses and help create jobs.\u201d\n\nThe federal government says that such private insurance pools \u2014 known formally as \u201cMultiple Employer Welfare Arrangements,\u201d or MEWAs \u2014 have saved money for employers in some cases. But MEWAs also have been susceptible to mismanagement and fraud, according to the government.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Department of Labor issued sweeping new regulations under the Affordable Care Act tightening reporting requirements for MEWAs. The department also issued a bulletin summarizing dozens of civil and criminal cases it had brought against MEWA operators in recent years.\n\nIn many cases, companies that expected to save money by joining a MEWA lost millions in premiums through high administrative fees or outright fraud by operators. Employees who had paid their health insurance premiums were stuck paying expensive medical bills out of pocket.\n\nOne MEWA, operated by the New Jersey Licensed Beverage Association, was successfully sued by the government in 2004 after it had racked up millions in debt over its five years in operation. The fund, which covered 3,800 restaurant workers, had a backlog of $6.2 million in unpaid claims when it ceased operations in 2003.\n\nEmail: pillets@northjersey.com\n\nThis article has been edited to correct an inaccuracy in the original concerning the legislative history of the Senate version of the bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the second time in recent weeks, New Jersey lawmakers are poised to approve fast-track legislation that could prove a boon to powerful South Jersey political leader George E.
