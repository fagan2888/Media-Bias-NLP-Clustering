The agency will take any \"appropriate investigative actions\" if anything is found.\n\nAlthough the agency is spending most of its attention on the exchanges, it does plan to address other ACA programs, including Medicaid expansion and services, Medicare payment and delivery reform, Medicare and Medicaid program integrity and public health programs, according to the report.\n\nThe OIG's focus on cybersecurity comes after the breach of Anthem's database, which compromised information of almost 80 million current and former Anthem members, FiercHealthPayer previously reported. It also follows on the heels of an OIG report that said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within HHS did not adequately prepare for the launch of Healthcare.gov in 2013.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the OIG report\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nAnthem releases hack numbers by state; 78.8 million consumers impacted overall\n\nThe legal and financial fallout of health data breaches\n\n'No such thing' as a totally secure health data system\n\nAnthem hack compromises info for 80 million customers\n\nOIG: CMS did not prepare for launch of Healthcare.gov\n\nReport: Marketplaces can do more to improve transparency", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Office of Inspector General is planning to beef up its oversight of the Affordable Care Act, keeping a close eye on subsidies and how the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services protects individuals' personal information, according to an OIG report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "The Office of Inspector General is planning to beef up its oversight of the Affordable Care Act, keeping a close eye on subsidies and how the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services protects individuals' personal information, according to an OIG report.", "title": "OIG to investigate subsidies, security of insurance exchanges", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/oig-investigate-subsidies-security-ACA-insurance-exchanges/2015-02-25", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,cybersecurity,Health Insurance Exchanges,Information Security,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Office of Inspector General (OIG)", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "It also follows on the heels of an OIG report that said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within HHS did not adequately prepare for the launch of Healthcare.gov in 2013.\nThe OIG also will work closely with HHS and other law enforcement agencies to continue monitoring cybersecurity threats and consumer fraud incidents.\nThe agency said in the report that it will be adding between five and 10 investigations specifically focused on the ACA this year.\nAlthough the agency is spending most of its attention on the exchanges, it does plan to address other ACA programs, including Medicaid expansion and services, Medicare payment and delivery reform, Medicare and Medicaid program integrity and public health programs, according to the report.\nThe Office of Inspector General is planning to beef up its oversight of the Affordable Care Act, keeping a close eye on subsidies and how the Department of Health and Human Services protects individuals' personal information, according to an OIG report."}
