Last fall he was feeling so much pain in one of his baby teeth the dentist pulled it out. Because of that ordeal, he was nervous about a late December appointment at Advantage Dental in La Pine for an annual exam.\n\nWilley, who cares for Landon and his 3-year-old sister while their parents work, seemed unsurprised the dentist found three more cavities. \u201cWhen he was little he was living on bottles of apple juice,\u201d she explained.\n\nLandon is one of more than 400,000 children covered by the Oregon Health Plan, the state Medicaid program. OHP covers children whose parents earn up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level, or $47,196 annually for a family of two.\n\nMost children, whether low-income or not, have no cavities, but the rate of untreated decay is twice as high in children living below the poverty line: 23 percent, compared with 11.6 percent for kids not living in poverty, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCavities are not only a cause of discomfort. They can lead to infections, tooth loss and hospitalization.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a crime that any kid should ever get a cavity with what we know today,\u201d said R. Mike Shirtcliff, founder of Advantage Dental, the Redmond-based company that serves 340,000 Oregon Health Plan members in 35 out of 36 counties. Three other dental care organizations serve OHP members, but Advantage has the largest share.\n\nMike Shirtcliff, founder of Advantage Dental, sits in a room where Advantage offered free sealants at the end of December in Redmond. Joe Kline / The Bulletin 2044675 true\n\nAs the dominant dental care provider in rural Oregon, Advantage is uniquely positioned to prevent tooth decay in children. The company has been growing and refining its community outreach division over the past five years and this year will scale up the effort as part of a quality-improvement study involving 80,000 kids and mothers in Deschutes and six other counties across the state.\n\n\u201cI see the day when we have a whole generation of kids graduating high school with no decay,\u201d Shirtcliff said. \u201cThen we can take all those people that have been damaged, and we can give them the best treatment we can. All of them. Not just those that have the means and the resources. I\u2019m talking about the entire society. I think it\u2019s doable.\u201d\n\nBig goals, and controversy\n\nDespite his lofty goals, Shirtcliff is no hero to his peers. Advantage is a target of criticism because it has lagged other dental care organizations in applying sealants to kids\u2019 permanent teeth, which is one of dentistry\u2019s preferred methods of cavity prevention. Complaints about long waits for routine care appointments have reached the Oregon Health Authority\u2019s oral health director, Bruce Austin.\n\nThe company also stirred up controversy when its hygienists began using a topical solution of silver nitrate, rather than drilling and filling, to treat cavities. Not only did some dentists consider the silver compound, which kills the cavity-causing bacteria, experimental, they opposed allowing anyone but a dentist apply it.\n\nShirtcliff, 72, is a logger\u2019s son from Myrtle Creek, near Roseburg. As a practicing dentist he wasn\u2019t comfortable with the conventional business model because it discouraged serving anyone but the well-heeled and privately insured. \u201cYou go to practice-management classes. They teach you how to do more and more and more fancy stuff that costs more and more. And it leaves more people behind that can\u2019t afford it. And it never made sense to me,\u201d he said.\n\nI see the day when we have a whole generation of kids graduating high school with no decay.\n\n\u2014 Mike Shirtcliff\n\nWhen managed care emerged in the 1990s, Shirtcliff embraced it as the business model that would allow dentists to serve low-income people.\n\nGarrulous and full of conviction, Shirtcliff persuaded 30 dentists from the Roseburg area to put up the first $300,000 to fund a new insurance company. Shirtcliff grew that enterprise into a $100 million company that provides care to OHP members through 39 of its own clinics and a network of about 200 owner-dentists.\n\nIn January, Shirtcliff announced Advantage intends to sell a majority share in the company to DentaQuest of Boston for an undisclosed sum. DentaQuest, the nation\u2019s largest administrator of Medicaid dental benefits, wanted access to the Advantage model of care delivery, which DentaQuest executives believe will become standard across the country, Advantage CEO Tom Tucker said. Advantage and the providers in its network receive a flat fee for each Medicaid member they agree to serve, and at least 80 percent of the money must be spent on patient care. The flat fee is an incentive to providers to emphasize preventive care, which is generally cheaper. As a holding company, Advantage receives a share of the fee for its administrative costs, and most of the profit is returned to the owner-dentists, who won\u2019t receive much return on their investment until they retire.\n\nServing OHP members is not profitable every single year, said Tucker, whose former Klamath Falls practice was in the Advantage network before he joined the company as CEO, but under the Advantage model dentists could fulfill his mission to serve everyone and \u201cbe compensated at a level that didn\u2019t cause them to go broke doing it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd the 100 owner-dentists who are ready to retire will do so with a return on investment of about 600 percent. As an example, Tucker paid about $378 per share when he joined the network in 1996. Today those shares are worth $3,000 apiece.\n\nShirtcliff refers to Advantage as a \u201csystem,\u201d rather than a business, that creates access to care. But there\u2019s debate in Oregon\u2019s oral health community about whether Advantage is fulfilling that promise.\n\nAs executive director of Kemple Memorial Children\u2019s Dental Clinic, a nonprofit that works with poor and uninsured people in Bend, Suzanne Browning fields many complaints about access to dental care. \u201cThe way the protocols work in the dental offices \u2014 and of course Advantage is a big proponent of this \u2014 you have to wait 90 days (after calling for an appointment) to get yourself a cleaning,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe are the worst state in the nation for giving children one visit a year.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, only 39 percent of Medicaid-enrolled children in Oregon had seen a dentist in the past year, the lowest rate in the country, according to a research brief from the American Dental Association\u2019s Health Policy Institute. By 2013, Oregon had moved into 11th place for Medicaid-enrolled children seeing a dentist, according to the ADA\u2019s most recent brief, issued in December. Oregon was still among the states with the largest gap between Medicaid and commercial insurance members for dental visits, the ADA said.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more evidence that Advantage is far from single-handedly closing the gap in oral care. More than 1 million Oregonians lived in an area with a shortage of dentists in 2015, according to a Pew Charitable Trusts report. Cavity rates among kids ages 6 to 9 are worse in rural areas: 58 percent in Central Oregon and topping out at 73 percent for Eastern Oregon, according to a 2012 state report.\n\nAdvantage knows most of the OHP members assigned to its network aren\u2019t using their benefits, said Sharity Ludwig, director of community dental programs. There could be a number of reasons for that, she said. The Oregon Health Plan has changed the rules on dental coverage several times over the years, so people might not be aware they have coverage beyond emergencies, she said.\n\nAustin, who was appointed as Oregon\u2019s first oral-health director in March 2014, said he wants to get past the anecdotes, but Advantage and the other dental care organizations serving the Medicaid population haven\u2019t been collecting data, such as how long patients wait for appointments. With contracts set for 2016, the state can\u2019t require new data collection until 2017.\n\n\u201cThere are people who are not happy at all with Advantage,\u201d Austin said. He does not have strong feelings about the company. \u201cI truly believe they want the best oral health for their patients. They just have a different model than other groups do.\u201d\n\nRisk-based care\n\nWhat makes Advantage different is treatment protocols are based on risk, said Peter Milgrom, a University of Washington public health researcher who has worked with Advantage on various projects over the past decade.\n\nThe company doesn\u2019t place sealants on every kid\u2019s teeth, he said, because it\u2019s a relatively expensive measure, which is also difficult to apply correctly outside of a clinic.\n\nDentist Andrew Walls discusses the X-ray of Malaree Jaynes, 11, with her mother Krystol Nikolauson during her appointment at Advantage Dental Clinics in La Pine. ORIG 12/24/2015 Ryan Brennecke / The Bulletin 2032047 true\n\n\u201cWe figure certainly less than half of children on Medicaid are even moderate risks,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you spend your resources as if every child had the same level of disease, sealants and so on, you don\u2019t have enough money to deal with kids that have severe form of the disease.\u201d\n\nPrioritizing and rationing treatment are hallmarks of managed care. Shirtcliff\u2019s aim is always twofold: improve health and spend less. As much as he cares about seeing kids avoid cavities, he\u2019s also calculating the cost savings. He figures the 1.1 million people enrolled in the Oregon Health Plan have an average annual dental care need of $2,000, which would cost the state $2.2 billion. The budget for oral health is around $250 million. So Oregon can\u2019t begin to address adults\u2019 needs in a serious way unless kids stop getting cavities, he said.\n\nShirtcliff complains dentists are trained to make \u201cwidgets\u201d like crowns and bridges and install them in \u201cfactories,\u201d or clinics.\n\n\u201cPeople have problems. The bigger they are, the more we get paid,\u201d Shirtcliff said. \u201cThe incentives are to make satisfactory treatments for end-of-disease, rather than looking at the cause of disease and how do we intervene upstream.\u201d\n\nHe believes the future of dentistry is in community outreach. Advantage employs a group of expanded-practice hygienists, licensed to do more types of work without a dentist present. They travel to Head Start preschools; Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) nutrition program offices; drug-treatment centers; and other places where people aren\u2019t likely to venture into a dental clinic.\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re able to have those conversations in a nonthreatening environment,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cYou can reinterpret misinformation.\u201d\n\nThe hygienists screen patients and enter the results into a centralized computer system. If someone\u2019s need is urgent, a case manager will work to get that person to a dentist in 48 hours. Otherwise, it might be six to eight weeks, or longer, Ludwig said.\n\nSealants are expensive, Austin said, but Oregon will continue to conduct its screen-and-seal program, which is carried out in schools regardless of kids\u2019 insurance coverage, because it\u2019s one of two best practices that prevent tooth decay. The other is water fluoridation, he said, but only 23 percent of Oregon communities have fluoridated water.\n\nAdvantage has a history of applying fewer sealants than other dental care organizations, Austin said, but the company now has to meet annual targets set by the coordinated care organizations.\n\nAdvantage began testing its risk-based approach this winter through a study designed by Milgrom. The results, which Milgrom will publish, will either validate the Advantage model, or give credence to its critics.\n\nThe project, called PREDICT, which stands for Population-centered Risk and Evidence-based Dental Interprofessional Care Team, is funded by Advantage, but Milgrom\u2019s work is supported by a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation grant.\n\nAdvantage embraces change more quickly than most of dentistry, where standard practices are designed to benefit the bottom line, Milgrom said. \u201cSealants are a 1950s technology,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of your cleanings are of no value too. The six-month recall that everybody gets, there\u2019s no basis for that. They might do as well with a year or two years.\u201d\n\nDental hygienist Adam McFarlin works on applying sealant to one of Malaree Jaynes, 11, teeth during her appointment at Advantage Dental Clinics in La Pine. Ryan Brennecke / The Bulletin 2032071 true\n\nShirtcliff joined forces with Milgrom to obtain FDA approval of a new silver compound \u2014 one that can be applied by hygienists \u2014 silver fluoride. Advantage and the UW professor formed a small business, won a grant to support their own research and received FDA approval for silver fluoride as a medical device, essentially making it available for off-label use on cavities. A sister company of Advantage is producing and distributing it to dentists around the country.\n\nHaving studied cavity prevention around the world, Milgrom is a big proponent of silver fluoride, which combines silver with a fluoride varnish. It\u2019s applied by the droplet to cavities, which then turn black but stop growing. If the cavity is small enough and the patient\u2019s habits improve, he or she might avoid the drill altogether.\n\nThe free ions in silver work on bacteria by denaturing the enzymes.\n\nSome of Advantage\u2019s research projects could become profit centers, Milgrom said. That\u2019s to be expected of Shirtcliff. \u201cThis guy\u2019s a businessman. He\u2019s thinking about all the angles.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t offend Milgrom, a self-described academic \u201cegghead.\u201d Shirtcliff \u201chas a huge heart and something there that\u2019s unusual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business, but it\u2019s more than a business.\u201d\n\nAustin, too, thinks silver fluoride, also called silver diamine fluoride, is promising. \u201cIt\u2019s a new paradigm in dentistry to treat decay medically rather than surgically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s also new enough and different enough that it\u2019s causing anxiety.\u201d\n\nBrowning said her organization declined to work with Advantage on the PREDICT project because it will use silver fluoride. The problem isn\u2019t the treatment itself, but the fact that most parents aren\u2019t familiar with it, she said. Parents might give consent but not understand the treatment stains teeth, and that it has to be reapplied several times, she said. All it would take is one complaint from a parent, she said, and schools would ask Kemple not to come back. She doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize progress made so far. \u201cWe\u2019re just now getting parents to increase the consent rate to do sealant work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have controversy in this world about fluoride.\u201d\n\nPolitical path\n\nTo Shirtcliff, the debate about fluoridating water or whether cavities should be treated outside of a dentist\u2019s office are as much a matter of politics as medicine. And at this point, he has almost as much experience as a lobbyist as he does fixing teeth.\n\nShirtcliff has been close to former Gov. John Kitzhaber since the latter was an emergency-room doctor and state senator from Roseburg. When Shirtcliff was still in private practice in his hometown of Myrtle Creek, Kitzhaber\u2019s office would call the local dental society trying to help low-income constituents find a dentist, Shirtcliff said, and they inevitably ended up seeing him.\n\n\u201cEventually, Kitzhaber\u2019s office would just call my office,\u201d Shirtcliff said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we met. We became friends over the years. Even though I\u2019m a conservative Republican and he\u2019s a Democrat, still we are doctors who take care of people.\u201d\n\nShirtcliff said Kitzhaber \u201cwas correct in his vision of health care. \u2026 We had a whole bunch of people who needed care who weren\u2019t getting it.\u201d\n\nShirtcliff boasts that his involvement is the reason that, unlike many state Medicaid programs, the Oregon Health Plan included dental care for adults from the outset.\n\nShirtcliff used his influence to further Advantage\u2019s growth as well, Austin said. He is the reason dental care organizations initially weren\u2019t incorporated into Oregon\u2019s unique system of coordinated care organizations, which distribute Medicaid dollars in defined territories. \u201cHe wanted to maintain that autonomy for the DCOs and have that direct connection to the state and the state\u2019s budget,\u201d Austin said.\n\nShirtcliff started beating the drum about dentistry-for-all in the early 1990s, after selling his practice and planning to move to Central Oregon. Family demands kept him in the Roseburg area, and since he\u2019d already signed a noncompete agreement with the dentist who bought him out, he said, he decided to focus on the Medicaid population, which no other dentist in Douglas County would accept. Then in 1993, Oregon passed the Oregon Health Plan, which was pioneering at the time because it embraced the concept of managed care.\n\nShirtcliff saw an opportunity to build a new system in which dentists would be willing to treat people on Medicaid. The original group of owner-dentists from Roseburg formed an independent practice association, which landed an OHP contract for Douglas County. Then Advantage Dental expanded its network to 300 owners by pushing into other parts of rural Oregon.\n\nShirtcliff left private practice and moved the Advantage headquarters to Redmond in 2000 because of its central location and airport access. In 2009, Advantage bought a family-owned chain of dental clinics based in Lane County. The company began opening more of its own clinics in 2013 when Oregon opted to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and about 400,000 more people enrolled.\n\nShirtcliff acknowledged that, like other health care providers, Advantage has been overwhelmed by demand because of the Medicaid expansion. Advantage continues trying to recruit new owner-dentists and hiring dentists to work in its own clinics, he said.\n\nCultural insight\n\nGrowing up in Myrtle Creek, Shirtcliff said he averted a life of poverty because of a few teachers who saw potential and encouraged him to go to college. He paid his way by doing dirty, dangerous jobs, like working in a nickel smelter. He said he became a dentist to avoid being shot in Vietnam. Shirtcliff served three years as an Army dentist, all stateside, before opening a practice in his hometown in 1972.\n\nShirtcliff reads constantly about health care, health policy and human behavior, he said. One of his major themes is the culture of poverty. All 469 Advantage employees have taken a course on the topic.\n\nShirtcliff thinks a lack of cultural understanding, as much as the economics of Medicaid reimbursement, explains why so few dentists are willing to treat low-income people. \u201cThey don\u2019t see themselves in the future, in different circumstances than what they\u2019re in,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically people in the culture of poverty, it\u2019s really about today. It\u2019s not about tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDentists expect everyone to brush, floss and avoid sugar, or to at least try to improve those habits after getting a cavity, he said. They don\u2019t know what to do with patients who skip out on appointments, or whose habits are so bad that when they do show up, their mouths are overrun with decay, he said. \u201cYou know people don\u2019t have the money,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the best thing people do when they have feelings that are irritating to them? They avoid them. Dentists are no different.\u201d\n\nShirtcliff is willing to try anything that will prod patients toward a different frame of mind. The company copied a British public health program in which low-income families received tooth-brushing kits in the mail. Advantage sent the same kits to 2,100 Central Oregon families in 2014.\n\n\u201cIf we can lower tooth decay by 20 percent, and we\u2019re spending $5 million on tooth decay in kids, that\u2019s $1 million a year, and all I did was send out toothbrushes and fluoride toothpaste,\u201d he said.\n\nMuch of Advantage\u2019s outreach work is based on findings from its participation a decade ago in a Klamath County project that sought to increase dental care among pregnant women. Pregnant women and mothers of infants are key to preventing tooth decay in kids because mothers transmit most of the bacteria that later cause cavities. That\u2019s why bad teeth, or good teeth, tend to run in families.\n\nDental hygienist Tiffany Foy, center, does an exam and fluoride treatment for 5-year-old Eduardo Saldana as mom Hortensia Alvarado holds him and 1-year-old sister Melanie and interpreter Ashley Galan, far left, watch during a monthly dental education program at the Becky Johnson Community Center in Redmond. Joe Kline / The Bulletin 2044667 true\n\nThe bacteria is passed to infants through the type of close daily contact, such as kisses and shared drinks, that transmits colds. The more prevalent the destructive bacteria in a mother\u2019s mouth, the more she\u2019ll pass to her child, and the higher the child\u2019s risk of cavities. To reduce the bacterial load, a pregnant woman should have professional cleanings in addition to brushing and flossing, Milgrom said.\n\nThe women in the Klamath County study wanted oral health care, but they either didn\u2019t know Medicaid included dental benefits, or they thought they weren\u2019t welcome in dentists\u2019 offices, said Ludwig, who worked in Klamath County at the time.\n\nCase managers were employed to help the women get appointments, and in a follow-up study two years later, their children showed significantly less decay than in a comparison group of counties where the program wasn\u2019t offered, Milgrom said.\n\nNow Advantage targets settings where mothers and children are often found together, and it employs case managers who help people with urgent needs find their way to clinics.\n\nExpanded-practice hygienist Tiffany Foy spends four days a week driving her Prius around to Central Oregon WIC and Head Start offices. Her only equipment is a plastic bin of supplies and a laptop computer.\n\n\u201cWhat questions do you have?\u201d she asks the parents who bring their kids into an exam room at the School-Based Health Clinic in La Pine. \u201cHow\u2019s the brushing going?\u201d\n\nThe families she saw one morning in late December were already brushing their toddlers\u2019 teeth. The exams took less than a minute as Foy peered inside the small mouths with a mirror and quickly wiped the teeth with a clear fluoride varnish. Like three-quarters of the kids she sees, these toddlers showed no signs of decay.\n\nTiffany Foy, center, a community dental hygenist, demonstrates brushing technique during a monthly dental education program at the Becky Johnson Community Center in Redmond. ORIG / 12-30-15 / Joe Kline / The Bulletin 2044659 true\n\nThe hygienists encounter some extreme cases, like a 3-year-old whose mother tried to treat cavities by rinsing the child\u2019s mouth with coconut oil. The home remedy only exacerbated the infection, and the child ended up in the hospital to have every single tooth extracted.\n\nPreschoolers with cavities have traditionally ended up in the hospital to be treated under anesthesia because they can\u2019t sit still for a dentist, Austin said. The cost alone makes that a situation to avoid, but new medical research showing that general anesthesia negatively affects developing brains makes preventing early childhood cavities an even more urgent matter.\n\nOral health home\n\nLandon Willey was on the verge of tears by the time he was released from the dentist\u2019s chair on Christmas Eve. In addition to the exam, the dentist hoped to place sealants on four of his permanent teeth. The procedure is not invasive, but it requires rinsing the tooth with a bitter-tasting soap and blowing air in the mouth to prepare for the plastic seal, which will keep bacteria out of the deep grooves on the biting surface of the molars.\n\nLandon\u2019s slender hands quaked as he tried to signal the dental assistant to stop. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d assistant Adam McFarlin asked. Willey didn\u2019t answer, but McFarlin guessed his mouth was sensitive. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cavities on the gum line there,\u201d he told the boy. \u201cThat\u2019s from not brushing enough.\u201d\n\nLandon\u2019s parents don\u2019t want his 3-year-old sister, Lilah, to have the same experience, Twila Willey said. Caring for the kids from breakfast to dinner, she plays a big role in the effort. \u201cI try to keep a lot of fruit in the house to replace the candy stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t buy soda pop.\u201d\n\nLilah rarely drinks juice, Willey said, and the kids keep toothbrushes at her house.\n\nThe effort seems to be paying off because Lilah had her very first dental exam a few days after Landon\u2019s, and she had no cavities, Willey said. \u201cShe\u2019s got perfect teeth.\u201d\n\nThis is Shirtcliff\u2019s vision, for low-income families to have regular dental care. That\u2019s why he feels comfortable brushing off his critics: \u201cI don\u2019t apologize for creating access to care in rural Oregon.\u201d\u2022", "article_metadata": {"description": "{%comp-FFFFFE-tl%}At 8 years old, Landon Willey already has accumulated a collection of painful experiences in a dentist\u2019s chair.
