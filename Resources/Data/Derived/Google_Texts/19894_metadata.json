State law enforcement officials discovered the so-called super pill recently, and they are warning residents to keep from buying pain killers on the black market.\n\nThe so-called super pill looks just like well-known pain killers like Percocet, Xanax and Oxycodone. However, it is laced with fentanyl, an opiod that is nearly 50 times more potent than heroin, according to health officials.\n\n\u201cThose pills look every bit as real as the legitimate drugs and unless you got it directly from a pharmacy, there\u2019s no guarantee that what you got in your hand isn\u2019t going to kill you,\u201d says Florida Department of Law Enforcement special agent Danny Banks.\n\nExperimental users\u2014many high school and college age\u2014are buying the pill. But Banks says so are unassuming patients without health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe problem now is the fentanyl is reaching an entire different group and it\u2019s not just those who are ingesting what they believe to be heroin. Now it\u2019s those who are ingesting what they believe to be a normal prescription drug.\u201d\n\nBanks says the super pill has caused a handful of deaths so far in Orlando.\n\nIn Florida, the most fentanyl-related cases have come out of South Florida.\n\nState law enforcement officials have set up drop boxes at police stations where residents can leave the pills without any questions asked. They are urging experimental drug users to stay away from the pill and asking patients without health insurance to buy their pills from a pharmacist.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nRenata Sago is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
