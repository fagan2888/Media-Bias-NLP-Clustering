Down from 337 in 2004. ER\u2019s per capita: 6.7 per million, lowest ratio in U.S. Patients: 12.45 million in 2013, up from 9.1 million in 2004. Patients treated and released: 86% Patients admitted: 14% (55% of all hospital admissions) How patients pay: Private insurance (30%), Medi-Cal (30%), Medicare (17%), uninsured (15%), other (7%). Sources: California Office of Statewide Planning & Development, American College of Emergency Physicians\n\nThe emergency room doctors at Torrance Memorial Medical Center are used to a winter rush \u2014 with perhaps 230 patients in the ER on their busiest days.\n\nBut the ER right now is already hitting those numbers, with visits up 15 percent over last year at this time.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing days when our average daily census is 200 to 230 patients and sometimes higher than that,\u201d said Dr. Zachary Gray, a medical director of the Torrance Memorial Lundquist Emergency Department. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing in the quiet part of the year numbers that rival our volumes historically in the busiest part of the year.\n\n\u201cThat is very difficult for us to manage. It\u2019s a physical space and infrastructure problem at this point.\u201d\n\nCalifornians experience some of the longest waits in hospital emergency rooms \u2014 an average of six hours and 18 minutes from arrival to admittance and nearly two hours more to be tucked into a bed \u2014 according to statistics compiled by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut South Bay hospitals are funneling resources into their ERs to prevent lengthy wait times through staffing changes, expanded facilities and operating efficiencies.\n\nAt Torrance Memorial, the median wait time to see a doctor is about 45 minutes, Gray said, a slight increase from the beginning of the year.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, if a patient is treated and released from the ER, the median wait time from arrival to discharge is three hours and 43 minutes at Torrance Memorial, five hours and 16 minutes at Los Angeles County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance and three hours and 42 minutes at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center in Torrance.\n\nThe median wait to see a health care specialist \u2014 whether nurse practitioner, doctor or otherwise \u2014 is one hour and 17 minutes at Torrance Memorial, 59 minutes at Harbor-UCLA and 37 minutes at Little Company of Mary, statistics showed.\n\nAlthough Harbor-UCLA Medical Center said its ER visits have declined slightly over the past year, the wait times have increased as the staff adjusts to its expanded emergency services facility.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still getting used to the new facility so our flow isn\u2019t quite as polished as it was previously,\u201d said Dr. Mike Peterson, director of operations for the Department of Emergency Medicine at Harbor-UCLA. \u201cBut our overall treatment time is actually better, so, in the end, patients don\u2019t spend as long (in the ER).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo address the flood of patients, Torrance Memorial increased its nurse staffing and the number of physician shifts and broke up the waiting room, tagging patients into particular pods.\n\n\u201cThat way the physicians know how many patients they have waiting to be seen as soon as they\u2019re triaged,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIt reinforces their sense of responsibility, and you start to care more about the numbers.\u201d\n\nThe ER expects to have more staff by Nov. 1.\n\nLocal hospital officials attribute many of the striking changes in ER operations to the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, the government-sponsored health care marketplace implemented a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a persistent rise in patient visits over the past six months,\u201d Gray said. \u201cAnybody you ask candidly is going to say that\u2019s due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned since (Obamacare) was instituted is there is a broad reservoir of people who did not seek medical care before because they were afraid of the cost and didn\u2019t have insurance. The Affordable Care Act has given those people the illusion of access to care. They have this insurance card so they feel comfortable going to the hospital because they know someone will help them pay their bills. These are people who didn\u2019t come before.\u201d\n\nAnd fewer people are getting fed up waiting in ERs and leaving without being seen, local hospitals noted.\n\nAt one point, about 12 percent of patients would leave the pediatric and adult ERs at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center before they were seen by a doctor, Peterson said.\n\nThe number is now down to 8 percent, which he acknowledged is still quite a bit higher than the 1 or 2 percent found acceptable for private facilities.\n\n\u201cEvery time someone leaves without being seen, we are very, very concerned,\u201d Gray said.\n\nTorrance Memorial\u2019s number hovers around 1 percent.\n\n\u201cWe want it to be zero, but it\u2019s just not attainable,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming after work because your doctor is closed and you know you don\u2019t have an emergency, and you walk into the waiting room and see 20 people waiting, you\u2019re going to cut your losses and turn around.\u201d\n\nGray noted that no matter how well local hospitals attempt to fend off lengthy wait times, it\u2019s not possible to staff for a surge.\n\n\u201cNo matter how efficient we are, if 25 people show up in the ER in one hour, the wait times are going to be long,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The emergency room doctors at Torrance Memorial Medical Center are used to a winter rush \u2014 with perhaps 230 patients in the ER on their busiest days.But the ER right now is already hitting those numbers, with visits up 15 percent over la", "title": "South Bay hospitals work to reduce emergency room wait times", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/health/20141002/south-bay-hospitals-work-to-reduce-emergency-room-wait-times", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20141002/NEWS/141009869/AR/0/AR-141009869.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1018px"}, "type": "article", "title": "South Bay hospitals work to reduce emergency room wait times"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "The emergency room doctors at Torrance Memorial Medical Center are used to a winter rush \u2014 with perhaps 230 patients in the ER on their busiest days.But the ER right now is already hitting those numbers, with visits up 15 percent over la", "title": "South Bay hospitals work to reduce emergency room wait times", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/health/20141002/south-bay-hospitals-work-to-reduce-emergency-room-wait-times", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20141002/NEWS/141009869/AR/0/AR-141009869.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "emergency room,Harbor-UCLA Medical Center,Hospitals,Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Emergency care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "emergency room,Harbor-UCLA Medical Center,Hospitals,Torrance Memorial Medical Center, Emergency care"}, "article_summary": "But South Bay hospitals are funneling resources into their ERs to prevent lengthy wait times through staffing changes, expanded facilities and operating efficiencies.\nAt Torrance Memorial, the median wait time to see a doctor is about 45 minutes, Gray said, a slight increase from the beginning of the year.\nSources: California Office of Statewide Planning & Development, American College of Emergency PhysiciansThe emergency room doctors at Torrance Memorial Medical Center are used to a winter rush \u2014 with perhaps 230 patients in the ER on their busiest days.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned since (Obamacare) was instituted is there is a broad reservoir of people who did not seek medical care before because they were afraid of the cost and didn\u2019t have insurance.\n\u201cNo matter how efficient we are, if 25 people show up in the ER in one hour, the wait times are going to be long,\u201d he said."}
