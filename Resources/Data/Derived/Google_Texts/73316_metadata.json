As Reese Witherspoon, a key champion of the effort, declared on the red carpet: \u201cWe are more than just our dresses.\u201d\n\nThat may very well be the case the other 364 days of the year. But on this night of all nights, the feminist push \u2013 much like Patricia Arquette\u2019s clunky, if well-meaning, plea for pay equality during her acceptance speech for winning best supporting actress \u2013 came off as more than a little ham-fisted.\n\n\n\n[READ: 2015 Academy Awards Best Picture Winner Is Not Taxpayers]\n\nFor starters, the dresses are actually a huge part of both the economics and appeal of an occasion whose continued popularity, even if increasingly flagging, is predicated on its ability to peddle the glamour and other-worldliness of Hollywood. Notably, Witherspoon didn\u2019t turn up her nose at presenting the Oscar for best makeup and hairstyling later in the evening, because at the end of the day this is an event about appearance and artifice. It is not, lest Tinseltown forget, a Nobel Prize Award Ceremony or a meeting of the Oxford Union.\n\nMoreover, the actresses are sometimes paid to wear and promote the brands on the red carpet or are lent the dresses for free. As one designer told Refinery29, \"Everybody relates to it on a financial basis.\"\n\nAnd for that matter, why exactly would you not expect to field questions about what you are wearing if, like Lady Gaga, you descended on the red carpet decked in a futuristic white contraption paired with what appeared to be a pair of red rubber gloves, or, like J-Lo, you showed up exhibiting ever new heights (or would that be lows?) of decolletage daring?\n\nOscar presenter Kerry Washington couldn\u2019t shut up about her shimmy-worthy, peplum Miu Miu gown, despite the best efforts of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d co-host Lara Spencer to draw her out about her work. \u201cCan you tell me anything about my favorite show in the whole wide world, \u2018Scandal\u2019?\u201d asked Spencer. \u201cI can\u2019t. As you know I\u2019ll get fired if I tell you anything,\u201d Washington replied, before quickly adding, \u201cI will tell you that the very next episode is an episode that means a great deal to me. It\u2019s a very moving episode. Yeah.\u201d\n\n\n\n[STUDY: Women are MIA in Hollywood]\n\nWow, talk about a great leap forward for womankind right there. (For the record, Washington was far more engaging when she was showing off the dance moves she could do in her dress.)\n\nThen there was the sulky Dakota Johnson, who was so charmless and glum \u2013 snapping at her mother Melanie Griffith and offering half-assed responses to questions about upcoming projects \u2013 that about the only reaction possible after her interview was an overwhelming urge to tweet #DontAskHerMore.\n\nWhich raises another fundamental problem of the campaign: Even without the requisite queries about clothes and accessories, there\u2019d be little time for long-form, soul-baring on the theatrical craft (for either the boys or girls involved) during brief red carpet interviews. As Hallie Cantor noted in the New Yorker: \u201c[T]he frenetic pace and A.D.H.D. nature of the red-carpet broadcast doesn\u2019t exactly lend itself to in-depth, substantive discussions of artistry.\u201d\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Hillary Clinton]\n\nFinally, beyond its all-too-obvious contextual disconnect, #AskHerMore, as is the case with so much hashtag activism, offers little more than symbolic gestures as solutions for endemic social ills, raising awareness and tweets for the fleeting virtual struggle du jour. Meanwhile, injustices back in the non-virtual world \u2013 remember #BringBackOurGirls? \u2013 proceed apace.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. There are very real problems with how Hollywood treats its female stars, from wage inequality to age discrimination to sexual harassment. But asking actresses to muse over softballs \u2013 such as naming their favorite TV show or \u201cbiggest risk\u201d that has paid off, both of which were posted on Witherspoon's Instagram account as examples of possible questions \u2013 is hardly likely to do much for the cause of women. And once #AskHerMore's metaphorical 15 minutes of trending on Twitter has passed (it was even tweeted by the \"Ready for Hillary\" super PAC), the vast institutionalized inequities of an entertainment industry that is woefully behind the times when it comes to the treatment of women (look no further than John Travolta\u2019s revolting behavior both on the red carpet and on stage Sunday night) will remain.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "#AskHerMore Misses the Mark at the Academy Awards", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A hashtag campaign to #AskHerMore on the red carpet misses the mark.", "title": "It's Not About the Dress?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2015/02/24/askhermore-misses-the-mark-at-the-academy-awards", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/06/3c8b8dbc3775ba8bc504bc657b2190/media:1bcc7f99c7b44ed995081e89ba8b6c5787thAcademyAwards-Arrivals.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A hashtag campaign to #AskHerMore on the red carpet misses the mark.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "#AskHerMore Misses the Mark at the Academy Awards"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 24, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Bree Hocking,movies,Hollywood,feminism,Twitter,fashion,picks,TJS,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A hashtag campaign to #AskHerMore on the red carpet misses the mark."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b51\"", "article_summary": "Moreover, the actresses are sometimes paid to wear and promote the brands on the red carpet or are lent the dresses for free.\nAs Reese Witherspoon, a key champion of the effort, declared on the red carpet: \u201cWe are more than just our dresses.\u201dThat may very well be the case the other 364 days of the year.\nThere are very real problems with how Hollywood treats its female stars, from wage inequality to age discrimination to sexual harassment.\nIt is not, lest Tinseltown forget, a Nobel Prize Award Ceremony or a meeting of the Oxford Union.\n(For the record, Washington was far more engaging when she was showing off the dance moves she could do in her dress.)"}
