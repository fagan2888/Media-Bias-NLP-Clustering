Yet, it\u2019s wonderfully satisfying that in a year that saw X-Men and Avengers and even Guardians, 2014 ends with an ensemble of old-school misadventurers and a few troublesome baddies in \u201cInto the Woods.\u201d\n\nCinderella, the Baker and his wife, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack of Beanstalk fame and Rapunzel make director Rob Marshall\u2019s adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine Broadway musical \u201cInto the Woods\u201d a dark, exquisitely enchanting pleasure.\n\nThe 1987 musical assembled quite the collection of fairy-tale all-stars. Then it sent them on their merry \u2014 or not \u2014 ways singing of wishes for princes, infants and a respite from a hardscrabble life.\n\nMarshall\u2019s ensemble is nearly as impressive. So much so that Tracey Ullman as Jack\u2019s harried mum and Christine Baranski as Cinderella\u2019s harrowing stepmum seem like cameos. Almost. Because this is an ensemble wonder.\n\nMeryl Streep is vividly vexing as Witch. If we take her at her word in \u201cStay With Me,\u201d she is misunderstood. To a degree. She sings the song to Rapunzel (MacKenzie Mauzy), her adopted \u2014 ahem, kidnapped \u2014 and sequestered daughter. Billy Magnussen plays the prince who discovers the lovely woman and climbs her ropey braid, to Witch\u2019s dismay.\n\nChris Pine is the smitten, smugly charming Prince. The one Anna Kendrick\u2019s Cinderella gobsmacks at the famous ball.\n\nThe weight of the tale falls on the shoulders of the Baker. And James Corden is touchingly fit for the gig. He and his lovely Wife , (a winsome and sympathetic Emily Blunt) have been rendered childless by a curse courtesy of Witch. It can be broken if, she tells them, they gather some rather unlikely items.\n\nThen she gives them a helluva shopping list.\n\nThere is a very funny bit in the Denver Center\u2019s current edition of the musical \u201cForbidden Broadway\u201d spoofing Sondheim\u2019s gift for gab at the expense of melody. \u201cInto the Words\u201d is hilarious.\n\nBut truth be told, there are a number of nearly hummable beauts here.\n\nThe 16-minute \u201cPrologue\u201d that weaves together the characters with the shared declaration \u201cI Wish\u201d and then the hopeful refrain \u201cInto the Woods\u201d even has its moments. Pine and Magnussen\u2019s princely duet \u201cAgony\u201d is winning. As is Cinderella and the Baker\u2019s Wife\u2019s \u201cA Very Nice Prince.\u201d\n\nThe orchestration is lush. Tony Award lifetime achievement winner Paul Gemignani conducts a collection of London Symphony members. So is cinematographer Dion Bebbe\u2019s palette.\n\nAs remarkable as Marshall\u2019s cinematic choices are, his wildest decision might be the casting a youngster in the role of Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nThirteen-year-old Lilla Crawford plays the slightly bratty miss with the red cape and a rather insatiable appetite. Johnny Depp howls and struts as the Wolf she encounters.\n\nA grown actress is typically cast as one of the canon\u2019s more famous girls. For good reason. The lyrics to the Wolf\u2019s come-hither song, \u201cHello, Little Girl\u201d goes from sly inuendo to outright disquieting when applied to a child. Where\u2019s SVU\u2019s Olivia Benson when you need her?\n\nBut then, Sondheim and Lapine headed into these woods to recover lessons beyond the bromide \u201chappily ever after.\u201d\n\nThat Marshall and his cast maneuver their uncomfortable news with a film that should bewitch kids of a certain maturity and please adults hankering for the lessons once delivered at bedtime is a delight. Not a sugary plum, but a delight nonetheless.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cInto the Woods\u201d review: A fairy-tale thicket worth entering", "title": "\u201cInto the Woods\u201d review: A fairy-tale thicket worth entering", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/24/into-the-woods-review-a-fairy-tale-thicket-worth-entering/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__AE26SCINTOTHEWOODS2p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141224__AE26SCINTOTHEWOODS2p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-24T10:49:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:33:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd18f1\"", "article_summary": "As remarkable as Marshall\u2019s cinematic choices are, his wildest decision might be the casting a youngster in the role of Little Red Riding Hood.\nThe lyrics to the Wolf\u2019s come-hither song, \u201cHello, Little Girl\u201d goes from sly inuendo to outright disquieting when applied to a child.\nSo much so that Tracey Ullman as Jack\u2019s harried mum and Christine Baranski as Cinderella\u2019s harrowing stepmum seem like cameos.\nHe and his lovely Wife , (a winsome and sympathetic Emily Blunt) have been rendered childless by a curse courtesy of Witch.\nThen it sent them on their merry \u2014 or not \u2014 ways singing of wishes for princes, infants and a respite from a hardscrabble life."}
