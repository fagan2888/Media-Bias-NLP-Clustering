After all, Rehm does not shove off the track with his right foot; rather, he pushes with a carbon-fiber prosthetic blade.\n\nRehm, 25, had his right leg amputated below the knee after a boating accident when he was 14. He has emerged as a world-class athlete anyway, winning Germany\u2019s national championships last month. His situation is inspiring and somewhat unusual, yet at the same time altogether familiar.\n\nWith uncomfortable echoes from the case of Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee sprinter from South Africa who forced sports officials to consider how to draw the line between able-bodied and disabled athletes, Rehm now finds himself in the same arena of confusion.\n\nUsing the same brand of prosthesis as Pistorius, Rehm beat 13 able-bodied athletes in the long jump competition at nationals. It was a dream, he said, but even while soaking in the moment atop the medal stand, he also knew that \u201ca big conversation was about to start.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIt did. A few days later, the governing body for German track and field announced that it would not nominate Rehm to its roster for the European championships \u2014 an honor that was historically all but guaranteed to the national champion.\n\nDespite approving Rehm\u2019s participation in the first place, officials said they could not be sure Rehm\u2019s prosthetic leg did not give him an advantage. Without conclusive data, they opted to leave Rehm out of Europe\u2019s showcase event, which ended Sunday in Zurich.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a shame they weren\u2019t brave enough to nominate me,\u201d Rehm said in an interview last week at his sports club, TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen.\n\n\u201cYears ago, people were just smiling about our sports, saying things like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s nice that they can move a bit,\u2019 \u201d he added. \u201cNow, it has all changed. We can win. And there ought to be a solution. We ought to be able to work together. I don\u2019t know why it has to be so hard.\u201d\n\nIt was 2007 when Pistorius first fought to compete in the Olympics, and he ended up in court to earn the right. Yet even now the issue continues to be among the most vexing in sports.\n\n\u201cThe governing bodies of sport in general didn\u2019t deal with Pistorius very well, and they still haven\u2019t figured out how to deal with it,\u201d said Peter G. Weyand, a professor of physiology and biomechanics at Southern Methodist University who has extensively researched athlete performance and worked on testing connected to Pistorius\u2019s case.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s clearly a need,\u201d Weyand said. \u201cThis is an issue that isn\u2019t going away.\u201d\n\nRehm still may try to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics. His winning jump at the national meet \u2014 8.24 meters, or just over 27 feet \u2014 surpassed an Olympic standard that was set for long jumpers trying to qualify for the 2012 Games and would have won the silver medal at the European championships. Weyand noted that the Brazilian amputee sprinter Alan Oliveira, who beat Pistorius in the 200 meters at the London Paralympics, is also close to meeting an Olympic qualifying standard in the sprint events.\n\nYet at this point, track\u2019s governing bodies \u2014 including its international organization, the I.A.A.F. \u2014 have shown little interest in attempting to proactively define what sort of prosthetic devices might be unfair.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn response to questions about Rehm\u2019s circumstance, as well as the larger concerns of disabled athletes who want to compete against able-bodied athletes, an I.A.A.F. spokesman provided only a generic statement that reaffirmed the organization\u2019s stance to handle situations on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\u201cThe likelihood is that para-athletes will remain a small representative group in able-bodied athletics at international-level competition for which the I.A.A.F. is responsible,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThat approach is frustrating for athletes like Rehm, in part because other organizations \u2014 including the German federation, known as the D.L.V. \u2014 have followed suit. Rehm\u2019s coach, Steffi Nerius, said the federation was made aware of Rehm\u2019s interest in competing at nationals as far back as last summer, when Rehm set a para-athletics record in the long jump at a competition in Lyon, France. Rehm\u2019s jump there was 7.95 meters, a mark that easily passed the able-bodied nationals qualifying standard of 7.55 meters.\n\n\u201cIt was clear he was capable,\u201d Nerius said.\n\nDespite the lead time, Rehm said his camp heard little from the D.L.V. until just weeks before the nationals. Rehm said he was informed then that there was no time to conduct any testing before the event, \u201cwhich made no sense because there had been a whole year.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nClemens Prokop, the president of the D.L.V., said that the federation had been interested in doing a thorough analysis of Rehm\u2019s prosthesis earlier in the year but that \u201cthe costs for this were so high that they were not economically affordable.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140817212814, "twitter": {"description": "Markus Rehm, a world-class German long jumper who uses a
