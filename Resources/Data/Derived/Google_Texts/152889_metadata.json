How could the court decide an unconstitutional financial penalty was somehow legitimate as a \u201ctax\u201d?\n\nAs a constitutional historian and former law professor, the question continued to nag me and eventually drew me into the latest of my long series of investigations of the Constitution\u2019s true meaning. That investigation has just been published by Case Western Reserve University Law Review.\n\nAfter reviewing the historical evidence, here\u2019s what I found: Chief Justice John Roberts\u2018 opinion upholding the Obamacare penalty did not include just one mistake; it included three.\n\nThe court admitted if the Obamacare penalty is only a penalty, it should be rejected as an unconstitutional overreach. The Constitution authorizes Congress \u201cTo lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,\u201d so if the court was right to label the penalty a \u201ctax,\u201d a legitimate argument could be made in favor of the mandate. Was the court correct to treat the Obamacare penalty as a \u201ctax\u201d? Not at all.\n\nWhen the Constitution uses the word \u201ctax,\u201d it means a financial charge imposed mostly to raise revenue. The Obamacare charge raises a small amount of revenue, but its main purpose is to force people to buy health insurance. For constitutional purposes, that disqualifies it as a tax. Deciding it was a tax was Justice Roberts\u2018 first mistake.\n\nWhen the Constitution was written, the American Revolution had been over for only four years. The Revolution had been fought largely over the issue of how taxes differed from other impositions. For the court to hold a penalty designed to coerce people is really a \u201ctax\u201d violates a principle our Founders fought for.\n\nThe Constitution also says federal laws imposing any \u201cdirect Taxes\u201d must be written to split the revenue from the states according to their respective populations. In other words, if Illinois has twice the population of Colorado, then twice the revenue must come from Illinois as comes from Colorado, irrespective of other circumstances.\n\nThis constitutional requirement for federal direct taxes is called the \u201capportionment rule.\u201d\n\nThe 16th Amendment abolished the apportionment rule for income taxes but not for other direct taxes.\n\nThe Obamacare law didn\u2019t provide for apportionment. Assuming the Obamacare penalty is a tax, would it be direct or indirect? If direct, then the law\u2019s failure to apportion it among the states renders it unconstitutional, and the evidence suggests that\u2019s precisely what ought to have occurred.\n\nJustice Roberts\u2018 opinion for the court shows puzzlement on this issue. Apparently, none of the parties provided the justices with good evidence of what the Constitution means by \u201cdirect taxes.\u201d But when the Constitution was written, the division between direct and indirect taxes was well understood. Direct taxes were levies on earning a living (production) and on living itself. Indirect taxes were taxes on consumption and certain other transactions.\n\nSpecifically, direct taxes included not just income taxes, but also levies on property and businesses. They further encompassed \u201ccapitations,\u201d or head taxes. These were charges just for living in a community.\n\nIndirect taxes included taxes on imports and levies on exports and on certain special transactions. Indirect taxes also included \u201cexcises\u201d \u2014 levies on consumption of goods. State and federal sales taxes are examples of excises.\n\nGiven these categories, Obamacare\u2019s penalty is obviously direct. It is imposed on uninsured people just for being in the country. Thus, it should have been apportioned according to the Constitution\u2019s standards for direct taxes, but it clearly wasn\u2019t.\n\nMy third question was: If the Obamacare penalty is a direct tax, then what kind of direct tax is it? The evidence shows it is a head tax \u2014 what the Constitution calls a \u201ccapitation.\u201d Because the Obamacare penalty can be waived or reduced, Justice Roberts thought it can\u2019t be a capitation \u2014 because everyone doesn\u2019t pay the same amount.\n\nThat was his third mistake. When the Constitution was written, American tax laws often waived or reduced capitations for people who were poor or who met other criteria. There was no requirement that everyone pay the same.\n\nIn sum, the Founding-era evidence shows the Supreme Court erred when it declared the Obamacare individual health insurance mandate is a tax that does not need to be apportioned among the states. The court should have ruled the mandate unconstitutional.\n\n[Originally published at the Washington Times]", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "My third question was: If the Obamacare penalty is a direct tax, then what kind of direct tax is it?\nThis constitutional requirement for federal direct taxes is called the \u201capportionment rule.\u201dThe 16th Amendment abolished the apportionment rule for income taxes but not for other direct taxes.\nThe court admitted if the Obamacare penalty is only a penalty, it should be rejected as an unconstitutional overreach.\nThus, it should have been apportioned according to the Constitution\u2019s standards for direct taxes, but it clearly wasn\u2019t.\nSpecifically, direct taxes included not just income taxes, but also levies on property and businesses."}
