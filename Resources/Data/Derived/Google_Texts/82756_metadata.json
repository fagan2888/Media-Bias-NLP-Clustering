In 1996, the agency authorized $2.3 billion for the project, known as the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS). The FAA received an additonal $438 million for implementing the new program.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has begun deploying a new computer system for its air traffic controllers despite warnings that the software suffers from unstable requirements, lacks key safety capabilities and requires training that has yet to be given to workers, a government watchdog warned Monday. The problems with the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) are so widespread right now that the new system already being installed at the Dallas airport actually has fewer capabilities for air traffic controllers than the old software it was designed to replace, the Transportation Department\u2019s inspector general reported. One of the missing capabilities is a special warning that alerts controllers of loss of separation between aircraft, a potential safety hazard, the IG said. Officials are scrambling for an upgrade this month to fix that problem. \u201cThe STARS deployment incorporates fewer capabilities than [the system] it aims to replace,\u201d the inspector general wrote in a stark memo made public Monday.\n\nWhat's that? The 35 year old system STARS is replacing is better than the new one? What's up with that?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the age-old problem with the FAA,\u201d said Mary Schiavo, herself a former Department of Transportation inspector general. \u201cThey rely pretty much entirely on the contractors. They keep changing the parameters, and they have to keep changing them, because it\u2019s gone on so long that new things keep getting developed.\u201d The warnings Monday are the latest for the troublesome STARS system. The IG recently raised red flags about STARS\u2019 implementation back in a May 2013 report, warning the new system was in danger of falling \u201cshort of providing promised capabilities for controlling takeoffs and landings \u2014 the most critical phases of flight.\u201d\n\nExactly the same problems with healthcare.gov. HHS kept changing the parameters of the website and what they wanted it to do, causing mass confusion with contractors and bureaucrats alike.\n\nHowever, the STARS system has faced problems since the contract was signed in 1996, when Ms. Schiavo was the department\u2019s top watchdog. \u201cWe issued warnings then,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has taken so long to implement that the computer code they [initially wrote] has [had] to be updated so many times that they never got the bugs out.\u201d\n\nThey have tried to implement the system in Dallas and the IG reported \"As a result of this examination, we determined that the risks we identified in our earlier report remain,\u201d the IG reported. \u201cNotably, FAA has yet to stabilize STARS software requirements.\u201d\n\nThe skies don't sound quite as friendly as they did before I read this story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/08/the_faas_23_billion_lemon.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: The FAA's $2.3 Billion lemon"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde907\"", "article_summary": "In 1996, the agency authorized $2.3 billion for the project, known as the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS).\n\u201cNotably, FAA has yet to stabilize STARS software requirements.\u201dThe skies don't sound quite as friendly as they did before I read this story.\nThe 35 year old system STARS is replacing is better than the new one?\nHowever, the STARS system has faced problems since the contract was signed in 1996, when Ms. Schiavo was the department\u2019s top watchdog.\nIf you loved the rollout of Obamacare, you're going to love the FAA's bug ridden, unstable, and potentially dangerous STARS program."}
