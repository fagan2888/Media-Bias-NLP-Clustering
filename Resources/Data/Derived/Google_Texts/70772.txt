Many came out Saturday for the 2nd Annual Dog Fest Walk 'n' Roll.

This year the event took place at Al Helms Park.

About 15 local vendors were selling food, crafts and pet supplies.

Proceeds from Saturday's dog walk benefits the Canine Companions for Independence.

Organizers of the event say they expected at least 3,000 visitors to the park and their goal was to raise $50,000

"It's a free, family event and it's going to be fun. We have games for the children, games for the dogs," explained Tony Super, Co-Chairman of the event. "We have a beautiful dog park, this is a great dog park. It's just a celebration and culmination of the last couple months of fundraising."
