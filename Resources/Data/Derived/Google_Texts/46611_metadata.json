But five \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d did just that Friday, joined by President Barack Obama for an afternoon of food, fun and Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama headed to The Coupe, a restaurant in Washington, D.C.\u2019s, Columbia Heights neighborhood, to meet with five \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d working to spread the word about the Affordable Care Act. As part of the White House\u2019s \u201caggressive outreach effort\u201d aimed at Millennials, the president dined with his guests for more than an hour, discussing their work with encouraging young people to enroll in Obamacare\u2019s health insurance marketplaces.\n\nAccording to the White House, \u201cThe President wanted to hear directly from young people about their experiences spreading the word about the importance of signing up for quality, affordable health insurance and thank them for their efforts.\u201d\n\n\n\nThose dining with President Obama included Anne Johnson of Generation Progress; David Dimock, a White House Youth Summit attendee and entrepreneur; Jasmine Hicks of Young Invincibles; Tommy McFly, host of The Tommy Show on 94.7 Fresh-FM; and Andres Cruz, an assister with DC Health Link.\n\nFollowing the disastrous roll out of the Affordable Care Act, the White House has shifted its attention to educating Millennials about the benefits of the president\u2019s signature law. Young people\u2019s participation in Obamacare is crucial to its success, with experts warning of a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d should the estimated 2.7 million 18- to 35-year-olds needed to keep premium costs low fail to enroll.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Monday the administration did not have data regarding how many \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d have enrolled in Obamacare\u2019s exchanges. However, he did say the \u201cmix\u201d of ages of Obamacare enrollees is more important than the actual number.\n\nThe Obama administration launched a campaign to encourage Millennials to #GetCovered in anticipation of the second half of the first open enrollment period. Since the campaign\u2019s launch, the White House has hosted a Youth Summit \u2014 two of its attendees dined with the president Friday \u2014 and teamed up with a bevy of celebrities tasked with promoting the law.\n\nMillennials can expect to see enrollment efforts expand to include grassroots organizers, elected officials, colleges and universities, celebrities, athletes and arts leaders, the White House said. The administration also plans to celebrate National Youth Enrollment Day on February 15.\n\nDespite the White House\u2019s efforts, young people still remain skeptical about the law. Comedy Central\u2019s popular \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d featured a panel of young people discussing Obamacare on Wednesday. The group agreed they still had many questions surrounding the law, including what coverage looks like and which doctors they have access to.\n\nAnd the law is proving to have many unintended consequences aimed directly at Millennials. Students at Bowie State University covered under university health insurance plans are finding the cost of their premiums have skyrocketed, and student-employees at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs worry their full-time positions may be eliminated as the law requires them to receive health insurance from university employers.\n\nObamacare\u2019s open enrollment period officially ends March 31.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Few can say they have broken bread with the President of the United States.
