You know, the massive, costly federal healthcare program for America\u2019s indigent? Within the last few months, it\u2019s been (a) exposed as an empirical failure by the most comprehensive study ever done, and (b) expanded hugely by Obamacare, natch. Here\u2019s how Medicaid is working in the Land of Lincoln:\n\nThe early findings of an ongoing review of the Illinois Medicaid program revealed that half the people enrolled weren\u2019t even eligible. The state insisted it\u2019s not that bad but Medicaid is on the federal government\u2019s own list of programs at high risk of waste and abuse. Now, a review of the Illinois Medicaid program confirms massive waste and fraud. A review was ordered more than a year ago\u2013 because of concerns about waste and abuse. So far, the state says reviewers have examined roughly 712-thousand people enrolled in Medicaid, and found that 357-thousand, or about half of them shouldn\u2019t have received benefits. After further review, the state decided that the percentage of people who didn\u2019t qualify was actually about one out of four.\n\nNot to fear, taxpayer-fleecing fraudsters, Big Labor has heroically filed a lawsuit to block the state from using private workers to purge ineligible recipients from the Medicaid rolls. This thing may be tied up in court for awhile:\n\nIllinois will continue looking at each of the 2.7 million people on Medicaid, trying figure out who doesn\u2019t belong in the program despite a lawsuit from the state\u2019s largest public employee union. Illinois\u2019 Health and Human Services Director Julie Hamos said Tuesday the state will appeal a ruling that would force the state to essentially stop its Medicaid scrubbing program, which is being done by a private contractor. \u201cWe believe ending this contract \u2026 would not best serve the interest of Illinois taxpayers,\u201d Hamos told a state legislative panel. \u201cWe do plan to appeal the decision of the arbitrator.\u201d That arbitrator ruled in favor of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees labor union, saying Illinois could have offered the work of scrubbing the Medicaid rolls to state employees, who are members of the union.\n\nMedicaid is the textbook definition of \u201cjunk\u201d coverage. Obamacare supporters are presently trying to excuse the president\u2019s historic \u201ckeep your plan\u201d lie by arguing that people are only losing \u201ccrappy\u201d coverage anyway. (In many cases, this isn\u2019t true). Yet they\u2019re also resolutely in favor of doubling down on this failing government program \u2014 which provides genuinely horrible access and lousy care. It\u2019s almost as if results and evidence don\u2019t matter to the Party of Science.
