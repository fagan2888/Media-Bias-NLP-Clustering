The shoot took place at Dagny's Coffee Company for about two hours Wednesday afternoon.\n\nFormer state Sen. Roy Ashburn, right, meets with Dagny's Coffee Company owner Mike Walters as a production company records the two Wednesday afternoon. Walters said he believes Ashburn lives in Los Angeles these days but requested to do part of the shoot for the untitled production at his favorite coffee house in Bakersfield.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly long-sleeve-denim shirt weather in Bakersfield Wednesday afternoon, yet there was Roy Ashburn, covered head to toe in his November best, sipping a large medium roast as he pretended to read The Californian for a camera crew outside Dagny\u2019s.\n\nThe production detail of about 15 or so guarded information on the shoot about as closely as they guarded the former state senator, who was blocked more than once from a Californian photographer\u2019s lens. What were they doing, these Dagny\u2019s interlopers, with their release forms, expensive equipment and insistent warnings to passers-by that if they didn\u2019t get off the sidewalk, they\u2019d be in the shot?\n\nThe person in charge, a woman in a hat and sunglasses who refused even to give her name, was no help.\n\n\u201cWho are you again? You\u2019re from the local paper?\u201d\n\nWas this a documentary? A \u201cWhere Are They Now\u201d special? Reality series? Is this denim-shirted version of Ashburn the buttoned-down alter-ego for a Sacramento-set superhero blockbuster?\n\nAshburn, after all, is interesting enough to launch his own entertainment franchise. The career of the conservative Republican, who represented Kern County for decades, took an unlikely tabloid turn when he was arrested for driving a state car while drunk. The fallout from that episode revealed that Ashburn had struggled for years as a closeted gay man. His career ended by term limits, he has since done some consulting, served on a state board and appears to be living a happy, authentic life, chasing his own rainbows.\n\nSounds pretty Hollywood to us.\n\nExcept in the snippet filmed on the sidewalk, Ashburn talked about none of that. After a scripted-within-an-inch-of-its-life bit of banter with Dagny\u2019s regular James Tiede \u2014 a scruffy coffee-house type wearing a T-shirt that said \u201cWisconsin: Smell the Dairy Air\u201d \u2014 the two entered into a deep conversation about ... taxes. Regulations. Permits. Fees. Prop 65. Even, yikes, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf this is a reality series, they\u2019re going to need some help in the editing room.\n\nA sign said the production was called \u201cAmerican Journeys\u201d but offered no further details. The television network HLN airs a program called \u201cAmerican Journey,\u201d or so the Internet tells me. That program is about \u201cthe fearless pioneering spirit at the heart of American ingenuity and resilience, the spirit that is rebuilding America and making a real impact in communities all across the country.\u201d\n\nEven Dagny\u2019s owner Mike Walters, who agreed to be on camera, didn\u2019t seem to know what was going on. Then again, this is a coffee-shop owner who doesn\u2019t like coffee.\n\n\u201cThey called me a month ago and told me they were doing something with a politician. I figured because Roy used to come in here four or five times a week, that it was him.\u201d\n\nThe only direction Walters received was to talk to the former lawmaker for two or three minutes.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018You never talked to Roy. He can talk for 30 minutes without taking a breath.\u2019\u201d\n\nAshburn\u2019s partner in the \u201cimpromptu\u201d scene outside was Tiede, 31, a regular at the 20th and Eye hangout. Though with his stylishly ripped jeans, shaggy hair and ironic T-shirt, he doesn\u2019t look the part of a conservative Ashburn fan, he is.\n\n\u201cI used to work at a gun shop and would see him at these gun dinners. I know him to be a fairly good guy-ish.\u201d\n\nTiede was drinking a Firestone double-barrel ale at Dagny\u2019s Wednesday when producers overheard him greeting Ashburn and asked him to do it again, for the cameras.\n\n\u201cI heard two different things \u2014 a documentary and a reality series,\u201d Tiede said.\n\nAt the end of the shoot, Ashburn ignored a reporter\u2019s request for an interview, though he was gracious enough to look sheepish about it, as his handlers hurried him along down 20th Street.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It wasn&rsquo;t exactly long-sleeve-denim shirt weather in Bakersfield Wednesday afternoon, yet there was Roy Ashburn, covered head to toe in his November best, sipping a large medium roast as he pretended to read The Californian for a camera crew outside Dagny&rsquo;s.
