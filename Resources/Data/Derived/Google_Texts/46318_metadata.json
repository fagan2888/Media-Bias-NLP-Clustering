But there was another workplace pooping incident involving another federal agency decades earlier--and it remains an unsolved mystery.\n\nThe difference is that the earlier episode took place hundreds of thousands of miles from the earth\u2019s surface, aboard the Apollo 10 spacecraft orbiting the moon in 1969 in preparation for the Apollo 11 landing, Vox reported recently.\n\nAs the Apollo 10 spacecraft circled the moon, mission Commander Tom Stafford made a sudden, distasteful discovery. \u201cThere\u2019s a turd floating through the air,\u201d he declared. This was, apparently, not an altogether uncommon phenomenon. Without going into too much detail, the plastic bag-based \u201cfecal subsystem\u201d deployed on long space flights had a less-than-perfect track record in capturing and containing excrement.\n\nIndeed, an official NASA report on the subsystem noted that containing waste was particularly difficult:\n\nThe collection process required a great deal of skill to preclude escape of feces from the collection bag and consequent soiling of the crew, their clothing, or cabin surfaces. The fecal collection process was, moreover, extremely time consuming because of the level of difficulty involved with use of the system. An Apollo 7 astronaut estimated the time required to correctly accomplish the process at 45 minutes.\n\nUpon discovery of the Apollo 10 fecal floater, Vox reported, the astronauts on the mission engaged in a rather spirited debate as to its origins:\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it. It ain\u2019t one of mine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s one of mine.\u201d \u201cMine was a little more sticky than that. Throw that away.\u201d\n\nMinutes later, lunar module pilot Eugene Cernan exclaimed: \u201cHere\u2019s another goddamn turd. What\u2019s the matter with you guys?\u201d\n\nWhile a modified version of the \u201che who smelt it, dealt it,\u201d rule could conceivably apply in this case, it appears we\u2019ll never know who bears responsibility for the soiling of Apollo 10.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tom Shoop", "description": "A mysterious incident during the Apollo 10 mission.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "A mysterious incident during the Apollo 10 mission.", "title": "The Astronaut Poop Bandit of 1969", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/management/2015/06/astronaut-poop-bandit-1969/114721/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/08/9349494259_ef5fb78dc9_k.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mysterious incident during the Apollo 10 mission.", "creator": "@tshoop", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/08/9349494259_ef5fb78dc9_k/open-graph.jpg", "title": "The Astronaut Poop Bandit of 1969", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-08T17:16:20Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/08/9349494259_ef5fb78dc9_k.jpg", "sailthru.title": "The Astronaut Poop Bandit of 1969", "keywords": "nasa, astronaut", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/08/9349494259_ef5fb78dc9_k/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "nasa,channel-management,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "A mysterious incident during the Apollo 10 mission."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd078\"", "article_summary": "The fecal collection process was, moreover, extremely time consuming because of the level of difficulty involved with use of the system.\nWithout going into too much detail, the plastic bag-based \u201cfecal subsystem\u201d deployed on long space flights had a less-than-perfect track record in capturing and containing excrement.\nIt appears that the Environmental Protection Agency was not the first federal agency to experience an employee poop problem.\nAn Apollo 7 astronaut estimated the time required to correctly accomplish the process at 45 minutes.\nAs the Apollo 10 spacecraft circled the moon, mission Commander Tom Stafford made a sudden, distasteful discovery."}
