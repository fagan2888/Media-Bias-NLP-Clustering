Particularly, she cannot help but notice the lack of images portraying children with disabilities.\n\nSo three years ago, Driscoll, a professional photographer, took matters into her own hands and founded a non-profit organization called Changing the Face of Beauty. She is on a mission to change public perception of disability through advertising.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, with our major brands right now we are not seeing a lot of inclusion, which is disappointing,\u201d Driscoll told The Daily Signal.\n\nLast year, Driscoll staged and shot a viral back-to-school photo shoot that included children with disabilities. She calls her daughter Grace her \u201csilent motivator\u201d and says she pushes her to paint an accurate picture of individuals with disabilities in her images.\n\n\u201cBack to School 2014\u201d is going to be AMAZING! It is all about #beuramazingself and these kids ROCKED it out today! A\u2026 Posted by Changing the Face of Beauty on Tuesday, August 5, 2014\n\nAs back-to-school advertising campaigns rev up this year once again, Driscoll feels that this is a \u201ccrucial time\u201d for disabled children to find inclusion, value and acceptance in society.\n\nDriscoll is already seeing an impact. Last year\u2019s campaign influenced Livie & Luca, a children\u2019s company, to begin a social media campaign called \u201cI\u2019m Going Back to School Too,\u201d partnering with Changing the Face of Beauty to raise funds for a special education campaign.\n\nAlong with the back-to-school shoot, Changing the Face of Beauty has produced other shoots to educate retailers on inclusion in advertising.\n\nRecently, Changing the Face of Beauty launched another social media campaign, aimed at attracting 15 companies to commit to including at least one model with a disability in their 2015 advertising. The campaign was called \u201c15 for 2015.\u201d They reached that goal in January and have partnered with over 100 brands, including brands in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nHEY! did you hear? ALL children of ALL abilities are returning to school! How cool is that? Right?Show us your\u2026 Posted by Changing the Face of Beauty on Monday, July 27, 2015\n\n\u201cThe resounding response from the companies that we\u2019ve worked with so far is, \u2018We never thought about it. I can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t think about it,\u2019\u201d Driscoll said.\n\nClothing store Freckles & Kitty is one of those companies.\n\n\u201cIt was certainly not a difficult decision to participate, once we realized that the option was there,\u201d Freckles & Kitty wrote on the Changing the Face of Beauty website. \u201cIt speaks to who we are as people, as a brand, and, by extension, as a company.\u201d\n\nDriscoll believes that an increase in portrayals of individuals with disabilities, reflecting a more realistic depiction of society, directly correlates to opportunities for employment and independence for the disabled.\n\nWe are all going back to school right? #imgoingbacktoschooltooWe wanna see your gorgeous student!

Already this year, Jamie Brewer, a model who has Down Syndrome, walked in New York Fashion Week shows because of Driscoll and Changing the Face of Beauty\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see big changes in the future,\u201d Driscoll said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Katie Driscoll, a young mother of six, back-to-school excitement is always dulled by one thing: advertising.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For Katie Driscoll, a young mother of six, back-to-school excitement is always dulled by one thing: advertising.", "title": "Why This Mom Wants to See Disabled Children in Ads", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_FaceBeauty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-05T23:08:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1IXpgQN"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "For Katie Driscoll, a young mother of six, back-to-school excitement is always dulled by one thing: advertising.", "title": "Why This Mom Wants to See Disabled Children in Ads", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150805_FaceBeauty.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-08-05T14:10:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-05T23:08:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Changing the Face of Beauty, advertising, intellectual disability"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc107\"", "article_summary": "Share with us!#changingthefaceofbeauty Posted by Changing the Face of Beauty on Tuesday, July 28, 2015It appears she is on to something.\nLast year, Driscoll staged and shot a viral back-to-school photo shoot that included children with disabilities.\nAlong with the back-to-school shoot, Changing the Face of Beauty has produced other shoots to educate retailers on inclusion in advertising.\nSo three years ago, Driscoll, a professional photographer, took matters into her own hands and founded a non-profit organization called Changing the Face of Beauty.\nParticularly, she cannot help but notice the lack of images portraying children with disabilities."}
