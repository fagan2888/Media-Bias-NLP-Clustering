Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking member of the Democrats\u2019 Senate leadership team, made waves with his claim last month that the party would have been better off focusing on the economy in the early months of the Obama presidency, rather than pressing for passage of health care reform.\n\n\u201cDemocrats blew the opportunity the American people gave them. We took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem \u2014 health care reform,\u201d Schumer told the National Press Club on November 25. Had Democrats focused exclusively on stimulating the economy, Schumer went on to argue, they\u2019d have accelerated the recovery from the Great Recession and converted Americans toward a \u201cmore pro-government view.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d Schumer asserted, \u201cDemocrats would have been in a better position to tackle our nation\u2019s health care crisis.\u201d\n\nLiberal economist Paul Krugman says Schumer\u2019s argument is bunk.\n\nIn his New York Times column today, Krugman lays into the senator\u2019s notion that there\u2019d have been a more opportune time to pass the landmark Affordable Care Act. First, however, Krugman cites measures like the uninsured rate and health care costs to note that health reform is working well as public policy \u2014 regardless of the politics.\n\nAs for Schumer, Krugman writes, the Democrat could hardly be more misguided in his criticism. In his National Press Club speech, the senator dinged Democrats for quickly pivoting toward health reform in 2009, even though few uninsured Americans vote. But as Krugman notes, Obamacare doesn\u2019t just benefit the uninsured; it\u2019s also a boon to Americans who lose their jobs or their employer-sponsored insurance, as well as anyone who\u2019d like to change jobs but can\u2019t find one that carries health insurance. The columnist could have added individuals with preexisting health conditions and adults who can now stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until age 26 to the list.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberal economist blasts Democratic senator's Monday morning quarterbacking", "title": "\u201cSeriously?\u201d: Paul Krugman unloads on Chuck Schumer for Obamacare criticism", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Liberal economist blasts Democratic senator's Monday morning quarterbacking", "title": "\u201cSeriously?\u201d: Paul Krugman unloads on Chuck Schumer for Obamacare criticism", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/05/seriously_paul_krugman_unloads_on_chuck_schumer_for_obamacare_criticism/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul-krugman-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liberal economist blasts Democratic senator's Monday morning quarterbacking", "title": "\u201cSeriously?\u201d: Paul Krugman unloads on Chuck Schumer for Obamacare criticism", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul-krugman-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Democrats, Health care reform, health insurance, Obamacare, Paul Krugman, The New York Times", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce296\"", "article_summary": "As for Schumer, Krugman writes, the Democrat could hardly be more misguided in his criticism.\nWe took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem \u2014 health care reform,\u201d Schumer told the National Press Club on November 25.\nThe columnist could have added individuals with preexisting health conditions and adults who can now stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until age 26 to the list.\nFirst, however, Krugman cites measures like the uninsured rate and health care costs to note that health reform is working well as public policy \u2014 regardless of the politics.\nIn his National Press Club speech, the senator dinged Democrats for quickly pivoting toward health reform in 2009, even though few uninsured Americans vote."}
