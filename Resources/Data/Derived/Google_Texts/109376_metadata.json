When it,\"enahnces global welfare\" say two scientists in a peer-reviewed paper published recently.\n\nA new peer-reviewed paper published in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, titled \u201cInformation Manipulation and Climate Agreements\u201d , is openly providing a \u201crationale\u201d for global warming proponents to engage in mendacious claims in order to further their cause. The paper appears to support or provide a formula for why lying or \u201cinformation manipulation\u201d is able to further the cause of man-made global warming and \u201cenhance global welfare.\u201d The authors use a mathematical formula to study information tactics. The authors, Assistant Professors of Economics Fuhai Hong and Xiaojian Zhao, note how the media and environmental groups \u201cexaggerate\u201d global warming and then the offer their paper to \u201cprovide a rationale for this tendency\u201d to exaggerate for the good of the cause. The paper was published on February 24, 2014. The author\u2019s boldly note in the abstract of the study that the \u201cnews media and some pro-environmental have the tendency to accentuate or even exaggerate the damage caused by climate change. This article provides a rationale for this tendency.\u201d \u201cWe find that the information manipulation has an instrumental value, as it ex post induces more countries to participate in an IEA (International Environmental Agreements) which will eventually enhance global welfare.\u201d The paper conclusions read in part: \u201cThis article offers a rationale for the phenomenon of climate change accentuation or exaggeration on the part of the international mainstream media or other pro-environmental organizations.\u201d \u2014 \u2018We show that the aforementioned exaggeration of climate damage may alleviate the problem of insuf\ufb01cient IEA participation.\u201d \u201cIn fact, our key result\u2014that overpessimism alleviates the underparticipation problem\u2014implies that the propaganda of climate skepticism may be detrimental to the society,\u201d the authors conclude on page two, footnote #5.\n\nReaction to the paper by scientists is highly critical:\n\nCraig Rucker of Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow CFACT (Climate Depot\u2019s parent company) noted in an April 4 blog: \u201cWhat will shock you is that two professors not only candidly admit it, but published a paper in a peer reviewed journal touting the beneficial effects of lying for pushing nations into a UN climate treaty in Paris next year!\u201d Rucker added: \u201cThe authors not only believe that their dubious ends justify their shady means, they institutionalize \u2018information manipulation\u2019 as a tactic, host panels about it at climate conferences and publish it in journals. They\u2019re shameless.\u201d CFACT Davi\u2019s Rothbard noted: \u201cGlobal warming skeptics have long charged that alarmists are over-hyping the dangers of climate change. Now comes a new paper from two economists in Singapore and Hong Kong that actually advocates exaggerating global warming fears to get countries on board international environmental agreements.\u201d\n\nTom Harris, executive director of the International Climate Science Coalition (ICSC), sends along a few other examples of this mindset in an email:\n\nQuote by Christine Stewart, former Canadian Environment Minister: \u201cNo matter if the science is all phoney, there are collateral environmental benefits.... climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.\u201d Quote by Timoth Wirth, U.S./UN functionary, former elected Democrat Senator: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ride the global-warming issue. Even if the theory of global warming is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic policy and environmental policy.\u201d Quote by Richard Benedik, former U.S./UN bureaucrat: \"A global climate treaty must be implemented even if there is no scientific evidence to back the greenhouse effect.\"\n\nIn their own words.\n\nThe two professors are backtracking furiously, claiming that they've been \"misinterpreted.\" Heh. Short version: \"We didn't say what we actually said but the data proves what we didn't exactly say but should have said.\"\n\nThe quotes above show that this mindset has been prevelant in the climate change movement for years. Every once and a while, the mask slips and we see what's really happening behind the curtain. It will be interesting to see how some climate change advocates respond to this paper and whether they have the guts to go against the grain and stand up for truth in science.\n\nDon't hold your breath.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/04/paper_its_ok_to_lie_about_climate_change.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Paper: It's OK to lie about climate change"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10e2\"", "article_summary": "When is it OK to lie about the facts regarding climate change?\nThe quotes above show that this mindset has been prevelant in the climate change movement for years.\nThey\u2019re shameless.\u201d CFACT Davi\u2019s Rothbard noted: \u201cGlobal warming skeptics have long charged that alarmists are over-hyping the dangers of climate change.\nIt will be interesting to see how some climate change advocates respond to this paper and whether they have the guts to go against the grain and stand up for truth in science.\nWhen it,\"enahnces global welfare\" say two scientists in a peer-reviewed paper published recently."}
