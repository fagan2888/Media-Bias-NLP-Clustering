I guess there's no denying that. The website is not... what's the word... functioning. At all. And some people who are losing their insurance felt a little misled when they misinterpreted Obama's words, \"if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what,\" as meaning... just what he said.\n\nAnd now people are all angry. They're like, \"You want to overhaul health care, and you can't even get a simple website working. You're grossly incompetent! And also a huge liar!\" It's a big mess, lots of people are unhappy, and everyone is losing faith in the government. Boy, have the Republicans and the Tea Party extremists really screwed things up this time.\n\nI mean, they're obviously at fault here. On one side, we have President Obama and the Democrats -- very smart, capable people who just want to get everyone health care, even if they have to do it with threats and fines -- and on the other side are those thuggish Republicans and those nutso Tea Partiers who are, like, racist -- especially against taxes. If you're trying to figure out who the villain is here, it can't be more obvious. Obama is intelligent and great, and the people who oppose him are awful. Those Tea Party people are almost like Nazis -- but Nazis who are anti-government. So I guess they're more like those horrendous people from history who didn't like the government pushing them around. You know, the... hmm, I can't remember the name, but I'm pretty sure it's a thing.\n\nSo there you have it. It's time to tell those wretched Republican and right-wing crazies to stop messing things up so we can get our health care. They really made a big mess this time, and they're going to pay for it.\n\nWhat's that? You want an explanation of how they're at fault here? Well, there are... um... so many reasons, it's hard to pick just one.\n\nOh, but you do want me to name at least one. Okay, uh...\n\nAha! I got it. All the negative attention the Republicans gave Obamacare caused the website to crash. You know what a \"Denial of Service\" attack is? That's where a website is flooded with so many requests at once that its servers can't handle it, and the site goes down. Usually, this takes millions and millions of requests, but in the case of healthcare.gov, all it takes is more than eight. So when Republicans were all like \"you have to log in and see how bad Obamacare is!\" they were, in fact, orchestrating an attack on the new and vulnerable website. So they basically crashed Obamacare by... um... mentioning it.\n\nNo, wait; scratch that. I have a new reason why the Republicans are at fault here: the sequester. The Republicans love when the government has less money, and they got their wish with the harsh sequester cuts and the government shutdown that affected literally tens of people. So there just wasn\u2019t enough money to put up a working website. I mean, they only had like a few hundred million dollars to get the job done. I don't think anyone can launch a functioning website for under a billion. Each Wordpress blog costs about... uh... $2.3 billion to launch. Don't bother googling that; I'm pretty sure I'm in the ballpark. So the government just had inadequate funds -- that plus the rushed schedule of three years\u2026. They just couldn't, um...\n\nActually, I have a better reason this is all the Republicans\u2019 fault: It's because none of them voted for Obamacare. Not a single Republican voted for the bill. Some may ignorantly say, \"That means the Republicans bear no responsibility, and the Democrats own this failure entirely.\" Well, anyone who thinks that is just not thinking things through. Put yourself in the shoes of the programmers -- or sandals, as computer programmers can be weird people -- and think what it must be like to have all these Republicans not want you to be there. Who can work in those conditions?", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Why Republicans Are Absolutely, Completely, 100% at Fault for the Botched Obamacare Rollout | PJ Media", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "PJ Media", "description": "And if you give me a minute, I'll come up with a reason.", "title": "Why Republicans Are Absolutely, Completely, 100% at Fault for the Botched Obamacare Rollout", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/why-republicans-are-absolutely-completely-100-at-fault-for-the-botched-obamacare-rollout/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/1/files/2013/11/1-35.jpg", "updated_time": 1464307609, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "And if you give me a minute, I'll come up with a reason.", "title": "Why Republicans Are Absolutely, Completely, 100% at Fault for the Botched Obamacare Rollout", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/blog/why-republicans-are-absolutely-completely-100-at-fault-for-the-botched-obamacare-rollout/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/1/files/2013/11/1-35.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Why Republicans Are Absolutely, Completely, 100% at Fault for the Botched Obamacare Rollout | PJ Media", "pinterestDescription": "Why Republicans Are Absolutely, Completely, 100% at Fault for the Botched Obamacare Rollout", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Why Republicans Are Absolutely, Completely, 100% at Fault for the Botched Obamacare RolloutSo there have been a lot of problems with the Obamacare rollout.\nAnd some people who are losing their insurance felt a little misled when they misinterpreted Obama's words, \"if you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period.\nThey just couldn't, um...Actually, I have a better reason this is all the Republicans\u2019 fault: It's because none of them voted for Obamacare.\nThey're like, \"You want to overhaul health care, and you can't even get a simple website working.\nIt's time to tell those wretched Republican and right-wing crazies to stop messing things up so we can get our health care."}
