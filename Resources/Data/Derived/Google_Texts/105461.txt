ANALYSIS/OPINION:

The likely Libertarian Party nominee for president took a look at the results of Super Tuesday, and came away with a single thought.

“I actually believe I may have won Super Tuesday,” says Gary Johnson, the former governor of New Mexico who ran for the White House in 2012 and managed to snag 1.2 million votes in the process. His campaign this time around is very much underway.

“With the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton trains becoming more and more unstoppable in their respective parties, I believe a real majority of American voters are going to be left without a political home in November,” Mr. Johnson continues. “To those millions of voters, a successful two-term Governor with a solid record of fiscal responsibility and defense of civil and personal liberties could well be the mainstream option.”

Left out of the official presidential debate process, Mr. Johnson recently sued the Presidential Debate Commission hoping to win a spot on the big stage, to no avail - yet. The candidate made the same point during his appearance before a sizable audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference - CPAC - this week. In the meantime, preliminary negotiations are underway to stage a third party debate, to be hosted by Fox Business Network host John Stossel.

Mr. Johnson points out, however, that the Libertarian nominee likely will be on the ballot in every state in November - debate or no debate.

“I hope to be that nominee,” he says. “Both of the major parties are succeeding in alienating more voters than ever before. The Democrat establishment is effectively shutting down its challengers, and Republicans are clearly rejecting their establishment. The net result may be that more Americans than ever before will be looking to a truly independent, experienced and proven candidate.”
