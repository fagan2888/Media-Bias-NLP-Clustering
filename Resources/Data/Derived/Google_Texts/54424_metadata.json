Similarly, the group didn\u2019t record any states adding reimbursements for remote patient monitoring technology, which would allow people to remain in their homes rather than staying in health care facilities. Only 16 states currently offer those reimbursements.\n\n\u201cI think the most significant part of this is that we haven\u2019t really seen much at all in terms of changes,\u201d Mario Gutierrez, the center\u2019s executive director, told StateScoop. \u201cIn fact, what we see is some states moving forward and some states moving backwards.\u201d\n\nGutierrez said he\u2019s encouraged by some states making \u201ca little fix here, a little fix there\u201d when it comes to making their health care programs more telehealth-friendly, and he appreciates that the Affordable Care Act has spurred a \u201ctransition period in health care.\u201d However, he notes that he was still hoping to see more progress on some of these issues.\n\nIn particular, he\u2019s disappointed that more states haven\u2019t taken steps to codify the use of store-and-forward techniques. The group is keeping a careful eye on a New York law passed in January that could let the state\u2019s Medicaid program provide reimbursements for the service, but Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s administration is still finalizing how it will translate the legislation into Medicaid policies.\n\nHe\u2019s hoping to see the state take up the technology, joining other large states like California, Illinois and Virginia, to help show lawmakers the value of store-and-forward services.\n\n\u201cIt is well-documented as improving quality and saving money, and very mature in the field, particularly around dermatology and ophthalmology, yet we\u2019re still stuck on nine states that reimburse for store-and-forward,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\n[Read more: Alaska bill to expand telemedicine techniques gains steam in Legislature]\n\nWhen it comes to remote patient monitoring tech, the group\u2019s researchers noted that only 10 states offered reimbursements for its use in 2013 compared to the 16 today, concluding that there has been some movement on the issue. But Gutierrez lamented that many officials still don\u2019t understand the technology\u2019s value, pointing to the fact that 23 states (compared to 15 a year ago) now restrict the \u201coriginating site\u201d for telehealth techniques to health care facilities, limiting doctors with home offices or other nontraditional practice locations.\n\n\u201cBy restricting the place where the originating site for the delivery of health care to just medical facilities kind of pre-empts the whole notion of being able to provide care and keep people healthy at home and offer patient portals and virtual care,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nHowever, he noted that one trend in the area encouraged him. Many states once required that patients live in a rural area with a documented shortage of physicians before they could receive Medicaid money for electronic care. Now, only 10 states still have that provision in place \u2014 Idaho, Nevada and Missouri have all eliminated those regulations in recent years.\n\n\u201cOne of the real advantages of virtual care is it allows you to provide care wherever the patient or individual may be,\u201d Gutierrez said.\n\nGutierrez is also optimistic about the prospect of more telehealth changes coming at the state level in the next few months. His group found that lawmakers in 44 states have introduced 150 telemedicine bills in their 2016 legislative sessions so far, a trend he attributes to a growing focus on the issue from advocacy groups like the National Conference of State Legislatures.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s much more attention being paid to telehealth in various formats,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly seen it form the kinds of calls we get from certain states for assistance.\u201d\n\nHowever, to get those bills to actually pass, Gutierrez said his group plans to put a focus on educating lawmakers and advocacy groups about the benefits of telehealth, which he believes are still only loosely understood.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of this is really about education, an increasing awareness as to what connected health and telehealth is all about,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cEventually, my feeling is you\u2019ll reach a critical mass where enough states start passing some forms of common language that other states will follow.\u201d\n\nContact the reporter at alex.koma@statescoop.com, and follow him on Twitter @AlexKomaSNG.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://statescoop.com/study-states-make-only-incremental-progress-in-passing-telehealth-friendly-policies", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/statescoop-media/uploads/telemedicineyoutube.jpg?mtime=20160502121530", "site_name": "StateScoop", "description": "The Center for Connected Health Policy's latest survey of state policies reflects an inconsistent focus on telemedicine nationwide.", "title": "Study: States make minor progress on telehealth-friendly policies"}, "description": "The Center for Connected Health Policy's latest survey of state policies reflects an inconsistent focus on telemedicine nationwide.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Center for Connected Health Policy's latest survey of state policies reflects an inconsistent focus on telemedicine nationwide.\nSimilarly, the group didn\u2019t record any states adding reimbursements for remote patient monitoring technology, which would allow people to remain in their homes rather than staying in health care facilities.\nIn particular, he\u2019s disappointed that more states haven\u2019t taken steps to codify the use of store-and-forward techniques.\nNow, only 10 states still have that provision in place \u2014 Idaho, Nevada and Missouri have all eliminated those regulations in recent years.\n\u201cI think a lot of this is really about education, an increasing awareness as to what connected health and telehealth is all about,\u201d Gutierrez said."}
