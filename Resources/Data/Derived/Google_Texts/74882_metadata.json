Or not. It\u2019s hard to know.\n\nWindow film \u2014 a transparent barrier that, its makers say, keeps bad sunrays from eating up your furniture and driving up your air-conditioning bills \u2014 is at its best unseen.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem. How do you know it\u2019s there? Because it\u2019s invisible, I\u2019m tempted to put it in the same category as the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes, or the buying and selling of galactic stars. I worry that homeowners are buying into some big transparent lie.\n\nIt\u2019s like sunscreen for windows, those with more faith tell me. But I want more proof. Plus, I have other concerns about sunscreen for windows.\n\nI like natural light in a house. \u201cThe space has great light,\u201d real estate agents will say, pointing out a plus in a home. Why kill it?\n\nI like sunshine. I grew up on the West Coast, where, before I knew better, getting a great tan was like a second career. When I did know better, I avoided the sun like a bat and slathered on sunscreen. Now I have Vitamin D deficiency from not enough sun. Someone, somewhere, is wrong.\n\nI like conspicuous consumption. I\u2019d rather buy a new area rug or table than some not-obvious, no-fun home improvement, like, say, insulation.\n\nPlus, I\u2019ve seen bad window jobs. And just like nose jobs, you notice only the bad ones.\n\nAs it happens, there is a man whose job is to turn unenlightened cretins like me around on this subject.\n\nDarrell Smith, executive director of the International Window Film Association, a group of manufacturers, distributors and installers, welcomes my skepticism.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to provide accurate information to those who have misinformation that is over 20 years old,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m your target,\u201d I said, then shot my opening round. \u201cI don\u2019t like how window tinting affects interior color. Why go to all that trouble picking paint to go with your sofa fabric to blend with your carpet, then cast a pall over it all?\u201d\n\n(As Smith answers me, I get an e-mail from his public-relations person, who\u2019s listening in: No one calls it tinting any more days. The preferred term is window film. Oh.)\n\n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Smith assured. \u201cYou can get products today that don\u2019t affect color.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m dubious.\n\nHe explains. Years ago, window films used to screen damaging light rays either by adding a dark color to the film, which would absorb the heat and harmful rays, or by adding metal to the film to reflect them.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s how you got those dark, shiny buildings that made you certain a drug deal was going on inside,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s technology uses absorbing metals and materials that have reflectors we can\u2019t see,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThe harmful rays are still absorbed or reflected, but this work is done outside of the visible light spectrum.\u201d\n\n\u201cOhhhh. So it\u2019s like the National Security Agency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, if a window film stopped 65 percent of the solar energy, it would block 65 percent of the light, too,\u201d said Smith. \u201cToday\u2019s films can stop solar energy and be color-neutral.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s clearly better,\u201d I said, finally coming around.\n\nHow much does window film cost? To coat a 5-foot-by-6-foot window can vary from $120 to $270, depending on where you live, said Smith.\n\nAnd you should shop around. (You can find an installer in your area at iwfa.com.) You\u2019ll find the best deals in winter, which is why we\u2019re talking about this now. As the weather heats up, deep discounts \u2014 like burgundy curtains in the Colorado sunshine \u2014 fade.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press). Contact her through marnijameson.com.\n\n7 crystal-clear window-film tips\n\nHere are more points homeowners should know about getting great protection, even if they never see it:\n\n1. Color-neutral options. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to change the color of your home\u2019s natural light or see any metallic shine, ask for a color-neutral day-lighting film,\u201d said the window-film association\u2019s Darell Smith. Your windows will save energy, but give up next to nothing in light quality.\n\n2. Lower bills. In hot weather, solar-control films can block up to 80 percent of the solar energy coming through windows, which cuts down on air conditioning. \u201cIt usually translates into a year-round savings of about 5 to 10 percent of the home\u2019s total energy bill,\u201d said Smith, and much more during hot months.\n\n3. Damage shield. Visible light lies on the spectrum between ultraviolet, which damages furniture, and infrared, which beams heat. Treated windows will block 99 percent of UVA and UVB rays, thus greatly slowing the deterioration and fading of drapes, carpet and furniture.\n\n4. Decorative looks. Today\u2019s window films can also inexpensively make clear glass look etched or frosted for privacy or a decorative effect.\n\n5. It\u2019s not a fix. If your window is in bad shape, leaking or poorly insulated, adding film won\u2019t fix that. Deteriorating windows should be replaced. However, if your windows are in good shape, don\u2019t replace them just for energy efficiency, said Smith. Try film first.\n\n6. Get a warranty on the work. And read it before you sign a contract. You should be protected against bad installations. Signs of a bad job include film that peels or lifts at the edges, or little bubbles growing under the film. Speaking of warranties, many window manufacturers will invalidate their warranty if you do anything to their windows, including adding window film. If your windows are still under warranty, find out how adding film will affect that protection. Get it in writing.\n\n7. Get money back. If you had window film installed in 2012 or 2013, you could get a federal energy tax credit of up to 10 percent of the cost of installation, up to $500. Ask your utility company if they offer a credit toward your energy bill if you treat your windows.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Abundantly clear: Window films can save money invisibly", "title": "Abundantly clear: Window films can save money invisibly", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/24/abundantly-clear-window-films-can-save-money-invisibly/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140124__20140125_C8_FE25AHMARNIp1.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140124__20140125_C8_FE25AHMARNIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-25T01:39:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T22:47:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf59a\"", "article_summary": "Speaking of warranties, many window manufacturers will invalidate their warranty if you do anything to their windows, including adding window film.\nToday\u2019s window films can also inexpensively make clear glass look etched or frosted for privacy or a decorative effect.\nDarrell Smith, executive director of the International Window Film Association, a group of manufacturers, distributors and installers, welcomes my skepticism.\nPlus, I\u2019ve seen bad window jobs.\nThe preferred term is window film."}
