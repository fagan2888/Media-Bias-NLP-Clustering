When Pope Francis administered those 15 Merry Christmas whacks heard round the world on Monday, he was doing something new under the Roman sun.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that popes have always been happy with the world\u2019s oldest continuously functioning bureaucracy. Martin V, the Italian aristocrat whose election ended the Great Schism in 1417, reduced the cardinals to \u201cquivering, stammering children in his presence,\u201d writes Eamon Duffy in his History of the Popes. One hundred years later, when Leo X discovered cardinals plotting against him, he executed the ringleader and created 31 new ones in a single day.\n\n\u201cHow many people work at the Vatican?\u201d a journalist once asked Pope John XXIII. \u201cAbout half of them,\u201d he famously replied. Francis, who came into office with a mandate to get the Curia working properly, has by word and deed made clear that he means to do just that.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Leo XIII found his efforts to resolve tensions with the Orthodox and Eastern Rite churches frustrated by hardliners in the Curia. Francis may occupy the papal throne as a humble man of the people, but he\u2019s also a tough old Jesuit. He wants the Curia \u2014 and the world \u2014 to know that bureaucratic foot-dragging and sabotage will no longer be tolerated.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Institutions, Opinion, Catholic, Pope Francis", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "Letting the world know that", "title": "Why Francis kicked the Curia\u2019s butt", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2014/12/24/francis-kicked-curias-butt/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Confirmation_of_the_Rule_1482_85.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@directorsilk"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2014/12/24/francis-kicked-curias-butt/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2014/12/24/francis-kicked-curias-butt/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Letting the world know that"}, "article_summary": "When Pope Francis administered those 15 Merry Christmas whacks heard round the world on Monday, he was doing something new under the Roman sun.\nFrancis may occupy the papal throne as a humble man of the people, but he\u2019s also a tough old Jesuit.\nOne hundred years later, when Leo X discovered cardinals plotting against him, he executed the ringleader and created 31 new ones in a single day.\nHe wants the Curia \u2014 and the world \u2014 to know that bureaucratic foot-dragging and sabotage will no longer be tolerated.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Leo XIII found his efforts to resolve tensions with the Orthodox and Eastern Rite churches frustrated by hardliners in the Curia."}
