Seconds earlier, an announcement came over the loudspeaker at the stadium telling fans they were no longer going to be kept in the stadium.\n\n9:58 PM: Investigative reporter Matthew Boyle reports that both he and a family member both tried to escape the scene of destruction and chaos, but were prevented by a forcible lockout. No one is allowed to leave Oriole Park at Camden Yards. There are at least 15,000 people trapped in the stadium \u2014 and it\u2019s the bottom of the tenth inning.\n\nFrom the wires:\n\nBaltimore (AFP) \u2014 Protesters smashed police cars and shop windows in downtown Baltimore on Saturday when the biggest demonstration over the death of a young African-American man in police custody turned violent.\n\nMore than 1,000 people joined an orderly 90-minute rally at Baltimore city hall demanding justice for Freddie Gray, who died last Sunday from spinal injuries, a week after his arrest in the city\u2019s impoverished west side.\n\nBut the mood shifted dramatically when several scores of protesters moved on to the Camden Yards baseball stadium, an hour before the scheduled start of a Baltimore Orioles-Boston Red Sox game.\n\nLive images from local television news helicopters showed a youthful crowd hurling soda bottles and trash cans at police officers alongside the Sports Legends museum and Camden Yards ticket booths.\n\n\u201cProtesters are now breaking windows and throwing items at us,\u201d the Baltimore police department confirmed on its Twitter feed. \u201cWe are asking everyone to remain peaceful.\u201d\n\nOthers were seen smashing shop windows and blocked intersections, with one motorist getting a rock through her car window, CBS affiliate WBAL reported.\n\nFive police cars were seen by an AFP photographer getting their windows smashed, before riot police moved in.\n\nTensions have been simmering in the blue-collar Mid-Atlantic port city of 620,000 as investigators try to establish the circumstances that led to Gray\u2019s death.\n\nSpeakers at the city hall rally called for President Barack Obama to launch a national inquiry into police misconduct, following a series of fatal confrontations between white police officers and African-American men and boys.\n\n\u201cIt has to stop. It really has to stop because it could have been any one of us,\u201d a young male adult member of Gray\u2019s extended family told the crowd.\n\nIn a press conference Friday, officials acknowledged Gray should have received medical help at the moment of his arrest, when he was seen by bystanders \u2014 and caught on video \u2014 howling in apparent pain.\n\nThey also revealed that Gray, contrary to police department policy, was not buckled into his seat in the van, which made at least three unexplained stops on its way to the Western District police station.\n\nGray died Sunday with 80 percent of his spine severed at the neck, lawyers for his family have said. His funeral is scheduled for Monday.\n\nSix officers have been suspended with pay as the police investigation inches closer to a May 1 deadline to submit findings to a Maryland state prosecutor, who could decide to press charges.\n\nGray\u2019s death is the latest in a string of high-profile confrontations between African Americans and police, including the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown in August in the St Louis. suburb of Ferguson.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baltimore (AFP) -- Protesters smashed police cars and shop windows in downtown Baltimore on Saturday when the biggest demonstration over the death of a young African-American man in police custody turned violent.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Baltimore (AFP) -- Protesters smashed police cars and shop windows in downtown Baltimore on Saturday when the biggest demonstration over the death of a young African-American man in police custody turned violent.", "title": "1,000 Black Baltimore Rioters Smash Police Cars, Local Businesses in Frenzied Protest", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 958, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/AFP-Baltimore.jpg", "height": 632}, "updated_time": "2015-04-25T20:20:14-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/25/1000-black-baltimore-rioters-smash-police-cars-in-frenzied-protest/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Baltimore (AFP) -- Protesters smashed police cars and shop windows in downtown Baltimore on Saturday when the biggest demonstration over the death of a young African-American man in police custody turned violent.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/AFP-Baltimore.jpg", "title": "1,000 Black Baltimore Rioters Smash Police Cars, Local Businesses in Frenzied Protest", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "anti-police, Crime, Riots,Big Government, Racism,baltimore", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-04-25T16:34:57-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-04-25T20:20:14-07:00", "tag": "Riots", "categories": "Big Government,Racism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c22\"", "article_summary": "No one is allowed to leave Oriole Park at Camden Yards.\nLive images from local television news helicopters showed a youthful crowd hurling soda bottles and trash cans at police officers alongside the Sports Legends museum and Camden Yards ticket booths.\n\u201cProtesters are now breaking windows and throwing items at us,\u201d the Baltimore police department confirmed on its Twitter feed.\nBut the mood shifted dramatically when several scores of protesters moved on to the Camden Yards baseball stadium, an hour before the scheduled start of a Baltimore Orioles-Boston Red Sox game.\nFive police cars were seen by an AFP photographer getting their windows smashed, before riot police moved in."}
