They\u2019re calling their combined campaign the Alaska First Unity ticket. The pair announced their decision at a packed press conference Monday afternoon. Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell approved the ballot change late in the afternoon.\n\nDownload Audio\n\nWalker agreed to drop his Republican affiliation to run for governor with Democrat Byron Mallott as his running mate. Walker previously ran as an Independent. Both Hollis French and Craig Fleener, who were candidates for lieutenant governor, will step aside.\n\nMallott said it was not an easy choice to make, but he didn\u2019t think either of them could beat Parnell on his own. Mallott said he does not feel like he\u2019s abandoning the people who voted for him in the primary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard in political life to ask for this because of recent \u2014 of a long history. But we\u2019re trying to change that! And I ask you to trust me. Look at my record. Look at what I say. At the actions I take. I cannot do anything more,\u201d Mallott told the crowd.\n\nThe pair\u2019s main message is that they are working together to build Alaska and to go against partisan politics. \u201cOur vision for Alaska was part of the problem in the campaign,\u201d Mallott said. \u201cThey overlapped so much that there was little differentiation between us.\u201d\n\nWalker said he is still socially conservative, but they are not running the campaign on social issues. Instead they have agreed to focus on improving the economy and the education system. He said one way to do that is to actually decide which mega-projects the State wants to complete, like the Alaska LNG Project.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop doing some of the crazy studies we do. We spend billions of dollars on studies and we don\u2019t actually do something. We just study the studies of the studies. We need to decide to what we can do, what we\u2019re going to do, and we can do it and stop studying everything else.\u201d\n\nWalker said he does not have other specific ideas for budget cuts. He assured the group that Mallott would be an active part of the decision making process and would have a place in the governor\u2019s office if they win, not next door.\n\nLuke Miller with the Parnell campaign said they are not surprised by the move. \u201cThey\u2019re both \u2014 the way we see it \u2014 two peas in a pod. They\u2019ve both supported these liberal Obama policies in Alaska, whether it\u2019s expanding Obamacare, raising taxes, or growing government.\u201d\n\nMiller says the Parnell campaign is still waiting to hear specifics from the new Unity Ticket on their actual policy proposals.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Alaska Public Media", "description": "The Bill Walker and Byron Mallott campaigns have joined forces to defeat Governor Sean Parnell in November.
