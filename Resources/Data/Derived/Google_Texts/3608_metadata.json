(AP/WSAZ) - About 800 state workers in Kentucky will get a raise after Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear decided to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour.\n\nThe increase affects only workers in the executive branch of state government and will cost taxpayers about $1.6 million. The current minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. Tipped workers in state parks will be paid $4.90 per hour, up from the current $2.19 per hour.\n\nPrivate companies with state service contracts will have to pay their workers at least $10.10 per hour. But that won't take effect until the current contracts come up for renewal.\n\nBeshear said about a third of the affected employees work in state nursing homes caring for military veterans. Most of the other affected workers work in behavioral health centers and state parks.\n\nFollowing Monday's announcement, Jeff Hoover, the Kentucky House Minority Floor Leader, released this statement about the wage increases:\n\n\u201cToday Governor Beshear is taking a page out of the Obama administration\u2019s playbook by forcing through failed legislation by executive action. It seems Governor Beshear apparently now understands he doesn\u2019t have to pass another budget and feels comfortable in adding to the strain on Kentucky\u2019s finances.\n\nThe expansion of Obamacare in our Commonwealth along with the unfunded liability in the teachers\u2019 retirement system will increase the budgetary structural imbalance in excess of $250 million, which the General Assembly will have to address immediately. Today\u2019s action will have repercussions long after Governor Beshear has left office.\n\nNow may not be the time to place a recurring cost on top of the obligations we already have in our budget. We will delve into the specifics of the executive order, and then consider them along with the other commitments that need to be addressed during the normal budget negotiations in the 2016 Regular Session of the General Assembly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The increase affects only workers in the executive branch of state government and will cost taxpayers about $1.6 million.", "language": "english", "author": "WSAZ News Staff/Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.wsaz.com/home/headlines/Ky-Governor-Announces-Pay-Increases-For-Some-State-Workers-306522321.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/money165.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The increase affects only workers in the executive branch of state government and will cost taxpayers about $1.6 million.", "title": "Ky.
