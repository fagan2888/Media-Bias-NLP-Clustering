But in a clarification issued in early November, the federal government appears to have taken a stand against that strategy.\n\nThere had been little doubt among most lawyers who follow the tax implications of the Affordable Care Act that a company would not be able to subsidize its employees\u2019 individual health insurance with pretax dollars (the way that premiums for group health insurance are excluded from an employee\u2019s income). But as we reported a few weeks ago, the government\u2019s guidance on using post-tax compensation was murkier. With its recent statement, the government removed some \u2014 though not all \u2014 of that ambiguity.\n\nThe additional clarity came in the form of a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d document issued by the Department of Labor. Even now, however, the issues remain complex and open to interpretation, and the tax and benefits lawyers contacted by You\u2019re the Boss offered differing perspectives on the Labor Department\u2019s answers. What better way to try to make sense of these issues than to borrow a trope from the government and present them in the form of an FAQ.\n\nQ.\n\nSo, can a company reimburse workers for their insurance premiums with after-tax money?\n\nA.\n\nNo. Any reimbursement scheme constitutes a group health plan, according to the Labor Department. This designation is important, because the government had already decided that a group health plan must comply with certain market reforms in the Affordable Care Act, including one that bans dollar limits for certain benefits. And a plan that reimburses members for individual policies simply cannot comply with those requirements, according to the agencies.\n\nBusinesses with plans that violate the health law\u2019s market rules can face penalties of up to $36,500 a year for each affected employee.\n\nUp until now, there had been a debate among lawyers about whether a company could expressly reimburse individual insurance premiums with taxable income, or, if not, condition the additional compensation on buying insurance \u2014 even if the money is not tied directly to the cost of premiums. But the latest advice from the Labor Department should end those arguments, according to four of five lawyers contacted by You\u2019re the Boss.\n\n\u201cWhat we know now is that you can\u2019t condition the receipt of after-tax money only on the purchase of insurance,\u201d said Christopher E. Condeluci, a Washington-based lawyer. \u201cInstead, you have to give the employee the choice between taking the money as cash wages or allocating that money toward the purchase of insurance.\u201d\n\nThe one lawyer we talked to who disagreed is Seth Perretta, who represents a number of large business organizations with a stake in the various rule-makings of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI can condition employment on all sorts of things,\u201d Mr. Perretta said. \u201cI can condition a subset of compensation on all sorts of things, on the employee doing lawful acts. I think it really turns on whether the regulators would agree that so long as the amount I\u2019m paying to you is not directly related to the amount you pay for insurance, whether or not disconnecting the two would allow me to treat that as a taxable wage.\u201d Even Mr. Perretta said the answer was still not clear.\n\nQ.\n\nSuppose an owner just gives raises and doesn\u2019t specifically reimburse premiums? Can the owner tailor the amount of additional compensation for each person to the cost of health insurance without crossing the line into reimbursement?\n\nA.\n\nYes, at least if the owner gives the raise unconditionally. (Mr. Perretta said it was unclear whether correlating a conditional raise would be permissible because \u201cwe are in uncharted territory.\u201d) For example, the raises could follow the government\u2019s age curve that sets the relative cost for premiums in the individual market. \u201cEmployee pay rates and raises are subject to various employment non-discrimination rules but, other than that, employers have wide discretion in setting pay,\u201d said Linda Mendel, a lawyer in Columbus, Ohio. It is not illegal, by the way, to discriminate in favor of older workers.\n\nQ.\n\nWhat about Zane Benefits, which is promoting a plan it says allows companies to reimburse employees who buy individual insurance with pre-tax dollars \u2014 and even lets lower paid employees who qualify claim federal subsidies when they buy their insurance on the exchanges. How is this possible?\n\nA.\n\nIt is not, at least according to federal regulators. The recent guidance did not mention Zane by name, but it referred to the type of plan it uses (a Section 105 plan, after that section of the tax code) and said that it, like other reimbursement plans, was subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance market reforms but cannot comply with them because of the reimbursement mechanism. Moreover, the Labor Department declared, \u201cemployees participating in such arrangements are ineligible for premium tax credits (or cost-sharing reductions) for Marketplace coverage.\u201d\n\nZane, for its part, published its own FAQ in response to the Department of Labor FAQ. In it, Zane insisted that its plan complies with the health law and that businesses that use it can rest assured that their employees can qualify for exchange subsidies. \u201cThis is nothing new,\u201d Rick Lindquist, Zane\u2019s president, wrote in an email about the Labor Department\u2019s guidance.\n\nAll of the lawyers we\u2019ve talked to disagree with Zane\u2019s legal reasoning, but until one side or the other forces a resolution of the issue, it will be Zane\u2019s word against the government\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141118143058, "BN": "boss", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "boss", "hdl_p": "More Clarity on Health Care", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 18, 2014", "org": "Labor Department (US);Zane Benefits Inc", "keywords": "Corporate Taxes,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Labor and Jobs,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Regulation and Deregulation of Industry,Small Business,Wages and Salaries,Labor Department (US),Zane Benefits Inc,The Agenda", "GBLC": "The Agenda", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/boss/Regulators Warn Against Reimbursing Employees for Health Premiums ( 20141118 )", "description": "Even now, however, the issues remain complex and open to interpretation.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Robb Mandelbaum", "SCG": "boss", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Robb Mandelbaum", "byl": "Robb Mandelbaum", "twitter": {"url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/regulators-warn-against-reimbursing-employees-for-health-premiums/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "Even now, however, the issues remain complex and open to interpretation.", "card": "summary", "title": "Regulators Warn Against Reimbursing Employees for Health Premiums"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/boss/post", "news_keywords": "Corporate tax,Health Insurance,Jobs,Labor Department,Obamacare;Affordable Care Act,Regulation and Deregulation,Small business,Wages and salaries,Zane Benefits", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 18, 2014", "article": {"tag": "The Agenda", "published_time": 1416339058, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-11-18T19:30:58-05:00"}, "utime": 20141118193058, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141118, "pdate": 20141118, "des": "Corporate Taxes;Health Insurance and Managed Care;Labor and Jobs;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Regulation and Deregulation of Industry;Small Business;Wages and Salaries", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "You\u2019re the Boss Blog", "description": "Even now, however, the issues remain complex and open to interpretation.", "title": "Regulators Warn Against Reimbursing Employees for Health Premiums", "url": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/regulators-warn-against-reimbursing-employees-for-health-premiums/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/regulators-warn-against-reimbursing-employees-for-health-premiums/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Regulators Warn Against Reimbursing Employees for Health Premiums", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2190\"", "article_summary": "Can the owner tailor the amount of additional compensation for each person to the cost of health insurance without crossing the line into reimbursement?\nSo, can a company reimburse workers for their insurance premiums with after-tax money?\nAny reimbursement scheme constitutes a group health plan, according to the Labor Department.\nThere had been little doubt among most lawyers who follow the tax implications of the Affordable Care Act that a company would not be able to subsidize its employees\u2019 individual health insurance with pretax dollars (the way that premiums for group health insurance are excluded from an employee\u2019s income).\nBut the latest advice from the Labor Department should end those arguments, according to four of five lawyers contacted by You\u2019re the Boss."}
