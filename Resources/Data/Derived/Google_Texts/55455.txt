SANTA CLARA, Calif. — In Missy Franklin’s first big race as a professional swimmer, it wasn’t the former Regis Jesuit High School phenom touching the wall first.

Franklin, a four-time Olympic champion who signed a professional endorsement deal with Speedo this week, finished third in the 200-meter freestyle final on the opening day of a Pro Swim Series event, the last major tuneup before the world championships in Kazan, Russia, in August.

The Netherlands’ Femke Heemskerk won the race in 1 minute, 55.68 seconds, followed by Hungary’s Katinka Hosszu (1:56.88) and Franklin (1:57.02).

This is the first meet for Franklin since the NCAA championships in March, when she helped California win the team title.

Franklin, who recently returned to the Denver area to spend time with her family and train with her longtime club team coach, Todd Schmitz, finished eighth in the 50-meter backstroke, a non-Olympic event. Veteran Natalie Coughlin won that race while setting a U.S. record of 27.51 seconds.

Franklin has three events — the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes and the 100-meter freestyle — remaining at this meet, which runs through Sunday.

The other headliner at the Pro Swim Series event, 22-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps, finished third in the men’s 200-meter freestyle.

Connor Jaeger won the race in 1:48.66, followed by Nikita Lobinstev (1:48.86) of Russia and Phelps (1:49.03). The time for Phelps was nearly a second slower than the 1:48.20 mark he put up in the 200-meter final at the same meet last year.

Phelps will not compete at the world championships because of his DUI-related arrest last September.
