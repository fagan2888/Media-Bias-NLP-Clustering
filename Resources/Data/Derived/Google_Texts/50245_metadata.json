After his piece appeared, Seifi heard from doctors who said that they become more risk-averse and less frank when they see that a patient is taping a conversation.\n\n\u201cPhysicians take it as \u2018This patient might file a lawsuit later,\u2019 so they try not to be open to any complaints,\u201d Seifi says.\n\nRecording raises issues of trust for doctors as well as patients, especially if it\u2019s done surreptitiously. Seifi\u2019s interest in this issue began when he noticed a patient secretly recording their conversation. The message was clear, he says: \u201cThe patient doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201d\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s true. On the other hand, Elwyn says, his research has shown that doctors who agree to go on the record with advice can boost their patients\u2019 trust and strengthen their relationship. It takes confidence to grant permission, though. Even experienced, competent doctors may worry about subjecting their advice to scrutiny.\n\n\u201cHumans are fallible, and it\u2019s very difficult for doctors to stay on top of everything,\u201d Elwyn says. A doctor who misses the latest evidence or neglects to disclose a risk or side effect may be called out by a dissatisfied patient.\n\nWhen patients record, doctors may feel an added pressure to stay up-to-date and to give extra care and attention to what they\u2019re saying.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not argument for not doing it \u2014 it just means that doctors have to be on their game,\u201d Elwyn says.\n\nDespite doctors\u2019 hesitation, Elwyn says that recording has important benefits for patients. Retaining all the information conveyed during a visit can be difficult \u2014 especially if the medical condition is complex \u2014 and patients and families value an audible record, Elwyn says, because it allows them to share and reflect on what has been said.\n\nGiven these benefits, it\u2019s not surprising that some patients are covertly recording, as Elwyn describes in a study in the journal PLOS One.\n\nSometimes patients come away from a visit with different interpretations of what the doctor said, and reviewing the conversation would help them clarify what went on.\n\nSeifi generally grants his patients and their families permission to record, but he says intent is important: \u201cAre they doing it to help the family or to give them material for a lawsuit?\u201d\n\nPatients in most places have a right to record even without a doctor\u2019s consent. Only 12 states \u2014 including Florida \u2014 require permission from all parties for audio recordings.\n\nDoctors worry about a recording that gets shared with a wider audience or goes viral on the Internet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate concern: What happens to the recording after the visit?\u201d Elwyn says. \u201cThis is virgin territory.\u201d\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act grants privacy protection to patient records, but Seifi says that once a recording is made, it may be hard to ensure that it remains private.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s lacking here is a policy that says we encourage you to record, but please take good care of this record \u2014 we don\u2019t want it to appear on the Internet or social media,\u201d Elwyn says.\n\nSuch policies may be coming, but for now there are few rules in place.\n\n\u2013 Christie Aschwanden, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2012/02/doctor-patient-418x250-e1432643931256.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbf1f\"", "article_summary": "A: The question of when or whether patients should record physician visits has become a highly contentious issue in medicine.\nWhen patients record, doctors may feel an added pressure to stay up-to-date and to give extra care and attention to what they\u2019re saying.\nOn the other hand, Elwyn says, his research has shown that doctors who agree to go on the record with advice can boost their patients\u2019 trust and strengthen their relationship.\nRecording raises issues of trust for doctors as well as patients, especially if it\u2019s done surreptitiously.\nGiven these benefits, it\u2019s not surprising that some patients are covertly recording, as Elwyn describes in a study in the journal PLOS One."}
