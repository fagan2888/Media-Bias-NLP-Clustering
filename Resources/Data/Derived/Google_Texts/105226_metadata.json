Instead, they can go to a local pharmacy and ask a pharmacist for the contraceptive.\n\nDr. Alison Block, a family medicine physician in northern California and member of Physicians for Reproductive Health, explained to Elite Daily it\u2019s not technically over-the-counter birth control. You still have to go to the pharmacist, ask for it and fill out a basic checklist.\n\nNow, birth control pills, the patch, the ring and Depo-Provera injections are available without a prescription in California. Other forms of contraceptives like the IUD and implant, which need to be put into the body, still need to be obtained from a doctor.\n\nThis is a major move by California legislators to help increase access to contraceptives.\n\nGetting a prescription from a doctor can be difficult for many women. This is especially true for young women and women who live in underserved areas. Block said:\n\nIt\u2019s removing a significant number of those barriers.\n\nThis new law is extra helpful for women seeking combined hormonal forms of contraceptives, like the pill. Some women may not be good candidates for long-acting reversible contraceptives for a number of reasons, and this will help serve them as well.\n\nAs Block explained, women can still go to a doctor, talk about the various options and get a prescription. Women are not discouraged from going to their doctors \u2014 they\u2019re just now offered a new option. Block said:\n\nI think it definitely vastly increases access.\n\nWhen similar laws were proposed in other states, there were concerns that making birth control over-the-counter would disqualify it from being covered by insurance and make it more difficult to obtain.\n\nBut with the law in California, where it\u2019s not technically over-the-counter, birth control is still covered by insurance. Block said:\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all prescriptions for birth control are covered under insurance, regardless of whether that prescription is provided by a physician or a pharmacist. Ultimately, the best access would be if these methods were available truly over-the-counter rather than behind the counter with the pharmacist, but that would pose unique challenges for insurance coverage. This service allows all birth control methods to be covered by insurance, just as they are when prescribed in the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThis is great news for many California women, who now have more power to make important planning decisions about their lives and their bodies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is great news for women in this state, who now have more freedom to make important decisions about their lives and their bodies.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "description": "This is great news for women.", "title": "You Can Now Start Getting Birth Control At Pharmacies In This State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2016/04/14141029/birth-control-caifornia.jpg", "url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/birth-control-california-law-pharmacy/1461351/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Elite Daily", "description": "This is great news for women.", "title": "You Can Now Start Getting Birth Control At Pharmacies In This State", "image": {"src": "http://cdn29.elitedaily.com/content/uploads/2016/04/14141029/birth-control-caifornia.jpg"}, "creator": "@asvokos", "site": "@EliteDaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/birth-control-california-law-pharmacy/1461351/"}, "ios": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/birth-control-california-law-pharmacy/1461351/", "app_store_id": 1032458504, "app_name": "Elite Daily"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 378366428966386}, "keywords": "birth control california,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily", "section": "News", "tag": "Birth Control,birth control california", "published_time": "2016-04-14T17:00:32+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/asvokos"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.elitestatic.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/apple_favicon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "birth control california,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fee\"", "article_summary": "Women in California can now pick up birth control at their local pharmacies without a doctor\u2019s prescription.\nThis means women won\u2019t need to go to a doctor to get a prescription for birth control.\nBut with the law in California, where it\u2019s not technically over-the-counter, birth control is still covered by insurance.\nThis service allows all birth control methods to be covered by insurance, just as they are when prescribed in the doctor\u2019s office.\nNow, birth control pills, the patch, the ring and Depo-Provera injections are available without a prescription in California."}
