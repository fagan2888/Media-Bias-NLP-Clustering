The "Social Circle" is a group effort between readers, social networkers and the OnMilwaukee.com editors. Every Monday, we ask a question via Facebook and Twitter and then post the responses from our Facebook "likers" and Twitter followers in this column. Well-known Milwaukee movers and shakers will contribute, too.

It's back-to-school time for lots of Milwaukeeans young and not so young, so this week, OnMilwaukee.com waxes nostalgic, asking Social Circle members what adorned their folders, notebooks or Trapper Keepers back in the day.

At least one of the OnMilwaukee.com editors admitted to unicorns.

Desiree Casberg: "Lisa Frank's animal cuteness was all over my folders, notebooks and Trapper Keeper."

Kat Froelich: "I wanted to be a graffiti artist, so I perfected my ideas on all my notebooks."

Fred Gillich: "Led Zeppelin, Yes, AC/DC, Jane's Addiction, Foghat, April Wine, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, RUSH."

Alissa Gonyea: "Fluffy kittens."

Lisa Gutowski: "Lisa Frank, yo."

Jessica Heese: "Any melodramatic and 'real' lyrics that truly expressed my heartfelt teenage angst."

Erin Shea Linnane: "Grade school was all about the scratch-and-sniff stickers and 'The Outsiders' and high school was doodles and song lyrics."

Ed Makowski: "Lasers and stealth bombers. An interesting observation in how we're gender trained from early childhood."

Hannah Medrow: "Peace signs and Peter Max knock-off designs on folders (it was 1972) and believe it or not, the entire Desiderata printed on a three-ring binder."

Elizabeth Meinz: "Black Flag logo."

Lisa Nitsch: "Billy Idol and other bands."

Mary O'Connell: "Muppets."

Liana Odrcic: "I had a Mick Jagger notebook in fifth grade in 1978. I begged for it, and my mom reluctantly agreed. I got it at the Ben Franklin in my home town."

Maria Holden Raboin: "I perfected free handing the Nirvana font and the drunken happy face, then proceeded to deface every book cover / folder / binder I had."

Jason Roberts: "Jodie Foster's Army sticker. Always."

Anthony Ruppert: "My brother had a Transformers Trapper Keeper."

Dawn Suvagian: "The Osmonds and Partridge Family."

Amy Schneider: "Lisa Frank, unicorns, hearts and rainbows."

Jen Skladanek: "The Dead Kennedy's DK symbol, usually a pentagram or two and probably lots of skulls."

Lauryl Sulfate: "I always bought plain ones (classes were color-coded) and then doodled and wrote song lyrics all over them."

Mitchell Wakefield: "MW + whoever I was dating at the time. 2 lovers, 2-gether, 4-ever!"

Mike Walter: "Zebra stripes."

Ed Werstein: "I graduated from Howdy Doody to Roy Rogers in about the fourth grade.

I'm old."

Blaine Wesselowski: "Denim."

Carrie Ann Winiewski: "Care Bears in grade school but I was all about the primary colors in high school."

Cindi Wood: "Hearts and an alternate glam rock spelling of my name."

Tricia Vasquez Young: "My name in bubble letters and horse drawings."
