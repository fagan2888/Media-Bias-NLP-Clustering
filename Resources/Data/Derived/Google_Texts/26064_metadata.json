Trump; Biden\u2019s mini-Miami tour; Murphy gives back fraudsters contribs\n\nBy Marc Caputo (mcaputo@politico.com; @MarcACaputo) with Kristen East (keast@politico.com; @kristenicoleast)\n\nIt\u2019s mid-week, Florida Playbookers, just three more days and a bunch of fundraisers and stump speeches to go until the Labor Day weekend -- and the first real dose of college football. But before the play-calling on the gridiron starts, check out the games in Gov. Scott\u2019s administration.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nINSIDE THE SCOTT ADMINISTRATION SPIN MACHINE -- \u201cEmails: Scott\u2019s office scrubbed release that cleared Planned Parenthood,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Christine Sexton: Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s office scrubbed a press release written by his own regulators that found there was no \u201cmishandling of fetal remains\u201d at clinics run by Planned Parenthood and, at the same time, said it would refer doctors who worked at those clinics to the state Board of Medicine for possible disciplinary action. Amid an outcry over a series of videos filmed at Planned Parenthood clinics outside Florida, Scott ordered health care regulators to inspect 16 Florida clinics run by the organization. The regulators reported that three clinics performed unlicensed abortions and that one did not follow its own guidelines for disposing of fetal remains. http://politi.co/1Ex2NYP\n\nHECKUVA JOB, O\u2019CONNELL -- \u201cScott: Resigning Lottery secretary did a \u2018good job\u2019,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Dixon: Gov. Rick Scott ignored questions Tuesday about Florida Lottery Secretary Cynthia O\u2019Connell, who isresigningafterreportsabout missed work and excessive travel bills. \u201cCynthia did a good job,\u201d Scott said after a Cabinet meeting in St. Augustine. \u201cWe had record sales, which means we increased the amount of dollars to give to education.\u201d http://politi.co/1L19eQY\n\nPRISON SECRECY \u2013 \u201cMiami Herald sues Florida corrections department over public records,\u201d by The Miami Herald\u2019s Julie Brown: \u201cThe Miami Herald has filed a lawsuit against the Florida Department of Corrections, alleging that the agency has violated the state\u2019s open record laws by withholding information about suspicious deaths and possible sexual and physical assaults of inmates at the hands of corrections officers in the state prison system. For more than a year, the Herald has been examining cases of physical, mental and sexual abuse of inmates, as well as a series of inmate deaths that have happened in state prisons that have had a history of violence. In some cases, the prison system failed to contact outside law enforcement agencies, allowing its own staff to conduct the investigations. In some cases, both inmates and DOC investigators have alleged the agency systemically covers up corruption and wrongdoing.\u201d http://bit.ly/1KpGnLN\n\nCO\u00d1O! -- \u201cBush rips Trump in Spanish and English,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo: \u201cHe attacks me every day \u2014 he personalizes everything,\u201d Bush said to a Spanish-language reporter, in a sign that Trump\u2019s criticisms of his vigor are getting to the former Florida governor. \u201cIf you\u2019re not totally in agreement with him, you\u2019re an \u2018idiot,\u2019 you\u2019re \u2018stupid,\u2019 you have \u2018low energy,\u2019 blah, blah, blah. That\u2019s what he does.\u201d\u2026\n\nEarlier in the day, Bush\u2019s campaign released a web-ad video mash-up of Trump over the years praising universal health care and Hillary Clinton, and saying at one point that he\u2019s more of a Democrat. The ad and Bush\u2019s aggressive posture at the press conference Tuesday are part of a strategy to help make the presidential contest a two-man race with Trump. Bush\u2019s effort has yet to pay dividends. He has fallen in Republican polls of the nation, Iowa and New Hampshire while Dr. Ben Carson, a nonpolitician like Trump, has risen to the No. 2 slot nationally and in Iowa. A third nonpolitician in the Republican field, Carly Fiorina, is also rising.\n\nIn a national Republican voter survey Monday from Public Policy Polling, the three nonpoliticians were beating the politicians 52-45 percent, with 3 percent undecided. In PPP\u2019s survey last week of New Hampshire, the nonpoliticians led 51-45 percent, with 4 percent undecided. And in a Monday Iowa poll from Monmouth University, it was 56-39 percent, with 5 percent undecided. http://politi.co/1JKmHM1\n\n-- @PatriciaMazzei: \u201cJeb Bush on Donald Trump: \u2018El hombre no es conservador.\u2019\u201d http://hrld.us/1N0Pkdp\n\n-- \u201cJeb Bush: The man who killed Trump\u2019s casino dreams,\u201d by CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond: \u201cDonald Trump openly boasts that he donates to politicians so he can exact favors from them after they reach office. He did so for Jeb Bush in 1998, holding a high-dollar fundraiser for the gubernatorial candidate in Trump Tower and shelling out $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party. But when Bush took office in 1999, Trump didn\u2019t get the political help he needed to make his casino dreams a reality in the Sunshine State. Instead, Bush maintained his hardline stance against gambling in the state, delivering a death blow to Trump\u2019s hopes of building out a multi-million dollar casino endeavor with the Seminole Tribe of Florida and prompting him to abandon those plans.\u201d http://cnn.it/1Q7MIu0\n\nANCHOR BABY QUESTIONS? AWAY! -- \u201cJeb Bush\u2019s testy \u2018anchor babies\u2019 exchange,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Marc Caputo: Jeb Bush and his campaign say they're willing to talk about Donald Trump, to a point. During a press availability Monday, the former Florida governor indicated he would \u201clove\u201d to change the subject. But his love quickly faded when asked about his take on the term \u201canchor babies.\u201d Here\u2019s an exchange between Bush and POLITICO.\n\nQuestion: \u201cWhen you headed the Hispanic Leadership Network in 2013, you guys told people not to use the phrase \u2018anchor baby,\u2019 and now you say it\u2019s not offensive and I was wondering \u2026\u201d\n\nBush: \u201cIt\u2019s been used a long time. I wasn\u2019t aware of that memo. I was a volunteer, co-chairman. Look, we can be politically correct about these things. Here\u2019s my record: I think that birthright citizenship is embedded in the Constitution of the United States. I\u2019ve consistently said that. So what\u2019s your question?\" http://politi.co/1NLfp1t\n\nJEB V. BDB -- \u201cJeb Bush knocks de Blasio again, this time on charters,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Eliza Shapiro: Republican presidential candidate and former Florida governor Jeb Bush criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio for the second time in as many weeks on Tuesday, citing the New York City mayor\u2019s record on charter schools. \u201c[Hillary] Clinton ally Bill de Blasio has succeeded in transforming the city into a downright hostile environment for charter schools, where more than 43,000 students now remain on waiting lists for them,\u201d Bush wrote in an op-ed about parent choice posted on TownHall.com. http://politi.co/1NVxBEM\n\nTESTING WARS \u2013 \u201cSchool leaders insist test scores are not accurate,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Jessica Bakeman: \u201cSchool district superintendents throughout Florida are challenging the Scott administration's interpretation of a third-party report on Tuesday that analyzed the results of new state exams. As far as the superintendents are concerned, the results aren\u2019t accurate and shouldn\u2019t be used to grade students or evaluate teachers and schools, despite the Department of Education\u2019s assertions otherwise. The superintendents are lobbying the state to exclude the test scores as a factor in assigning school grades, which are on an \u2018A\u2019 to \u2018F\u2019 scale, for at least this year, and some are also pushing to hold teachers harmless from the test scores. The report, which was ordered by Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature and performed by Alpine Testing Solutions and edCount LLC under a $594,000 contract, contains specific criticisms of the exams, which the superintendents argue support their conclusions, not the department\u2019s.\u201d http://politi.co/1LSJpZ4\n\n--Earlier on Tuesday, education commissioner Pam Stewarttouted the report's overall conclusion that the tests' results were valid in aggregate and could be used to evaluate teachers and grade schools. \u201cI believe it is in the best interest of our students that we move forward based on the results of this year\u2019s FSA, and I am pleased that the report supports that,\u201d she said. \u201cNow all Floridians can share my confidence in the FSA.\u201d More, from Bakeman: http://politi.co/1O5XtMc\n\n-- Here's the report: http://bit.ly/1NUYwRc\n\nBIDEN TIME -- Vice President Joe Biden speaks today at Miami Dade College about \u201cthe importance of helping Americans go to college and the critical role that partnerships between colleges like MDC and employers play in helping Americans obtain the skills they need to succeed in the workforce, especially in the STEM areas,\u201d a press release says. If this sounds campaign-y to you, well, you\u2019re not alone. Biden then hits up a 6:30 p.m. Democratic senatorial fundraiser at the home of donor Steve Bittel. And Sen. Ted Cruz has his first Florida fundraiser at one of the Falic family homes in Bal Harbour this evening. Jeb held a Friday fundraiser and a Tuesday event in Miami.\n\nNOT MEDICAL MARIJUANA PUSH-- \u201cGroup seeks to legalize marijuana in Florida,\u201d by Orlando Sentinel\u2019s Scott Powers: \u201cPetitions are hitting the streets soon for a new proposed constitutional amendment that would fully legalize marijuana use, possession and cultivation by adults in Florida. A political action committee called Floridians For Freedom, associated with a longtime marijuana advocacy group called the Florida Cannabis Action Network, announced Tuesday it has gotten state approval to begin seeking signatures to get their measure on the November, 2016, ballot. The measure is distinct from another constitutional drive, run by United For Care and led by Orlando lawyer John Morgan, because Morgan's group wants to legalize marijuana for medical purposes only, while Floridians For Freedom wants it legalized for all uses.\u201d http://bit.ly/1VuHLhX\n\nMEDICAL MARIJUANA CHANGE -- \u201cCongress quietly ends federal government\u2019s ban on medical marijuana,\u201d by The LA Times\u2019 Evan Halper: \u201cThe bill\u2019s passage over the weekend marks the first time Congress has approved nationally significant legislation backed by legalization advocates. It brings almost to a close two decades of tension between the states and Washington over medical use of marijuana. Under the provision, states where medical pot is legal would no longer need to worry about federal drug agents raiding retail operations. Agents would be prohibited from doing so.\u201d http://lat.ms/1GLGI3V\n\nCABINET UPDATE -- \u201cScott, cabinet update land buy list as environmental fight looms,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Dixon:http://politi.co/1hvEShM\n\nLATVALA IN A LATHER -- \u201cJack Latvala: How dare anyone question my GOP loyalty,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Adam C. Smith: \u201cState Sen. Joe Negron may have declared victory in his campaign for Florida Senate president, but \u2026 Sen. Jack Latvala \u2026 is still campaigning for the job. And with Negron supporters spreading the word that Latvala could even strike a deal with Democrats to win the post, the Pinellas Republican noted that he has been working to elect Republicans for 46 years. \u2018I love my Republican party,\u2019 he told the crowd at the Carillon Hilton. \u2018I have never been anything but a Republican.\u2019 That was a veiled swipe at Negron, who used to be Martin County Democratic Chairman and once ran unsuccessfully for the Florida House as a Democrat.\u201d http://bit.ly/1EwAFVT\n\nDEPT. OF CORRECTIONS \u2013 Yesterday\u2019s story on this topic, and the Florida Playbook mention of it, incorrectly described Senate Republican leader Bill Galvano as neutral in the race. He backs Negron. (story here http://politi.co/1VtquFR). Separately, I learned yesterday that possible CD-6 candidate Brandon Patty is 33. His age was wrong in the Friday Florida Playbook.\n\nRUBIO: ABOLISH DOE -- \u201cIn Nevada, Marco Rubio says U.S. education department is unnecessary,\u201d by AP: \u201cWhat starts out as a suggestion ends up being, \u2018If you want money from us, you must to do it this way,\u2019 and you will end up with a version of a national school board,\" Rubio said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a national school board.\u201d http://bit.ly/1JAb4u5\n\n-- \u201cUS presidential hopeful Marco Rubio to visit Puerto Rico,\u201d by AP\u2019s Danica Coto: http://apne.ws/1O6sSy5 (Note: Florida Playbook told you first, Friday http://politi.co/1hSt1uY)\n\n--RUBIO\u2019S PR FUNDRAISER hosts: Bertica Cabrera Morris, Maita Carbonell, Jorge Del R\u00edo, Jos\u00e9 Fuentes, Art Garffer, Jos\u00e9 R.

Richard Corcoran of Wesley Chapel; state Sen. Joe Negron of Stuart; State Sen. Rob Bradley of Orange Park; state Rep. Dana Young of Tampa; U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney of Okeechobee. We've also heard Buzz about state Rep.

The email exchange was from her tenure as Secretary of State, when she was using a private home server to discuss official business with then-Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, Richard Verma \u2026 about a \u2018hold\u2019 placed by then-U.S. Senator George LeMieux (R-FL) on President Obama\u2019s nominee to be Ambassador to Brazil, Tom Shannon.\n\n\u201cWhat took them so long [to lift the hold]? Did you promise your first born?\u201d Clinton writes.\n\nVerma\u2019s reply: \u201cYes, I sold my soul to George Lemieux today. I am not proud of it.\u201d\n\nClinton: \u201cDoes this mean you have to go to Cuba and arrest Castro or just shovel more $ into Little Havana?\u201d http://bit.ly/1LSEG9O\n\n-- \u201cClinton emails show interest in Florida,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Alex Leary: http://bit.ly/1EAqCze\n\n--\u201cSt. Petersburg pushes for Cuban consulate,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Charlie Frago: http://bit.ly/1LJ1aHq\n\nSOBEL\u2019S CHOICE -- \u201cWill Senator Eleanor Sobel run for Hollywood mayor?\u201d by Miami Herald\u2019s Amy Sherman: \u201cSobel says she will delay a decision about whether to run until March\u201d http://bit.ly/1NV7dLp\n\nNATION, WE CAN HEAL -- \u201cHulk Hogan seeks forgiveness, says he\u2019s not a racist,\u201d by The Tampa Tribune: \u201cA month after Hulk Hogan was fired by World Wrestling Entertainment following the leak of a racist rant from a video tape in 2006, he asked his fans for forgiveness today while attributing the offensive word heard on video to growing up in a \u2018rough\u2019 South Tampa neighborhood.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Iz0Vd8\n\n-- \u201cMan shot by deputy at WWE center remains in hospital,\u201d by AP\u2019s Kyle Hightower: \u201cA man shot by a sheriff's deputy while stalking a female wrestler outside a World Wrestling Entertainment training facility in central Florida remains hospitalized, authorities said Tuesday.

On Monday, Michael Cox and Gonzalo DeRamon, co-founders of the Biscayne Housing Group, consummated plea deals in Miami federal court. They now stand convicted of conspiring with the top two principals of the Carlisle Development Group \u2014 once the state\u2019s biggest affordable housing developer \u2014 as well as two South Florida contractors who already pleaded guilty \u2026 On Friday, Matthew Greer, 37, the onetime chief executive officer of Miami-based Carlisle, and the company\u2019s co-founder, Lloyd Boggio, 69, are planning to plead guilty to two conspiracy offenses, according to court records.

And we have a winner: Rep. Patrick Murphy, Senate candidate and son of a builder, who collected $6,000 from Boggio from 2011-2014, $250 from Cox in 2012; and $500 from Greer in 2011. Solution: donate an equivalent amount to charity as a giveback, the campaign said in a statement: \u201cWe decided to donate the contributions to a charity that focuses on affordable housing. That is the right thing to do.\u201d As the Murphy campaign was announcing the give-back, Grayson\u2019s campaign was demanding the congressman return \u201cthe dirty money.\u201d\n\nDISNEY-DUBAI? -- \u201cFlights start between Orlando and Dubai,\u201d by AP: \u201cThe first nonstop flight from Dubai by Emirates Airlines arrives Tuesday at Orlando International Airport.
