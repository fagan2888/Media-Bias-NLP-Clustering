The Kentucky senator, whose libertarian following allows him more latitude in defying traditional GOP orthodoxy, has been an outspoken advocate for softening drug laws, reforming the criminal justice system, and creating major tax breaks for areas in financial distress, like Detroit. He has also given high-profile speeches at black colleges.\n\nRather than seek out strategic fights with liberal black institutions to make a point, Paul\u2019s aides say he tries to get their input and look for areas where they can align. To help do that, he has enlisted Elroy Sailor, an influential Republican lobbyist and strategist, to set up roundtable conversations with black community leaders and business owners \u2014 most of them Democrats \u2014 in Detroit, Chicago, Atlanta, and Houston.\n\nSailor said Paul has plans to meet with the NAACP and the National Urban League in coming months.\n\nThe key difference between Paul\u2019s strategy and that of other Republicans, Sailor said, is that he isn\u2019t approaching the process of engaging with black leaders as \u201coutreach.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just think \u2018outreach\u2019 is a term for consultants,\u201d said Sailor. \u201cIt\u2019s a good term for politics. Outreach is \u2018OK, well, we got six black people today, and we want to get 12 black people next week.\u2019 It\u2019s a numbers game.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cDo you need the symbolism? Yes. Do you need to do the party to honor Black History Month? Do you need to respond when someone says something that is not in the best interest of one your minority constituencies? Do you need to do the Hispanic Heritage Month luncheon? Yes, of course. But if that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re setting yourself up for failure. You\u2019ve got to focus on solutions.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s approach has not been without missteps. He has expressed concern about how the Civil Rights Act curtails property rights. He has made his own problematic Obamacare\u2013slavery comparisons, a favorite Republican blunder. And when he made news earlier this month by urging his party to lay off its voter ID crusade, he was forced to walk it back days later. But there are signs that he\u2019s building goodwill among people of color: A poll released Saturday showed 29% of black voters in Kentucky would favor Paul over Hillary Clinton in a 2016 matchup. Such an outcome would represent the best showing of any Republican presidential candidate in decades.\n\n\u201cIf he runs in 2016, you might not see a lot of African-Americans switching over to becoming Republicans, but I think what you\u2019re going to see is a lot of Paul Democrats,\u201d said Sailor.\n\nNot everyone is so sure. Greg Carr, chair of Howard University\u2019s Afro-American studies department, credited Paul for giving a speech on his campus last year, but said he has a long way to go before he succeeds in changing students\u2019 minds about the GOP. \u201cA lot of them were asking, \u2018Is this the Republican Party of Frederick Douglass or Ronald Reagan?\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nCarr was also skeptical of the RNC\u2019s claim that their dustups with black media were meant to appeal to black voters.\n\n\u201cAs with any American political party apparatus, the RNC is in the business of winning elections and advancing their political agenda,\u201d Carr said. \u201cI think asking Ebony magazine or a black host on MSNBC to apologize would resonate with their party base long before it would do anything other than reinforce their image as a party hostile to non-whites.\u201d\n\nIf the party\u2019s goal really is to attract minority voters, Carr said, Republicans would do well to aim their umbrage at right-wing provocateurs like Rush Limbaugh for \u201ctheir consistent questioning of President Obama\u2019s bona fides as an American.\u201d Indeed, the GOP has had an uneven record in tamping down its bigot eruptions. Even after Donald Trump spent months trumpeting his birther conspiracy theories, Republican presidential candidates still lined up to kiss his ring and beg for his endorsement in 2012. And earlier this year, when Ted Nugent called Obama a \u201csubhuman mongrel,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz defended the conservative rock star\u2019s record of championing the Second Amendment, while gently distancing himself from the uncouth remarks. (Paul, by contrast, blasted Nugent.)\n\nRon Christie, a black Republican strategist and Fox News contributor, said that even if Republicans haven\u2019t landed on a unified message, people of color recognize the party is taking an interest in their vote for the first time in many years.\n\n\u201cI will tell you, from my television work, I have noticed in people of color who have stopped me on the street in recent months have said, \u2018You know, I still don\u2019t agree with you guys but you\u2019re really trying to get black voters to listen to you,\u2019\u201d Christie said. \u201cThe biggest mistake the party could make now is to say, \u2018We increased our number of black votes from 7% to 10% and now we\u2019re done! Mission accomplished.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTo use the old adage, actions speak louder than words. What we have done now is created an environment where people of color are willing to listen. Do we squander it by taking folks for granted or writing them off?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3252482, "userid": 233242}, "description": "The RNC picks fights with liberal media over race, while Rand Paul talks policy with black Democrats.
