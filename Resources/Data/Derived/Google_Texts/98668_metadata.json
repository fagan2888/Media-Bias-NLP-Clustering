Jay Nixon said he knows there isn\u2019t much he and Missouri lawmakers can agree on.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop Nixon from expounding upon what he considered universal legislative goals: good schools and individual opportunity, both of which he said would be championed in his budget proposal.\n\nThat budget, Nixon said, will increase funding for all levels of education \u2014 \u201cfrom preschool to graduate school\u201d \u2014 by $493 million, providing, for example, for the expansion of early childhood education and a tuition freeze for state universities, including MU.\n\nWithin those new funds lie $278 million to be used exclusively on K-12 classrooms, which Nixon said would allow for more classroom technology, smaller class sizes and better-prepared teachers.\n\nWith the new funding, Nixon pushed for schools to offer tougher classes, achieve higher test scores and maintain higher graduation rates. By the end of the decade, he said, two-thirds of all jobs will require college credentials.\n\nThe governor echoed a recent proposal by Sen. David Pearce, R-Warrensburg, which would put into place a performance-based model for state fund disbursement to institutions of higher education. Additional core funding, Nixon said, will require schools to meet specific goals.\n\n\u201cOur students have to compete worldwide,\u201d Nixon said, \u201cand they\u2019re going to have to raise their game.\u201d\n\nNixon justified his proposed investment with the story of Frank Fontana, a St. Louis optometrist. Fontana served in the Army during World War II, fighting fascism in the European Theater, and came home to something that was, Nixon said, far more precious \u2014 and patriotic \u2014 than a ticker-tape parade: the GI Bill, the post-war measure that allowed former servicemen to attend four-year schools at no cost to them.\n\n\u201cThe GI Bill gave Frank the opportunity to pursue his dreams, to support his family and become a great optometrist. I should know,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cHe was mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are excited that Gov. Nixon will be increasing funding for Bright Flight and higher education core funding for the University of Missouri System by $12 million,\u201d said Ben Levin, president of the Associated Students of the University of Missouri. \u201cWe will be working hard in the coming months to make sure that legislators in Jefferson City know how important higher education is to the economic health of our state.\u201d\n\nNixon\u2019s budget will also provide for the $20 million training of over 1,200 mental health professionals and reauthorize the Missouri Rx Plan for low-income seniors\u2019 prescriptions.\n\nAmong Nixon\u2019s non-budgetary goals are the passage of an LGBTQ non-discrimination act, the bond-funded rebuilding of the crumbling Fulton State Hospital, a revamp of last year\u2019s controversial redistricting of public schools and the reinstatement of strict campaign contribution limits.\n\nYet above all else, Nixon said, he supports the expansion of Medicaid in Missouri.\n\n\u201cSince New Year's Day, Missouri taxpayers have spent $115 million and counting \u2014 $5.47 million a day \u2014 to improve and reform health care in other states,\u201d Nixon said.\n\nNixon said $2 billion \u2014 or $500 for every Missouri taxpayer \u2014 goes toward other states\u2019 implementation of what Nixon called innovations, like rewarding patients for healthy lifestyle choices and penalizing them for missing doctors\u2019 appointments.\n\n\u201cAnd each day we don't act, nearly 300,000 working Missourians go another day without the treatment they desperately need, for no other reason than they live in Branson instead of Bentonville, in Cape Girardeau instead of Cairo, in Maryville instead of Muscatine,\u201d Nixon said.\n\nNixon went on to cite the problems with healthcare expansion under the federal Affordable Care Act to cheers from the Republican state legislators.\n\n\u201cBut rejecting Medicaid won't fix any of those things,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cIt won't keep Missourians from having to pay federal taxes, or exempt our businesses from new requirements under the law. Instead, by standing still, we're making the things we don't like about Obamacare even worse, forcing Missourians to bear all the costs of this law and reap none of the benefits.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themaneater.com/stories/2014/1/22/state-state-nixon-budget-back-education-health-car/", "image": "http://www.themaneater.com/media/2014/0124/graphics/preview016_jpg_900x600_q85.jpg", "description": "The governor\u2019s budget will earmark over half a billion additional funds for education alone.", "title": "State of the State: Nixon budget to back education, health care expansion"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.themaneater.com/media/2014/0124/graphics/preview016_jpg_500x500_q85.jpg", "site": {"id": 15441117}, "card": "summary"}, "description": "The governor\u2019s budget will earmark over half a billion additional funds for education alone.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14b3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSince New Year's Day, Missouri taxpayers have spent $115 million and counting \u2014 $5.47 million a day \u2014 to improve and reform health care in other states,\u201d Nixon said.\nWith the new funding, Nixon pushed for schools to offer tougher classes, achieve higher test scores and maintain higher graduation rates.\nAdditional core funding, Nixon said, will require schools to meet specific goals.\nNixon went on to cite the problems with healthcare expansion under the federal Affordable Care Act to cheers from the Republican state legislators.\nThat budget, Nixon said, will increase funding for all levels of education \u2014 \u201cfrom preschool to graduate school\u201d \u2014 by $493 million, providing, for example, for the expansion of early childhood education and a tuition freeze for state universities, including MU."}
