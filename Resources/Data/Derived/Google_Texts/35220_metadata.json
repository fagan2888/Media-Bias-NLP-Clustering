Some \u201cbronze\u201d-level plans, the lowest level of coverage, carry deductibles as high as $12,700 per year for a family of four.\n\nThe deductible is the amount a family or insured person must pay out of pocket before the health care plan kicks in. For a household with the country\u2019s median annual income \u2014 about $52,000 \u2014 such a hefty deductible may create an unhealthy incentive: skipping treatment and medication in order to keep out-of-pocket spending low.\n\nThe average individual deductible for a bronze plan is a whopping $5,081 per year, according to research provided to CBS MoneyWatch from HealthPocket, a technology company that ranks health care plans.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, that represents an increase of 40 percent from the average deductible for an individually purchased plan before the federal health care overhaul, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe math makes it clear that many middle-income families will be hit the hardest. That\u2019s because tax credits are only available for people earning up to four times the federal poverty level. In essence, individuals with annual income of more than $46,960 won\u2019t qualify for the subsidies. For families of four, the cut-off for tax credits is an annual income of about $94,000.\n\nIn Texas alone, that means nearly 1.1 million people who may seek health care coverage through Obamacare won\u2019t qualify for tax credits, or about one-third of the state\u2019s potential pool of customers, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nSome consumers are \u201cseeing sticker shock\" with the Obamacare plans, Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, told The Journal. \u201cOnce they start to use the policy, they will see a second sticker shock\" with the high deductibles, he added.\n\nTo be sure, plans with low or negligible deductibles are available, as long as consumers have the financial ability to pay higher monthly premiums.\n\nTake consumers living in Houston. For a family of four able to pay a monthly premium of $1,033 to buy the platinum-level plan \u2014 the highest available under the health care overhaul \u2014 they\u2019ll find no deductible at all, according to HealthCare.gov.\n\nBut that means shelling out almost $12,400 per year in monthly premiums, or about the same as the deductible for the bronze plans. Either way, families and individuals who don\u2019t qualify for tax credits may find Obamacare failing to deliver on its promise of affordable health care.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some health care plans carry deductibles so high that consumers may avoid treatment and medicine", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-deductibles-deliver-hefty-sticker-shock/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/05/8a1c2571-484c-4548-a182-81ada6926a24/thumbnail/1200x630/489402d8ad5ad082309efd92a261add3/healthcare_generic.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Some health care plans carry deductibles so high that consumers may avoid treatment and medicine", "title": "For some, Obamacare deductibles deliver sticker shock"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some health care plans carry deductibles so high that consumers may avoid treatment and medicine", "title": "For some, Obamacare deductibles deliver sticker shock", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-deductibles-deliver-hefty-sticker-shock/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-deductibles-deliver-hefty-sticker-shock/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-deductibles-deliver-hefty-sticker-shock/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbsmoneywatch", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/12/05/8a1c2571-484c-4548-a182-81ada6926a24/thumbnail/1200x630/489402d8ad5ad082309efd92a261add3/healthcare_generic.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obamacare-deductibles-deliver-hefty-sticker-shock/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/obamacare-deductibles-deliver-hefty-sticker-shock/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSMoneyWatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda880\"", "article_summary": "Either way, families and individuals who don\u2019t qualify for tax credits may find Obamacare failing to deliver on its promise of affordable health care.\nSome consumers are \u201cseeing sticker shock\" with the Obamacare plans, Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, told The Journal.\n\u201cOnce they start to use the policy, they will see a second sticker shock\" with the high deductibles, he added.\nThat\u2019s because tax credits are only available for people earning up to four times the federal poverty level.\nFor families of four, the cut-off for tax credits is an annual income of about $94,000."}
