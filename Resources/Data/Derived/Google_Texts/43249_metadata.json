Some research has shown that praying or believing in God could actually reduce stress.\n\nBut researchers at Baylor University \u2014 a private Christian school \u2014 have found an argument against this notion. Prayer is a complicated thing, after all, affecting everyone differently. The Baylor study was published in the journal Sociology of Religion and was funded by the John Templeton Foundation. It found that praying didn\u2019t have the same positive effect over everyone; in fact, this particular study showed that prayer even exacerbated anxiety-related disorders in some people instead of soothing them.\n\n\u201cFor many individuals, God is a major source of comfort and strength that makes the world seem less threatening and dangerous,\u201d Matt Bradshaw, an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cThrough prayer, individuals seek to develop an intimate relationship with God. Those who achieve this goal, and believe that God will be there to protect and support them during times of need, develop a secure attachment to God. In this context, prayer appears to confer emotional comfort, which results in fewer symptoms of anxiety-related disorders.\u201d\n\nOthers, however, glean something different from praying. People who have \u201cavoidant or insecure attachments to God\u201d \u2014 such as people who are agnostic, for example \u2014 may not feel totally comforted or confident that God \u201cwill be there for them when they need Him,\u201d Bradshaw continued. \u201cFor these individuals, prayer may feel like an unsuccessful attempt to cultivate and maintain an intimate relationship with God. Rejected, unanswered or otherwise unsuccessful experiences of prayer may be disturbing and debilitating \u2014 and may therefore lead to more frequent and severe symptoms of anxiety-related disorders.\u201d\n\nIn short, if you believe God really has your back, you might glean more comfort from praying than people who don\u2019t truly believe that.\n\nPrayer And Mental Health\n\nSome researchers and psychologists have found that people who prayed or attended church were more likely to recover from illness or surgery quicker than people who didn\u2019t; these people were also less likely to experience depression. This is possibly because religion provides a community support system and consistent social bonding opportunities. Socializing has been shown to reduce stress and depression, especially among older adults. Religion strengthens social ties, since people who share common beliefs tend to bond quickly.\n\nPeople who are religious are \u201cbetter able to cope with stress, they heal faster from illness, and they experience increased benefits to their health and well-being,\u201d Dr. Roberta Lee, author of \u201cThe SuperStress Solution,\u201d told PsychCentral. \u201cOn an intellectual level, spirituality connects you to the world, which in turn enables you to stop trying to control things all by yourself. When you feel part of a greater whole, it\u2019s easy to understand that you aren\u2019t responsible for everything that happens in life.\u201d\n\nBut the Baylor study points out that this isn\u2019t always the case; everything depends on individual expectations, the style of prayer, and the individual\u2019s perceived characteristics of God. \u201cThese are all important considerations, but a comprehensive understanding of the connection between prayer and mental health remains elusive,\u201d Bradshaw said in the press release. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do in this area.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "praying, prayer mental health, religion", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers found that prayer doesn't help everyone; it can make anxiety worse for certain individuals.", "title": "Prayer Doesn\u2019t Always Reduce Anxiety: It Could Make It Worse", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/praying-religion-doesnt-always-reduce-stress-it-could-exacerbate-anxiety-related-disorders-298022", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/13/praying-hands-bible.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers found that prayer doesn't help everyone; it can make anxiety worse for certain individuals.", "title": "Prayer Doesn\u2019t Always Reduce Anxiety: It Could Make It Worse", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/praying-religion-doesnt-always-reduce-stress-it-could-exacerbate-anxiety-related-disorders-298022", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/13/praying-hands-bible.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/13/praying-hands-bible.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-13T17:35:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-13T17:39:33-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers found that prayer doesn't help everyone; it can make anxiety worse for certain individuals."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb45f\"", "article_summary": "Praying has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety; but a new study finds that praying doesn't do much for people who don't really believe in it.\nSome research has shown that praying or believing in God could actually reduce stress.\nSocializing has been shown to reduce stress and depression, especially among older adults.\nFor thousands of years, people have turned to religion or spirituality as a way to reduce stress, anxiety, and bring warmth, comfort, and meaning into their daily lives.\n\u201cFor these individuals, prayer may feel like an unsuccessful attempt to cultivate and maintain an intimate relationship with God."}
