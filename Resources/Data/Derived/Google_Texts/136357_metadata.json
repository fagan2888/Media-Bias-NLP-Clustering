A batch of emails exchanged between the two organizations\u2019 respective top administrators reveals disagreement over a number of issues, including the city\u2019s efforts to regulate recreational marijuana, the future of the Mirror Pond dam and who\u2019s responsible for costs associated with work beneath the Colorado Avenue bridge. The records include all emails sent between the city and park district this calendar year through October and were obtained by The Bulletin through a public records request,\n\nIn most Oregon cities, parks are a division of city government. However, in 1974, voters in Bend approved the creation of a stand-alone parks agency with its own director and budget.\n\nSpinning the district off from the city also resulted in a property tax rate for the district of $1.65, a rate that is more than half of the city\u2019s $2.80. The district\u2019s robust funding has made parks a prominent feature across the city and earned the district national recognition for its work. However, the more it expands, the more the district and city have to coordinate on matters such as road closures, policing and urban planning.\n\nWhile the emails reveal a number of disagreements, the two administrators, City Manager Eric King and park district Executive Director Don Horton, say there is no lingering animosity. Following one email flare-up in October, the pair say they met to hash out strategies for better coordination, agreeing to meet more often and include deputies whose work often overlaps.\n\nThe October exchange focused on an advisory group the city formed to develop policies governing the sale of recreational marijuana. Applications to participate in the group were open to the public, and the City Council appointed members representing a range of interests, including the marijuana industry and Bend-La Pine Schools.\n\nIn emails and public meetings, Horton accused the city of leaving the district out of the process by not directly notifying his agency that the committee was being formed. In particular, he was upset the district wasn\u2019t able to earlier advocate for a requirement that recreational marijuana stores be set back 250 feet from parks, a policy the district\u2019s governing board backs. The city has maintained the committee\u2019s work was well advertised and the district would have been welcomed into the process at the beginning. A special meeting was eventually set up for the district to make its case in front of the committee, though the group voted against the 250-foot rule.\n\nAfter a string of emails on the subject, Horton wrote to the city on Oct. 17, beginning with the sentence, \u201cThis happens a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s not purposeful but when we set meetings with city staff and no one shows up, when staff won\u2019t return phone calls or confirm meetings and discuss policy issues without our knowledge it makes us feel as though we are not important,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd certainly not a partner. I\u2019m trying to change that.\u201d\n\nIn a response, King wrote to Horton, \u201cEmail is not a productive way to air your grievances.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would suggest that if you truly want a partnership relationship you not assume the worst and find more constructive ways to communicate your frustrations,\u201d King replied.\n\nIn an interview, Horton said he was referring to a meeting 11 months earlier the city had requested and then failed to show up for.\n\n\u201cThe point I was trying to make was that we need to foster this relationship a little bit better,\u201d Horton said of the exchange.\n\nSince the subsequent meeting between the two administrators, Horton said, \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any issues.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the exchange in a separate interview, King said, \u201cI certainly don\u2019t have any personal issues with (Horton).\u201d\n\nHowever, he did note he told Horton, \u201cGee, if that happens, please don\u2019t wait 11 months to share it over an email.\u201d\n\nWater under the bridge?\n\nWhile that exchange focused on the formation of city policy, others have concerned agency finances, including a tussle over differing interpretations of city agreements governing its relationship with utility companies. Under the agreements, the city is not responsible for the cost of relocating infrastructure when it conflicts with a city construction project. For example, if a road is being widened, the power company has to pay to relocate any utility poles.\n\nThe park district argues the city incorrectly applied one of its agreements to a park district project to install a tunnel under the Colorado Bridge, a move that cost the district $189,000, Horton said. The work required the relocation of a high-pressure pipe maintained by Cascade Natural Gas and electrical infrastructure overseen by Pacific Power. At the same time as the tunnel was being installed, the city was attaching a sewer line to the bottom of the bridge, though that work didn\u2019t affect any of those utilities.\n\nThe city\u2019s agreement with Cascade Natural Gas includes a clause that says the utility is liable to cover costs associated with a project that benefits the public good. Even though the tunnel is part of the district\u2019s trail system and not maintained by city staff, the city was able to argue it benefited the public, and Cascade Natural Gas covered the tab.\n\nThere is no \u201cpublic good\u201d clause in the city\u2019s agreement with Pacific Power. The park district, however, argued that the trail should be considered a city project as it\u2019s noted in a citywide transportation plan, and therefore the cost should fall to Pacific Power.\n\nIn emails, King wrote the city reviewed its policy and felt it would be incorrect to call the trail a city project.\n\nIn a message to King on Aug. 27, Horton wrote, \u201cIs there something else going on here that I should know about(?)\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked you if I can attend the meetings you have with PacifiCorp but haven\u2019t been invited,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019ve met with them and drawn an opinion without talking to us. I thought we were in partnership to provide such things but it feels otherwise. It\u2019s disappointing that we are leading Mirror Pond and trying to work with the city but you can\u2019t find time to include us in decisions that have a huge impact on our projects.\u201d\n\nKing clarified that he hadn\u2019t met with Pacific Power, but instead received a call from the utility and ran into one of its representatives at a Rotary meeting. King emphasized that he considers the city partners not only with the park district, but also Deschutes County and Bend-La Pine Schools.\n\n\u201cAs partners we need to adhere to the written agreements we have with each other,\u201d King wrote.\n\nIn a response, Horton complained the district didn\u2019t have the chance to make its case that the trail should be considered a city project, writing, \u201cI believe you have an even greater responsibility to the safety of the public and in this case it\u2019s been completely overlooked.\u201d\n\nHe also threatened to abandon their collaboration over planning for the future of the Mirror Pond dam, writing, \u201cIf you truly believe that we are the same as the school district perhaps they can help you with Mirror Pond.\u201d\n\nIn reply, King emphasized that \u201cwe cannot interpret documents incorrectly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was nothing subversive going on here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope you wouldn\u2019t think I would do something like that. I really hope we can all stop playing the blame game with this \u2026 it was no one individual\u2019s fault \u2026 more of an awkward set of circumstances. It really is not productive to make assumptions based on ill intent. I would like to find a way to move beyond that.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Horton said what really bothered him was the city\u2019s unwillingness to hear him out, saying, \u201cWe were having a hard time getting in there to make our case, and that was frustrating.\u201d\n\nKing said it\u2019s \u201cnot uncommon\u201d for two agencies to disagree about the interpretation of an agreement. He also pointed out that the city waived development fees for the project to help out with the district\u2019s unexpected $189,000 utility relocation costs.\n\nMirror Pond\n\nOne area both Horton and King said they have collaborated closely on is the Mirror Pond dam. The two agencies have formed a committee to develop plans to replace the aging dam, with staff members and elected officials from both sides participating. Pacific Power owns the dam but announced it would no longer use it to generate electricity after a hole was discovered in it in 2013. The committee is not only looking to acquire and replace the dam, but also to address the problem of upstream silt accumulation.\n\nHorton threatened to pull out of the partnership after two city councilors, Barb Campbell and Nathan Boddie, said they oppose a plan that called for downtown redevelopment to help fund the construction of a new, natural-looking dam. The plan had earlier been supported by a majority of the council and park district board.\n\n\u201cLast night two City Council members held a meeting (with supporters) to derail the Mirror Pond project,\u201d Horton wrote in July. \u201cHow do we handle this? Council voted 4-3 in favor of moving forward on this project. We are in partnership to get this project done, yet there are two members of council obstructing the direction that the two boards have chosen to go. I\u2019m not sure how much longer we can stay in partnership when members of the governing body are actively leading an advancement against us.\u201d\n\nKing said he intentionally did not respond to this email.\n\n\u201cI serve at the will of the majority of council, and sometimes council is very divided on issues,\u201d King said. \u201cAll I do is count to four (votes) and move forward. I can inquire why there\u2019s not support, but it\u2019s not my job to coax or influence anyone.\u201d\n\nHorton said Campbell and Boddie were \u201cvoting against the community,\u201d noting that outreach efforts had found support for the Mirror Pond plan. Horton said he intended for his email to encourage King to have \u201ca more in-depth discussion with council so they could better understand what was put into the process.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs head of that organization, he ought to have a part of that,\u201d Horton said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he hasn\u2019t attempted to do that, as head of his organization, he certainly, he needs to help foster it, foster support of that plan.\u201d\n\nIn emails, Horton often invoked the district\u2019s leadership on Mirror Pond, at one point saying in reference to the dam and other matters, \u201cit\u2019s the Park District doing the giving.\u201d\n\nKing emphasized in an interview that costs associated with Mirror Pond are being split \u201c50-50,\u201d but Horton said \u201cI\u2019m personally taking the lead on this project.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually when we have a project, there\u2019s a project manager,\u201d Horton said in an interview. \u201cWell, I\u2019m the project manager, no doubt I\u2019ve been taking the lead. The city has paid 50 percent of the bills \u2026 but they haven\u2019t paid my costs and my staff have invested a lot of additional time into this.\u201d\n\nDifferent cultures\n\nCity Councilor Victor Chudowsky, who is heavily involved in the Mirror Pond issue and said he enjoys working with Horton, pins any disagreements between the two agencies on differing cultures. The key, he said, is that the city is constantly balancing, while the district has one focus.\n\n\u201cThe district is all about parks, whereas the city has to deal with infrastructure, public safety, the municipal court and the urban growth boundary. It\u2019s a much wider portfolio, and it\u2019s a much more political process to get things done. We have to bargain and negotiate with different interests in our community because we have multiple, diverse goals. The parks don\u2019t have to deal with this, and I think the two will always operate differently and have different cultures, because of that fundamental fact.\u201d\n\nBoth Horton and King agreed with this assessment, and also agreed that the city\u2019s many different jobs makes it tough to balance priorities, while the district\u2019s singular focus is the reason Bend has great parks.\n\n\u201cHaving a park district puts a bright spotlight on that service, and their governing board is very focused,\u201d King said. \u201cThat focus can improve service levels.\u201d\n\nThe downside for the management of the city, King noted, is that when city revenues fall, parks can\u2019t be part of the balancing act. Funding for police or sewers can be cut to help with an emergency, but parks are not a chip the city has to work with.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have as much ability to prioritize the services we provide as we would otherwise,\u201d King said. \u201cBut, we are very lucky in Bend to have the quality parks we do have. Don does a great job managing, and the product shows that.\u201d\n\nIf parks were to fall under the city\u2019s auspices, Horton said, \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have the park system we have today,\u201d while also agreeing that same separation results in the city\u2019s job being tougher.\n\nGetting along\n\nJim Johnson knows a thing or two about interagency relations, having been both the administrator of Lane County and the city manager of the county\u2019s largest city, Eugene.\n\n\u201cIt is not at all uncommon to have intergovernmental relationships that don\u2019t go well,\u201d said Johnson, who is now deputy director of Portland State University\u2019s National Policy Consensus Center. \u201cThe local agencies are competing for the interests of citizens, competing for tax dollars and competing in all different types of ways. The best thing to do is to try to decrease the level of competition, as they are all serving the same people.\u201d\n\nThe key, Johnson said, is \u201cregular face-to-face meetings,\u201d not only between administrators, but between elected officials.\n\n\u201cEmail just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t interpret body language and unless you use all capital letters, you can\u2019t get tone. Meeting in person is the way to go.\u201d\n\nWhile Horton and King have put a greater emphasis on staff meetings, they are also asking their respective elected bodies to consider hosting joint office hours along with members of the Bend-La Pine School Board. King said not only will it be a chance for citizens to meet with policymakers, but it also will give the different agencies\u2019 policymakers an opportunity to become more familiar with one another.\n\n\u201cRelationships are always a work in process,\u201d King said. \u201cNo relationship is perfect. It\u2019s how you strengthen them that matters. Don was expressing his feelings in those emails, and I take that at face value. Now, \u2018How do we put a structure in place that will address his concerns?\u2019 is the question.\u201d\n\nHorton takes a similar view, saying, \u201cI think it comes down to communication.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommunication seems to be the issue with most relationships,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something people have to continue to work on. Whenever you see a series of emails over the course of a year or so, you\u2019ll see frustrations. But there haven\u2019t been any issues we are not able to work through.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-633-2160, tleeds@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When a relationship devolves into pleas to \u201cnot assume the worst\u201d or complaints about unreturned phone calls and being made to feel unimportant, it\u2019s often a sure sign something\u2019s not right.
