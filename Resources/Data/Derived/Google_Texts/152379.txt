Holiday shoppers took to Towne East Mall, some to finalize their holiday shopping and other shoppers were just getting started.

"It's first and last [shopping day], I just started yesterday and I'm finishing today," said one shopper.

"I don't like shopping throughout the year, I like to last minute it... because you will spend less I think," said another shopper.

The mall was busy with families trying to find the perfect holiday gifts.

Wichita Police want to remind shoppers at all locations across Wichita that thieves like to target parked cars. There are signs outside of major retailers that police have put to remind shoppers to hide items in their cars.

Police also remind shoppers to not leave the keys in the car and to lock their doors.
