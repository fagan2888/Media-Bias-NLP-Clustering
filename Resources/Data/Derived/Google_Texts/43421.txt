NASHVILLE, Tenn. - This week marked the deadline to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, and there has now been another push for Tennessee to expand health care coverage to people who can't afford it.

The Nashville Coalition for Insure Tennessee held a Candlelight vigil in support of Tennesseans they said have been caught in the gap -- making too much for Medicare, but too little to afford their own health insurance.

In March, a state senate committee voted down Haslam's latest push for Insure Tennessee, with some opponents worried about how much tax money it could cost the state.

But those gathered at the State Capitol hoped something can still be done next year.

“It is a great plan and we need to bring it forward, and we need to get each state senator and representative to pass it at the next session beginning in January,” said Rep. Bill Beck (D-Nashville).

Governor Haslam has already said publicly that he doesn't think his Insure Tennessee plan has been any more politically popular than it was this last session.
