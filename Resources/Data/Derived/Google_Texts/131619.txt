Fox has suspended commenters Stacey Dash and Ralph Peters for two weeks after two separate instances of on-air profanity while criticizing President Obama.

Peters referred to the president as a common slang for female anatomy when he appeared on Fox Business Network on Monday morning. His comments were not "bleeped," although Peters was reprimanded on-air by host Stuart Varney. Peters then apologized for his prior language.

Later on Monday, Dash said that Obama "doesn't give a s--t" about terrorism during the show Outnumbered. Dash's comments were partially censored.

A statement from Bill Shine, Senior Executive Vice President of Programming at Fox News and Fox Business explained that their comments were "completely inappropriate and unacceptable for our air."

“Earlier today, FOX contributors Lt. Col. Ralph Peters and Stacey Dash made comments on different programs that were completely inappropriate and unacceptable for our air. FOX Business Network and FOX News Channel do not condone the use of such language, and have suspended both Peters and Dash for two weeks.”
