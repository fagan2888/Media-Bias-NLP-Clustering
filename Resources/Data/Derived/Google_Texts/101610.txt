Another day, another hilarious internet meme ruined by politicians trying to be hip.

This time around, Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas) took a shot at Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), his 2014 Senate opponent, with this take on the "doge" meme.

Rep. Tom Massie (R-Ky.) also got in the doge action in a critique of congressional bipartisanship.

Much bipartisanship. Very spending. Wow. #doge http://t.co/NMlzqrZS8e pic.twitter.com/zjQTrfoUFJ — Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) December 23, 2013

As MSNBC's Adam Serwer puts it, "ok so doge just died."

Good job, Congress. You created only 65 laws this year and cost the country $24 billion due to the shutdown, but at least you succeeded in killing one of the internet's favorite memes!

This is hardly the first time an elected official has used a meme to make a political message. Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) posted a cat-themed listicle in October while taking a swing at Obamacare's error-plagued website.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Rep. Issa as a congressman from Ohio. He represents California.

1 of 11 Rudy Giuliani And The Price Of Milk While running for president in 2007, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani told a reporter at a Montgomery, Ala., supermarket that he estimates "a gallon of milk is probably about a $1.50, a loaf of bread about a $1.25, $1.30, last time I bought one." It must have been a few election cycles since his last trip: The grocery store's website listed milk for $3.38 and bread up to $3.49. Share this slide:
