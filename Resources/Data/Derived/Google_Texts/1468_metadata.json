Bernie Sanders, saying he has \"neither asked for nor given\" endorsements involving other elected officials or candidates.\n\nSestak did praise Clinton as someone who would be \"a very fine commander in chief,\" while describing Sanders' approach to addressing income inequality as one that \"takes care of the fever, not the source of it.\"\n\nJohn Fetterman, mayor of the Allegheny County borough of Braddock, has backed Sanders, saying he is \"where the party is going.\"\n\n\"Inequality is more than just one issue,\" Fetterman said. \"It pervades everything: education, health care, housing, you name it.\"\n\nThe debate \u2014 broadcast live by WGAL-TV in Lancaster and co-sponsored by Franklin & Marshall College \u2014 had a more civil tone than a forum last week in Pittsburgh, when the candidates sparred over a number of issues.\n\nThe three Democrats seeking to face off against Republican incumbent Pat Toomey this fall showed broad agreement as they answered questions on the minimum wage, natural gas drilling, foreign policy and lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender rights.\n\nResponding to a question about the federal Affordable Care Act, all three praised the law and offered a distinct approach for improving it.\n\nSestak credited the law with cutting overall health care costs but said it could be boosted by finding ways to reward doctors for improving their care and reducing the number of times a patient needs to return.\n\nMcGinty said negotiations with pharmaceutical companies are needed to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and that insurance companies must work to reduce their operating costs.\n\nFetterman said the law has been a first step toward providing universal health care for all Americans, praising its provisions extending health care as policies that should not have been politically controversial.\n\nThe candidates again waded into natural gas drilling policies, an area in which McGinty's opponents had previously criticized her as not taking a tough enough stance when she led the Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nWhile Sestak didn't criticize McGinty by name, he did say that state officials weren't ready when natural gas drilling in the state's Marcellus Shale began to ramp up about a decade ago.\n\nThe state DEP \"didn't have the manpower, the regulations, the oversight to do it,\" Sestak said.\n\nIn an email after the debate, Fetterman's campaign described her as having \"tried to obscure her lax attitude toward fracking.\"\n\nMcGinty pointed to her work boosting Pennsylvania's use of renewable energy as evidence of her environmental record, while also saying she would support more stringent state and federal laws on disclosing chemicals used in fracking.\n\n\"If you've got nothing to hide, you should be willing to comply with the law,\" McGinty said.\n\nAll three candidates said there should be a extraction tax on natural gas pumped out from beneath Pennsylvania, describing the current per-well impact fee as insufficient.\n\nTuesday's debate came two weeks ahead of the April 26 primary election and days before the latest round of campaign finance reports are due from federal candidates.\n\nMcGinty previewed her report earlier Tuesday, with her campaign announcing that she raised $1.8 million through April 6. She did not disclose how much cash was left in her campaign account at the end of the reporting period.\n\nSestak and Fetterman have not yet announced their fundraising totals, which are due to the Federal Election Commission on Thursday.\n\nlolson@mcall.com\n\nTwitter @LauraOlson\n\n202-824-8216", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "With two weeks to go, Democratic Senate candidates face off", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Morning Call", "author": "The Morning Call", "og": {"site_name": "themorningcall.com", "description": "LANCASTER \u2014 The three Democrats vying in Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race drew perhaps their biggest distinctions during Tuesday's debate when asked about their favored candidates for the race at the top of the ticket.", "title": "With two weeks to go, Democratic Senate candidates face off", "url": "http://www.mcall.com/news/local/elections/mc-pa-us-senate-debate-democrats-20160412-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-570db2e0/turbine/mc-pa-us-senate-debate-democrats-20160412", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.14", "twitter": {"site": "@mcall", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "U.S. Senate, Democrats, Katie McGinty, Joe Sestak, John Fetterman, Pat Toomey", "fb": {"admins": 1762506491, "page_id": 73291032902, "app_id": 377275452340817}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=501096172, app-argument=http://www.mcall.com/deeplinkid/86532503", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-04-12", "Description": "Katie McGinty, Joe Sestak, and John Fetterman face off in second broadcast debate as they seek Democratic U.S. Senate nomination.", "y_key": "7164478e9f100cbd", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "U.S. Senate, Democrats, Katie McGinty, Joe Sestak, John Fetterman, Pat Toomey"}, "article_summary": "Tuesday's debate came two weeks ahead of the April 26 primary election and days before the latest round of campaign finance reports are due from federal candidates.\n\"If you've got nothing to hide, you should be willing to comply with the law,\" McGinty said.\nAll three candidates said there should be a extraction tax on natural gas pumped out from beneath Pennsylvania, describing the current per-well impact fee as insufficient.\nFetterman said the law has been a first step toward providing universal health care for all Americans, praising its provisions extending health care as policies that should not have been politically controversial.\n\"It pervades everything: education, health care, housing, you name it.\""}
