The other (issue) is with PSERS \u2013 this year, we\u2019re paying 21.4 percent of every dollar that goes out for retirement, and that includes substitutes. If we hired a company that outsources, they would keep track of all the hours (and) PSERS would no longer be an issue.\u201d\n\nSource4Teachers Business Development Director Paula Vercammen said that the company currently serves nearly 50 school districts in Pennsylvania since July 2013, including several in Westmoreland County.\n\nThe group also hopes to partner with the ARIN Intermediate Unit.\n\n\u201cBeing a private firm, we aren\u2019t held to the same standards of measurement a school district is. Employees that work for us are measured over a full 12-month period, whereas in a school district, where you have substitutes that don\u2019t work during the summer months or holiday breaks, you have to credit them with for those hours worked as an average over that time,\u201d Vercammen said.\n\nSource4Teachers would recruit at colleges and career fairs, conduct background checks, train and manage, as well as offer positions to current Armstrong substitute teachers or other employees.\n\nSubstitutes currently make $90 per day, and Source4Teachers would charge nearly 30 percent commission.\n\nVercammen said there are other benefits to hiring Source4Teachers \u2013 including reducing hard and soft costs when administrators don\u2019t have to worry about calling for substitute teachers during the morning -, with Kirk explained evens out expenses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a relatively-break even from my analysis. We know (what the PSERS rate will be) in the future,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cThe administrative time that would be freed up is immeasurable variable I can\u2019t put a dollar figure on.\u201d\n\nBoard Director Larry Robb said the past few years, regional school districts have had scrambled for substitute teachers due to multiple factors.\n\nThe change order to the technical education-wing of the new Armstrong Junior-Senior High School in Manor Township includes some-60 electrical-related items.\n\nL.R. Kimball Project Manager Brian Hayes said the electrical contractor is all set to go with approval.\n\n\u201cThere were ongoing changes \u2013 even to the point of things going in while decisions were being made,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous update our engineers have tried to keep up with.\u201d\n\nProject Manager Roshelle Fennell also spoke on the change order.\n\n\u201cIt was a major change to the whole suite,\u201d Fennell said. \u201cThe teachers are very happy. It was no fault of anybody \u2013 just major changes and new equipment.\u201d\n\nReynolds Construction On-Site Manager Stephen Reckhart added that teachers were not complete with their design specifications at the initial construction \u2013 which caused some of the surprise cost.\n\n\u201cEven though it\u2019s not been approved, some of the things he put in were based on the change order,\u201d Reckhart said. \u201cHe is being proactive that it will be set up. It\u2019s been 6-8 months we\u2019ve been trying to see what the tech education department really wants.\u201d\n\nSchool Superintendent Stan Chapp said the change order also allows for program modification and to offer the most flexibility in STEM classes in the future.\n\nWith the approval, there would be about $20,000-worth of change orders to date on the construction project, Hayes said.\n\nIn terms of the rest of the construction project, Fennell said most windows have been installed, and temporary heating will be available before a public open house of the site Saturday, November 1.\n\nExterior bricking will hopefully be completed by mid-November\n\nThe last section of roof \u2013 over the library \u2013 will also hopefully be completed this week. Underground storage has also begun.\n\n\u201cWe had a really great month of September due to the great weather up there,\u201d Fennell said.\n\nThe regular meeting begins at 7:30PM within West Hills Intermediate in East Franklin Township.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Armstrong County, Leader Times, newspaper, local news, Family Life TV", "description": "A local newspaper in middle Armstrong County covering the events of Kittanning, Ford City and the surrounding area.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3287\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEven though it\u2019s not been approved, some of the things he put in were based on the change order,\u201d Reckhart said.\n\u201cBeing a private firm, we aren\u2019t held to the same standards of measurement a school district is.\nThe six-month contract would be with Source4Teachers \u2013 which was founded in New Jersey 14 years ago \u2013 a company that would provide any necessary substitute teachers.\n\u201cWe have to start tracking those hours,\u201d Kirk said.\n\u201cWe have over 110 substitute teachers on staff."}
