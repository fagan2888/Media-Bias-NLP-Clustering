It provides no tax credits for people making below the poverty level, who, under the act, were supposed to be covered by an expanded Medicaid program. But in a ruling that upheld the health care law, the Supreme Court also ruled that states could not be forced to expand Medicaid, and many, including Florida, did not.\n\nAnd plenty of local people making less than the poverty level, but who are not eligible for Medicaid, are still streaming into the Free Clinic.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to open up more and more to see additional patients,\u201d Milidantri said. \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing goal, to be able to help out more often.\u201d\n\nBOX:\n\nThe Flagler County Free Clinic is located at 700 State Road 100 in Bunnell.\n\nFor more information, go to flaglercountyfreeclinic.com.
