Well, Cuba should at least recognize our right to exist\u2019 [we wouldn\u2019t accept] \u2018that\u2019s a separate issue.'\u201d\n\nLevin concluded, \u201cno, that\u2019s the fundamental issue. Because if they don\u2019t recognize the right of Israel to exist, then they believe they have right to make sure it doesn\u2019t exist. This seems to me to be a threshold point.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mark Levin argued that Iran's recognition of Israel's right to exist was a \"fundamental\" matter in the US' negotiations with Iran on Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mark Levin argued that Iran's recognition of Israel's right to exist was a \"fundamental\" matter in the US' negotiations with Iran on Monday.", "title": "Levin: Recognition of Israel's Right to Exist 'Fundamental' in Iran Nuke Deal - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Levin-25-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/04/06/levin-recognition-of-israels-right-to-exist-fundamental-in-iran-nuke-deal/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mark Levin argued that Iran's recognition of Israel's right to exist was a \"fundamental\" matter in the US' negotiations with Iran on Monday.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Levin-25-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Levin: Recognition of Israel's Right to Exist 'Fundamental' in Iran Nuke Deal - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Breitbart Jerusalem, Iran, Iran Nuke Deal, Mark Levin,Breitbart Jerusalem, Breitbart TV, Middle East,Levin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Jerusalem", "tag": "Mark Levin", "published_time": "2015-04-06T21:52:20-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Middle East,Breitbart Jerusalem"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdce3b\"", "article_summary": "Because if they don\u2019t recognize the right of Israel to exist, then they believe they have right to make sure it doesn\u2019t exist.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTalk radio host and author of \u201cThe Liberty Amendments,\u201d Mark Levin argued that Iran\u2019s recognition of Israel\u2019s right to exist was a \u201cfundamental\u201d matter in the US\u2019 negotiations with Iran on Monday.\nWell, Cuba should at least recognize our right to exist\u2019 [we wouldn\u2019t accept] \u2018that\u2019s a separate issue.\n'\u201dLevin concluded, \u201cno, that\u2019s the fundamental issue.\nThis seems to me to be a threshold point.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
