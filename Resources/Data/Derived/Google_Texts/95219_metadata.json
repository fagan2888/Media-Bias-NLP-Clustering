Rather, it all focus more on transitioning from the historical fee-for-serivice system to a more risk-based system that is measured by performance.\n\nAnd it will be crucial for CCRCs to begin tracking their quality outcomes if they want to thrive in this evolving environment.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what your costs are, what your lengths of stay are, or what your re-hospitalization rates are, your\u2019e at risk of losing money when you participate in those kind of captivated risk-based, performance-based systems,\u201d Maag said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the future.\u201d\n\nCCRC providers will have to know their role in the new risk-based system, and technology can help them accomplish this.\n\n\u201cTechnology has been changing dramatically over the last several years and it will have a major impact in what we do and how we provide services,\u201d Maag said. \u201cFor-profits are spending millions of dollars in [technology]. We need to start looking at that and become a player in technology in the future.\u201d\n\nIn 2015 and beyond, CCRCs will be charged with evolving with these major trends and analyzing their campuses to see just how they fit into the greater shifts taking place in the senior housing and care sector.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at these three different trends, you\u2019ll have to ask yourselves these questions,\u201d said Maag. \u201cThink about 2025. Are you going to be viable in 2025?\u201d\n\nWritten by Jason Oliva", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "leadingage, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) will have to pay attention to three major trends if they want to compete with for-profit providers in 2015, according to a recent LeadingAge QuickCast.
