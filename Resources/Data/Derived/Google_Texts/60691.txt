— A 50-year-old Aberdeen woman was injured Sunday night in what authorities say was a drive-by shooting.

Aberdeen police said the shooting happened shortly after 7 p.m. on Colonial Avenue.

The woman was treated and released from Moore Regional Hospital, authorities said.

A second drive-by shooting also was reported at a residence just outside Pinebluff on Monday night.

No one was injured in the incident, which happened on Morgan Lane near West Philadelphia Avenue. Moore County sheriff's Capt. Bill Mackey said it was too early to tell if the two shootings were related.



Anyone with information is asked to call the Moore County Sheriff’s Department at 910-947-2931.
