But the DFL governor and the Democratic Senate majority will have to share power with Republicans, who are taking command of the House after two years.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats do agree on what big issues need to be addressed during the session, but there are clear differences on what changes each party wants to make, the Pioneer Press says, noting true bipartisanship will be a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\n\nThe marathon of bills, amendments and debates convenes Tuesday at noon. Here\u2019s a look at some of the issues expected to be on the agenda:\n\nBudget and taxes\n\nMinnesota has a projected $1 billion budget surplus, which lawmakers will work with to decide on a budget to fund the government for the next two years.\n\nDayton and DFL officials have said the money should be put towards improving rural broadband access, childcare tax credit, youth scholarships, as well as changing the state\u2019s tax code to align more closely with the federal tax code, the Pioneer Press says.\n\nGOP officials have hinted towards tax cut proposals to make the state friendlier to businesses, MPR News says.\n\nRoads and bridges\n\nWhat to do to fix Minnesota\u2019s thousands of \u201cstructurally deficient\u201d roads and bridges is expected to be a priority in this year\u2019s session, the Pioneer Press reports.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans will have to compromise on how the state will fund the billions needed to keep its transportation system in decent shape, the Star Tribune says. Dayton says over the next decade, roughly $6 billion in new funds is needed to make that happen.\n\nDayton has proposed a wholesale gas tax to fund the repairs, but state Republicans suggest getting the money elsewhere, like the budget surplus, the general state sales tax or borrowing more in construction bonds, reports note.\n\nEducation\n\nDemocrats have said they want to increase school spending to help close the achievement gap, as well as push for early childhood education scholarships and a child care tax credit.\n\nRepublicans are expected to seek education reform, including changes to teacher tenure laws. Minnesota Action Network says the \u201clast in, first out\u201d mentality, which bases staffing on seniority instead of performance, can limit high quality teachers in schools. Dayton, who has vetoed such a change, isn\u2019t expected to support this, the Pioneer Press notes.\n\nRepublicans may also take up the Minnesota State High School Sports League\u2019s controversial policy for transgender student athletes, The Associated Press says.\n\nLawmakers will also likely weigh in on whether to increase funding to keep tuition frozen at state colleges and universities for another two years.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nHouse Republicans may seek to block future automatic increases to the state\u2019s minimum wage law, which the DFL-controlled Legislature passed last spring.\n\nSome are also calling for the inflationary provision to be removed from the law, the Star Tribune says. This isn\u2019t expected to find support with Dayton or the DFL Senate majority, the AP notes.\n\nSunday liquor sales\n\nThe ban on Sunday liquor sales is a perennial issue at the Capitol, but this year may be different as proponents seek to revoke the old blue law. Supporters have suggested a plan that would allow cities to decide whether to allow Sunday liquor sales, rather than repealing the ban statewide.\n\nJune primary\n\nThere\u2019s a new push with powerful backing to move the state\u2019s current August primary to June.\n\nSupporters, including new Secretary of State Steve Simon and incoming House Speaker Kurt Daudt, have said an earlier primary would boost turnout, the AP notes.\n\nDayton has said he would sign such a bill.\n\nPrivacy\n\nSurveillance technology, such as police body cameras, drones and license plate readers, are expected to draw scrutiny from lawmakers.\n\nLaws that govern how law enforcement officials can use these devices and how the data should be kept is expected to be discussed.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nLawmakers may look into stronger oversight for MNsure, the state\u2019s health care exchange, after technical glitches plagued the initial rollout of the program last year.\n\nCritics have a long list of proposed improvements. Democrats have said they\u2019re open to suggestions for improving the program, but don\u2019t want to start the \u201cObamacare\u201d debate over again, the Pioneer Press says.\n\nSex offender program\n\nThe state\u2019s controversial sex offender program, which is the subject of a federal civil rights lawsuit, is on lawmaker\u2019s must-do list during this session, the Pioneer Press says.\n\nA task force recommended changes in 2012, but lawmakers haven\u2019t done much because they don\u2019t want to appear soft on sex offenders, reports note.\n\nMedical marijuana\n\nMedical marijuana was a major issue during the last legislative session, but it isn\u2019t expected to take up a lot of time this year, The Associated Press notes.
