However, there are two to watch: Health Catalyst and the collaborative group the Data Alliance Collaborative (DAC).\n\nHealth Catalyst reports in an article, \u201cWhat is Data Mining in Healthcare,\u201d\n\nThat said, not all analyses of large quantities of data constitute data mining. We generally categorize analytics as follows:\n\nDescriptive analytics\u2014Describing what has happened\n\nPredictive analytics\u2014Predicting what will happen\n\nPrescriptive analytics\u2014Determining what to do about it It is to the middle category\u2014predictive analytics\u2014that data mining applies. Data mining involves uncovering patterns from vast data stores and using that information to build predictive models.\n\nIn January, the six-year old Health Catalyst received $41 million in a third round of funding:\n\n\u201cExisting investors Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Kaiser Permanente Ventures, Sorenson Capital, CHV Capital \u2014 an Indiana University Health Company \u2014 and Partners HealthCare. The funding will make it possible for Health Catalyst to build out its healthcare analytics platform. The company plans to invest $50 million in product development over the next 24 months, including production of the next 200 advanced content-driven clinical applications on its roadmap.\u201d\n\nHealth Catalyst clients include Kaiser Permanente, Partners HealthCare, Crystal Run Healthcare, Memorial Hospital at Gulport, Northbay Healthcare and Wisconsin Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\nAccording to an article published today by Bloomberg, Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS) in Charlotte \u201cis placing its data, which include purchases a patient has made using a credit card or store loyalty card, into predictive models that give a risk score to patients\u201d\n\nCHS is working with IBM to develop a big data-mining system to compete with Healthy Catalyst.\n\nThe Bloomberg report states that CHS is running big data computer algorithms on two million Americans to identify people who may present a risk to the hospital by identifying people who allow their gym memberships to lapse, who purchase cigarettes, or who \u201c[pick] up candy bars.\u201d\n\nAt the ongoing Google I/O conference, Google CEO Larry Page says his company\u2019s ability to collect vast amounts of personal information is positive, and that the company is not going far enough with the collection and analyzing of that information.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m so excited about the possibilities to improve things for people, my worry would be the opposite,\u201d he told the New York Times\u2019s Farhad Manjoo. \u201cWe get so worried about these things that we don\u2019t get the benefits \u2026 Right now we don\u2019t data-mine healthcare data. If we did we\u2019d probably save 100,000 lives next year.\u201d\n\nPage\u2019s remarks followed the the introduction of Google Fit, the company\u2019s new fitness and health tracking platform that will put sensors on mobile devices, like smart watchers, that will monitor weight, eating habits and workout data to make suggestions, or if Obamacare gets involved, demand that Americans uphold positive helath care habits.\n\nThe CHS data mining program is being run by Michael Dulin, M.D., Ph.D., director of research and evidence-based medicine. According to CampaignMoney.com, Dulin contributed $250 to Obama for America PAC in September 2012.\n\nCHS is in partnership with IT and clinical experts launching the Data Alliance Collaborative (DAC).\n\nAccording to a recent press release:\n\nThrough this first-of-its-kind initiative, DAC members are co-developing and sharing knowledge, data and resources to address unmet healthcare needs. They include:\n\nCarolinas HealthCare System (Charlotte, N.C.),\n\nCatholic Health Partners (Cincinnati),\n\nFairview Health Services (Minneapolis),\n\nTexas Health Resources (Arlington, Texas),\n\nIBM\n\nPremier healthcare alliance.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) has been criticized as overly intrusive and another avenue for the federal government to spy on Americans.\n\nThe NSA is already collecting communications metadata and content, while vehicle \u201ctrack and tax\u201d pilot programs and mandatory new vehicle black boxes and toll road systems are increasingly tracking the movements of Americans.\n\nIronically, Dulin is happy to data mine patients, but refused to disclose to the Bloomberg reporter the name of the data vendor handing over patient consumer and spending profiles.\n\nUnder Dulin\u2019s vision, not only will the hospital know about patient consumer activities, but that data will be shared with doctors. \u201cIf the early steps are successful, though, Dulin said he would like to renegotiate to get the data provider to share more specific details on patient spending with doctors\u201d reports Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cThe data is already used to market to people to get them to do things that might not always be in the best interest of the consumer, we are looking to apply this for something good,\u201d Dulin said.\n\nPlenty of spokespeople will tell you that helping Americans make healthy choices, assisting them in managing their health, exercise and eating habits is a good thing. One only needs to spend time at the beach, or a theme park, to know we have a societal problem.\n\nBut is it the government\u2019s role to fix that?\n\nRonald Reagan famously said \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: \u2018I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data mining of health and life style information is happening now.
