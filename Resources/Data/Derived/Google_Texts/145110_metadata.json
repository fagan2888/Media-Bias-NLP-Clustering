But a new study finds that the solution may be right inside their kitchen cabinets. Honey, which has already shown some promise in treating wounds, may also be useful for fighting infections.\n\nIn a way, it makes sense. If honey can help treat wounds and prevent infection on the outside, then it could probably fight infections on the inside, too. \u201cThe unique property of honey lies in its ability to fight infection on multiple levels, making it more difficult for bacteria to develop resistance,\u201d said study leader Dr. Susan M. Meschwitz, of Salve Regina University in Newport, R.I., in a press release. Her findings were presented recently at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Council.\n\nHoney commits a multi-pronged attack on bacteria, as it uses hydrogen peroxide, acidity, osmotic effect, high sugar concentration, and polyphenols to kill bacterial cells. Together, these antibacterial properties make it difficult for the bacteria to adapt. Osmotic effect works particularly well due to honey\u2019s high sugar concentration, which sucks water out of the bacterial cells, dehydrating them, and leading to death.\n\nHoney also inhibits a bacterial cell\u2019s ability to communicate with other bacterial cells, known as quorum sensing. This renders them unable to form communities, and therefore unable to attack in large numbers, where they would normally be stronger. Meanwhile, polyphenols, or antioxidants, such as caffeic acid, p-coumaric, and ellagic acid contain antimicrobial properties. \u201cWe have separated and identified the various antioxidant polyphenol compounds,\u201d Meschwitz said in the release. \u201cIn our antibacterial studies, we have been testing honey\u2019s activity against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\u201d\n\nBacterial resistance, Meschwitz says, occurs when bacteria adapt to the antibiotics that are supposed to inhibit their growth processes. As their DNA adapts, they become immune to the antibiotic\u2019s effect, and therefore become even more dangerous. It has been said that if we continue using antibiotics unsparingly, previously eradicated diseases will come back and wreak havoc. In an effort to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use, which occurs in doctors' offices as well as industrial farms, both the health care community and the nation\u2019s regulators have been taking action and calling for reduced use.\n\nUntil antibiotic use is reduced to more manageable levels, scientists, it seems, will have to continue looking for new antibiotics.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "honey to fight bacteria, honey and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, honey fights bactieral infections, honey fights infection", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Honey is one of the latest promising solutions to fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a new study finds.", "title": "Fighting Antibiotic Resistance With Honey", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/honey-could-be-next-antibiotic-how-it-deals-multi-pronged-attack-infectious-bacteria-271357", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/honey.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Honey is one of the latest promising solutions to fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a new study finds.", "title": "Fighting Antibiotic Resistance With Honey", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/honey-could-be-next-antibiotic-how-it-deals-multi-pronged-attack-infectious-bacteria-271357", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/honey.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/16/honey.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-03-16T18:29:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-17T11:29:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Honey is one of the latest promising solutions to fighting antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24ab\"", "article_summary": "Honey also inhibits a bacterial cell\u2019s ability to communicate with other bacterial cells, known as quorum sensing.\nHoney commits a multi-pronged attack on bacteria, as it uses hydrogen peroxide, acidity, osmotic effect, high sugar concentration, and polyphenols to kill bacterial cells.\nAs their DNA adapts, they become immune to the antibiotic\u2019s effect, and therefore become even more dangerous.\nFrom sea bacteria to veterinary pain medications, scientists have been looking everywhere for a solution to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\nHoney, which has already shown some promise in treating wounds, may also be useful for fighting infections."}
