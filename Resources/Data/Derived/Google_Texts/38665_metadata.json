Those who were found to have above average looks ended up having a better chance of earning a four-year degree than those who were found to be less attractive.\n\nThe study s being published online this week in a book called \u0093Physical Attractiveness and the Accumulation of Social and Human Capital in Adolescence and Young Adulthood,\u0094 co-authored by Rachel Gordon, a professor of sociology at the University of Illinois-Chicago.\n\nThe study looked into how looks affected a high school student\u0092s performance in terms of GPA as well as future success down the road.\n\nOther research has found that attractive people generally do better in attaining better pay and promotions. Gordon told USA Today that this stems partly from getting a jump in high school due to better looks resulting in higher GPAs.\n\n\u0093The attractive do have a GPA advantage over the average,\u0094 Gordon told USA Today.\n\nGordon co-wrote the study with Robert Crosnoe, the Elsie and Stanley E. (Skinny) Adams Sr. Centennial Professor in Liberal Arts at the University of Texas at Austin; and Xue Wang, a graduate from the doctoral program in sociology at the University of Illinois \u2013 Chicago.\n\nThe study tracked the success of almost 9,000 students in college. Overall, one third of the students graduated, and of those students, those deemed at least somewhat attractive graduated at a rate three percentage points higher than others.\n\nThe success rate was about the same for those found to be most attractive and those who were found to be above average \u2013 which indicates that the important thing, in terms of attractiveness in the study, was to be above average, according to an article from Inside Higher Education. Students didn\u2019\u0092t need to be among the top tier of attractive people to get the benefits found in the study.\n\nStudents were assessed on a five-point scale. Researchers used a list of attractive qualities to judge students so that their own bias did not influence the scores.\n\nThere are some disadvantages to being attractive, according to the study. For example, those with above average looks tend to date more, have more sexual partners and participate in more heavy drinking.\n\nGordon told USA Today that the study is an important step in understanding the influence of good looks and helping teachers and students move past them to more substantial issues.\n\nGordon said the topic is important \u0093given that it\u0092s been looked at so little in academic literature.\u0094\n\nPlease follow and like us:\n\nPlease Leave A Comment\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looks, as it turns out, do matter.
