In fact, a new report suggests premiums for \u201cbenchmark\u201d Silver plans will actually be lower in many states next year.\n\nErstwhile ObamaCare booster Jonathan Chait calls this news \u201calmost unfathomably positive,\u201d while Ezra Klein brags that \u201cObama\u2019s signature accomplishment is succeeding beyond all reasonable expectation.\u201d\n\nSo how do Chait, Klein and company explain the fact that ObamaCare\u2019s ratings keep dropping?\n\nThe latest Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll finds only 35% of the public now holds a favorable view of ObamaCare \u2014 which is lower than it was when it officially launched in October. (Our latest IBD/TIPP poll finds disapproval rising.)\n\nMore damning is the reality that only 26% of the uninsured \u2014 the very people for whom ObamaCare was supposedly built \u2014 now view it favorably. In fact, the law has never been more unpopular with the uninsured since it went into full effect.\n\nSupport is slipping among Democrats \u2014 it fell to 57% in September from 70% last October \u2014 and fewer than a third of independents now support the law.\n\nThe poll also found that twice as many say they\u2019ve been hurt by ObamaCare as helped.\n\nEven the recent \u201cunfathomable\u201d successes turn out to be less than meets the eye.\n\nThat claim about 8 million signing up for ObamaCare plans? The truth is, no one knows for sure. The administration said 8 million had finished the application process. But it has since refused to release updates showing how many actually paid their initial premiums or are still covered.\n\nAnd as for those lower benchmark premiums, they are more a reflection of ObamaCare\u2019s temporary industry subsidies, which were included in the law for the express purpose of keeping rates artificially low in the first years (a fact liberals somehow always manage to leave out).\n\nWorse, these lower benchmark premiums could actually hurt those getting subsidized insurance.\n\nBecause of the Rube Goldberg subsidy scheme ObamaCare employs, \u201cmoderate rate actions, and even rate decreases, can translate into huge, net (after-subsidy) rate hikes,\u201d note the Wakely Consulting Group\u2019s Jon Kingsdale and Julia Lerche in a recent Health Affairs article.\n\nThat\u2019s because the amount of the subsidy is based on the cost of those \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans. The lower the benchmark, the smaller the subsidy.\n\nAdd to this the fact that many of the popular ObamaCare plans have sharply rising premiums, and what you get are potentially massive rate shocks for millions who want to stick with the plans they have.\n\nWhen it comes to ObamaCare\u2019s success, we\u2019ll take the public\u2019s view over those of cloistered liberal elites in Washington any day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unhealthy Reform: ObamaCare defenders keep insisting that the law is a huge success while public approval continues to deteriorate, even among Democrats and", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Unhealthy Reform: ObamaCare defenders keep insisting that the law is a huge success while public approval continues to deteriorate, even among Democrats and especially among the uninsured.It\u2019\u2026", "title": "Even The Uninsured Are Growing Sour On ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/obamacare/even-the-uninsured-now-hate-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-09-10 15:55:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-10T15:55:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That claim about 8 million signing up for ObamaCare plans?\nWorse, these lower benchmark premiums could actually hurt those getting subsidized insurance.\nThat\u2019s because the amount of the subsidy is based on the cost of those \u201cbenchmark\u201d plans.\nMore damning is the reality that only 26% of the uninsured \u2014 the very people for whom ObamaCare was supposedly built \u2014 now view it favorably.\nUnhealthy Reform: ObamaCare defenders keep insisting that the law is a huge success while public approval continues to deteriorate, even among Democrats and especially among the uninsured."}
