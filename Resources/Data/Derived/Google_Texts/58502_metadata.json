Bob Menendez, D-N.J., that was introduced on Monday would also elevate Puerto Rico's pension obligations to be senior secured debt, which presumably means they would have priority over the commonwealth's constitutionally backed general obligation debt since pension obligations are neither secured nor debt unless he's referring to pension bonds. Hatch said that proposal was \"irresponsible\" and instead called for \"at least some action to improve public pension reporting and transparency\" instead of allowing complete restructuring that would cause costs to go up because of \"bad and imprudent actors.\"\n\nIf both Republicans and Democrats are going to come to a consensus, Hatch said several things must happen, starting with serious attempts at consensual debt negotiations between Puerto Rico's government and its creditors. He also wanted to make clear that Republicans do not have any interest in helping \"vultures\" or \"speculators\" trying to make fast money from Puerto Rico debt, apparently referring to hedge funds. Individuals who have invested their retirement funds in Puerto Rico debt should not be given those labels, he said.\n\nIf Democrats are serious about putting forward \"practical and fiscally responsible legislation,\" Hatch said, they should show more interest in a bill that he and Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, introduced last year. The three senators lead the Senate committees with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico.\n\nTheir legislation would not give any restructuring authority but instead would establish an authority that could issue bonds and provide up to $3 billion in resources, taken from unallocated Affordable Care Act funds, to help Puerto Rico stabilize its budget and debt. The bill also calls for a number of studies, including on the commonwealth's pension plans and liabilities and the commonwealth's healthcare treatment by the federal government. Additionally, it would provide assistance to the island in improving its accounting and disclosure practices given the opacity of the commonwealth's current financial situation.\n\nWhile there are many proposals for the commonwealth currently floating in Congress, observers expect the House Natural Resources Committee to come out with a bipartisan proposal before a March 31 deadline House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., imposed late last year. Discussions for that proposal have centered on some type of restructuring paired with a federal oversight authority.\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who has been actively lobbying Congress for some type of restructuring authority, said in a press call earlier on Thursday that any legislation should also impose a stay on litigation over Puerto Rico's debt.\n\nThe commonwealth has two major payments looming in May and July. Garcia Padilla and others have said that without a congressional solution by that time, Puerto Rico will default on much of its debt.", "article_metadata": {"status": "open", "domain": "The Bond Buyer Online", "sailthru.author": "Jack Casey", "description": "Senate Finance Committee chair Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on Thursday called for Democrats and the administration to be more transparent and realistic, after proposing unworkable solutions to Puerto Rico s crisis as Congress continues to work toward bipartisan legislation for the commonwealth.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-04-17 17:38:00", "title": "Hatch Blasts Democrats Over Unworkable Puerto Rico Proposals", "og": {"url": "http://www.bondbuyer.com/news/washington-budget-finance/hatch-blasts-democrats-over-unworkable-puerto-rico-proposals-1099185-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.bondbuyer.com/media/newspics/hatch-orinn-bl092209-357.jpg", "site_name": "The Bond Buyer", "description": "Senate Finance Committee chair Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on Thursday called for Democrats and the administration to be more transparent and realistic, after proposing unworkable solutions to Puerto Rico s crisis as Congress continues to work toward bipartisan legislation for the commonwealth.", "title": "Hatch Blasts Democrats Over 'Unworkable' Puerto Rico Proposals"}, "type": "Article", "brand": "The Bond Buyer", "sailthru.date": "2016-03-17 17:38:00", "wordcount": 746, "robots": "noarchive", "sailthru.title": "Hatch Blasts Democrats Over 'Unworkable' Puerto Rico Proposals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=460455161", "featured": 0, "sailthru.tags": "Budget & Finance, Breaking News, Regional News, Legal and Bankruptcy, Puerto Rico, Today's Top Stories, Orrin Hatch, restructuring, Chapter 9, House, Senate, Senate Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley, Lisa Murkowski, debt relief, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, Super Chapter 9, Bob Menendez, Paul Ryan, pension obligations, territory-wide restructuring, debt negotiation, oversight board, healthcare, Medicaid, tax credit, Northeast, Article", "google-site-verification": "r6d19srFgTpMachoxP7AsSPo_VBkHIaJK2Jd0kuCDtw", "sailthru.description": "Senate Finance Committee chair Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on Thursday called for Democrats and the administration to be more transparent and realistic, after proposing \u201cunworkable\u201d solutions to Puerto Rico\u2019s crisis as Congress continues to work toward bipartisan legislation for the commonwealth.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.bondbuyer.com/media/newspics/hatch-orinn-bl092209-357.jpg", "news_keywords": "Orrin Hatch, restructuring, Chapter 9, House, Senate, Senate Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley, Lisa Murkowski, debt relief, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, Super Chapter 9, Bob Menendez, Paul Ryan, pension obligations, territory-wide restructuring, debt negotiation, oversight board, healthcare, Medicaid, tax credit"}, "article_summary": "Individuals who have invested their retirement funds in Puerto Rico debt should not be given those labels, he said.\nHis comments may not bode well for the development of bipartisan legislation that would provide relief for Puerto Rico.\nPuerto Rico Gov.\nThe three senators lead the Senate committees with jurisdiction over Puerto Rico.\nGarcia Padilla and others have said that without a congressional solution by that time, Puerto Rico will default on much of its debt."}
