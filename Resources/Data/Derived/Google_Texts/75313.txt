Taofor Lee has been a part-time dealer at Tropicana for almost nine years, but with no health care it's been at least six years since the 57-year-old Chinese immigrant has seen a doctor. "I'm getting older and I'm worried about my health," Lee said through a translator. Lee was one of a dozen casino workers who attended an informational session hosted through the United Auto Workers union at the Tropicana this week as the union hopes to help its members - and eventually the surrounding community - sign up for health care under the Affordable Care Act.
