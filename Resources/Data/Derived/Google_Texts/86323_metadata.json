Adults stand about 8 inches tall at the shoulder and can stretch about 2\u00bd feet from head to backside. Their tails can be just as long and provide good balance when navigating though trees while hunting for prey. Their teeth, jaws and partially retractable claws resemble those of a cat, but their agility has been described as almost primate-like. They can hang upside down and quickly climb to the top of a tree,\u201d the zoo said.\n\nThe animals are native to Madagascar and weigh about 20 pounds.\n\nRico was born July 28 to parents Violet and Dorian, who came to Denver from zoos in Omaha and Utah, respectively.
