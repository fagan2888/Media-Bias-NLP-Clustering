A Tampa man who tried to hang himself at the Pinellas County Jail on Friday has died, the Pinellas County Sheriffâ€™s Office said.

According to deputies, England Wilson, 32, 908 E. 17th Ave., died from his injuries at 7:30 p.m. today at a local hospital.

At about 8:15 a.m. Friday, as detention deputies were getting inmates out for recreation at the South Division area of the Pinellas County Jail,14400 49th St. N., Clearwater, they found Wilson hanging from his cell gate with a sheet tied around his neck.

Deputies cut Wilson down and began CPR. He was transported to a local hospital, where he died.

Wilson was being held at the jail for the U.S. Marshals Service after he and Shamorcus Brandan Nesbitt, 27, were arrested this week on a host of federal robbery and firearms charges stemming from a series of 19 robberies between December and mid-May.
