So far, the Obama-era IRS has succeeded in hounding nonprofit tea-party groups into political irrelevancy. By holding up rulings on nonprofit status, the IRS ensured that the Tea Party\u2019s big political wins of 2010 would not be a factor in the president\u2019s 2012 reelection bid. Disgraced former IRS official Lois Lerner headed the division that focused inordinately on conservative groups.

According to FCC commissioner Ajit Pai, Obama\u2019s agency, until outrage arose, had planned \u201cto ask station managers, news directors, journalists, television anchors and on-air reporters to tell the government about their \u2018news philosophy\u2019 and how the station ensures that the community gets critical information.\u201d In other words, Obama FCC appointees dreamed of predicating federal licensing on having politically correct views similar to their own.\n\nEnemies?

In truth, the attack was an organized terrorist hit facilitated by our own lax security.\n\nDinesh D\u2019Souza has written and filmed some very unflattering things about Obama. He might be as openly critical of the president as Daniel Ellsberg once was of Nixon. In January, the office of Obama-appointed U.S. attorney Preet Bharara indicted D\u2019Souza on federal charges of violating campaign-finance laws. If convicted, D\u2019Souza could be imprisoned for up to seven years. Usually, those accused of such transgressions face far lesser charges involving fines.\n\nSpeaking of the Obama Justice Department, its former Office of Public Affairs director, Tracy Schmaler, was reported to have worked closely with the George Soros\u2013funded Media Matters for America on stories slamming critics of the administration. When the story alleging this public-private political partnership came out, Schmaler resigned \u2014 and then went to work for former Obama political operative David Axelrod.\n\nGoing after reporters? Obama regularly blames Fox News by name for its criticism. In 2008, he seemed to enter into a personal grudge match with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity.\n\nIgnoring the law? The Affordable Care Act as currently administered bears little resemblance to the law that was passed by Congress and signed by the president. Federal immigration law is now a matter of enforcing what the president allows and ignoring the rest.\n\nWiretaps? Well, aside from the electronic surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency, the Obama Justice Department secretly monitored Fox News reporter and sometime critic James Rosen. The Justice Department even seized his e-mails and phone records in fear that he might publish administration leaks. To hide these shenanigans, the Justice Department fraudulently dubbed Rosen a flight risk and a possible criminal co-conspirator.\n\nThere are a few differences, however, between the transgressions of Nixon and Obama, and America\u2019s reaction to each.\n\nThe old watchdogs of civil liberties that took on Nixon \u2014 the American media of the Watergate era \u2014 are now silent. Obama is not right-wing, easily caricatured, unappealing, or an old anti-Communist agitator but an iconic liberal, charismatic, and, in the past, an experienced community organizer. A Democratic Senate majority now has little interest in auditing Obama, though it once zealously pounced on Nixon\u2019s misdeeds.\n\nIf you once suggested that Nixon\u2019s team was violating constitutional principles, you were hailed as speaking truth to power. Try that with progressive Obama and you are likely to be caricatured as some sort of embittered tea-party zealot at best, a retrograde racist at worst. Nixon ended impeached and disgraced; Obama may well enjoy a lucrative and in-demand post-presidency.\n\nBoth presidents once had enormous potential and high poll ratings, but their treatment of the Constitution was as Orwellian as it was unnecessary.
