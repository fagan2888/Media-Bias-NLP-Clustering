I think we need him,\u201d Sharp, 20, said.\n\nAfter attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., Rubio returned to Florida on Saturday to convince Floridians of the same. The Florida primary is scheduled for March 15.\n\nIntroduced by Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez, Rubio used the rally to reflect on priorities he has frequently shared on the campaign trail: his desire to enact term limits in Congress, to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s executive orders and Obamacare, to leverage a more aggressive war against terrorism and threats to America from Russia, China and North Korea.\n\nHe briefly acknowledged his Democratic opponents \u2014 he focused on Bernie Sanders\u2019 embrace of socialist political ideologies and criticized Hillary Clinton in an oft-repeated bit about how her decision to use a private email server while serving as secretary of state \u201cdisqualifies\u201d her for the presidency. And while Rubio did not devote the majority of his time talking about Trump, an anti-establishment candidate who has defeated Rubio in every primary thus far, there was a quiet urgency to remarks made by him and others who believe the future of traditional conservatism relies on a Rubio win.\n\n\u201cConservatism is not an attitude. Conservatism is not how loud can you be, how offensive can you be, how many bad words can you say, how many ridiculous things can you say on television,\u201d Rubio said to the crowd, before criticizing Trump's unwillingness to take sides in conflicts in Israel and comparing Trump to former Florida Gov. Charlie Christ, whom he told the crowd he had called out for \u201cmasquerading as a conservative,\u201d during his 2010 run for U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny how history repeats itself,\u201d Rubio said to cheers.\n\nHis most relatable moments were during a pledge to improve conditions for U.S. military veterans and the retelling of his parents\u2019 journey from Cuba to Florida, where he said his \"American Dream\" was made possible.\n\nIt\u2019s a story that appeals to young couple Mallory and Ruben Bosque.\n\n\u201cHe relates to the people that are really working hard out there,\u201d said Ruben Bosque, who comes from a Cuban family. \u201cHe\u2019s been in our shoes. He knows firsthand how it is.\u201d\n\nMallory Bosque said she appreciates Rubio's consistency on issues.\n\n\u201cI feel like Trump is all business,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the background knowledge. Marco lays it on the line. Those are his goals. He doesn\u2019t jump around.\u201d\n\nBut what if Rubio lost the nomination to Trump as projected? Would they vote for Trump?\n\nThe couple looked at each other and grimaced.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't smile,\u201d Ruben Bosque said. \u201cI would go in there with a frown, but I guess I\u2019d have to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "JACKSONVILLE \u2014 Scattered between the war veterans in baseball hats and families with children in tow, a group of young people waited for Marco Rubio to arrive in Jacksonville, one of the first communities to support Rubio's 2010 U.S. Senate run, the presidential candidate would later say.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-E04F9845-437F-40DD-88B8-787C870844F7-pubGS"}, "og": {"site_name": "Gainesville.com", "description": "JACKSONVILLE \u2014 Scattered between the war veterans in baseball hats and families with children in tow, a group of young people waited for Marco Rubio to arrive in Jacksonville, one of the first communities to support Rubio's 2010 U.S. Senate run, the presidential candidate would later say.", "title": "In Jacksonville, Rubio talks top priorities", "url": "http://www.gainesville.com/article/20160305/WIRE/160309802", "image": {"width": 160, "identifier": "http://www.gainesville.com/global/images/fb/GS.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 160}, "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20160305, "fb": {"admins": 100001603422190, "app_id": 191331304228818}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-160309802-pubGS"}}, "keywords": "UNITED STATES,  Politics,  Politics (general),  Article,  Wire Stories"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe relates to the people that are really working hard out there,\u201d said Ruben Bosque, who comes from a Cuban family.\nAfter attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington, D.C., Rubio returned to Florida on Saturday to convince Floridians of the same.\n\u201cI wouldn't smile,\u201d Ruben Bosque said.\nIt\u2019s a story that appeals to young couple Mallory and Ruben Bosque.\nJACKSONVILLE \u2014 Scattered between the war veterans in baseball hats and families with children in tow, a group of young people waited for Marco Rubio to arrive in Jacksonville, one of the first communities to support Rubio's 2010 U.S. Senate run, the presidential candidate would later say."}
