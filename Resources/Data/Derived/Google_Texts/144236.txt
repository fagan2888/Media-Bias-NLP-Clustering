Investigators are trying to determine the case of a fire that destroyed a museum in Larned, Kansas.

Firefighters from Larned and Great Bend were called around 2 p.m. Friday to the Central States Scout Museum in the 800 block of Broadway. The Larned Tiller and Toiler said crews responded to the report of a bottled-gas fuel heater fire that began in the back room of the museum.

Museum curator Charles Sherman told officials he believed that the fire began in what was formerly the dormitory of the museum on the buildingâ€™s west side. No injuries were reported.

Sherman said the building is a total loss.

The building was originally built in 1948 as an automobile dealership, the Tiller and Toiler reports.
