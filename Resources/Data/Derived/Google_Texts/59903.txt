Here comes a spoiler for tonight’s episode of “Game of Thrones,” which will be better remembered as Joffrey and Margaery’s wedding.

Do they know how to throw a wedding on this series or what?

We’d barely caught our breath after last season’s famed Red Wedding installment when the lovely outdoor festivities of the king’s wedding left us stunned. The build up, with offensive dwarf pantomimes and other slights, still didn’t prepare us (non-readers of the books) for the foaming-at-the-mouth, raving, paralyzing poisoning that was to come.

HBO had asked critics not to mention that a pivotal episode was coming tonight, nor who was involved, so here’s hoping viewers shared the surprise. The sadistic, sociopathic King Joffrey, (played by the amazing Jack Gleason), got his comeupance. His bride Margaery Tryell (Natalie Dormer) got what she should ultimately consider the wedding gift of a lifetime. Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) endured hideous abuse from the King and then ended up accused of the murder he did not commit. Sansa (Sophie Turner), who was spirited away and who last week made a strange new friend in Ser Dontos Hollard (Tony Way), may know something about this turn of events. Then again, the Red Viper, Prince Oberyn Martell, is in town for the nuptials and has pledged to repay debts. What did he mean by that, beyond acting out at the brothel last week?

After the initial gasp, a couple of thoughts: credit to the writers-producers for being unafraid to kill off key characters in this sprawling epic. We’ve known from the first that nobody on “GoT” is safe when it comes to shedding blood/trimming the cast. We’ve seen plenty of deaths by sword; they caught us offguard here. Also, Gleason has been a consistently intriguing, fascinating presence playing this evil young royal. He will be greatly missed. And Joffrey, the most hated character in the entire series, the one who made our skin crawl, he’ll be missed, too.
