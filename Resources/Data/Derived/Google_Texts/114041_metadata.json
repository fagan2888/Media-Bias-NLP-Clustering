Marco Rubio saying \u201cThis election is about the future.\u201d The Republican candidates are then featured in a quick montage saying they want to roll back the policies set by President Obama. \u201cRepeal every rule that Obama has\u2013\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is seen saying. \u201cObamacare has to be repealed,\u201d Carly Fiorina says. The debate segments of the candidates saying \u201crepeal\u201d are then shown next to scenes from Clinton\u2019s campaign announcement video and film footage of Obama emerging from Air Force One, all played backwards.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\n\u201cAmericans have come too far to see our progress ripped away,\u201d Clinton says at the end of the video in a line taken from her campaign launch in June.\n\nClinton has emphasized her closeness to President Obama in this election cycle, saying that she would preserve Obama\u2019s legacy and seek to build on his policies. She has also said she would go further than the President in a number of issues, including on immigration and Wall Street reform.\n\nLeft unsaid in the video is the contrast between Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s chief challenger for the Democratic nomination, who wants to replace Obamacare with a single-payer system, and said in 2011 that Obama would benefit from facing a primary challenger.\n\nClinton began stepping up the rhetoric against Republicans this summer, criticizing Republicans for being too extreme on issues ranging from abortion and immigration to gun control and Wall Street regulation. She will seek to make the argument that Republican Party is far out of step with the American mainstream, an argument that bears out in some polls: the GOP had a 32% favorability rating, according to a Pew survey, compared with 48% favorability for the Democratic party.\n\nThe candidates in the primary debates have expended much of their energy attacking the leaders of the other party already. Most of the shots in the Republican debate were directed at Hillary Clinton: Fiorina said a Clinton presidency would be disastrous for veterans, Donald Trump again called her the worst Secretary of State in history, Ted Cruz said Clinton \u201cembodies the cronyism of Washington\u201d and many boasted they could defeat Clinton in a general election.\n\nRead more: Here\u2019s What Democratic Operatives Thought of the Republican Debate", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's campaign will release a video on Thursday attacking the Republicans for seeking to roll back President Obama's policies", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Using their words.", "title": "How Hillary Clinton Is Targeting Republican Candidates", "url": "http://time.com/4110301/hillary-clinton-republican-video/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hillary-clinton-democrat-presidental.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/hillary-clinton-democrat-presidental.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Using their words.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Hillary Clinton Is Targeting Republican Candidates"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "hillary clinton republicans, hillary clinton bernie sanders, hillary clinton video, hillary clinton gop debate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "hillary clinton republicans, hillary clinton bernie sanders, hillary clinton video, hillary clinton gop debate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f4d\"", "article_summary": "The 28-second campaign video provides a window into the kind of contrast Clinton will set with the Republicans in a general election, with the campaign painting Republican candidates as backward-looking and out of touch.\nClinton has emphasized her closeness to President Obama in this election cycle, saying that she would preserve Obama\u2019s legacy and seek to build on his policies.\nThe video begins with Florida Sen.
