Ted Cruz and others level that the businessman has not been a consistent conservative. \u201cUsually, I just invoke the name Ronald Reagan,\u201d Trump replied.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cI mean, Ronald Reagan was a fairly liberal Democrat, and he evolved over years and he became more and more conservative. And he was not a very conservative person, but he was pretty conservative. And he ended up being a great president,\u201d the candidate added.\n\nCruz does not believe Trump\u2019s comparison to Reagan is accurate. \u201cI would note that Ronald Reagan spent decades as a principled conservative, spent decades traveling the country sharing his conservative, free-market views [and] defending the Constitution,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\u201cRonald Reagan did not spend the first 60 years of his life supporting Democratic politicians, advocating for big government politics, supporting things like the big bank bailouts, supporting things like expanding Obamacare to turn it into socialized medicine,\u201d the Texas senator added.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nReagan was a Democrat who supported Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s and Harry Truman in the 1940s. In the 1950s, he joined the \u201cDemocrats for Eisenhower,\u201d backing the popular World War II general who successfully ran and won under the Republican banner.\n\nReagan changed his party affiliation in 1962 (when he was 51), and threw his full support behind conservative Sen. Barry Goldwater in the 1964 presidential campaign. The Hollywood actor then ran for office himself later in the decade as a Republican, being elected twice as governor of California.\n\nReagan would say when explaining his switch to the GOP, \u201cI didn\u2019t leave the Democrat Party, the party left me.\u201d\n\nThe three legs of Reagan conservatism are: limited government/pro-growth fiscal policies, a strong national defense, and support for traditional values.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWhen asked to define what a conservative is during his Face the Nation interview on Sunday, Trump responded, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a person that doesn\u2019t want to take overly risks. I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Trump responded.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a person that wants to \u2014 in terms of government I\u2019m talking about \u2014 a person that wants to conserve, a person that wants to, in a financial sense, balance budgets, a person that feels strongly about the military. And I feel very strongly about the military,\u201d he added.\n\nWhat the candidate failed to discuss was traditional values. Trump\u2019s bona fides in this area are already suspect with many social conservatives because the billionaire candidate described himself as very pro-choice in 1999 and has voiced support for certain homosexual rights, though he has not backed same-sex marriage.\n\nNational Review dedicated an issue last week to arguing why Trump is not a conservative, hitting on his changing views on social issues, past support for Democrat candidates, and support of certain \u201cbig government\u201d programs and bailouts.\n\nTrump responded:\n\nNational Review is a failing publication that has lost it\u2019s way. It\u2019s circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad! \u2014 Donald J.
