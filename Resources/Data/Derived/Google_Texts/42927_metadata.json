A rate increase of 10% on a government mandated insurance?\u201d a ConnectiCare customer wrote in a comment submitted to the Connecticut Insurance Department. \u201cMy monthly rate is already $433.48.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you give us a break? I'm trying to provide the best health care for my kids and you make it more difficult each year!\u201d another customer wrote. \u201cI might as well just drop insurance altogether. This is so discouraging.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis increase would probably make me opt to pay the fine for not having insurance,\u201d an Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield customer wrote.\n\nThe insurance department published comments on three companies\u2019 proposed rate hikes in advance of next Monday\u2019s public hearing on the proposals. Anthem is seeking to raise rates by an average of 4.7 percent on plans that cover 55,000 people, while ConnectiCare is seeking a 9.8 percent rate hike for plans that cover 34,400 people. Golden Rule, which covers 3,414 people, has proposed an 18.5 percent rate increase.\n\nThe rate increases subject to the hearing are for plans sold through the state\u2019s individual market and, if approved, would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. Some of Anthem\u2019s plans are sold through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT, while all of the ConnectiCare and Golden Rule plans subject to the hearing are sold outside the exchange.\n\nSeveral people who submitted comments said they wouldn\u2019t be able to afford the proposed premiums and expressed frustration that insurance costs rise faster than wages. Most comments were published without writers\u2019 names.\n\n\u201cIf I can get a pay increase to sustain me with [this] insurance premium increase then ok. Maybe you should talk to my employer. Let me know how that works out,\u201d a ConnectiCare customer wrote.\n\n\u201cWhoever allows this rate increase to occur will cause my family to sink farther into debt until we can no longer afford health insurance at all. Not only will we be forced to pay a penalty, but we will have to avoid seeking healthcare for what could be serious issues,\u201d wrote an Anthem customer who pays nearly $300 per month for a plan that is subsidized by the federal government.\n\nAffordability has been a key theme among people who have testified at past health insurance rate hearings. But insurance department officials have noted in the past that state law gives them narrow parameters for considering a rate hike. In a decision last year that called for Anthem to reduce its proposed rate hike, insurance department actuary Paul Lombardo noted that state law allows the insurance commissioner to reject rates for three reasons: if they\u2019re inadequate, excessive, or unfairly discriminatory.\n\nOne commenter suggested that Anthem\u2019s proposal should be considered excessive since health care inflation has been below 3 percent in the U.S. for the past two years.\n\nIn their filings, insurers cited expectations that the cost of covering health care claims would rise in 2016, particularly for prescription drugs.\n\nA consulting firm, Wakely Consulting Group, submitted comments on the Anthem proposal on behalf of Access Health CT, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. The comments were based on the company\u2019s initial filing, which has since been revised. Wakely suggested that the assumptions behind Anthem\u2019s proposal were \u201csomewhat conservative,\u201d and recommended that some factors that contributed to the rate increase be removed, while others be backed up with more details.\n\nMany of those who submitted comments said they have not seen rising prices matched by better coverage or service. Many noted that they have high-deductible plans that require them to pay thousands of dollars toward their care before the insurer begins chipping in.\n\n\u201cIf I were to become ill, even with a minor ailment, it will still leave me in financial distress despite having insurance,\u201d one customer wrote.\n\n\u201cThis insurance plan that I was forced to take by our [government] is not working for me. But yet I'm being forced to have it. Now the rate is going up. I have no source of action. There is nothing I can do but to urge you not to let this increase happen,\u201d Anthem customer James F. Moraveck Jr. wrote.\n\nOther commenters took aim at insurance company executive salaries.\n\n\u201cAsk their CEO's to take a salary and bonus cut instead,\u201d an Anthem customer wrote.\n\n\u201cWhen I read about CEO's multi-million-dollar packages and insurance company's rate increases, my blood boils,\u201d wrote another customer. \u201cI am in the healthcare business as a provider and daily learn how families have to opt out of getting their child's medication or recommended surgery because of the high deductibles and decreased coverage.\u201d\n\nGolden Rule\u2019s proposal generated only one comment: \u201cDo not increase their rates.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/20/ct-insurance-customers-urge-regulators-to-reject-rate-hikes/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 2016 insurance rates, Affordable Care Act, Connecticut Insurance Department, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/07/20/ct-insurance-customers-urge-regulators-to-reject-rate-hikes/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "\u201cCan you give us a break?
