Downtown St. Andrews went back in time Saturday night. Five local businesses along the south end of Beck Avenue joined forces to put on their third annual Rock 'n' Roll Block Party.

Classic rock enthusiasts came together to enjoy their favorite music, tell stories and trade some of their collection of vinyl records.

"I would say in the last three months I hear all the time 'we had no idea St. Andrews had this much to do.' I am thrilled, I have been sitting on this corner praying for it for about nine years," said Joan Canal, Owner of Hectic Eclectic. "I wish everybody would come out and enjoy the beauty we get to participate in everyday."

They also held a look-alike contest where you are invited to dress as your favorite rockers like Madonna and Jimmy Buffet.

The businesses that participated were:

Hectic Eclectic

Floriopolis

Sunjammers Watersports

Mariner's Daughter

Star Gallery
