Meyer, Holzer Health System CEO, said. \u201cWhile these efforts helped us to maintain our not-for-profit community hospital system, unfortunately, it has not been enough to address the sweeping changes in the healthcare environment. This national situation placed us in a regrettable position. We must now take additional action to ensure the long-term financial health and stability of Holzer so that we may continue providing the excellent health care our patients deserve for many years to come.\u201d\n\nHolzer officials said that prior to Monday\u2019s announcement of layoffs the hospital was actively reducing costs by eliminating duplication of services because of a merger in 2012 of Holzer Clinic and Holzer Consolidated Health Systems, divesting excess property holdings and renegotiating supply contracts.\n\n\u201cAs is being experienced by health systems throughout the country, inpatient service volumes decreased nearly 15 percent while reimbursement for services continues to decline, and cost of care delivery continues to rise,\u201d wrote Karrie Swain Davison, Holzer communications coordinator, in a press release. \u201cOperational expenses in the most recent fiscal year exceeded revenues by more than $1.2 million, resulting in the unmanageable decline in revenue necessitating a reduction in force.\u201d\n\nEmployee notifications began Monday and will continue through Oct. 30.\n\nHolzer officials said they will offer support for the affected employees by providing separation pay and other outplacement services, such as job placement assistance and career support.\n\n\u201cHolzer Health System remains committed to the health and well-being of the residents of southern Ohio and western West Virginia,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIt is the hope of all involved in this difficult decision that the community hospital that (has) provided for the health care needs of the region since 1910 will continue its legacy of excellent patient-centered care for future generations.\u201d\n\nHolzer Health System officials on Monday said a planned \u201creduction in force\u201d will eliminate about 100 jobs throughout its various locations in southern Ohio and western West Virginia. http://mydailytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/web1_DSCN4895.jpgHolzer Health System officials on Monday said a planned \u201creduction in force\u201d will eliminate about 100 jobs throughout its various locations in southern Ohio and western West Virginia.\n\nMichael Johnson michaeljohnson@civitasmedia.com\n\nReach Michael Johnson at 740-446-2342, ext. 2102, or on Twitter @OhioEditorMike.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-OH", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Gallipolis", "og": {"site_name": "Gallipolis Daily Tribune", "description": "GALLIPOLIS \u2013 Holzer Health System is reducing its workforce.
