Evanston could get its second federally qualified health center soon, if city officials approve a requested zoning variation

Access Community Health Network, which now has a facility at 7464 N. Clark St. in Chicago, wants to relocate it to 1723 Howard St. in Evanston, a vacant office building that formerly housed a construction company.

Just 17 months ago the first such health center opened in Evanston, a branch of Erie Family Health, after a roughly two-year campaign that involved winning federal, foundation and hospital grants to help subsidize the center's operation at its facility at 1285 Hartrey Ave., and providing temporary office space for it at the Evanston Civic Center.

The developers of the new Access site plan to tear down the office building next door at 1719 Howard St. to expand the available parking for the facility from eight to 19 spaces. But that's still four spaces less than require under the city's zoning code -- which means the project will require a zoning variation.

The developers have conducted a traffic study which indicates there is sufficient on-street parking near the site to meet the expected parking demand.

Access is affiliated with Presence St. Francis Hospital. The hospital's president, Dr. Roberta Luskin-Hawk, has written a letter in support of the variation request, in which she says the center "will provide tremendous community benefit" by expanding access to affordable, comprehensive health services.

The planned facility would have 17 exam rooms and would operate from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday and on Saturday mornings.

The project is scheduled to be reviewed by the city's Design and Project Review Committee Wednesday afternoon The committee will make a recommendation about the variation to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
