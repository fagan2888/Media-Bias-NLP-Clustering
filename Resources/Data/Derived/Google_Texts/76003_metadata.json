In 2009, a few months after his inauguration, he made history by becoming the first sitting president to ever appear on a late night talk show as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. From then on, he has been a regular on the late night couch, slow-jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon, dancing with Ellen DeGeneres, and reading mean tweets with Jimmy Kimmel. In anticipation of his final appearance tonight on Jon Stewart\u2019s The Daily Show (his seventh!), we looked back and chose our favorite moments from President Obama\u2019s late night stints.\n\nWhen he was still a presidential candidate in 2007, Obama stopped by Ellen and performed the requisite intro dance to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy in Love.\u201d\n\nExpand\n\nAs part of his promotion of the Affordable Care Act, Obama showed off his comedic chops on Zach Galifianakis\u2019s faux cable broadcast show, Between Two Ferns, where he was introduced as Barack Obama, \u201ccommunity manager.\u201d We\u2019re still marveling at his ability to keep a straight face.\n\nAfter Stephen Colbert declared no politician could ever do his job, Obama immediately proved him wrong by delivering The Word\u2014or in this case The Decree\u2014on The Colbert Report.\n\nHoping to pass a bill that would stop student loan interest rates from rising, Obama slow-jammed the news on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nDuring David Letterman\u2019s farewell tour, Obama joked about retirement and suggested that he and Dave should play dominoes once he\u2019s out of the White House.\n\nOn Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s popular \u201cCelebrities Read Mean Tweets\u201d segment, Obama cracked a smile after someone tweeted their distaste for his mom jeans.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "President Barack Obama, The Daily Show, late night talk shows, Between Two Ferns, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Colbert Report, The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live, late night television", "author": "Patricia Garcia", "og": {"site_name": "Vogue", "description": "In anticipation of his final appearance tonight on The Daily Show, we looked back and picked President Obama's funniest stints on late night.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Funniest Late Night Appearances", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://media.vogue.com/r/pass/2015/07/21/obama-jon-stewart-holding.jpg", "height": 1216}, "url": "http://www.vogue.com/13286549/obama-late-night-daily-show/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Vogue", "description": "In anticipation of his final appearance tonight on The Daily Show, we looked back and picked President Obama's funniest stints on late night.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Funniest Late Night Talk Show Appearances", "image": {"src": "http://www.vogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/21/obama-jon-stewart-holding.jpg"}, "creator": "@voguemagazine", "site": "@voguemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1087973225, app-argument=http://www.vogue.com/13286549/obama-late-night-daily-show/, affiliate-data=ct=smart-banner&pt=45076", "template": "article", "articleSection": "Culture", "keywords": "Culture, TV, President Barack Obama, The Daily Show, late night talk shows, Between Two Ferns, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, The Colbert Report, The Tonight Show, Late Show with David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live, late night television, mobileAppReadyTrue", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/vogue"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obama\\u2019s Funniest Late Night Appearances\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.vogue.com\\/13286549\\/obama-late-night-daily-show\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/media.vogue.com\\/r\\/c_1,h_560,w_560\\/2015\\/07\\/21\\/obama-jon-stewart-holding-560x560.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"13286549\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-07-21T17:26:43Z\",\"section\":\"Culture\",\"authors\":[\"Patricia Garcia\"],\"tags\":[]}", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width", "description": "In anticipation of his final appearance tonight on The Daily Show, we looked back and picked President Obama's funniest stints on late night."}, "article_summary": "), we looked back and chose our favorite moments from President Obama\u2019s late night stints.\nHoping to pass a bill that would stop student loan interest rates from rising, Obama slow-jammed the news on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.\nIn 2009, a few months after his inauguration, he made history by becoming the first sitting president to ever appear on a late night talk show as a guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\nFrom then on, he has been a regular on the late night couch, slow-jamming the news with Jimmy Fallon, dancing with Ellen DeGeneres, and reading mean tweets with Jimmy Kimmel.\nPresident Obama is no stranger on the talk show circuit."}
