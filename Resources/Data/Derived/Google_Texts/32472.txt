Continued funding for the Ingham Health Plan debated as U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare looms. Current State speaks with Tim Daman of the Greater Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce and County Commissioner Robin Naeyaert.

County officials continue to debate what to do about millions of excess dollars for funding the Ingham Health Plan. For years, the plan has funded medical services for the county’s neediest residents who could not afford health or medical insurance. But with the advent of Obamacare and medicaid expansion, the plan serves thousands fewer county residents than in the past.

Since last fall, when voters approved an extension of the millage used to pay for the plan, the health plan’s fund balance has grown to around $10-million. That’s led to calls both to re-divert the surplus as well as to return it to taxpayers. It’s also created confusion over whether officials misjudged the situation in the months leading up to the millage.

Two weeks ago, Current State talked with Dr. Dean Sienko, Vice Chair of the Board of the Ingham Health Plan and Democratic County Commissioner Deb Nolan. Today, Current State talks with two others: Republican Commissioner Robin Naeyaert and the CEO of the Greater Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce, Tim Daman.
