Last week, Mr. Obama named Ashton Carter as his latest secretary of defense.\n\nMr. Colbert charged that hiring so many Pentagon leaders in recent years has been the primary reason for job growth.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s boosted our numbers a little bit,\u201d Mr. Obama conceded.\n\nStill, the president, as he often does during late-night TV appearances, managed to largely stick to White House talking points on the economy, health care, immigration reform and the midterm election results.\n\nMr. Obama conceded that the November contests didn\u2019t go as he would\u2019ve liked, but he seemed to dismiss the notion that voters specifically rejected Democrats.\n\nIn fact, he said voters \u2014 young voters in particular \u2014 simply didn\u2019t come out to the polls because they\u2019re sick of everyone in Washington.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point, people say, \u2018You know what? It\u2019s just not going to make a difference.\u2019 Part of my job for the next two years, and hopefully part of the job of Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, is to convince people that even in divided government, we can still put the American people ahead of politics,\u201d Mr. Obama said.\n\nThe president again zeroed in on income inequality while defending his larger economic record.\n\n\u201cOverall, what we have not seen is income growth and wage growth. Corporate profits are [at] a record high, you got the stock market at a record high, but that has not translated into ordinary [people] getting enough of the share of growing productivity,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Obama also stressed that his recent executive action on illegal immigrants was done \u201clawfully.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "He's often been accused of abusing his power, but a tongue-in-cheek President Obama took that notion to new heights Monday night as he booted Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert from his own show, commandeering the late-night program to give it a more \"presidential\" feel.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "He\u2019s often been accused of abusing his power, but a tongue-in-cheek President Obama took that notion to new heights Monday night as he booted Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert from his own show, commandeering the late-night program to give it a more \u201cpresidential\u201d feel.", "title": "Obama commandeers Colbert Report, promotes Obamacare, pushes agenda", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/8/obama-commandeers-colbert-report-promotes-obamacar/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/08/obama-colbert-report-jpeg-03f7b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/08/obama-colbert-report-jpeg-03f7b.jpg", "description": "He's often been accused of abusing his power, but a tongue-in-cheek President Obama took that notion to new heights Monday night as he booted Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert from his own show, com", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama commandeers Colbert Report, promotes Obamacare, pushes agenda"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Politics, Stephen Colbert"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc18\"", "article_summary": "Last week, Mr. Obama named Ashton Carter as his latest secretary of defense.\nMr. Obama also stressed that his recent executive action on illegal immigrants was done \u201clawfully.\u201d\nMr. Colbert charged that hiring so many Pentagon leaders in recent years has been the primary reason for job growth.\n\u201cThat\u2019s boosted our numbers a little bit,\u201d Mr. Obama conceded.\nMr. Obama conceded that the November contests didn\u2019t go as he would\u2019ve liked, but he seemed to dismiss the notion that voters specifically rejected Democrats."}
