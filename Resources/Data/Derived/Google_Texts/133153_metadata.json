Late-night comedy is a staple for those of us who are constantly up \u2018til all hours courtesy of insomnia, and we count on it for our evening injection of humor and, truth be told, a reason to live. Before we had Twitter to help us survive the late-night hours, we had television, and that means we have a certain affection for the icons of late night. For the rest of us, there\u2019s the occasional next day viral video from Jimmy Fallon to give a taste of what we missed.\n\nBut who would it be? Rumors swirled that perhaps CBS was finally willing to put a woman at the helm, exciting news indeed given that this is an absolutely incredible era for female comedians. From Comedy Central\u2018s Broad City to USA\u2019s Playing House, women are all over the airwaves being painfully funny; they\u2019re producing their own films, they\u2019re rocking the standup scene, and they\u2019re taking their acts on tour. While the female comedy scene is dominated, as is the male one, by straight white women, there are tons of queer women and women of color as well\u2014we\u2019re living in a rich, diverse time for women in comedy.\n\nCBS is known for being a conservative network, so no one wanted to get too wild with the speculation, but perhaps they could replace a white guy with a white lady, in a daring act of progressivism. If they really mustered up their gumption, maybe they could choose a black woman, eh? Thus, we waited with bated breath for the grand announcement, while the Internet swirled with commentary\u2014an illustration of how digital forces are influencing television networks.\n\nOr are they? Because the grand reveal was that James Corden would be the replacement. Oh, look, another white guy comedian. He\u2019s British, though, so I guess that gets him an extra diversity credit, right? Corden, an actor on Gavin & Stacey and Doctor Who, isn\u2019t very well-known in the United States, although he\u2019s appeared on a variety of U.K. shows. He has no late-night hosting credits in his repertoire, although he has hosted a couple of low-level awards shows in the U.K. His resume certainly isn\u2019t as impressive as that of many of the women who could have replaced him\u2014or even Chelsea Handler, who went to Netflix instead.\n\nIn fact, one might argue that his qualifications actually doesn\u2019t speak that well of him. On Horne & Corden, his attempt at co-hosting a sketch show, ratings dipped fast after initial interest, which raises some questions about his writing chops and acting abilities. Corden actually admitted that his sketch writing skills were weak, which does not exactly inspire confidence among those who\u2019d like to see a strong comedic presence on late night. Sketches are key to a successful late night show, and someone who can\u2019t engage with that kind of humor is going to get into trouble fast.\n\nThe main thing going in his favor is his presence on Twitter, as he has approximately four million Twitter followers. CBS, notoriously laggy when it comes to digital culture, may have thought that hiring him would be a sharp, progressive move for getting ahead of the curve and drawing in a socially engaged audience. (Late night TV tends to perform better in older, middle-aged white dude audiences, while digital culture could appeal to a younger generation.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tapping Colbert as Letterman's replacement was a stroke of genius.
