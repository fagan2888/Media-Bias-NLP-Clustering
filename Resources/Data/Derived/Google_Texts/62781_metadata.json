In D.C., restaurant hourly employees are not eligible for paid sick leave, not even for the few dollars tipped employees make hourly. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nWhen one of Losia Nyankale\u2019s two kids wakes up sick, she usually scrambles to find a caretaker or grabs the cold medicine and pushes the ailing child out the door and onto the school bus.\n\nA more difficult option is calling out sick, because Nyankale, 29, is a server at Dupont Circle\u2019s Luna Grill and Diner. Her occupation is not covered by the District\u2019s law requiring employers to offer sick leave.\n\nA proposed law to be introduced Tuesday would change that by expanding landmark legislation from 2008 that guaranteed nearly universal paid sick leave in the District but excluded tipped wait staff, including most servers, bussers and bartenders.\n\nCouncil member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8) and Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) plan to introduce the measure Tuesday. They have several co-sponsors.\n\nThe Paid Sick Days for All Coalition has been advocating for the change for almost two years. Organizers and volunteers have canvassed neighborhoods and gathered signatures. \u201cThis is something that people simply don\u2019t know about,\u201d said organizer Sarah Brammer Shlay.\n\nFive years ago, the D.C. Council passed the Accrued Sick and Safe Leave Act, making Washington the second city in the country to require employers to offer paid sick leave. The first was San Francisco. Depending on the size of the firm, D.C. businesses must provide employees between three and seven paid sick days each year. But unlike San Francisco\u2019s law, the District\u2019s measure carved out an exemption for \u201crestaurant wait staff and bartenders who work for a combination of wages and tips.\u201d It also excludes certain health-care workers.\n\nDetractors said the law would threaten the city\u2019s economy. It presents a \u201crisk to small and local businesses\u2019 survival,\u201d Barbara Lang, president and chief executive of the D.C. Chamber of Commerce, testified in 2007.\n\nA D.C. government audit released in June, however, concluded that the requirement \u201cneither discouraged business owners from locating in the District nor encouraged business owners to move their business from the District.\u201d\n\nSome continue to argue that extending sick leave to tipped workers would be bad for the bottom line and discourage growth in an industry that employs more than 48,000 people in the District.\n\nRestaurant owners are already being forced to adjust to provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Kathy Hollinger, president and chief executive of the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington, said in a statement. \u201cThe additional requirements that would arise with paid sick day legislation would be prohibitive to the creation of jobs.\u201d\n\nAndy Shallal, owner of the Busboys & Poets and Eatonville restaurants, disagrees. Shallal, who says he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d a run for mayor, has been an outspoken advocate for paid sick leave for restaurant workers and said he has offered it to all of his own workers since 2008 without harm to business. \u201cWhen I talk to my restaurant friends, the one thing they ask often is, \u2018Will people abuse it?\u2019 But that hasn\u2019t been our experience,\u201d he said. And for public health reasons, restaurant workers shouldn\u2019t be compelled to work when they\u2019re sick, he said.\n\nNearly 60 percent of such workers admitted to working while sick, according to a study conducted by ROC-DC, a group that tries to improve wages and working conditions for restaurant workers. It\u2019s an industry norm, said LaDawn Harris-Robinson, who has worked as a waitress at the steakhouse Smith & Wollensky for about two years. \u201cI\u2019ve had pretty much everything\u201d and still come to work over the past 15 years of serving and tending bar, she said, ticking off a list of ailments: bronchitis, sinusitis, a fractured foot, severe morning sickness. \u201cThere was a time when I was throwing up two to three times a day.\u201d\n\nThe District\u2019s 2008 law requires workers to be on the job for a year and work 1,000 hours before they can use paid sick leave, which advocates say is unfair in an industry where turnover is high. The bill that Barry plans to introduce would lower the waiting period to 90 days. It also would mandate that tipped wait staff earn no less than $10 an hour.\n\nAt least nine council members agree, having signed an ad in this week\u2019s edition of the Washington City Paper in support of the legislation.\n\n\u201cWe are always looking for ways to strike a balance between worker protections and the needs of our business community,\u201d said council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), a mayoral candidate. \u201cThe negative impacts that some thought would happen didn\u2019t happen. . . . It\u2019s time to have a more comprehensive policy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "dcpolitics, d.c. politics, Marion Barry, paid sick days, wait staff, bartenders, waitresses, waiters, Washington, D.C., sick leave,", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Tipped wait staff was excluded from the landmark 2008 legislation; new proposal would reverse that.", "title": "D.C.
