Herb Slatery will be Tennessee’s next attorney general for the next eight years.

Slatery, chief legal counsel to Gov. Bill Haslam, will replace Bob Cooper, who sought to keep the job.

State Supreme Court justices announced their pick for the state’s top attorney at a news conference Monday. Tennessee is the only state in which the court appoints the attorney general.

"I am profoundly grateful for this opportunity," Slatery said at the press conference.

He practiced law for 30 years in Knoxville before joining the Haslam administration in 2011.

On Twitter, the governor described Slatery as "a thoughtful and strategic leader."

The justices narrowed the field to six candidates last week after a public hearing and private interviews. Other finalists were Eugene Bulso, Mark Fulks, state Sen. Doug Overby and Bill Young.

"He is an excellent lawyer with proven leadership ability and sound judgment," Chief Justice Sharon Lee said.

According to news reports, the justices did not take questions at the news conference.

The decision comes on the heels of an unsuccessful effort to unseat Lee and Justices Cornelia Clark and Gary Wade in the Aug. 7 retention election.

Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey’s political action committee funded most of that effort with $425,000 in donations, campaign finance records show. He and other Republican lawmakers were critical of Cooper because he refused to join other states’ attorneys general in a challenge of the Affordable Care Act.

"As the first Republican attorney general in Tennessee history, Herbert Slatery will be a strong advocate for the people of Tennessee and a vigilant defender of Tennessee’s conservative reforms," Ramsey wrote on Facebook.
