They are now linked to a national investigation into graffiti tagging in San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, OKC and Tulsa.\n\nIn fact, court records show two of them - Yeakey and Gaby - now face charges for being in possession of 350 spray paint cans, $15,000 and 36 pounds of marijuana. And Oklahoma City Police say one of them \u2013 Gaby - is a student at OSU.\n\nWhile both the city and county do what they can to clean up the mess left behind by the taggers, plenty keeps popping up elsewhere. So that's why local law enforcement is cracking down on graffiti taggers everywhere.\n\n\"We typically pursue the gang graffiti vandal and the tagger vandal, said Sgt. Brad Harper, a detective with the graffiti unit at the Oklahoma City Police Department. \"They've got a huge fan base - and it's not just with these specific taggers, it's taggers nationwide.\"\n\nPolice and county officials are cracking down on taggers. By erasing their calling cards, and levying steep penalties and fines -all in an effort to curtail the problem. And what some consider art, police and county officials consider a crime - especially if it is done on public or private property without permission.\n\n\"I have never seen anything that I think is beautiful enough that I'd want it spray painted on my house,\" said Brian Maughan, Oklahoma County Commissioner for District 2.\" I don't call it art, I call it ugly.\"\n\nMaughan also helped start the SHINE program, which stands for Start Helping Impacted Neighborhoods Everywhere. Maughan says it is a comprehensive initiative he started a few years ago. It uses people assigned to do community service and provides a way to clean up his district.\n\nFind out more about the SHINE program!\n\nAnd police say if you notice someone tagging public or private property, call them immediately.\n\nOklahoma city is one of the few departments across the country that has a designated graffiti investigations unit that does file felony crimes against these taggers. They also help with cleanups.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Police arrested 26-year-old Paul Yeakey of Broken Arrow, 24-year-old Hillary Gaby of Edmond and 29-year-old Victor Reyes of Chicago, Illinois.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24936034/viz-l3-index-three-arrested-for-graffiti-crimes-across-the-metro", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24936034_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Police arrested 26-year-old Paul Yeakey of Broken Arrow, 24-year-old Hillary Gaby of Edmond and 29-year-old Victor Reyes of Chicago, Illinois.", "title": "Three Arrested For Graffiti Crimes Across OKC, Surrounding Areas"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24936034_SA.jpg", "description": "Police arrested 26-year-old Paul Yeakey of Broken Arrow, 24-year-old Hillary Gaby of Edmond and 29-year-old Victor Reyes of Chicago, Illinois.", "card": "summary", "title": "Three Arrested For Graffiti Crimes Across OKC, Surrounding Areas"}, "wnreadableurl": "viz-l3-index-three-arrested-for-graffiti-crimes-across-the-metro", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "date": "2014/03/10", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,graffiti,taggers,art,arrested,news9.com,", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS04", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,graffiti,taggers,art,arrested,news9.com,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd857f\"", "article_summary": "On Monday, Oklahoma City police announced three people arrested for tagging graffiti around the city - are wanted for several other charges across the country.\nThese three people were arrested last November in Oklahoma City, accused of applying graffiti to private property.\nThey are now linked to a national investigation into graffiti tagging in San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, OKC and Tulsa.\nBrad Harper, a detective with the graffiti unit at the Oklahoma City Police Department.\nSo that's why local law enforcement is cracking down on graffiti taggers everywhere."}
