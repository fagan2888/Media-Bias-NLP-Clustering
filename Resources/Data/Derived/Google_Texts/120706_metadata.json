Planeloads of aid material, doctors and relief workers from neighboring countries began arriving today.\n\nNepal bore the brunt of the quake's impact and officials say the death toll is expected to climb. Among the dead are 17 who were struck by a quake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest that buried part of the base camp.\n\nMost areas remain without power and water.
