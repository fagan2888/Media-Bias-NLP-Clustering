In it, he suggested the city allocate $2 million towards the effort, which he called the Neighborhood Safety Grant Program. Neighborhoods, under the proposal, could have applied for funding to install burglar alarms, safety sensor lights and to \u201coffset the costs of private security patrols,\u201d he wrote in the memo.Kalra said burglaries going \u201cthrough the roof\u201d prompted him to make the recommendation.\u201cI think we need to do whatever we can to make our neighborhoods as safe as possible,\u201d Kalra said in an interview.\n\nAt the Oct. 7 council meeting council members \u2013 uncomfortable with what they described as a step towards privatization of the police force \u2014 declined to advance Kalra\u2019s recommendation to a vote.\n\n\u201cI know that he\u2019s not saying that\u2019s his preferred method, but I\u2019m not sure our police department wants us \u2014 to see us \u2014 hire privately police to take over the function of the police department. I do think we need to engage the neighborhoods. So I strongly support the sentiment but I won\u2019t be supporting the motion,\u2019\u2019 Councilwoman Rose Herrera told the council, according to a transcript of the meeting.But Tom Saggau, spokesperson for the city\u2019s Police Officers\u2019 Association, said the union had backed the councilman\u2019s idea because the police need help.\u201cI mean, this is unprecedented, that a city \u2014 the 10th largest city in the nation \u2014 would say \u2018look we can\u2019t protect you, so here\u2019s some money neighborhoods, go protect yourselves,\u2019\u201d Saggau said in an interview.The Police Officers\u2019 Association says for certain that the shrinking number of officers is linked to the increasing rate of San Jose property crimes. \u201cThe fact of the matter is, this city\u2019s crime rate continues to increase, \u201d Saggau said.Kalra\u2019s recommendation came in the wake of shrinking recruitment and higher resignation rates in the number of street-ready San Jose law enforcement officers. While the police department has the budget for 1,250 officers, the current number of sworn-in, deployable officers stands at 894, a police department spokesman said.\u201cIf you look at the facts, they\u2019re not coming, and they\u2019re certainly not coming in the numbers that would allow us to fully restore our burglary unit, yet the burglaries still happen and the neighborhoods are still clamoring for help,\u2019\u2019 Kalra said.The rising crime rates and dropping officer numbers have been major points of contention in this year\u2019s mayoral race. The police association has publicly endorsed candidate Dave Cortese in hopes that new city leadership might help alleviate the growing public safety concern.\n\nNearby cities like Oakland have a history of working with private security companies. Oakland approved the use of public funds to pay for private armed guards in response to high crime rates in 2009. But supplementing the police force with private contractors would have been unusual for San Jose.\n\nWith so few officers per capita, average wait times for San Jose 911 calls have averaged 20 minutes, Saggau said. Judge LaDoris Cordell, of the Independent Police Auditor\u2019s office, said delayed emergency response is one of the public\u2019s top concerns.\u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that the delay in response times, and complaints about officers not showing up have to do with their not being staffed,\u201d Cordell said.One major problem is getting qualified candidates to join the police force. Police academy enrollment is at only a third of its capacity. While the police force saw just a handful of resignations per year a decade ago, now as many as 90 officers, sergeants, and detectives are leaving San Jose annually in favor of other Bay Area forces with better employee benefits and protections, Saggau explained.\u201cI just got a text message this morning, four more \u2014 two sergeants and two officers \u2014 fifteen or eighteen years experience, are leaving, \u201d Saggau said on Oct. 6, pulling the resignation texts up on his phone with an unsurprised look.Cordell said the struggle for pension reform \u2014 another major issue in this year\u2019s mayoral race \u2014 is tied to the retention problem.\u201cThere will be more retiring out, or leaving for greener pastures, because they\u2019re offered better benefits,\u201d Cordell said in an interview.Though the council denied Kalra\u2019s appeal for neighborhood funding to hire private security, Kalra said in an Oct. 21 statement that he would continue to look for \u201ccreative ways\u201d to help the neighborhoods combat crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Despite a depleted police force and rising crime, the council rejected Councilman Ash Kalra's recommendation to provide neighborhoods with funds to hire private security personnel and deploy other safety measures.", "title": "'Private security patrols' a no-go as San Jose City Council rejects safety grant program - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/San-Jose-Police-Badge.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-30T19:40:30+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/23/san-jose-neighborhood-safety-grant-program/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Crime", "tag": "San Jose Police Department", "published_time": "2014-10-23T06:36:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-30T19:40:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite a depleted police force and rising crime, the council rejected Councilman Ash Kalra's recommendation to provide neighborhoods with funds to hire private security personnel and deploy other safety measures.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/San-Jose-Police-Badge.jpg", "title": "'Private security patrols' a no-go as San Jose City Council rejects safety grant program - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7705\"", "article_summary": "Councilman Ash Kalra outlined the recommendation in an Oct. 6 memo to San Jose council members.\nBut supplementing the police force with private contractors would have been unusual for San Jose.\nWith so few officers per capita, average wait times for San Jose 911 calls have averaged 20 minutes, Saggau said.\nIn it, he suggested the city allocate $2 million towards the effort, which he called the Neighborhood Safety Grant Program.\nDespite a depleted police force and a rising crime rate, the San Jose City Council has rejected a councilmember\u2019s recommendation to provide neighborhoods with funds to hire private security personnel and deploy other safety measures, a suggestion that had the support of the city\u2019s police union."}
