You just can't make this stuff up. This is what was presented as Fox Fact on Tuesday's Fox & Friends.\n\nIn yet another glaring example of the Fox News disconnect with reality, this morning's Fox & Friends featured a discussion of mainstream media bias with a representative from the Media ResearchCenter, a far right group that is dedicated to exposing all that nasty anti-American, anti-Christian stuff that Fox & Friends just wallows in. On Tuesday's Fox & Friends, human sock puppets Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Scott Brown did more wallowing.\n\nIn yet another glaring example of Fox & Friends irony, Hasselbeck began by citing coverage of - wait for it - Benghazi and then proclaimed that \"it's been a banner year for bias in the mainstream media, to say the least.\" Brown informed us that the Media ResearchCenter annually ranks \"the worst offenders.\" Naturally, he didn't mention the right wing ideology behind the MRC. He introduced his guest, Genevieve Wood who was one of the MRC ranking judges. While he noted that she is a contributor to the Daily Signal, he didn't mention that this is an arm of the right wing Heritage Foundation.\n\nThe first award was for CNN's Jeff Zucker whose crime was saying that his network wasn't going to be \"shamed\" into covering Benghazi on behalf of a political ideology. In yet another moment of irony, Wood said that with media bias \"it's not just what people say, that can be biased. It's what news organizations choose to cover or not to cover.\" (Oh, like how Fox minimally covered gay marriage while providing saturation coverage of the ACA's contraceptive mandate?)\n\nShe praised Fox News for its Benghazi coverage because with it, there would have been \"no coverage.\" (Fox ignored the recent congressional report that debunked Fox's Benghazi myths.) More irony with the chyron \"Not Fair Nor Balanced.\" Wood continued to bray about the negligence of the mainstream media regarding Benghazi. Brown who, despite Fox's support, lost his last two Senate bids, blithered about Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi. Hasselbeck affirmed his comment and added some agitprop about how this was \"brushed under the rug.\"\n\nThe next award went to CBS's Scott Pelly who said that the CBO's claim, that jobs will be lost under the ACA, was referring to those who choose to work less - a comment that was accurate because, as Politifact explains it, \"The CBO report says that with Obamacare providing greater access to insurance on the individual market and subsidies to help pay for it, some Americans will decide on their own to work less.\" Wood used Pelley's words to describe how it \"should have been reported\" in the verbiage of right wing propaganda. Nobody mentioned that we've had 57 straight months of job growth.\n\nThe \"classless award\" went to CNN's Carol Costello who, OMG, had the audacity to \"mock\" Bristol Palin's description of the brawl that she and her family were involved in - a brawl that, if perpetrated by black people, would have been seen by Fox as another example of degenerate black culture. Hasselbeck gasped as she said \"how personally aggressive can you get.\" (Like when Megyn Kelly slut shamed Sandra Fluke?) More irony with Wood's comment about how Costello is \"a news anchor\" and \"talk about letting your opinion show through.\"\n\nThe last award was for \"twisted tweets\" which went to Politico's Roger Simon who had the audacity to mock Rick Perry's call for more border control. (Meanwhile we have Fox's Todd Starnes out and out racist tweets). Wood defended Perry because he wants to protect the border which, she claimed, Obama isn't doing. Brown reinforced the right wing lie. (Obama has deployed more protection to the border than any president.)\n\nFox & Friends actually thinks that the mainstream media is biased? Seriously? Talk about letting your opinion show through! And when we're talking \"worst of the worst,\" we could be describing Fox & Friends.
