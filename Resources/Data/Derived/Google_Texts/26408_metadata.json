Photo-ops often ensue, with a folding table covered with packages of drugs and usually an assortment of weapons as well.\n\nSounds good, but not if you know what actually follows. Without losing a beat, the drug dealers in the show had often recruited even younger boys, black adolescents, too young to go to prison, who are back on the corners and in the projects selling the very same types of drugs that were confiscated. Sometimes the source for the substances had to change, from Maryland to Pennsylvania, from New York to New Jersey, for example, but that meant nothing more than an extra hour or two in the car, delivering the goods for local distribution.\n\nWhat remained unchanged is the ubiquity of available, illegal drugs; unsafe neighborhoods; the murderous violence of the drug culture and its leaders; and the power and financial success of the dealers who become heroes for the young to emulate creating the next generation of dealers and users.\n\n[OPINION: America Is Neglecting Its Addiction Problem]\n\nWhen the determined police detectives in \"The Wire\" tried to raise the game past \"buy-bust\" and work to \"follow the money,\" they got closer to the roots of the supply chain and its corrupt enablers in government, the police and business. But they were cut short of rooting out the big guys or the corruption; better a photo-op than undermining the edifice of greed and exploitation that marks the illegal drug industry. Their due is that they are posted to awful police jobs and kept from advancement, making it clear to others that trying to actually topple the drug trade will get you exiled and punished in your own department.\n\nTom Wainwright's 2015 book \"Narconomics,\" which I reviewed, shows how supply-side interventions, like crop control, interdiction and \"buy-bust\" are as useless in Colombia and Mexico as they are on the streets of Baltimore, New York and London. Efforts to control the supply do not work: Drug access goes unfettered, while the prices that users pay are barely impacted.\n\nPresident Barack Obama recently advanced a set of actions that may curtail this demand and end the wasting of precious resources and pursuit of useless supply-side efforts in the face of a growing drug epidemic and death toll. Foremost among the president's proposals is the accent on treatment. The National Institute on Drug Addiction estimates that \"every dollar invested in addiction treatment programs yields a return of between $4 and $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft. When savings related to healthcare are included, total savings can exceed costs by a ratio of 12 to 1.\" These estimates do not convey the individual, family and social costs of drug abuse and addiction, which include enormous human suffering, unemployment, disability, domestic violence, teenage pregnancy and multi-generational poverty.\n\n[READ: Obama Is Right, Fighting Drug Addiction Is a Bipartisan Issue]\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Addiction data also underline the treatment gap, the difference between those afflicted and those who receive care. Their 2011 estimates are that only about one in 10 get the treatment they need (21.6 million persons aged 12 or older who have an illicit drug or alcohol use problem with 2.3 million receiving specialty substance use disorder treatment).\n\nIf treatment is not delivered according to known, quality principles, we will soon be writing about the folly of treatment. Effective substance use treatment is based on a set of common sense practices. First is early intervention \u2013 the sooner the better. This calls for early detection of alcohol and drug use in schools and the workplace; in pediatric and family practice settings; and for adults in primary care practices and emergency rooms. Second is comprehensive services. A singular reliance on recovery programs (like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous) does not suffice: patients (and families) need to be offered and receive motivational enhancement strategies; cognitive-behavioral therapy; family support; relapse prevention skill-training; and medication assisted treatment (including buprenorphine, Vivitrol and methadone).\n\n[READ: 10 Ways to Combat America's Drug Abuse Problem]\n\nThird is that treatment must be continuous and long-lasting. We don't imagine that 28 days of diabetes or heart disease treatment will suffice, nor that stopping and starting it will work. Yet few people with substance use conditions have access, and payment coverage, for uninterrupted treatment that goes on for years. Fourth, and perhaps done the least, is so-called treatment to target. When hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, even depression (increasingly) are treated, there is a quantifiable measure of the disease or its consequences that is measured and tracked, which allows patient, family and treating clinicians to know if the efforts employed are working \u2013 and when not, to make course corrections. The \"target\" is one or more measures, including laboratory and self-reports and the use of administrative data on truancy, work absenteeism and high-cost medical services, which are too high at baseline and will improve when the disease is under control.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Policy Dose [Opinion]", "title": "Substance Use Treatment Works Better Than Any War on Drugs", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Early intervention and treatment are more effective at combating addiction than any war on drugs.", "title": "The Folly of Supply-Side Drug Intervention", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/policy-dose/articles/2016-04-19/substance-use-treatment-works-better-than-any-war-on-drugs", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6c/6f/c10d51224a4992bebead49070116/160418-drugbust-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Substance Use Treatment Works Better Than Any War on Drugs", "description": "Early intervention and treatment are more effective at combating addiction than any war on drugs.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 19, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lloyd Sederer,drugs,drug abuse,War on Drugs,addiction,Policy Dose [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Early intervention and treatment are more effective at combating addiction than any war on drugs."}, "article_summary": "Efforts to control the supply do not work: Drug access goes unfettered, while the prices that users pay are barely impacted.\n[READ: Obama Is Right, Fighting Drug Addiction Is a Bipartisan Issue]The National Institute on Drug Addiction data also underline the treatment gap, the difference between those afflicted and those who receive care.\nThe National Institute on Drug Addiction estimates that \"every dollar invested in addiction treatment programs yields a return of between $4 and $7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft.\nYet few people with substance use conditions have access, and payment coverage, for uninterrupted treatment that goes on for years.\nIf treatment is not delivered according to known, quality principles, we will soon be writing about the folly of treatment."}
