Employees reportedly spend their days staring at their computers, according to a KMOX-TV report.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re told to sit at their computers and hit the refresh button every 10 minutes, no more than every 10 minutes,\u201d the employee said. \u201cThey\u2019re monitored, to hopefully look for an application.\u201d\n\nThe employee accused Serco of attempting to conceal the lack of work as it continues to hire employees for processing centers in Missouri, Kentucky and Oklahoma. The employee said Serco is compensated for each worker it hires.\n\nThe Centers for Medicaid and Medicare services told KMOV-TV in a statement that \"Serco is committed to making sure federal funds are spent appropriately, and the number of Serco staff is reviewed on a regular basis.\"\n\nLast year, the British government launched an investigation into the firm's parent company, Serco Group, for allegedly overbilling the government by \"tens of millions of pounds\" under a contract to monitor offenders on parole and individuals released on bail, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThe Obama administration defended the high-dollar contract at the time.\n\n\"Serco is a highly skilled company that has a proven track record in providing cost-effective services to numerous other federal agencies,\" then-Medicare spokesman Brian Cook said. \u201cThe company has provided exceptional records management and processing support to other federal agencies, similar to work they will do for the marketplace.\"", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-31 06:19:19 EST",
