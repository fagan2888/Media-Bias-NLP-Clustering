The remaining 20%, roughly $20 million, \u201cis at risk, tied to specified outcomes and improvement goals that we develop jointly,\u201d Burton said.Both Allina and Health Catalyst will use data analytics to identify potential improvement targets. A committee of executives from both organizations will set goals for the risk-sharing, quality and cost-improvement portions of the contract.\u201cIt's a little intimidating, because it requires you to put your money where your mouth is,\u201d Burton said. \u201cWe do believe one of the gaps over the decade with healthcare technology is we've spent tens of billions of dollars on healthcare technology without the accountability to make sure we move the needle. This is the kind of structure that keeps everybody focused on meaningful outcomes improvement.\u201dSixty Allina employees have accepted employment at Health Catalyst as part of the deal. The Health Catalyst newcomers will receive an ownership interest in the company, which ranked 17th on Modern Healthcare's 100 Best Places to Work in Healthcare in 2014. Also, while not specifying the equity share, Burton acknowledged that Allina has become \u201ca meaningful owner in Health Catalyst.\u201dAllina, a 12-hospital, 90-clinic provider network, is not alone in taking an ownership stake in Health Catalyst. In 2013, Health Catalyst scored a series of cash and prestige coups when the investment arms of other well-known provider organizations\u2014 Partners HealthCare , Boston; Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, Calif.; and Indiana University, Bloomington\u2014invested $8 million and took equity in the company.Allina was the first customer of Health Catalyst when the data warehouse developer formed in 2007, Burton said.But Allina also had developed data-mining and analytics capabilities in-house that other healthcare organizations might be able to use, said Allina President and CEO Dr. Penny Wheeler. As the two organizations kept in touch, Allina learned that Health Catalyst was developing data analytics tools that Allina hadn't, \u201cand we couldn't necessarily do that internally,\u201d Wheeler said. Without the new tools, \u201cWe might not be able to invest in the services we wanted to.\u201dHealth Catalyst could benefit from Allina's expertise in how to best implement and use new data analytics tools, she said. Allina is one of the original 32 Pioneer accountable care organizations, for example, and one of about a dozen that produced gross savings in 2012 and 2013.Providers have been bulking up on data analytics contracts since the advent of ACOs and other performance-based payment mechanisms promoted under the Affordable Care Act.\u201cAs we evolved independently, we realized they had the knowing part and we could do the doing part,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cAt this part of the evolution, the one plus one could be three.\u201dWith the agreement, \u201cThey get some very smart people from our organization that have developed predictive models,\u201d Wheeler said, while Allina will benefit as those former employees work in other organizations and learn from them.Follow Joseph Conn on Twitter: @MHJConn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Provider network Allina Health, Minneapolis, is outsourcing its IT data warehousing, analytics and performance improvement areas to Health Catalyst, Salt Lake City, in a deal designed to foster cost-cutting and quality improvements.", "title": "Allina outsources IT in 10-year, potential $108 million deal", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Provider network Allina Health, Minneapolis, is outsourcing its IT data warehousing, analytics and performance improvement areas to Health Catalyst, Salt Lake City, in a deal designed to foster cost-cutting and quality improvements.", "title": "Allina outsources IT in 10-year, potential $108 million deal", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150106/NEWS/301069936", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Provider network Allina Health, Minneapolis, is outsourcing its IT data warehousing, analytics and performance improvement areas to Health Catalyst, Salt Lake City, in a deal designed to foster cost-cutting and quality improvements.", "title": "Allina outsources IT in 10-year, potential $108 million deal", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150106/NEWS/301069936", "published_at": "2015-01-06", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b89\"", "article_summary": "The Health Catalyst newcomers will receive an ownership interest in the company, which ranked 17th on Modern Healthcare's 100 Best Places to Work in Healthcare in 2014.\nAs the two organizations kept in touch, Allina learned that Health Catalyst was developing data analytics tools that Allina hadn't, \u201cand we couldn't necessarily do that internally,\u201d Wheeler said.\nThis is the kind of structure that keeps everybody focused on meaningful outcomes improvement.\u201dSixty Allina employees have accepted employment at Health Catalyst as part of the deal.\nThe remaining 20%, roughly $20 million, \u201cis at risk, tied to specified outcomes and improvement goals that we develop jointly,\u201d Burton said.Both Allina and Health Catalyst will use data analytics to identify potential improvement targets.\nWithout the new tools, \u201cWe might not be able to invest in the services we wanted to.\u201dHealth Catalyst could benefit from Allina's expertise in how to best implement and use new data analytics tools, she said."}
