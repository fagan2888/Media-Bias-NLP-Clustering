Springfield, FL---It's been four years since the Rutherford Rams boys basketball team has made it to Lakeland for the Final Four. Tonight, they were just one game away from booking their ticket back there and continuing to chance a state title.

Facing Bishop Kenny. A packed house for this one as the Rams sensing the moment, took advantage early.

Gabe Steele opened the game with a three. How about another. That moves the Rams up four early.

The Crusaders tie it, but Steele then dishes to Josh Wade who cuts to the basket to retake the lead.

Rutherford builds momentum. Lose ball, Steele is able to corral it, drives to the bucket but isn't able to get. Keith Arts is like man I got your back. The lead at 10.

Second quarter, Khaliel Spearman, catches fire. Three from the wing is good. Not enough though for Khaliel, he wants more.

Spearman, brings the ball up the court, and hits another deep bomb. He's partying, Rams fans are partying.

They go up 32-16 at the half and go on to win 63-52. The Rams are in the Final Four where they'll play American Heritage in the state semis.

Steele led the way with 19 points, while Spearman poured in 18.
