Orchard owns Blair, Huband, Norm Thompson, Solutions, Sahalie, Gold Violin, Appleweeds, Tog Shop, LinenSource, Drapers & Damons, Old Pueblo Traders, Bedford Fair and WinterSilks

Capmark Financial Group is buying a direct marketing retail business that focuses on seniors, Orchard Brands Corp., for $410 million in cash.

Orchard Brands, headquartered in Beverly, Massachusetts, sells apparel, accessories and home products for men and women through catalogs, mailers, e-commerce and 30 retail stores. The groups brands include Blair, Huband, Norm Thompson, Solutions, Sahalie, Gold Violin, Appleweeds, Tog Shop, LinenSource, Drapers & Damons, Old Pueblo Traders, Bedford Fair and WinterSilks. The companys products are aimed at baby boomers and seniors. (See related graphic.)

Orchards Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based buyer is a holding company that also owns Bluestem Brands Inc., which operates Fingerhut, Gettington.com and PayCheck Direct. Bluestreams companies sell general merchandise to low and middle-income consumers in the U.S. Capmark expects the Orchard acquisition to diversify Bluestreams customer base and expand its retail capabilities.

Orchard had $1.02 billion in net sales for the period ended Dec. 27, and Ebitda of $70.7 million.

Goldman Sachs is Orchards financial adviser, while Schulte Roth & Zebal is providing legal advice. Capmarks financial adviser is Morgan Stanley & Co. and its legal counsel is Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP as well as Faegre Baker Daniels LLP. Capmark is making the acquisition with a combination of cash and new debt. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc. are underwriting a term loan, and Credit Suisse and U.S. Bank NA are leading an asset-based credit facility.

Other recent retail deals include Sycamore-backed Hot Topic Inc.s acquisition of pop-culture themed retailer Geeknet Inc., announced earlier in May, and Ascenas deal for Ann Inc., the owner of Ann Taylor and Loft.
