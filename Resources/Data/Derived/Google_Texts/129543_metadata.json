The celebration will include the opening of the Zuni Youth Enrichment Project summer camp, a lunch at the Zuni Comprehensive Community Health Center, and youth soccer activities.\n\nLMIC is part of the Let\u2019 s Move!

LMIC is a federal interagency team coordinated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) that works in partnership with tribal governments, urban Indian health centers, and private organizations to advance the health of Native youth. LMIC accomplishes this goal by encouraging daily physical activities and good nutritional choices among individuals, families, and tribal communities.\n\nThe Pueblo of Zuni was chosen for this year\u2019s celebration because of its longstanding commitment to community-based approaches to preventing childhood obesity. The Pueblo of Zuni offers interactive, fun, and free activities for children all year round to help them stay active and healthy.\n\nThe event will be hosted by a number of organizations, including the IHS, Notah Begay III Foundation, Nike N7 Fund, Zuni Youth Enrichment Project, and Zuni Wellness Center.\n\nThe IHS, an agency in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, provides a comprehensive health service delivery system for approximately 2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who are members of federally recognized tribes.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "On June 16, Let\u2019 s Move! in Indian Country (LMIC) celebrate its third anniversary at the Pueblo of Zuni in New Mexico.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/14/lets-move-indian-country-celebrate-third-anniversary-zuni-pueblo-155308", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/lmic.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Let's Move! in Indian Country to Celebrate Third Anniversary at Zuni Pueblo"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-14T11:11-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/14/lets-move-indian-country-celebrate-third-anniversary-zuni-pueblo-155308", "dc": {"title": "Let's Move! in Indian Country to Celebrate Third Anniversary at Zuni Pueblo"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Let's Move! in Indian Country to Celebrate Third Anniversary at Zuni Pueblo"}, "article_summary": "in Indian Country (LMIC) celebrate its third anniversary at the Pueblo of Zuni in New Mexico.\nThe celebration will include the opening of the Zuni Youth Enrichment Project summer camp, a lunch at the Zuni Comprehensive Community Health Center, and youth soccer activities.\nThe event will be hosted by a number of organizations, including the IHS, Notah Begay III Foundation, Nike N7 Fund, Zuni Youth Enrichment Project, and Zuni Wellness Center.\nThe Pueblo of Zuni offers interactive, fun, and free activities for children all year round to help them stay active and healthy.\nOn June 16, Let\u2019 s Move!"}
