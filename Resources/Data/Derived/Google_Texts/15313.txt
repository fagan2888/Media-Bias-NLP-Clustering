American International Group (AIG) joins State Farm and USAA as insurance carriers granted exemptions by the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones for certain insurance inspections.

The FAA will allow the insurers to use unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, to perform tasks that the insurers say are too risky for humans, such as roof inspections after a major storm.

AIG said the use of drones will keep inspectors safe and speed up the claims process, which means its customers will, in theory, get paid faster.

“UAVs can help accelerate surveys of disaster areas with high resolution images for faster claims handling, risk assessment, and payments,” according to an AIG statement. “They can also quickly and safely reach areas that could be dangerous or inaccessible for manual inspection, and they provide richer information about properties, structures, and claim events.”

The FAA’s exemption also allows AIG to expand its drone research here in the States, after previous flight tests were conducted in New Zealand.

“AIG is committed to continuous improvement and innovation in providing better, faster, and safer risk and claims assessments to our customers,” said Eric Martinez, Executive Vice President, Claims and Operations, AIG. “Leveraging cutting edge technologies like UAVs can enhance our ability to assess and mitigate risks to better help our customers and their communities prepare for and rebuild after a catastrophic event.”
