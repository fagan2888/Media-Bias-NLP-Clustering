The celebration of Thomas Edison's birth is underway. The inventor would have turned 169 this year.

In honor of Edison, Fort Myers holds the annual Edison Festival of Light, and on Saturday, kids and adults alike were at Harborside Event Center for the STEMtastic Day of Discovery.

It gave them the chance to learn about science and math, with help from the Lee County School District.
