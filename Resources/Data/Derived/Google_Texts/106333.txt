Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index Chart from Gallup shows pattern of the percentage of uninsured Americans

As the Obama administration was gearing up to release new enrollment numbers for the Affordable Care Act later in the day, a new poll released Wednesday shows that the number of uninsured individuals in the U.S. has dropped to levels not seen since 2009.

The poll, part of the Gallup-Healthways Well Being Index, shows 16% of Americans were uninsured as of Feb. 10, the last day the survey of 19,000 people was conducted. The poll was begun on Jan. 2.

The last time the percentage of uninsured reached that level was in early 2009. Previous polls found the number of uninsured was close to that mark in early 2011, at 16.1%, and late 2012, at 16.3%. The slice of uninsured peaked at 18% in mid-2013, the pollsters said.

But it may be too early to tell whether Obamacare is having a significant effect on the uninsured. The fluctuation in the percentages may be a sign of inherent variability in the rate or random changes. If the uninsured rate continues to fall over the next several months, it could be due to the ACA, Gallup officials said.

The poll also found that the number of uninsured “invincibles,” or those aged 18-34, is declining. Uninsured consumers aged 18-25 is down to 23.3%, showing a steady decline since the ACA’s passage allowed them to remain on their parents’ plans. The percentage of those without coverage ages 26-34 was down to 25.7%, a level not seen since late 2010. Consumers in those age groups are needed to help pay for older, less healthy patients.
