He also says more people still need to have access to healthcare.\n\n\"that means we might have to move the Medicare age from 65 to 55 or expand Medicaid,\" Murphy said.\n\nVernon agreed improvements need to be made, but referenced different needs.\n\n\"To allow bargaining for lower drug prices, most of us still struggle with that,\" Vernon said.\n\nOne more area the candidates differ is how to handle the federal budget.\n\nVernon says her priority is stopping subsidies for big oil companies. She also says tax reform needs to take place.\n\n\"I don't think Wall Street executives should pay a lower tax rate than the assistant who works for them,\" Vernon said.\n\nShe also says more funding should be put into infrastructure needs throughout the country.\n\nMurphy says he's against the Sequester budget cuts. Instead, he says more funding should be pumped into education, at all levels.\n\n\"We need to focus on things like the Pell Grant, making it easier for kids to have access to higher education and their not in depth forever,\" Murphy said.\n\nPrimary elections are June 7th.\n\nThe primary winner will go up against Republican Rod Blum who was first elected to office in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Saturday,  Pat Murphy and Monica Vernon took part a debate at Monticello City Hall.", "language": "english", "author": "Jordee Kalk, KCRG TV", "og": {"url": "http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Democrat-candidates-debate-for-second-time--376858621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/420*315/13015467_1588969648080154_7476571427209404373_n.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On Saturday,  Pat Murphy and Monica Vernon took part a debate at Monticello City Hall.", "title": "Democrat candidates debate for second time"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Saturday,  Pat Murphy and Monica Vernon took part a debate at Monticello City Hall.", "title": "Democrat candidates debate for second time", "url": "http://www.kcrg.com/content/news/Democrat-candidates-debate-for-second-time--376858621.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/420*315/13015467_1588969648080154_7476571427209404373_n.jpg", "creator": "@KCRG", "site": "@KCRG", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Democrat candidates debate for second time", "fb": {"app_id": 1482644542038403, "pages": 57827502171}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "_pi-uBEP3DU48yOrVs_IYPqZzPgLtRkS7bl24Ebx1MY", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Democrat candidates debate for second"}, "article_summary": "In each of their opening statements, both candidates made reference to past experiences and claim their backgrounds will help defeat current Republican Congressman Rod Blum.\nOn Saturday, Pat Murphy and Monica Vernon took part a debate at Monticello City Hall.\nMonica Vernon says her work on the City Council gives her experience leading during emergencies, citing her work during the historic 2008 flood.\nOne heated question the candidates faced is what changes they would make to the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd the battle continues to be the front-runner Democrat candidate for the First Congressional District."}
