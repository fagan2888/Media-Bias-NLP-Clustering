Country music legend Charlie Daniels tweeted on Tuesday what many of us were already thinking.

He asked if anyone in the Obama administration has a clue what’s going on in the Middle East.

Daniels blasted the administration’s history of ineptitude in the region and his followers appeared to agree whole-heartedly.

I wonder if there’s anybody in the Obama administration who knows what’s actually happening in the Middle East. Doubtful — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) November 3, 2015

Somebody in Washington needs to admit that we’re fighting a proxy war in Syria — Charlie Daniels (@CharlieDaniels) November 3, 2015

He didn’t get any argument from social media users.

@CharlieDaniels he would fire them if they suggested admitting they were wrong about anything. — Wesley Sumner (@WesleyAprilS) November 3, 2015

@CharlieDaniels @gailtalk they all find out like Obama finds out what his administration is doing…reading it in a newspaper — BFD G (@TCC_Grouchy) November 4, 2015

@CharlieDaniels if they do know. They can’t say it out loud or they will be fired. Reality is not allowed in this administration. — Rob (@IamRob81) November 3, 2015

.@CharlieDaniels before or after they admit: -Obamacare is expensive failure -It was NOT a video -IRS was more than smidgeon -VA is corrupt? — Sandy (@RightGlockMom) November 3, 2015

@CharlieDaniels The only wars this admin declares are on political adversaries and private citizens who disagree with its policies. — Jon McPhalen (@JonMcPhalen) November 3, 2015

@CharlieDaniels that’s the whole point of proxy wars. U don’t have to admit your killing people. You can even act outraged! — John O’Connell (@anvilinvest) November 3, 2015

On Wednesday Daniels suggested what may be the cause of the problem.
