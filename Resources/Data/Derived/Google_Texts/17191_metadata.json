Elizabeth Warren to run for the post.\n\nWilde, who campaigned for President Obama during the 2008 election, called Hillary \u201ca really exciting candidate for so many reasons, but she has a lot to prove to a lot of people.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cAnd I think she\u2019s up for that,\u201d Wilde added.\n\nThe actress, best known for her roles on the Fox television show House and Disney\u2019s Tron movies, told the Daily Beast that the former Secretary of State would get her vote because of her focus on women\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she feels the plight of women and girls as the most important issue of the 21st century is a huge reason why I\u2019m supporting her,\u201d Wilde told the outlet.\n\nWilde, who starred in a Funny or Die promotional video for the Affordable Care Act in 2013, said it would be important to \u201cprotect our new health care law, and I think Hillary would be focused on that.\u201d She continued:\n\nI think the equal rights of women in this country is something that\u2019s still not a law and she would absolutely be focused on that. Our justice system is a mess and she\u2019s aware of that. I think where she\u2019ll face difficulty is with Wall Street. They\u2019re afraid of the rhetoric she\u2019ll use in her campaign and I think she\u2019ll face a lot of pressure from her campaign to tone that down because of the donations they\u2019ll receive from different banks. So it\u2019s her responsibility to understand her base and that many of her supporters are further left-leaning than she is.\n\nWilde added that \u201cit\u2019d be great\u201d if Sen. Elizabeth Warren entered the race:\n\n\u201cMy dream is that Warren would be [Hillary\u2019s] VP but that\u2019s not happening in a million years,\u201d the actress told the Daily Beast, laughing. \u201cMy ideal society!\u201d\n\nWilde also discusses why she won\u2019t run for office (\u201cI\u2019m not organized enough\u201d), whether Daft Punk will be scoring Tron 3 (\u201cI think we\u2019d tremendously lucky to get them\u201d), and why female filmmakers will be better represented in Hollywood (\u201cI\u2019m optimistic we\u2019ll get to that point\u201d) in the Daily Beast spread.
