When the song talks about falling down, I\u2019m on the floor. When it talks about uplifting stuff, I\u2019m up, and my moves are graceful.\u201d\n\nHer background in dance: Stephanie has been dancing for 13 years. This is her first time creating the choreography for a dance, and she said she hopes to do more of it. \u201cI liked the way I could express myself, tell my story rather than someone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHer process: Stephanie wanted to create an entry to which everyone could relate. \u201cEveryone is so hard on each other and so hard on themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re only human. When we fall down; we get up. Sometimes we cry; sometimes we\u2019re happy. My dance tells that story.\u201d\n\nWhy she likes dancing: \u201cI like the way it makes me feel. I can express myself. I like competition. I like being on stage, with the lights on me. I like being with my team and the social interactions,\u201d she said, adding that she like to learn new dances, finds dancing to be a stress reliever, and thinks dancing is very fun. \u201cFor me, dancing is like breathing.\u201d\n\nStephanie\u2019s home life: Stephanie lives in Glen Oaks in Prospect with her parents Jennifer and Brian Downs.
