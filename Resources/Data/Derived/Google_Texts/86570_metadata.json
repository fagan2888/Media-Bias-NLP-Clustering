Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for his decision to raise the minimum wage for state employees and contractors from $7.25 to $10.15 an hour.\n\nThe increase, authorized by Wolf through an executive order Monday, would elevate the wages of workers in Pennsylvania state government and certain businesses that contract with the state by nearly $3 per hour.\n\nThe order applied immediately to roughly 450 of the state\u2019s 79,000 employees.\n\nSuzanne Stoltenberg, Pennsylvania state communications director at the National Federation of Independent Business, said the state\u2019s contracting procedure is already arduous and time-consuming. She contends that the governor\u2019s mandate will further discourage small businesses from participating in the process.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of the smaller businesses\u2014some of them who hire entry-level people that have no training\u2014they literally cannot afford to up their [pay] by $3 per hour when employees may be part-time, brand new, or have no skills,\u201d Stoltenberg told The Daily Signal.\n\nShe said Wolf\u2019s order also would hit taxpayers in the form of higher costs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an irony of sorts\u2014you want to get value for your state tax dollar when you\u2019re contracting, but then you\u2019re telling the people who are contracting that their labor costs are going to be higher.\u201d\n\nDemocratic state legislators have tried passing bills to raise Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum wage across the board, but Republican lawmakers successfully stalled those efforts.\n\nThe state\u2019s Independent Fiscal Office released a report in November 2015 that analyzes one of the legislature\u2019s proposed wage increases. The study projected that increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 would result in the loss of 31,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe have to take into consideration when we do these things that it has an economic impact,\u201d state Sen. Stewart Greenleaf, R-Montgomery County, told The Daily Signal. \u201cThe higher the minimum wage is, the more people who lose their jobs.\u201d\n\nGreenleaf, who voted in 2006 to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage to the current $7.25 an hour, said if Pennsylvania moves to increase wages again, it should do so incrementally so that negative effects are minimized.\n\nAlex Halper, director of government affairs at the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, said the governor used his executive power as a \u201cspringboard\u201d to push for a statewide minimum wage increase.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of employers would love to have the ability to, with a magic wand, increase their employees wages, but obviously in the real economy that\u2019s not the way it works,\u201d Halper told The Daily Signal.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, he said, how Wolf intends to pay for raises for state employers. He predicted that the issue would make its way into this year\u2019s budget negotiations.\n\nJohn Dodds, director of the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, meanwhile, said benefits of raising the minimum wage statewide far outweigh the cost. While he conceded that an increase could result in job losses, he noted that 1.4 million individuals would see their wages increase 40 percent.\n\n\u201cYou have to look at the trade-off here,\u201d Dodds told The Daily Signal. \u201cMoney is good for the economy, it will have a stimulant effect, and it will very quickly get circulated back through the local small businesses and the local economies. In that regard, it\u2019s probably a positive for unemployment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cFor a lot of the smaller businesses \u2026 they literally cannot afford to up their by $3 per hour,\u201d a business advocate says of minimum wage increases.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cFor a lot of the smaller businesses \u2026 they literally cannot afford to up their by $3 per hour,\u201d a business advocate says of minimum wage increases.", "title": "Governor Orders Minimum Wage Hike for State Workers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160308_PAMinWage_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-09T21:01:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RRSfGy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cFor a lot of the smaller businesses \u2026 they literally cannot afford to up their by $3 per hour,\u201d a business advocate says of minimum wage increases.", "title": "Governor Orders Minimum Wage Hike for State Workers", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160308_PAMinWage_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs,minimum wage", "published_time": "2016-03-09T18:07:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T21:01:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tom Wolf, National Federation of Independent Business, minimum wage, living wage, Pennsylvania Chamber of Business, Philadelphia Unemployment Project"}, "article_summary": "John Dodds, director of the Philadelphia Unemployment Project, meanwhile, said benefits of raising the minimum wage statewide far outweigh the cost.\nTom Wolf, a Democrat, for his decision to raise the minimum wage for state employees and contractors from $7.25 to $10.15 an hour.\nThe study projected that increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 would result in the loss of 31,000 jobs in Pennsylvania.\nAlex Halper, director of government affairs at the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, said the governor used his executive power as a \u201cspringboard\u201d to push for a statewide minimum wage increase.\nSuzanne Stoltenberg, Pennsylvania state communications director at the National Federation of Independent Business, said the state\u2019s contracting procedure is already arduous and time-consuming."}
