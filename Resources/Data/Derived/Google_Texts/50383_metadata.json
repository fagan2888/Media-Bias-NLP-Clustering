Half of the scholars, however, would specifically engage in \u201cfocused attention meditation\u201d for two of those hours for three days, being told by the researchers to become \u201ccompletely aware of the spontaneously arising sensory perception in their right index finger.\u201d The other half simply meditated as usual, using a technique known as open monitoring meditation.\n\nBefore their meditation started, as well as on the third and fourth day of the retreat, the scholars were subjected to a series of tests aimed at measuring their tactile performance. While they were blinded, the scholars\u2019 right index finger (along with a nearby finger and corresponding finger on the left hand) was touched by a device with two pointed ends set apart by an adjustable distance. The shorter the distance between the points when the scholar could reliably (over 50 percent of the time) tell that they were being poked by two different points, the better their perception of touch. Another blinded experiment measured their ability to accurately perceive the location of an object touching them.\n\nLo and behold, those who had focused on their right hand fingers the entire weekend performed better on the two-point discrimination test both on the third day and the fourth, when the scholars were instructed to revert back to their ordinary meditation technique. In one participant\u2019s case, he was able to accurately report two points touching him when they were 1.68 millimeters apart on the first day, and at 1.27 millimeters by the third day.\n\n\u201cOur data show that focused attention meditation on a particular body part \u2014 in this case the right index finger \u2014 significantly enhanced tactile acuity but not localization performance. In addition, open monitoring meditation resulted in no changes at all,\u201d wrote the authors. \u201cThese data indicate that merely being aware without external stimulation or training can drive highly specific changes in tactile perception.\u201d\n\nThe level of improvement they noticed was fairly equivalent to that of long-term training or stimulation, as can be seen with visually impaired individuals who become reliant on their sense of touch. It was in some respects even better, since it\u2019s been previously observed that such training can improve touch perception but worsen our ability to accurately locate where we\u2019re being touched.\n\n\u201cTaken together, our findings indicate that the framework of neuroplastic processes induced by external training and stimulation needs to be extended to incorporate the observation that intrinsic brain activity created by mental states without external events can alter perception and behavior in similar ways,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nWhile the authors\u2019 findings are undoubtedly fascinating, it should be noted that their study subjects are particularly unique. The average length of meditation experience shared by the scholars was a whopping 11 years, and they spent an average of four hours a week meditating.\n\nStill, you could do a lot worse for a parlor trick.\n\nSource: Philipp S, Kalisch T, Wachtler T, et al.
