Ted Cruz really does want healthcare reform, just not Obamacare, the Texas Republican said Thursday night.\n\nThe conservative firebrand and self-made arch-foe of the Affordable Care Act was on CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire\u201d to defend the tactics he proposed that helped drive the United States to a government shutdown.\n\n\n\nAnd those tactics seem to be working by Cruz\u2019s standards.\n\nCruz: Use debt ceiling debate for leverage\n\n\u201cAn awful lot of Washington would like to change the subject,\u201d on fighting Obamacare, Cruz said. \u201cWho hasn't stopped focusing on Obamacare is the American people.\u201d\n\nCruz argued that he has gotten the grassroots outrage against the health care law he has always sought.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans rose up and said this thing isn't working,\u201d the freshman senator said. \u201cThat's what we need to stay focused on.\u201d\n\nIt was Cruz who helped propose a government funding bill that attached language defunding President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislation.\n\nThe defunding language was a rider that Democrats have long said was unacceptable and ultimately pushed the government into shutdown when a deal over spending could not be reached.\n\nBack and forth between Democrats and Republicans over how to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling continue, with House Republicans passing multiple piecemeal funding bills that include Veteran\u2019s Affairs and national parks.\n\nSenate Democrats have refused to take up those bills, arguing that the entire government should be funded and calling anything else hostage negotiations made under duress.\n\nAny Cruz is good news for Democrats\n\nCruz\u2019s \u201cCrossfire\u201d opponent Thursday, Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, continued that charge repeatedly.\n\nFunding only parts of the government, Whitehouse argued, is akin to a hostage taker who will \u201clet the occasional hostage out while holding all the other hostages.\u201d\n\nCruz, a nationally ranked debate champion, stuck to his talking points.\n\n\u201cWhy is it a hostage negotiation on a straight-up funding on the VA?\u201d Cruz asked. \u201cWhy can't we all come together and say our vets should all be above politics?\u201d\n\nRepublicans have held up the funding of everything else, Whitehouse countered.\n\nCruz has drawn considerable fire for his anti-Obamacare tactics even within his own party, with fellow Republicans like Rep. Peter King of New York calling Cruz \u201ca fraud\u201d for promising that he could defund Obamacare when all along he could not.\n\nWhen asked if he owed the GOP an apology for its dropping approval ratings, Cruz instead turned the question into an indictment of Democrats who \u201cdo not want to discuss Obamacare.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, \u201cHouse Republicans are listening to the millions of Americans\u201d Cruz says are suffering under Obamacare, losing their jobs, work hours and insurance.\n\nWhitehouse did not say that Obamacare was untouchable; arguing only that any reform should come through the normal legislative process instead of by tying it to larger issues of government funding and the debt ceiling.\n\nThat said, Whitehouse still largely defended the law, citing constituents and the costs of Medicaid and Medicare that he says are going down.\n\n\u201cYou've got to believe that Obamacare has something to do with those huge savings,\u201d Whitehouse said.\n\nWhitehouse argued that Republicans decided early on that Obamacare was going to be a failure.\n\nIt was \u201ca political choice to pull all support from anything this president wanted to do,\u201d Whitehouse said.\n\nWhen accused of countering any positive health care reform, Cruz argued that \u201cI am a big supporter of healthcare reform,\u201d a cause he says he has long championed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Updated 10/10/2013 at 9:08pm Washington (CNN) -- Sen.
