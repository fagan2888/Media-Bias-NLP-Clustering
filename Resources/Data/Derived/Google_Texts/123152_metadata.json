John Kasich wants to tax it even more.\n\nFree-market think tank Opportunity Ohio released a video last week criticizing Kasich\u2019s plan to increase taxes on companies using horizontal hydraulic fracturing, also known as \u201cfracking,\u201d to extract oil and natural gas from shale deposits.\n\nIn March, dozens of employers and elected officials launched the Protect Ohio Jobs Coalition, claiming a fracking tax hike could jeopardize tens of thousands of jobs.\n\nAccording to Opportunity Ohio, the proposal included in Kasich\u2019s 2016-17 budget clashes with President Ronald Reagan\u2019s adage, \u201cif you want less of something, tax it.\u201d\n\nA series of Opportunity Ohio videos released in 2013 warned that a fracking tax hike represented government picking winners and losers, and it was likely to harm employment \u2014 not just in the industry but in much of Appalachian Ohio.\n\nOpportunity Ohio estimates energy companies have invested more than $30 billion in fracking in southeast Ohio and have earned $3 billion from those investments. Oil production has been far lower than anticipated, already prompting some companies to leave the state.\n\nKasich, a Republican, has been pushing for a tax hike on fracking since 2012.\n\nThe governor presents his push for a fracking tax hike as proof of his indifference to special interests \u2014 but he embraced the Obamacare Medicaid expansion at the Ohio Hospital Association\u2019s behest after campaigning against it.\n\nWhy the disconnect?\n\n\u201cI think John Kasich understands intimately how hospital subsidies from government work, but fundamentally doesn\u2019t comprehend how the free market really works,\u201d Opportunity Ohio president Matt Mayer said in an email to Ohio Watchdog.\n\n\u201cHe can say the words, but can\u2019t get the ideas,\u201d Mayer added.\n\nLike many states, Ohio charges severance taxes for removing natural resources from the ground. Kasich contends that Ohio\u2019s severance tax is too low, and could be increased without driving employers away.\n\nSince 2012, Kasich\u2019s plan has been to use a severance tax hike to pay for a statewide income tax cut. He explained his dedication to the idea in the face of continued legislative opposition at a campaign event in October.\n\n\u201cI want everybody in Ohio to get a cut, a tax cut outta this,\u201d Kasich said when asked about the fracking tax. \u201cWe were proposing 4 (percent). Every day they (legislators) wait it goes higher.\u201d\n\nCritics, including industry group the Ohio Oil & Gas Association, have pushed back, pointing to steep drilling rig startup costs and the other taxes Ohio levies on energy companies while also reminding the governor resources in Ohioans\u2019 property don\u2019t belong to the state.\n\n\u201cLike a high income tax, the proposed severance tax increase promises to penalize one of Ohio\u2019s most promising industries and ultimately drive job-creators from the state,\u201d Joe Nichols of the free-market Buckeye Institute wrote in a March 20 Forbes column.\n\nGiven his administration\u2019s emphasis on job creation, why has Kasich fixated on hiking the severance tax instead of, for instance, simplifying Ohio\u2019s tangled local income tax system?\n\n\u201cKasich\u2019s zealous drive for higher energy taxes is all about getting him the money he needs to keep government spending high,\u201d Mayer told Ohio Watchdog. \u201cMunicipal tax reform doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s press secretary did not respond to questions about Kasich\u2019s quest for a severance tax hike.\n\nOhio\u2019s current severance tax rate for crude oil is 20 cents per barrel, and the rate for natural gas is 2.5 cents per thousand cubic feet. Kasich\u2019s proposed fracking tax hike would not affect the rate for conventional oil and natural gas wells.\n\nIn his 2016-17 budget, Kasich is calling for \u201cfixed rates for crude oil and natural gas of 6.5 percent when sold at the wellhead, and a lower rate of 4.5 percent for natural gas and natural gas liquids when sold downstream.\u201d\n\nThe current iteration of Kasich\u2019s fracking tax hike is one of several tax hike proposals included in his budget as a way to pay for additional income tax cuts. Kasich is also seeking to hike the sales tax, the gross receipts tax on businesses, the cigarette tax and e-cigarette taxes.\n\nBoth Opportunity Ohio and The Buckeye Institute have encouraged the Ohio General Assembly to pay for income tax cuts by cutting spending instead of shifting the tax burden to specific activities and industries.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
