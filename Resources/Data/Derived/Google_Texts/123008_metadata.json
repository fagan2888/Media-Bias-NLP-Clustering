Though Rubio did not present or pitch any new ideas, it was an opportunity for those in attendance to hear them in person.\n\nRubio, who was introduced by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, called for the country\u2019s electorate to pick a president who can tackle the world\u2019s changing economy and address growing threats against the United States.\n\nHe voiced concern over decreased federal military spending in the face of a growing Islamic State.\n\n\u201cISIS is a dangerous and growing threat,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe have no choice but to confront them and defeat them. Either they win or we win. There is no middle ground here.\u201d\n\nRubio also brought up some of his familiar talking points, such as the need to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and changing the way America treats higher education by highlighting the need for more vocational and career training outside of four-year colleges.\n\n\u201cThe student loan problem in America is massive,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIt is crippling the lives of young people in America.\u201d\n\nJulie Beeks, 24, of Charleston said she still hasn\u2019t decided which candidate she will vote for. But she said Rubio is young, attractive and charismatic \u2014 everything the Republican Party needs in a candidate to help broaden its base.\n\nThe Charleston School of Law student added she has seen him in person before, and that every time she walks away impressed.\n\n\u201cI think that he\u2019s a breath of fresh air,\u201d Beeks said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have that in a presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nThough Rubio posed for pictures with those who attended the event, he did not participate in a question-and-answer session with the public nor did he make himself available to reporters.\n\nDave Newman of Charleston said he attended the event, however, because he wanted to see Rubio in person. He added that Rubio\u2019s even-keeled demeanor is among the many things he likes in the presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cI can see him as president,\u201d Newman said. \u201cHe was probably who I was going to vote for before. He is definitely who I\u2019m going to vote for now.\u201d\n\nReach Cynthia Roldan at 843-577-7111.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Marco Rubio in Mount Pleasant, calls on voters to pick a president who is ready for a challenge, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nVideos, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Election 2016,GOP presidential primary,Marco Rubio,Mount Pleasant,Republican presidential primary", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "MOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio stopped by the Lowcountry on Wednesday to present his vision for the future of the country.", "title": "Marco Rubio in Mount Pleasant, calls on voters to pick a president who is ready for a challenge", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151125/151129536/marco-rubio-in-mount-pleasant-calls-on-voters-to-pick-a-president-who-is-ready-for-a-challenge", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151125/PC1603/151129536/AR/0/AR-151129536.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151125/PC1603/151129536/AR/0/AR-151129536.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio stopped by the Lowcountry on Wednesday to present his vision for the future of the country.", "title": "Marco Rubio in Mount Pleasant, calls on voters to pick a president who is ready for a challenge", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151125/PC1603/151129536/AR/0/AR-151129536.jpg?201511251716", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151129536}}, "keywords": "Marco Rubio in Mount Pleasant, calls on voters to pick a president who is ready for a challenge , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nVideos, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Election 2016,GOP presidential primary,Marco Rubio,Mount Pleasant,Republican presidential primary", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-25T14:54:35Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-25T17:16:00Z", "author": "Cynthia Roldan"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "MOUNT PLEASANT \u2014 Republican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio stopped by the Lowcountry on Wednesday to present his vision for the future of the country."}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio mingles among those who attended his event at Mount Pleasant on Wednesday.\nHe added that Rubio\u2019s even-keeled demeanor is among the many things he likes in the presidential candidate.\nRepublican presidential hopeful Marco Rubio stopped by the Lowcountry on Wednesday to present his vision for the future of the country.\nAbout 100 people crammed onto the deck of the Water\u2019s Edge restaurant in Mount Pleasant to listen to Florida\u2019s junior senator.\nDave Newman of Charleston said he attended the event, however, because he wanted to see Rubio in person."}
