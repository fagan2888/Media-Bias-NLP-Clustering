A Santa Rosa Beach man is behind bars on a number of drug charges.

Back on June 29, the Walton County Sheriff’s Office Vice/Narcotics unit served a probable cause search warrant at the residence of 58-year-old Keith Daniel Oberhausen.

During the course of the search over nine grams of “ICE” methamphetamine, marijuana, suspected LSD, drug paraphernalia, a log detailing drug transactions, and $14,500 in US currency was found hidden on the property.

Oberhausen was later charged with possession of methamphetamine, possession of a controlled substance, possession of less than 20grams of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia.
