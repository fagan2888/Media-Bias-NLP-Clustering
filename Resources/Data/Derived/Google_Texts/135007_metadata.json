(Photo: Staff Graphic ) Story Highlights Approval of the roundabout allows Monmouth County to solicit bids for construction. Depending on the outcome of those bids, construction could start in late summer.\n\nSome township residents say a traffic roundabout is the best solution for an intersection that has a history of car crashes.\n\nBut other neighbors contend they haven\u2019t seen enough information about the proposal and believe it could be an excessive move.\n\nMonmouth County officials have been considering how to improve the intersection at Crine Road, Dutch Lane and Heulitt Road for more than five years.\n\nLast week, the county freeholders voted to approve the plans for the roundabout, which allows the county engineering staff to solicit bids for the estimated $1.03 million project.\n\n\u201cThere were a couple of near fatal accidents that brought this all about,\u201d said Freehold Director Lillian Burry, who also lives in Colts Neck.\n\nThe intersection had 11 crashes from 2005 to 2008, with seven causing serious injuries. Those crashes sparked concern from residents. More so, from 2010 through this year, there have been another 14 crashes, according to state Department of Transportation data. That caught the attention of county engineers.\n\nBut Brook Crossan, a resident and Colts Neck planning board member, said he and his neighbors were surprised to hear a roundabout was how county officials wanted to address the problem.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the roundabout has been all that well publicized,\u201d he said.\n\nCrossan said he had gathered a petition with 20 signatures in the hours before the Thursday night meeting asking the vote to be postponed. He said there were other ways to improve the intersection and the roundabout \u201cseemed a little bit of overkill.\u201d\n\nBut another resident, Michelle Warendorf, said it\u2019s time to move ahead with the roundabout, which she said has been discussed for years. She got choked up as she talked about crash six years ago at the intersection, one that involved a school bus carrying her children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d she said of the intersection. \u201cThis has to be done.\u201d\n\nFreeholder Serena DiMaso said she initially had concerns about the need for a roundabout, but ultimately decided it was the right choice after discussing with County Engineer Joseph Ettore all of the options his staff had considered to improve safety.\n\nFreeholder John Curley cast the lone vote against the roundabout, saying he thought the freeholders should wait to vote until the county engineering department can meet with neighbors who still have questions.\n\nCurley said his opposition has nothing to do with the roundabout itself.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I would support it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople need to have more input into what\u2019s transpiring and certainly more information into what\u2019s transpiring.\u201d\n\nSusanne Cervenka: 732-643-4229; scervenka@app.com\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT:\n\nApproval of the roundabout allows Monmouth County to solicit bids for construction. Depending on the outcome of those bids, construction could start in late summer.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.app.com/story/news/local/western-monmouth-county/2014/05/23/colts-neck-traffic-monmouth-county/9512119/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Colts Neck residents are split on a roundabout for an intersection with a crash history.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Colts Neck residents are split on a roundabout for an intersection with a crash history.", "title": "Neighbors divided over roundabout", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/western-monmouth-county/2014/05/23/colts-neck-traffic-monmouth-county/9512119/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Colts Neck residents are split on a roundabout for an intersection with a crash history.", "title": "Neighbors divided over roundabout", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9f81ab41545ea59430cc2bdd5024c6bb5e0b947/c=0-297-337-634&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/05/23/0524roundabout.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Colts Neck-traffic-Monmouth County-roundabout-New Jersey"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Staff Graphic ) Story Highlights Approval of the roundabout allows Monmouth County to solicit bids for construction.\nLast week, the county freeholders voted to approve the plans for the roundabout, which allows the county engineering staff to solicit bids for the estimated $1.03 million project.\nDepending on the outcome of those bids, construction could start in late summer.\nSome township residents say a traffic roundabout is the best solution for an intersection that has a history of car crashes.\nBut other neighbors contend they haven\u2019t seen enough information about the proposal and believe it could be an excessive move."}
