But I fear our nation is on\n\nthe brink of social, economic and political ruin. I am running for Congress to take part in\n\nthe battle to preserve our American principles and way of life. I believe I would serve our\n\ndistrict well, because I am the only candidate with a proven lifetime record of fighting for\n\nconservative principles.
