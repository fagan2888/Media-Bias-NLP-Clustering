Mediocrity becomes marginalized \u2014 at least it did until February at MetLife Stadium \u2014 with Denver racing down the field for scores.\n\nFormer Rockies manager Don Baylor once said that teams were in scoring position at Coors Field when the batter stepped into the box. Likewise, Peyton Manning is a threat on touchbacks. Of the Broncos\u2019 49 scoring drives at home last season, 17 covered at least 80 yards.\n\n\u201cField position still matters,\u201d said Denver offensive coordinator Adam Gase. \u201cIt is important.\u201d\n\nAnd there lies an area for improvement: punt returns. While the Broncos were solid on kickoff returns last year, ranking sixth in the NFL, they lacked consistent production on punt returns. Denver averaged 7.8 yards per punt return, 11th in the AFC and 22nd overall. Trindon Holliday provided electricity \u2014 8.5 yards per return and one touchdown \u2014 but crossed wires, making him a threat as much to the Broncos as to the opponent.\n\nWith Holliday gone to the New York Giants, a vacancy sign flashes on returns. Leading into Saturday\u2019s scrimmage at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Ronnie Hillman and Andre Caldwell have fielded kickoffs in training camp. Isaiah Burse, Jordan Norwood, Emmanuel Sanders and Wes Welker are getting the reps on punts, a more pressing need based on statistics.\n\nBurse brings burst and a college r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with special-teams experience. While playing for Fresno State, he returned 29 punts for 344 yards and two touchdowns. He\u2019s slippery at 5-foot-10 and 187 pounds, and has rebounded after drops early in camp.\n\n\u201cI have to be more consistent,\u201d said Burse, who is trying to extend the Broncos\u2019 streak to 11 consecutive seasons with an undrafted rookie making their opening-day roster. \u201cI know I need to get better and cut down on mental mistakes. It\u2019s coming along. When you get out there, everybody is fast. I can\u2019t lose my focus.\u201d\n\nNorwood didn\u2019t make an NFL team last year and hasn\u2019t played regularly since 2011, when he briefly returned punts for the Browns. He has to show he\u2019s more elusive than Burse. Sanders said both players have performed well in practice, \u201cso they don\u2019t need me right now.\u201d The Steelers didn\u2019t use Sanders on punt returns last season, but in 16 career attempts he has averaged 10.9 yards.\n\n\u201cWith this up-tempo offense, it\u2019s tough to have a receiver going back every time,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut I have said many times, if they need me, I am willing to do it.\u201d\n\nWelker provides a similar, if not more likely, safety net. He fits the profile, which demands returners catch the ball \u2014 that\u2019s typically written in 72-point Helvetica bold on the white board in the locker room \u2014 and be shifty. Even at age 33, Welker can pull it off. He returned 10 punts last season for 70 yards, with two fair catches, as he and Eric Decker took over for Holliday late in the season.\n\n\u201cI can do it if they want me to,\u201d Welker said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something new.\u201d\n\nWelker returned 25 punts in 2012 with the Patriots. He said suffering concussions last season wouldn\u2019t preclude him from the role this year.\n\nPunt returners are bold, fearless. There are those who fly in F-16 jets, as Welker did last month, and those who ride bulls, which Sanders grew up wanting to do as a career, following in his uncle\u2019s footsteps.\n\nNo other team matches Denver\u2019s offense. And a better return game producing a shorter field can help it remain prolific.\n\n\u201cIf you are going to return punts, or even kicks, you have to have some charisma about yourself,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou have to have a different mind-set. It\u2019s not for everyone. You need to be a little crazy.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
