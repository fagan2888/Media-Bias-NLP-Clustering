While many Americans state that they plan to retire between 65 and 70 (45%), the typical retirement may have changed. In a survey just released by AARP, a surprising 37% plan to work for pay in retirement.\n\n\n\nThose surveyed who plan to work for pay post-retirement indicate a desire to work part-time (73%). Almost half are looking to work in a new field (44%).\n\n\n\nConnecting with co-workers, interesting and challenging work, and the desire for a work-life balance are all stated as top reasons why work is enjoyable. Some are seeking to pursue their dream job or dream field in this next phase. Sports, hospitality, and education fields are frequently cited. Most are hoping that their new dream jobs will be part-time, flexible with work from home options, and allow time for travel and fun.\n\n\n\nThe survey results are available on an enhanced, Work & Jobs free website providing a valuable one-stop online experience that includes information, tools and programs: AARP.org/Work.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur new research shows a fluid workplace, with many experienced workers looking for flexible part-time work in interesting and challenging positions to continue their careers,\u201d said Kim Adler, AARP\u2019s Work and Jobs lead. \u201cThe new website will help experienced workers control their careers and stay connected, competitive and current in the workplace,\u201d Adler added.\n\n\n\nAARP.org/Work offers information, tools and connection to a variety of resources and will expand in the coming months. For starters, the website offers:\n\n\n\nTips for those looking for work or exploring workplace options\n\n\n\nPrograms for workers contemplating a career change\n\n\n\nGuidance on the challenges and opportunities for those in part-time, flexible, and work-from-home jobs\n\n\n\nAn important list of employers who value experienced workers\n\n\n\nPrograms and advice from experts on starting a business\n\n\n\nInsights from experts on how to stay competitive in the workplace\n\n\n\nTips on how to navigate work life, including guidance on reaching peer networks\n\n\n\nThe AARP \u201cWork and Jobs\u201d survey can be directly accessed here:\n\nhttp://www.aarp.org/research/topics/economics/info-2015/aarp-post-retirement-career-study.html\n\n\n\nThe release of the survey \u2013 and the announcement of the enhanced website \u2013 comes in conjunction with distribution of the September issue of the AARP Bulletin that includes a package of informative work-related stories. A column by AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins, titled \u201cDisrupting Work,\u201d cites the need to develop a new multi-generation workplace culture.\n\n\n\nOn September 22, AARP will conduct a free Real Possibilities virtual career fair at www.aarp.org/virtualcareerfair.\n\n###\n\n", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:Press Center", "Division1": "Division:Press Center", "page_title": "AARP Survey Released In Conjunction With New Work and Jobs Website Shows Many Experienced Workers Focus on Working Longer- and Into Retirement, Mostly In Part-Time Positions", "estimated_publish_date": "2015-09-08", "Last-Modified": "2015-09-08T10:20:24.924-04:00", "keywords": "work, jobs, survey, retirement, website", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-09-2015/aarp-survey-released-in-conjuction-with-new-work-and-jobs-website.html", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.JXU1Hc0eOQ2d5zVQS0hVhK6_r3O4zoBieKyMVmBLyuc\",\"checksum\":\"ccf1e613b4aed24714373b0303f00861\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-09-2015/aarp-survey-released-in-conjuction-with-new-work-and-jobs-website.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "source": "aarp_press_center", "type": "info", "description": "AARP Site Helps 50-Plus Stay Connected, Competitive, Current", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Money/Retirement planning", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "AARP Site Helps 50-Plus Stay Connected, Competitive, Current", "title": "Survey Released With New Work and Jobs Website Shows Many Experienced Workers Focus on Working Longer - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-09-2015/aarp-survey-released-in-conjuction-with-new-work-and-jobs-website.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/etc/aarp/statics/global/img/logos/aarp_50x50.imgcache.rev1463067054884.png", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/about-aarp/press-center/info-09-2015/aarp-survey-released-in-conjuction-with-new-work-and-jobs-website", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "IALevel1": "about-aarp", "IALevel2": "press-center", "s43": "PressCenter|Membership", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-27"}, "article_summary": "Those surveyed who plan to work for pay post-retirement indicate a desire to work part-time (73%).\nThe survey results are available on an enhanced, Work & Jobs free website providing a valuable one-stop online experience that includes information, tools and programs: AARP.org/Work.\n\u201cOur new research shows a fluid workplace, with many experienced workers looking for flexible part-time work in interesting and challenging positions to continue their careers,\u201d said Kim Adler, AARP\u2019s Work and Jobs lead.\nIn a survey just released by AARP, a surprising 37% plan to work for pay in retirement.\n\u201cThe new website will help experienced workers control their careers and stay connected, competitive and current in the workplace,\u201d Adler added."}
