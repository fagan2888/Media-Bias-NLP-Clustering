However, \"it is basically a requirement that insurers use nondiscriminatory criteria,\" said Jocelyn Samuels.\n\nAs such, Samuels explained, insurers would face pressure from the government if they don't cover transgender-related treatments, in part because the administration considers them medically necessary. Patients who felt they were discriminated against would be able to sue under the measure.\n\nLike the hotly contested mandate requiring insurance companies to cover contraceptives, abortifacients, and sterilization, this new rule comes from the Affordable Care Act. And like the Obama administration's rewrite of the 1972 Title IX law, the regulation says that people with gender dysphoria are to be in a protected class because to do otherwise would be sex discrimination.\n\nClick \"like\" if you want to defend true marriage.\n\nCreating \u201ctransgender rights\u201d has been a major priority of President Obama in his second term.
