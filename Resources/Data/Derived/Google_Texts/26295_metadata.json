About 85 percent of prizes are paid by retailers.\n\nWinners of prizes between $600 and $5,000 can obtain a claim form at retailers to send in or they can receive cash from 192 banks across the state for a fee of $10.\n\nThose who win more than $5,000 must contact a regional lottery office.\n\n\u201cThis has been a struggle on how to get people their money because they want it fast,\u201d Lottery Director Dennis Berg said. \u201cAnd certain people in this culture want cash.\u201d\n\nLottery officials said younger players would likely prefer another option than cash since they often don\u2019t carry a lot of money.\n\nIf cashless payouts are implemented, some retailers might be allowed to cash winning tickets between $600 and $5,000.\n\nThe Michigan Lottery introduced a debit card two years ago that allows players to buy tickets and have prizes up to $600 loaded on the card. But the lottery discontinued the card earlier this month.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Northeast Ohio Media Group, http://www.cleveland.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Lottery officials are considering new options to pay some winners because retailers now have less cash on hand to give out to those holding winning tickets.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/20/ohio-lottery-officials-considering-new-payment-met/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Ohio Lottery officials are considering new options to pay some winners because retailers now have less cash on hand to give out to those holding winning tickets.", "title": "Ohio Lottery officials considering new payment methods"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ohio Lottery officials are considering new options to pay some winners because retailers now have less cash on hand to give out to those holding winning tickets.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ohio Lottery officials considering new payment methods"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb251\"", "article_summary": "CLEVELAND (AP) - Ohio Lottery officials are considering new options to pay some winners because retailers now have less cash on hand to give out to those holding winning tickets.\nLottery winners might one day receive payment cards or have their winnings electronically transferred to an account, the Northeast Ohio Media Group reported (http://bit.ly/1JXNGHX ).\nIf cashless payouts are implemented, some retailers might be allowed to cash winning tickets between $600 and $5,000.\nThe Michigan Lottery introduced a debit card two years ago that allows players to buy tickets and have prizes up to $600 loaded on the card.\n\u201cThis has been a struggle on how to get people their money because they want it fast,\u201d Lottery Director Dennis Berg said."}
