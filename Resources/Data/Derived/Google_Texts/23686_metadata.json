Going to panels about publishing or subscribing to Publisher\u2019s Lunch (don\u2019t do it!) or obsessively Googling a certain agent can fill you with all kinds of ideas about what you think publishers want, and can distract you from exactly the thing that makes your book good.\n\nBut the truth is that much of the experience of publishing a book has surprised me, some of which would probably have been helpful to know. So here\u2019s A List of Things About Publishing I Wish I\u2019d Known.\n\n1. Subject matter matters\n\nI feel like I\u2019m bordering on saying something sacrilegious here, but here it goes: There\u2019s a common strain of thinking among writers, particularly literary writers and the institutions that foster them (conference/colonies/workshops), that insists a book is only as good as its writing. I subscribe wholeheartedly to this belief and have defended it to both students and friends. Every one of my favorite books is a little case study in this \u2014 a subject that I knew little about or could care less for (or, worse, assumed I knew very well) that on the page came vividly, mind-alteringly alive. They\u2019re books that transcend their subjects and they do this, always, through the spell of the language. Trying to shortcut that work by choosing a subject that is already salacious or provocative or easy seems to me like a cynical move that underestimates the reader, or is just kind of lazy. Most of the time subject matter finds you, not the other way around. It\u2019s what fascinates or angers or scares you, it\u2019s a deeply internal (and unteachable) part of writing that seems less of a choice than a discovery.\n\nBut here was Lesson One in my publishing education: Once a manuscript leaves your desk, subject matter is the primary (and often only) way it is discussed. So if you haven\u2019t figured out a quick way to answer that cringe-inducing question \u201cWhat\u2019s your book about?\u201d in a way that interests other people, somebody else will. And that will be how the book is sold, how it\u2019s marketed and publicized, and largely how it finds its way to readers. In the glut of a given publishing week, where reviewers and editors have galleys piled by the dates on their spines, books are judged by their covers \u2014 or at least by their tag lines. This is just the reality: The people deciding which books to push and which ones to skip don\u2019t have time to read everything. So while I still think it\u2019s a mistake to consider the market as a primary factor in writing anything, in the future if I\u2019m drawn to two projects equally, I might start with the novel about conjoined-twin assassins before the quiet, semi-autobiographical coming of age tale. Or better yet, a quiet, semi-autobiographical coming of age tale about conjoined-twin assassins. You\u2019re welcome to steal that.\n\n2. People in the book biz actually want to love your book\n\nThough from afar it\u2019s easy to imagine the publishing business as either a collection of jaded gatekeepers who enjoy affirming their superiority by rejecting your work, or as a bunch of crass entertainment execs chasing the next megahit, I\u2019ve been disappointed to find that it\u2019s actually neither. Everyone who I\u2019ve encountered in the book biz \u2014 from editorial to sales \u2014 seems disarmingly genuine about their love of books, and their jobs are pretty much like everyone else\u2019s in the world, which is to say torn between reconciling their passion with the realities of the market. Every book they publish, especially if it\u2019s by a first-time writer, is a risk to them and their reputation, and it\u2019s one they take because they personally responded to the book. This was a revelation to me, the fact that the grand faceless facade of New York publishing turned out to be a collection of surprisingly normal people, all of whom were looking to fall in love with a manuscript.\n\n3. It\u2019s slow for a reason\n\nAs a good rule of thumb it\u2019s usually a full year between when you turn in your final edits and when your book comes out. I, for one, was rather vocal among friends about this glacial pace. I mean, how many meetings were needed to decide to hit print? It wasn\u2019t until my pub day actually came and suddenly people from all parts of my life were texting me photos of my book in their local store or library that I understood what on earth all that time was for. Getting a book into the world, it turns out, is an enormous endeavor, one based, still, on old-fashioned person-to-person communication. Yes, a book can be physically produced in a handful of weeks, but it takes a human being reading it, understanding how to talk about it, and suggesting it in person to another human being (who happens to run a retail outlet that suggests books to a community of human beings) for your book to actually make it into the world. Multiply that process by the number of booksellers, magazine editors, book reviewers, bloggers, social media loudmouths and public radio nerds nationwide and this takes some time. The upshot of this for the writer is you have a year to move on, start something else, and distance yourself from the material. By the time your first grade teacher and all your exes are reading it, it feels a little like somebody else wrote it. And I\u2019ve found that to be very helpful.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Financial concerns for a writer will never go away -- so the key is to decide how you define success", "author": "Ted Thompson", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Financial concerns for a writer will never go away -- so the key is to decide how you define success", "title": "\u201cI sold my book for $25,000\u2033: A debut novelist\u2019s experiment with radical honesty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/03/i_sold_my_book_for_25000_a_debut_novelists_experiment_with_radical_honesty/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ted_thompson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Financial concerns for a writer will never go away -- so the key is to decide how you define success", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/ted_thompson.jpg", "title": "\u201cI sold my book for $25,000\u2033: A debut novelist\u2019s experiment with radical honesty", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cI sold my book for $25,000\u2033: A debut novelist\u2019s experiment with radical honesty", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Publishing, Ted Thompson, Writers on writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17e0\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Publishing, Ted Thompson, Writers on writing, Entertainment NewsWhat has surprised you most about the book business?\nMost of the time subject matter finds you, not the other way around.\nGetting a book into the world, it turns out, is an enormous endeavor, one based, still, on old-fashioned person-to-person communication.\nBut the truth is that much of the experience of publishing a book has surprised me, some of which would probably have been helpful to know.\nAnd that will be how the book is sold, how it\u2019s marketed and publicized, and largely how it finds its way to readers."}
