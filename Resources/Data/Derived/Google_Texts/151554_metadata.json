Not long ago, gays and lesbians were not only considered unsuitable parents; they were an active danger to children, child molesters and abusers. Kids raised by same-sex couples were said to fare worse than those raised by heterosexual couples.\n\nNo such arguments were made in Chicago on Tuesday, where lawyers for Wisconsin and Indiana did their best to defend their states\u2019 bans on same-sex marriage before a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals. Their line of attack against gay marriage was quite the opposite: Gay parents are too responsible to need marriage.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2014 lawyers for Indiana and Wisconsin claimed that because a \u201cfleeting moment of passion\u201d can produce offspring, straight people need marriage as an incentive to stay together and raise their \u201cunintended children.\u201d Gay people, on the other hand, have to think and plan a lot harder if they want to be parents, so marriage doesn\u2019t concern them. In other words, because an ill-considered, alcohol-fueled romp between two straight people can lead to a baby, gays shouldn\u2019t be able to marry.\n\nJudge Richard Posner, a Reagan appointee, could only respond with sarcasm. \u201cWould you criminalize fornication?\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds like a way of dealing with this unintended child problem.\u201d\n\nThe absurdity of Indiana and Wisconsin\u2019s justifications for banning gay unions \u2014 which are really something if you listen to the audio \u2014 highlights the central problem for opponents of same-sex marriage: As traditional justifications for anti-gay discrimination have lost legal ground, defending gay-marriage bans increasingly requires logical acrobatics.\n\nThe case against same-sex marriage made a lot more sense when lawyers could rely on prejudiced assumptions about gay people. Quite simply, banning gay marriage would be perfectly reasonable if having gay parents were indeed harmful to children, if homosexuality were a psychological disorder, and if the law considered gay sex to be an immoral act worthy of sanction by the state. It\u2019s taken the courts a long time to catch up with scholarly research on gay couples \u2014 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental illness in 1973, but it has only been recently that courts have stopped considering gays to be psychologically damaged. But now that it has, opponents of same-sex marriage have been left with very little material to work with.\n\nAs conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia noted in his dissent in Lawrence v. Texas \u2014 the 2003 ruling that overturned sodomy bans nationwide \u2014 if moral disapproval of gay people and gay sex could not be codified into law, \u201cWhat justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Straight people get drunk and pregnant!
