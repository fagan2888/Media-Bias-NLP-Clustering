But a conservative campaign against the president\u2019s executive orders on immigration halted expansion of his plans and has delayed implementation long enough to threaten the program\u2019s consideration by a high court before the end of his term, the New York Times reported Wednesday.\n\nEven if Obama prevails in a challenge to his executive immigration actions before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, there would be enough time for only a few hundred thousand people to be granted deportation deferrals. In the next few weeks, when the court is expected to rule, the Republican-led states that sought to delay the immigration actions may get a victory by ensuring the challenge misses a deadline to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, leaving a decision about immigration to the next president.\n\nThese prospects have sparked protest actions by immigration reform activists, who planned to fast for nine days in the park across from the Fifth Circuit courthouse in New Orleans, the Times reported. \u201cThe lack of action is taking on the tenor of political behavior that is unconscionable for a federal court,\u201d said Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights and racial justice for Center for Community Change, which organized the protest. \u201cWe want to let the court know that we are watching. It is not acceptable to us that they are going to run out the clock to achieve political goals,\u201d she told the Times.\n\nA three-judge panel had been deliberating the president\u2019s actions for more than three months -- longer than the court\u2019s goal of 60 days after argument for most cases. Immigration activists and White House officials have braced for a loss in the appeals court, because two of the three judges have already issued rulings against Obama\u2019s immigration actions.\n\nThe president\u2019s actions came after years of gridlock on the issue of comprehensive immigration reform with House Republicans, since many of them oppose a pathway to citizenship for the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants living the country. If the circuit court doesn\u2019t decide soon, a Republican in the Oval Office and not the nine justices of the Supreme Court could decide the futures of millions of immigrants, said Josh Blackman, a conservative law professor from Texas who opposes Obama\u2019s actions.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cWhat is the point of no return? As long as we get a decision by the end of October or beginning of November, the case could be heard by the Supreme Court this term,\u201d Blackman told the Times.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "immigration reform, immigration reform obama, immigration reform blocked, immigration reform executive actions, immigration reform court decision, immigration reform undocumented immigrants, immigration reform republicans", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "\"As long as we get a decision by the end of October or beginning of November, the case could be heard by the Supreme Court this term.\"", "title": "Immigration Reform 2015: Obama Executive Action Deadline Approaches As Federal Court Mulls Legality Of Deferred Deportation Expansion", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-reform-2015-obama-executive-action-deadline-approaches-federal-court-2141203", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/10/14/obama-daca-immigration-deadline.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"As long as we get a decision by the end of October or beginning of November, the case could be heard by the Supreme Court this term.\"", "title": "Immigration Reform 2015: Obama Executive Action Deadline Approaches As Federal Court Mulls Legality Of Deferred Deportation Expansion", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/immigration-reform-2015-obama-executive-action-deadline-approaches-federal-court-2141203", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/10/14/obama-daca-immigration-deadline.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/10/14/obama-daca-immigration-deadline.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-10-14T09:20:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-14T17:56:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"As long as we get a decision by the end of October or beginning of November, the case could be heard by the Supreme Court this term.\""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f0c\"", "article_summary": "U.S. President Barack Obama vowed one year ago to provide a reprieve from deportations to as many as 4 million undocumented immigrants and allow them to work legally in the country.\nA three-judge panel had been deliberating the president\u2019s actions for more than three months -- longer than the court\u2019s goal of 60 days after argument for most cases.\nImmigration activists and White House officials have braced for a loss in the appeals court, because two of the three judges have already issued rulings against Obama\u2019s immigration actions.\nAs long as we get a decision by the end of October or beginning of November, the case could be heard by the Supreme Court this term,\u201d Blackman told the Times.\nIt is not acceptable to us that they are going to run out the clock to achieve political goals,\u201d she told the Times."}
