Through his first six games, Ranson averaged a ridiculous 37.7 points. Whether you\u2019re from the days of Pistol Pete Maravich or Steph Curry, that\u2019s serious scoring.\n\nHot? The 6-foot-2 Ranson\u2019s hands are so warm that they melt his cellphone. \u201cBut only when I get the bill,\u201d said his father and Wildcats coach Brad Ranson.\n\nSeriously, Ranson lit it up through his first five outings by making 34 3-pointers and 41-of-49 free throws as Pueblo Central got off to a 2-3 start. He opened with 39 points in a 55-54 loss to Lewis-Palmer and followed with 35 against Vista PEAK in a 64-58 setback that included nine 3-pointers.\n\nHe really started to take off against Denver West with a 43-point effort in a 79-36 whipping, \u201csettled\u201d for 27 against Golden in a 63-52 loss, then turned in one of the memorable games of the era. Ranson made eight 2-pointers, 8 3-pointers and was a sparkling 19-of-19 on free throws for 59 points versus Falcon in a 90-88 overtime thrilling win.\n\nOn Thursday, in a 44-39 victory over Loveland, Ranson had a season-low 23 points as the Wildcats evened their record and his average dipped below 40 points.\n\nEven Ranson admits to being dumbfounded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, just playing my game, trying to win games,\u201d he said. \u201cJust trying to do what I can to help us win, I guess. But what\u2019s it like. I don\u2019t know, I really can\u2019t explain it. My dad has always taught me how to score \u2026 it\u2019s just crazy to kind of comprehend it, I really don\u2019t know. \u201c\n\nBrad Ranson said his son \u201cstill has some football in him\u201d after passing for 1,316 yards and 12 touchdowns, and rushing for 918 yards and 14 touchdowns this past season. However, the coach added, \u201che\u2019s taking good shots and just putting it in the hole.\u201d\n\nOf course, the opposition has already tried trick and specific defenses in order to stop his son, even slowing the pace on purpose, but he knows to expect anything. \u201cHe gets different looks every night,\u201d coach Ranson said.\n\nPlus, Wildcats injuries have practically required the younger Ranson to score more.\n\nSenior Kobi Betts, who was the team\u2019s second-leading scorer in 2014-15 and signed to play at Air Force, went down with an ACL in a scrimmage Nov. 28. And junior point guard Isaiah Marquez may not be back until January after suffering a broken jaw.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m OK with it,\u201d said Ranson, who averaged 25 points a year ago and signed early with Northern Colorado. \u201cAnd the team is OK with it.\u201d\n\nAnd how long can it last?\n\n\u201cIf I have to? You know, I feel like I can do it. It just depends on what other teams are going to do, box-and-one, diamond-and-one. \u2026 Every game teams are turning up the heat now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut fun? It\u2019s really fun.\u201d\n\nNeil H.
