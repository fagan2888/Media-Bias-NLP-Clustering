Stacey Wespi said. \"They're starting dinner and then they get interrupted with a phone call, someone at the door, a television show, the needs of a child.\"\n\nWespi said anyone who must leave the kitchen while cooking should turn the stove off.\n\nFirefighters also say to never wear loose-fitting clothing while cooking. A 96-year-old Wichita woman died in May after suffering severe burns when the robe she was wearing came in contact with a burner on her stove.\n\nFire Prevention Week is also a good time to check smoke detectors and for the whole family to go over the plan for escaping a burning home, Wespi said.\n\n\"They need to make sure that they have a plan to get out of the house from any point of the house and they need two means of escape, not just one route,\" he said.\n\nAnybody with fire prevention questions or anybody needing assistance with in stalling smoke detectors can call the Wichita Fire Department at 268-4441.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "More than half of all accidental home fires start in the kitchen.", "language": "english", "author": "Phil White", "og": {"description": "More than half of all accidental home fires start in the kitchen.", "title": "Fire Prevention Week To Focus On Kitchen Fire Dangers", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Fire-Prevention-Week-To-Focus-On-Kitchen-Fire-Dangers-226675921.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/58C/D26/58CD266BBF0947F6A774DA4311F15D4D", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/279/BAF/279BAF390E36425AAD98708893F9FCD7.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "More than half of all accidental home fires start in the kitchen.", "title": "Fire Prevention Week To Focus On Kitchen Fire Dangers", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Fire-Prevention-Week-To-Focus-On-Kitchen-Fire-Dangers-226675921.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/fire-truck-ax.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Fire Prevention Week To Focus On Kitchen Fire Dangers", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Fire Prevention Week To Focus"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2190\"", "article_summary": "Sunday, October 6, 2013About half of all accidental house fires begin in the kitchen, so the Wichita Fire Department is using Fire Prevention Week to raise awareness about cooking fires.\n\"In the past three years, we've experienced an average of 200 cooking fires just here in Wichita,\" Crisp said.\nFire Prevention Week is also a good time to check smoke detectors and for the whole family to go over the plan for escaping a burning home, Wespi said.\nIn Wichita, just over half of the house and apartment fires so far this year have started in the kitchen.\nAnybody with fire prevention questions or anybody needing assistance with in stalling smoke detectors can call the Wichita Fire Department at 268-4441."}
