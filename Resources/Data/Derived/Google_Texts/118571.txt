GRENCHEN, Switzerland — Australian rider Rohan Dennis broke cycling’s prestigious hour record on Sunday after covering a distance of 52.49 kilometers at the Velodrome Suisse.

The 24-year-old Dennis, who won silver in the team pursuit at the 2012 Olympics, eclipsed the mark of 51.85 kilometers set by Austria’s Matthias Braendle in October.

The record was previously held by cycling greats Fausto Coppi, Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx. The UCI changed the rules last year, allowing competitors to ride bikes that can be used for endurance track events.

Dennis said “I didn’t have time to enjoy because it was a lot of pain. I hope now that the record will stay for a while.”

Australian Jack Bobridge fell just short of the Brandle’s record last month after covering 51.3 kilometers.
