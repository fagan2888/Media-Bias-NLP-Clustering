A recent R&D Magazine survey of industry leaders in 63 countries ranked the U.S. No. 1 in the world for health-care innovation.\u201d\n\nOne big reason for the United States\u2019 lead in healthcare innovation is that despite much government intervention, until recently our healthcare system \u2014 unlike those of many other countries \u2014 retained at least some ties to the free market. The way to profit in the free market, of course, is to meet the needs of consumers; and in the healthcare arena, that means coming up with newer, better, and less expensive treatments for the myriad maladies that afflict the human race.\n\nObamaCare changes all that. The misnamed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) distorts the healthcare market with its taxes, subsidies, cost controls, and other regulations, causing resources to be directed toward political rather than economic ends.\n\nThe effects of the ACA have already been felt in the insurance market, where premiums have increased and choices have been restricted, and in employment, where companies are shedding staff and shrinking employees\u2019 hours to avoid the law\u2019s mandates.\n\nThe law\u2019s effects on other sectors have, however, been largely overlooked by most media outlets. One of \u201cthe least noticed\u201d of these effects is ObamaCare\u2019s \u201cthreat to innovation,\u201d declared Atlas, a physician and senior fellow at Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution. Atlas is hardly alone in sounding the alarm over the ACA\u2019s impact on medical innovation. Many experts concur that the law is likely to slow innovation in the United States, which will surely have negative, though often difficult-to-detect, consequences for Americans\u2019 health.\n\nDevice-ive Tax\n\nPerhaps the most blatant anti-innovation provision in the ACA is the tax on medical devices. In an effort to partially pay for the law\u2019s massive spending hikes, Democrats included a 2.3-percent excise tax on revenue \u2014 not profit \u2014 from the sale of medical devices.\n\nThat tax, which took effect in 2013, \u201chas taken a heavy toll on the [medical-device] sector, hurting pricing decisions of companies and subjecting them to tremendous margin pressure,\u201d according to a December report from Zacks Investment Research. The 2.3 percent skimmed off the top has \u201cwip[ed] out almost a quarter of the profit\u201d of device manufacturers, the website said, noting that there has been \u201ca slew of divestments\u201d in the sector, many of them \u201cspecifically to offset the tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly without any comparison the most difficult situation we\u2019ve had to face in 34 years,\u201d Fred Lampropoulos, CEO of Utah-based device maker Merit Medical Systems, told Salt Lake City\u2019s KSL-TV in 2013.\n\nAt the time, Lampropoulos estimated the tax would cost his company as much as $7 million a year.\n\n\u201cYou take that kind of money out of a company and something has to give,\u201d he said, \u201cand it\u2019s basically research and development or marketing, and those are jobs.\u201d\n\nA survey taken at the end of 2014 by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), a trade group, found that 18,500 device-industry workers had already lost their jobs as a result of the tax and that the industry plans to forgo hiring nearly 20,500 employees over the next five years. Citing a 2007 report by healthcare consulting firm the Lewin Group claiming there were four indirect jobs in the general economy for every direct job in the device industry, AdvaMed calculated that the device tax could cost as many as 195,000 jobs. And that may understate things: 46 percent of survey respondents \u201csaid they would consider further reductions in employment if the tax is not repealed.\u201d\n\nThe survey also found that more than half of respondents had reduced their R&D spending as a result of the tax and that three-quarters \u201csaid they had taken one or more of the following actions in response to the tax: deferred or cancelled capital investments; deferred or cancelled plans to open new facilities; reduced investment in start-up companies; found it more difficult to raise capital (among start-up companies); reduced or deferred increases in employee compensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reduction in R&D is especially troubling as investments in research today are the cures and treatments of tomorrow,\u201d Stephen Ubl, president and CEO of AdvaMed, said in a press release accompanying the survey results. \u201cThe effects of this tax could have a damaging ripple effect for decades to come if left unaddressed. This tax is not just a tax on medical technology companies. It\u2019s a tax on medical progress.\u201d\n\nIndeed it is. According to Atlas, between 2012 and 2014, U.S. R&D spending growth averaged just 2.1 percent, slightly more than a third of the average over the previous 15 years, while R&D spending in other countries increased more rapidly. Not all of that can be blamed on Obama\u00adCare, but certainly a significant amount can: The CEO of one of the largest U.S. healthcare companies told Atlas that his company\u2019s 2013 device-tax bill exceeded its entire R&D budget. That\u2019s wealth transfer, not investment in the future.\n\nThe tax harms device makers both big and small, said Robert Grajewski, president of Edison Nation Medical, a company that helps medical inventors bring their products to market. Big companies are wary of investing in early-stage innovations \u201cbecause they know it\u2019s going to cost them significantly to bring these products to the market, and [the device tax] is just another arbitrary tax and toll on that process,\u201d Grajewski explained in an interview with The New American. Instead, he said, they\u2019re waiting for others to prove out their innovations and then buying them up at that stage.\n\nBut where are the startups going to get their capital? Since Obama signed the ACA into law, Atlas wrote, \u201cprivate-equity investment in new U.S. health-care startups has also diminished.\u201d And those that can obtain capital have another problem. \u201cWith these startup companies, revenue is king,\u201d said Grajewski. With companies \u201ctypically starting at a loss,\u201d he argued, \u201cevery dollar is important,\u201d so \u201cjust arbitrarily taking two percent, three percent away from a company \u2026 certainly is not helpful.\u201d\n\nThe device tax, he maintained, \u201cultimately hurts innovation. It hurts the delivery of care.\u201d\n\nPenny-pinching Provisions\n\nWhile the device tax\u2019s effects are easy to understand and observe, other ObamaCare provisions may have even more far-reaching but less obvious consequences.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act, from my perspective, has really put front and center the shift in healthcare from a fee-for-service business to one that\u2019s more around population housing, keeping a population healthy based on providing a set amount of capital from which then you are in charge of administering that kind of healthcare,\u201d stated Grajewski.\n\nThat, of course, is the model employed by every \u201cuniversal\u201d healthcare system in the world, and it inevitably leads to poorer care and rationing in an effort to control costs. ObamaCare, not surprisingly, is loaded with such cost-cutting measures.\n\nFor instance, the ACA assigns the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the task of \u201cmak[ing] recommendations\u201d that certain insurers be excluded from offering plans on the exchanges \u201cbased on a pattern or practice of excessive or unjustified premium increases,\u201d even if those rate hikes are applied only to plans sold outside the exchange. Since the law doesn\u2019t define \u201cexcessive or unjustified premium increases,\u201d insurers are at the mercy of HHS, which has decided that an annual premium increase of 10 percent or more will put an insurer on the \u201cnaughty list\u201d and may ultimately mean the company\u2019s exclusion from the exchange.\n\nThis policy \u201chas significant impacts on what insurers offer \u2026 inside the exchanges as well as outside,\u201d Burke Balch, J.D., told The New American. Balch, director of the National Right to Life Committee\u2019s Robert Powell Center for Medical Ethics, noted that \u201cmany of the plans in the exchanges are narrowing their networks dramatically,\u201d cutting down on the number of providers, most especially \u201cleading centers of medical innovation.\u201d That\u2019s because the high-quality research hospitals tend to be among the most expensive.\n\n\u201cThese are the research centers, these are the teaching hospitals, these are the places where the toughest and most difficult cases get sent, and these are the places where medical innovation very largely takes place,\u201d Balch said. \u201cSo over time, if you basically are excluding these top-flight, cutting-edge medical centers from the plans that people are able to get through the exchanges and also creating a disincentive for insurers even to offer such plans outside the exchanges \u2026 there\u2019s going to be insufficient demand to sustain these cutting-edge medical centers, to sustain these specialists. What happens when that occurs?... They start to go out of business, they start to cut back on the advanced, experimental procedures, and so medical progress slows to a crawl.\u201d\n\nMonetary Myopia\n\nThe exchanges also suffer from what John Graham, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, called \u201cshort-term-ism.\u201d Because individuals buying coverage on the exchanges can re-enroll in a new policy every year \u2014 indeed, HHS actually encouraged them to do so this year because the rates on the benchmark exchange plans had in many instances risen dramatically since 2014 \u2014 insurers are focused on how much each covered person is going to cost them over the next 365 days, often to the exclusion of long-term costs, Graham told The New American.\n\nGraham cited the example of two very effective drugs used to treat hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni. Those drugs, he said, can cost tens of thousands of dollars for a three-month course of treatment, which seems expensive until one considers that an untreated patient is likely to need other treatments over the rest of his lifetime and quite possibly a liver transplant, which will prove far more costly than Sovaldi or Harvoni.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re talking about spending 60, 70, 80 thousand dollars today to save half a million or more dollars over the entire lifecycle of the treatment,\u201d he explained. \u201cNow, in a system where the individual and the insurer only have a one-year-contract, the insurer has no incentive to pay for that because it doesn\u2019t capture the benefit of the long-term savings.\u201d\n\nObamaCare\u2019s shortsightedness is one of its most significant impediments to innovation. Balch referred to it as \u201ccutting off our nose to spite our face\u201d \u2014 forcing healthcare spending below market levels in the short term without realizing the harm it will do in the long term.\n\n\u201cWhenever you have something that is innovative, whenever you have something that is cutting-edge, it tends to start out as extremely expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what happens is over time, economies of scale kick in, greater efficiency occurs in its production, and the price tends to fall. But unless you have sort of the demand and the opportunity to have that initial high cost, you\u2019re not going to get the innovation that then gets to that level.\u201d\n\nOther Cure-killers\n\nAnother of the ACA\u2019s cost-cutting measures \u2014 the excess-benefits or \u201cCadillac\u201d tax, an excise tax on employer-sponsored coverage the government considers too generous \u2014 is only likely to magnify the negative effects of exchange coverage. Although the tax is indexed to inflation, healthcare costs have been rising faster than inflation for decades, which means most employer plans are likely to become subject to the tax unless they are scaled back considerably over the coming years. Some employers will simply drop coverage and let their employees buy it on the exchange, possibly chipping in extra (taxable) pay to help cover the premiums. Others will offer only the minimum coverage required by law. Either way, the disincentives to innovation created by narrow networks, low reimbursement rates, and outright refusal to pay for certain treatments can only grow.\n\nThe biggest long-term anti-innovation provision of the ACA may well be its expansion of Medicaid. According to the Heritage Foundation, 71 percent of the net increase in individual-market coverage in 2014 was attributable to Medicaid expansion. Medicaid, however, already reimburses healthcare providers at such low rates that only half of family doctors accepted Medicaid patients in 2013, a survey by physician-staffing firm Merritt Hawkins found, and half of those who do see Medicaid patients aren\u2019t accepting any new ones. Moreover, while the ACA bumped up reimbursement rates for 2013 and 2014, it did not guarantee those rates into the future, so this year Medicaid reimbursement rates have fallen back to 2012 levels even as healthcare costs have continued to rise. (Some states are paying the difference out of their own coffers this year, but they are unlikely to want to continue eating the extra cost for an extended period.)\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that patients covered by Medicaid have worse outcomes than those covered by private insurance. Much of this is attributable to Medicaid\u2019s meager reimbursement rates. When one\u2019s insurance doesn\u2019t pay what quality healthcare providers are worth, one isn\u2019t as likely to get good or timely treatment. For instance, there have been great strides in treating cancer in recent decades, much of it due to earlier diagnosis and treatment. But the low reimbursement rates and parsimonious prescription-drug plans offered by Medicaid and by many exchange plans, which Graham said are \u201cmore like Medicaid coverage\u201d than private insurance, will tend to lead to later diagnosis and less-effective treatments. Meanwhile, with the revenue stream for specialists such as oncologists drying up as a result of ObamaCare, \u201cthere aren\u2019t going to be as many of them,\u201d Graham said. \u201cAmerica,\u201d he asserted in a January Forbes piece, \u201ccannot continue to win the war on cancer if Obamacare succeeds in reducing Americans\u2019 access to oncologists or cancer drugs.\u201d\n\nAnother way in which ObamaCare stunts innovation is by mandating \u201cessential health benefits\u201d on exchange plans and requiring them to offer multiple tiers of coverage \u2014 the sorts of requirements that only large, established firms will be able to meet. Add to that the fact that subsidies are based on middle-tier (Silver) plans, and, wrote Reuters\u2019 Reihan Salam, \u201clow-end entrants that only want to focus on low-cost, limited-network Bronze-level plans won\u2019t have that option.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare includes many other incumbent-friendly provisions, which lock healthcare providers into existing business models,\u201d Salam penned. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame, as there is nothing about the goal of achieving universal coverage that necessitates making it harder for innovative new business models to take hold.\u201d That\u2019s true, but as long as that laudable objective is pursued via government compulsion, innovation is bound to suffer.\n\nThen there is the uncertainty associated with a thousand-page law and the tens of thousands of pages of associated regulations that continue to pour forth from Washington. The Obama administration has repeatedly altered deadlines, granted exemptions, and otherwise made an already difficult-to-follow statute virtually incomprehensible. Congressional Republicans have spouted a great deal of rhetoric about repealing and replacing Obama\u00adCare but until recently have followed it up with little substantive legislation. The Supreme Court has modified the law, most significantly in 2012\u2019s NFIB v. Sebelius, in which the court upheld the ACA\u2019s mandates and fines but declared its Medicaid expansion optional for states, and also in 2014\u2019s Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, in which the court ruled that closely held for-profit corporations could not be forced to pay for contraceptive coverage for their employees if their owners have religious objections to doing so. The court is now hearing arguments in King v. Burwell, which challenges subsidies for health insurance bought on the federal exchange; a decision in favor of the plaintiffs could upset the entire ObamaCare apple cart by making vast swaths of people unable to afford coverage and therefore exempt from the individual mandate.\n\n\u201cThat unknown, not knowing what the future may hold, certainly has people worried and hesitant to make moves and make decisions, and that\u2019s really slowed down innovation,\u201d Grajewski said.\n\nGraham agreed, observing that \u201cwe\u2019ve got an eternity of just arbitrary rulemaking and insider trading basically in Washington, D.C., to decide what our healthcare system looks like,\u201d though he also suggested some could be using the uncertainty as an excuse: \u201cEntrepreneurs should not be scared of uncertainty. They should manage the risk and go for it.\u201d\n\nBut managing risk is exceedingly difficult when the rules are constantly changing. Such a volatile regulatory environment was one of the prime contributors to lengthening and deepening the Great Depression, economist Robert Higgs has argued. In such a climate, businesses and investors simply hold onto their capital until things calm down to the point where they can feel relatively certain that they will get a good return on their investment.\n\n\u201cNot knowing what\u2019s coming next,\u201d Grajewski averred, \u201chas made people be very hesitant to see where things fall out or where the wind blows, and thus they\u2019d much rather wait and see before adopting new products, new processes, new technology, and even new innovations because they don\u2019t want to extend that dollar in a very belt-tightening environment when they don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what they need to do to survive.\u201d\n\nPrognosis for Progress\n\nObamaCare won\u2019t stifle all medical innovation, of course. There will always be those who are driven to succeed despite the obstacles, though much of this success may come from shipping jobs and R&D overseas to avoid the hostile environment here at home. In addition, there are others who will take advantage of the opportunities to innovate in ways that accommodate the newly cost-conscious environment.\n\n\u201cThere has been a renewed focus by entrepreneurs and startup companies to really focus on new technologies that help deliver care more efficiently, more effectively, and around this population health-management model,\u201d said Grajewski, citing the examples of the \u201cgrowth in remote patient monitoring equipment\u201d and the introduction of the GuardianOR, a device to prevent operating rooms from accidentally discarding costly surgical equipment, which he claimed is \u201ca multi-billion-dollar-a-year issue.\u201d\n\nFew would argue that innovations that cut the cost and improve the quality of care are a bad thing. In fact, it\u2019s likely that many such innovations would have occurred even in the absence of ObamaCare, though perhaps it would have taken them a bit longer to come to fruition. But to the extent that such innovations are driven by political considerations rather than consumer needs, capital is diverted to less efficient uses, retarding economic growth. Then, as innovations desired by consumers dwindle, pressure is likely to mount for the government to \u201cinvest\u201d in new medical technologies to make up for alleged \u201cmarket failure,\u201d with predictably disastrous results. In the words of Forbes\u2019 Bill Flax, \u201cHere come the medical Solyndras.\u201d\n\nIs all lost, then? Are we doomed to a future of stagnating, rather than advancing, healthcare? Perhaps not. Republicans now control both houses of Congress and have introduced a number of bills modifying or repealing all or part of Obama\u00adCare. Getting them past Democrats in the Senate, who could mount a filibuster given that there are only 54 GOP senators, and then signed by the president is another matter.\n\nOne bill that might find its way onto the books is a repeal of the medical-device tax. As of this writing, the House version of the bill has a whopping 276 cosponsors, including 36 Democrats, and the Senate version has 34 cosponsors, including five Democrats. Thus, the bill can easily pass the House, and if just one more Democratic senator supports the bill (assuming all Republicans do), it will be filibuster-proof. It will not necessarily be veto-proof, though amending it to include some offsetting spending cuts might convince Obama to sign it, suggested Graham.\n\nAlso, unrelated to ObamaCare but very much related to innovation is the 21st Century Cures Initiative, a bill championed by House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.). According to Graham, the bill would \u201creframe the whole national system for researching and developing not only pharmaceutical and biotech but digital medicine, medical devices that could just be apps on your smartphone, just restructure the whole architecture of the regulatory apparatus to reduce the cost and increase the speed to market of some of these new technologies.\u201d That\u2019s something that is sorely needed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become increasingly sluggish and demanding over the years, delaying or denying approval of many promising and even lifesaving treatments \u2014 even when they have been approved for use in other developed countries. The agency, Graham says, has \u201cbecome measurably worse over the last five years,\u201d which in part explains why it now costs $2.6 billion to develop a new pharmaceutical, nearly 2.5 times more than it cost just 12 years ago. If shuttering the FDA is not in the cards, then serious reform of the agency is a must if U.S. companies are to continue bringing new treatments to market.\n\nWhat does the future hold for medical innovation in the United States? \u201cThe 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers Medical Technology Innovation Scorecard found that \u2018the gap between innovation leaders and emerging economies is rapidly narrowing,\u2019\u201d wrote Atlas. \u201cAnd that \u2018although the United States will hold its lead, the country will continue to lose ground during the next decade.\u2019\u201d If America wishes to remain at the forefront of finding new cures for the innumerable ailments that plague mankind, Obama\u00adCare needs to go.\n\nThis article is an example of the exclusive content that's available only by subscribing to our print magazine.
