Bernie Sanders of Vermont earned bragging rights for his economic, trade and anti-Wall Street themes in Michigan on Tuesday and demonstrated \u2013 much to the dismay of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton \u2013 that he will be a threat to her campaign in upcoming races in Ohio, Illinois and other large, industrialized and racially diverse states.\n\nThe democratic socialist\u2019s stunning two-point victory over Clinton in the Wolverine State yesterday made a mockery of previous polling data showing Clinton up by as much as 20 points. It once again highlighted the frontrunner\u2019s vulnerabilities on matters of trust and her weakness among white voters \u2013 especially young people and blue-collar workers. Finally, it underscored Clinton\u2019s inability to develop an effective rejoinder to Sander\u2019s anti-trade message that effectively blames NAFTA and other major trade deals dating back to the administration of President Bill Clinton for the loss of millions of U.S. jobs.\n\nRelated: Even Bad-Boy Trump Can't Seem to Stop Trump\n\n\u201cThe political revolution that we\u2019re talking about is strong in every part of the country,\u201d Sanders said at a hastily called news conference in Miami last night, in the wake of his unexpected showing in Michigan. \u201cAnd frankly, we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen.\u201d\n\nIt would be a mistake to make too much of the Michigan results. The name of the game is winning delegates, and Clinton still finished the night in good shape. She and Sanders almost equally divvied up Michigan\u2019s 130 pledged delegates, with 65 going to Sanders and 58 to the former secretary of state. Earlier in the evening, Clinton picked up many more delegates by crushing Sanders in Mississippi, 82.6 percent to 16.5 percent. Clinton claimed 29 pledged delegates from Mississippi to just four for Sanders.\n\nThe goal is to amass at least 2,383 delegates before this summer\u2019s Democratic national convention to claim the nomination and Clinton is more than half way there, with 1,221 pledged and \u201csuper\u201d delegates, to just 577 for Sanders. And because the Democrats will continue to observe a proportional distribution of delegates based on the outcome of each race instead of \u201cwinner take all,\u201d it would take a series of major blowouts by Sanders to catch up with Clinton in the delegate count.\n\n\u201cSanders almost certainly cannot win the nomination unless he starts winning big states in landslides\u2014a most unlikely development,\u201d Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said on Wednesday. \u201cBut he\u2019s now going to stay in, probably through June, and he\u2019ll bedevil Clinton.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, a new Quinnipiac University poll out today shows Clinton heading into next week\u2019s crucial primary contests in Ohio and Florida leading by nine points in the Buckeye State, 52 to 43 percent, and by a 30-point margin in Florida, 62 to 32 percent. There will be other contests in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.\n\nRelated: Could Clinton Choose Sanders as Her Vice President?\n\nStill, Sanders and his campaign strategists have shown a remarkable ability to rewrite the political narrative. Clinton hoped to dismiss Sanders as essentially a regional candidate who played well in New England and a few western and plains states with overwhelmingly white populations but without the political chops to attract large numbers of blacks, Hispanics and white working class voters in the South, Northeast and Midwest.\n\nAlthough he was largely written off as an also ran in Michigan, Sanders visited the state repeatedly, poured millions into TV and radio ads and tapped into a mother lode of angry and frustrated voters who were still uneasy about the economic recovery and held strong negative views about major free trade agreements, such as the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement and the pending Asian-rim Trans-Pacific Partnership that Clinton once promoted but now opposes.\n\nBoth Sanders and Clinton devoted considerable attention to the drinking water crisis in Flint, and used the beleaguered city as the venue for last Sunday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate. Pundits criticized Sanders for a shaky debate performance and Clinton knocked him off stride momentarily with the claim that he had opposed the federal bailout of Michigan\u2019s auto industry \u2013 an assertion Sanders called a \u201clow blow\u201d and strongly disputed in subsequent radio ads. But Sanders proved far more strategic than Clinton in targeting pockets of support outside the Detroit metropolitan area and Flint, with their large black populations.\n\nRelated: Bernie and Hillary Take the Gloves Off in a Fiery Debate\n\nWhile political experts will be studying Sanders\u2019s upset victory over Clinton for years to come, here are five preliminary explanations for what happened.\n\n1- The polling was just plain lousy. Clinton began the day leading Sanders by 21.4 points in the RealClearPolitics average of polling in Michigan, including those of Fox News, CBS, the Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist, Monmouth University and local news organizations. Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm said that polling in Michigan political contests has been historically bad. Yet even prominent outside political analysts got it wrong, including FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver, who put Clinton\u2019s chances of beating Sanders at \u201c99 percent.\u201d\n\n2- Clinton badly underestimated the political venom in Michigan towards free trade agreements. The economy was foremost in the minds of voters who turned out for the primary, according to exit polls, and almost six in 10 said international trade deals like NAFTA costs jobs in the United States. Among that group, Sanders beat Clinton by nearly 20 points. One in three voters complained in exit polling that Clinton is too pro-business. Sanders also ran ads showing that over the years Clinton waffled on the question of \u201coutsourcing\u201d that seriously damaged Michigan\u2019s once booming economy.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Tax Plan Soaks Everybody, With the Wealthiest Paying Millions More\n\n3- Sanders made a break through among African Americans\u2014the very group that Clinton has captured and held in mostly Southern states. Exit polls showed that he trailed Clinton in those states on average by 84 percent to 16 percent. By contrast, he captured 31 percent of the black vote in Michigan--his strongest performance to date, which may bode well for him in next week\u2019s Super Tuesday races. Clinton was also hurt by a relatively mediocre turnout of older blacks in Detroit and Flint.\n\n4- Sanders won thanks to a big turnout of independents. The Vermont socialist is riding the crest of a populist movement sweeping both parties, and gained a decided edge over Clinton because of Michigan\u2019s open-primary rules. Sanders, who spent much of his career as an independent, had no choice but to enter the presidential race as a Democrat if he hoped to get into the running. His message of correcting income inequality, cracking down on Wall Street big shots and reforming a \u201ccorrupt\u201d campaign finance system is registering outside of the party. Under Michigan\u2019s open primary rules, independents and moderate Republicans could cross over and vote for him on Election Day. Exit polls showed Sanders won roughly three-fourths of independent voters on Tuesday. Those crossovers also contributed to a record turnout.\n\n5- Clinton just can\u2019t overcome her voter trust problem. Clinton, like Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, has long been saddled with high negatives on questions of honesty and trust. Her biggest problem remains nagging questions about her use of a private internet server to handle sensitive or highly classified government messages while she was at the State Department. The FBI and two inspector generals have been investigating Clinton\u2019s handling of her email, and Trump and other GOP candidates gleefully speculate that she may be indicted before the November election.\n\nSanders has been careful in responding to questions about Clinton\u2019s email problems, although he has become more aggressive on that subject in recent weeks. He also has been hitting hard at Clinton\u2019s past cozy relations with Wall Street and the millions of dollars in speaking fees she has picked up after leaving government from New York bankers and others in the financial world. Exit polls showed that Michigan Democrats by a margin of 80 percent to 57 percent believe that Sanders is more honest and trustworthy than Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.", "title": "How Sanders Defied the Odds to Beat Clinton in Michigan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/09/How-Sanders-Defied-Odds-Beat-Clinton-Michigan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02292016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/09/How-Sanders-Defied-Odds-Beat-Clinton-Michigan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02292016_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm said that polling in Michigan political contests has been historically bad.\nEarlier in the evening, Clinton picked up many more delegates by crushing Sanders in Mississippi, 82.6 percent to 16.5 percent.\nExit polls showed that Michigan Democrats by a margin of 80 percent to 57 percent believe that Sanders is more honest and trustworthy than Clinton.\nShe and Sanders almost equally divvied up Michigan\u2019s 130 pledged delegates, with 65 going to Sanders and 58 to the former secretary of state.\nAmong that group, Sanders beat Clinton by nearly 20 points."}
