Over the past year they have returned 47 per cent and 48 per cent respectively.\n\nAs well as investing in biotech companies, Worldwide Healthcare has exposure to some of the world\u2019s biggest drugs firms. It is also invested in businesses that should benefit from the roll out of \u2018ObamaCare\u2019, which will result in 30million Americans gaining access to health insurance.\n\n\n\nAlthough the trust is 70 per cent invested in the US, it warrants its \u2018worldwide\u2019 label by the fact that it is also invested in Europe, Asia and emerging markets.\n\n\n\nGavin Haynes, managing director of Bristol-based adviser Whitechurch Securities, believes the long-term potential for investment in healthcare is \u2018compelling\u2019 for the simple reason of demographics.\n\n\n\nHe says: \u2018With the average age in the Western world ever increasing, healthcare is likely to remain a long-term growth industry. As people get older, their need of medical products and services increases.\u2019\n\n\n\nWhat he likes about Worldwide Healthcare is OrbiMed\u2019s \u2018extensive scientific, medical, finance and operational expertise\u2019.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Worldwide,Healthcare,Trust,boosted,blockbuster,drugs,ObamaCare", "original-source": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2519847/Worldwide-Healthcare-Trust-boosted-blockbuster-drugs-ObamaCare.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "As well as investing in biotech companies, Worldwide Healthcare has exposure to some of the world\u2019s biggest drugs firms.", "title": "Worldwide Healthcare Trust boosted by blockbuster drugs and ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2519847/Worldwide-Healthcare-Trust-boosted-blockbuster-drugs-ObamaCare.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/07/article-2519847-19E6247C00000578-708_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp, noydir", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2519847, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Worldwide,Healthcare,Trust,boosted,blockbuster,drugs,ObamaCare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-12-07T22:06:32.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Jeff+Prestridge,+Financial+Mail+on+Sunday", "section": "Investing", "modified_time": "2013-12-08T14:31:18.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Worldwide Healthcare Trust boosted blockbuster drugs ObamaCare"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "This is Money", "description": "As well as investing in biotech companies, Worldwide Healthcare has exposure to some of the world\u2019s biggest drugs firms.", "title": "Worldwide Healthcare Trust boosted by blockbuster drugs and ObamaCare", "url": "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-2519847/Worldwide-Healthcare-Trust-boosted-blockbuster-drugs-ObamaCare.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/12/07/article-2519847-19E6247C00000578-708_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "description": "As well as investing in biotech companies, Worldwide Healthcare has exposure to some of the world\u2019s biggest drugs firms."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0013\"", "article_summary": "As well as investing in biotech companies, Worldwide Healthcare has exposure to some of the world\u2019s biggest drugs firms.\nAs people get older, their need of medical products and services increases.\u2019What he likes about Worldwide Healthcare is OrbiMed\u2019s \u2018extensive scientific, medical, finance and operational expertise\u2019.\nBlockbuster drugs and ObamaCare offer a boost to Worldwide Healthcare TrustInvestors in biotechnology funds have enjoyed a rip-roaring year on the back of a booming US stock market, frantic takeover activity and a string of best-selling drugs developed by biotech companies.\nWorldwide Healthcare has exposure to some of the world's biggest drugs firmsHe says that by 2016, nine out of the world\u2019s ten best-selling drugs will have been developed by biotech firms, against six now.\nGains: The fund will benefit from Barack Obama's care actFor UK investors, it offers two investment trusts, the \u00a3297million Biotech Growth fund and the bigger and more broadly invested Worldwide Healthcare fund."}
