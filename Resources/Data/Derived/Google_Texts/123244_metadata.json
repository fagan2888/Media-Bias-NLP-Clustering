Bipartisan legislation has been introduced that calls for considering the socio-economic factors of a hospital's service population in calculating readmission scores in pay-for-performance formulas, he said.In addition to working on those two fronts, Nickels said, the AHA also has to guard against legislators' attempts to pay for their own pet programs by cutting Medicare funding\u2014particularly funding for graduate medical education.Chet Speed, vice president for public policy at the American Medical Group Association , said refining Medicare's shared-savings program for accountable care organizations tops the AMGA reform agenda along with stabilizing funding for Medicare Advantage plans.\n\nSpeed said more than 100 of the 435 large, multispecialty group practices that belong to the AMGA participate in an ACO and the feedback the organization receives is that commercial ACOs offer a lot more flexibility than those under the CMS umbrella.\n\n\n\nThe attribution process, in which ACOs are assigned responsibility for specific beneficiaries, remains a big problem as well, Speed said. \u201cWhen 40% of the people in an ACO are seeking care outside of the ACO, it's difficult to manage that population.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe AMGA will also work to block funding cuts to Medicare Advantage, a business more AMGA members are getting into. \u201cThe cuts mandated in the Affordable Care Act are likely to continue,\u201d Speed said. \u201cWe're trying to ensure that any further cuts to the MA program are kept to a minimum.\u201d\n\n\n\nBecause of the annual drama surrounding potentially huge Medicare payment cuts driven by the sustainable growth-rate physician-reimbursement formula, Medicare Advantage is seen as more stable and predictable revenue stream for large practices, Speed said.\n\n\n\nWhile not directly related to healthcare reform, the SGR is linked to several reform initiatives such as paying primary-care doctors at Medicare rates for services delivered to Medicaid beneficiaries. The ACA's Medicaid parity provision is set to expire Dec. 31, and physician organizations are pushing to extend it, but the SGR may get in the way.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be a strong effort to extend the Medicaid payment parity, but it's unclear whether something like that could get passed through Congress individually or as part of larger healthcare legislation in a lame-duck session,\u201d said Anders Gilberg, the Medical Group Management Association's senior vice president for government affairs. \u201cBut, when you link Medicaid to Medicare, you're simply linking it to a system that still remains under the SGR formula\u2014which doesn't supply any more stability.\u201d\n\n\n\nA bipartisan, bicameral SGR reform bill was introduced in both houses of Congress last year, but the effort to get it passed unraveled at the last minute as lawmakers argued over how to pay for it. Instead, Congress approved the 17th legislative \u201cpatch\u201d to postpone SGR-driven pay cuts until April 1, 2015.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're setting ourselves up for an 18th patch, that's the fear the physician community has,\u201d Gilberg said. \u201cSo, all our focus is on getting Congress to pass SGR reform in the lame-duck session.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne reason for optimism, according to Gilberg, is that\u2014if funding SGR repeal results in unpopular spending cuts elsewhere\u2014there will be shared accountability. If Republicans take control of the Senate after the election, he said the GOP will end up \u201cowning the issue\u201d along with any negative repercussions that become attached to their action or inaction.\n\n\n\nSpeed was not optimistic. He predicted another 12- or nine-month patch will be passed next March and repeal won't be seriously addressed until the summer of 2016.\n\nWatching for ACO rules\n\nIn addition to keeping their eye on Congress, physician organizations are keeping watch for announcements from the White House Office of Management and Budget. The office has been reviewing a rule making adjustments to the ACO program for several weeks. Speed said the CMS has been told by the AMGA and others that its ACO program is requiring physicians, who are used to operating under a fee-for-service system, to take on too much financial risk too soon. He's hoping this may be addressed in the rule. Neither he nor Gilberg would predict when the rule would be released, but both said they wouldn't be surprised if it comes Aug. 29\u2014the Friday before the Labor Day weekend.\n\nTargeting the device tax", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "The dynamics of healthcare reform may wildly change in the weeks ahead.
