The Breathmobiles aim to reduce ER visits related to asthma.\n\nRIALTO >> The bench seat in the motor home is filled with patients and parents. So are chairs under a canopy outside the vehicle.\n\nIt\u2019s appointment morning for Arrowhead Regional Medical Center\u2019s Breathmobile No. 1 as it brings asthma treatment to neighborhoods across the San Bernardino and Inland valleys.\n\nOn Wednesday, this modernized version of the doctor making house calls was at Simpson Elementary School, one day after the school year ended in the Rialto Unified School District.\n\nImplemented in 2007, Arrowhead Regional Medical Center now operates two mobile Breathmobiles that make house calls to schools and serve the neighborhoods around them.\n\nBreathmobile No. 2 operates primarily in the High Desert, visiting schools in cities that include Hesperia, Victorville, Phelan and Trona.\n\nBusiness is good, said Karen O\u2019Cull, Arrowhead Regional\u2019s Breathmobile program.\n\nRains and cooler temperatures in late spring have created a \u201cpollen storm,\u201d which is triggering asthma and nasal-breathing issues for many county residents, she said.\n\nWhile the goal of the Breathmobile is to reduce emergency room visits due to asthma, O\u2019Cull said she believes the region\u2019s population growth and the dramatic expansion of warehousing \u2014 which brings with it more truck traffic and pollution \u2014 are behind the surge of asthma distress cases seeking ER attention.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more asthma in the 5 and under age group, but we are also trying to catch asthma earlier,\u201d O\u2019Cull said.\n\nDr. Lance Brown, chief of pediatric emergency medicine at Loma Linda University Medical Center and Children\u2019s Hospital, said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine an uptick in the already high volume of relatively sick children (displaying asthma-like symptoms).\u201d\n\nThey show up in the ER in \u201cvery serious condition,\u201d he said.\n\nA big driver in the increasing demand for Breathmobile services has been the long wait times for appointments with pulmonary disease specialists, O\u2019Cull said.\n\nEven before the Affordable Care Act, most children had access to health insurance, she said.\n\nThe issue is timely access to care, she said. As young patients get appointments some six to eight months out, their parents bring them to an ARMC Breathmobile to get stabilized while they wait for a provider in their health network, O\u2019Cull said.\n\nAmong those visiting the Breathmobile on Wednesday were Elder Garcia, 12, who had been visiting emergency rooms off and on for several years prior to his treatments at the country-run Breathmobile about a year ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI used to wake up at night, and I couldn\u2019t breathe,\u201d Elder said Wednesday.\n\nHis mother Hortencia Leyva said his face would turn purple from lack of oxygen, during some of those attacks.\n\nLike many Breathmoble patients, the soon-to-be eighth-grade student at the district\u2019s Jehue Middle School in Colton, has been stabilized on an inhaled bronchodilator and an inhaled steroid.\n\nThe Breathmobile stop at Simpson Elementary was the location closest to the family home, Leyva said.\n\nTo schedule an appointment at the Breathmobile, call 909-498-6277.", "article_metadata": {"description": "RIALTO >> The bench seat in the motor home is filled with patients and parents.
