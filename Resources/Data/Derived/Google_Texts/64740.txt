In his column for The Blaze, conservative commentator Wayne Root proffered a unique theory for why Chief Justice John Roberts has twice voted to save the Affordable Care Act — like former House Speaker Dennis Hastert, the “lifelong conservative warrior appointed by George W. Bush to become the key conservative vote in important decisions” is being blackmailed.

“Justice Roberts was born, raised and groomed for one job in this life,” Root wrote, “to join that Supreme Court, strike down Obamacare, protect the Constitution and end big government overreach. Yet he is the man responsible for saving Obamacare – twice.”

“This doesn’t seem odd to you?” he asked. “This doesn’t smell rotten?”

Root noted that Democrats would only need to blackmail one or two key Republican figures — the other possibility he floats is House Majority Leader John Boehner — in order to effectively nullify all of the GOP’s recent electoral victories. The “Obama Crime Family” certainly has the means to acquire information on conservative targets, after all.

“What makes anyone think the government and its three-letter agencies (IRS, NSA, DOJ, FBI, SEC) don’t know everything bad about everyone in key positions in Washington, D.C.?” Root asked. “What makes you think that blackmail isn’t happening every day to conservative politicians — except it’s the government doing the blackmailing?”

Most conspiracy theorists are smart enough to know that asking paranoid-sounding questions is an effective way to communicate the possibility of a conspiracy without actually being required to provide proof — which is why Root deserves a modicum of applause for treating his readers to some baseless speculation:
