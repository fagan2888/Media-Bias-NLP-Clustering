The updates also clarify that Wauwatosa cited provisions in the public records law to support the reasons for denial.\n\nWauwatosa residents: Interested in knowing which of your local eateries has a roach situation, or conversely, which ones have been religiously following food safety codes?\n\nIt could take a while to find out.\n\nSince October, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has been asking for the Wauwatosa Health Department's database of restaurant inspections.\n\nBut the agency says it can't turn over the database because it contains medically sensitive information.\n\nIn other words, the Health Department paid $7,000 in taxpayer money for a database that, by its design, has barriers to public access.\n\nNearly a decade ago, the Health Department's current head, Nancy Kreuser, approved the creation of a homegrown environmental health database because, according to the city attorney's office, the city lacked alternatives.\n\nThe database includes restaurant inspections, a public record that details food code violations of restaurants, as well as other information the agency collects, such as test results for food-borne illnesses that it says are confidential under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.\n\nAccording to a letter from the city attorney's office, the software doesn't have the capability of selecting one set of records from another. It isn't compatible with any common formats or commercial software, which would allow dissemination of the public records.\n\nThe department says it isn't planning to update the software because of budget concerns.\n\n\"The City honors open records requests and in paper format for this kind of record,\" Kreuser said Friday in an email.\n\nThe Wauwatosa city attorney's office, however, denied a Journal Sentinel open records request for the database late last year.\n\n\"The city's current database includes personally identifiable information within the meaning of HIPAA. The database cannot be released in its current form,\" a letter from the city attorney's office said.\n\nVirtually all health departments in Wisconsin are able to release their restaurant inspections databases.\n\nThe state offers a database to municipalities for free that many agencies in Wisconsin have joined. Kreuser said the state's database isn't a viable option for Wauwatosa because it doesn't contain certain necessary features.\n\nIn the four-county area that includes Waukesha, Washington and Ozaukee counties, only Wauwatosa does not make its database available.\n\nIn January, the agency agreed to provide individual reports of restaurant inspections as they occur. While the Journal Sentinel will begin making any recent reports available on its website each month, these won't provide the tallies of violations and quick searching and comparing of restaurants that the originally requested database would allow.\n\n\"It's astonishing that their system is so screwed up, they can't isolate restaurant inspections from other kinds of data,\" said Bill Lueders, president of the Wisconsin Freedom of Information Council.\n\nLueders also questioned the application of HIPAA.\n\n\"Everything involving a physical condition is not a medical record,\" Lueders said. \"I seriously question the application of HIPAA to people who contact a government agency to say that they got a tummy ache. That's not a medical record.\"\n\nIn an email, a Wauwatosa city attorney wrote on behalf of the Health Department that medical information in the database varies widely but can include actual medical records as well as reports of medical conditions.\n\nThese could be, for example, tests or lab reports created in response to complaints for food-borne illnesses.\n\nUsually, records with private medical information are separate from restaurant inspections.\n\nFor example, the City of Milwaukee has restaurant inspections in one database, and investigations into outbreaks that contain protected medical information are in another.\n\nThe state Department of Health Services said its restaurant inspection database isn't intended to store any confidential medical records.\n\nThe City of Wauwatosa denied other freedom of information requests related to the database.\n\nThe total cost of creating the program was around $7,000, but the city attorney's office declined to provide documents mentioning the cost of acquiring or creating the database. Relying on public records law, the city said the records request was too broad and lacked a time limit.\n\nThe city wouldn't disclose any contracts related to creating the software, citing the same reason of an overly broad records request. Finally, the city was hush-hush about whether it hired programmers or firms to create the software, calling that information a \"trade secret.\"\n\nWhen asked in December whether more access to the restaurant inspections database would be in the public's interest, or whether they'd be in favor of plans to update the software, Mayor Kathleen Ehley and Ald. Bobby Pantuso, who is on the Board of Health, deferred to the city attorney's office.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Wauwatosa lags in allowing public to inspect restaurant database", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/health/wauwatosa-lags-in-allowing-public-to-inspect-restaurant-data-b99195961z1-243261341.html", "image": {"width": 974, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/database-thumb1.jpg", "height": 748}, "type": "article", "description": "In the four-county Milwaukee area, only Wauwatosa won\u2019t make its database public, saying part of it contains medically sensitive information.", "title": "Only Tosa does not make its database available"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/database-thumb1.jpg", "title": "Wauwatosa lags in allowing public to inspect restaurant database", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "description": "In the four-county Milwaukee area, only Wauwatosa won\u2019t make its database public, saying part of it contains medically sensitive information."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ac1\"", "article_summary": "Since October, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has been asking for the Wauwatosa Health Department's database of restaurant inspections.\nThe Wauwatosa city attorney's office, however, denied a Journal Sentinel open records request for the database late last year.\nThe state Department of Health Services said its restaurant inspection database isn't intended to store any confidential medical records.\nIn January, the agency agreed to provide individual reports of restaurant inspections as they occur.\nFor example, the City of Milwaukee has restaurant inspections in one database, and investigations into outbreaks that contain protected medical information are in another."}
