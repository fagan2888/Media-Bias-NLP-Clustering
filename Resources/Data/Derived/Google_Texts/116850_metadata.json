The $15.9 million grant was among 12, ranging from $2 million to $18 million over a three-year period.\n\nThe grant was to the American College of Cardiology Foundation. Lewandowski, who is credited with the original idea, will oversee the project.\n\nSMARTCare will put existing software into a package that can become part of an electronic health record. The work will be done by a contractor.\n\nThe most immediate result could be wider adoption of software that provides practice guidelines.\n\n\"This is the ACC (American College of Cardiology) guidelines put in a convenient electronic format,\" DeFranco said.\n\nThe guidelines could help prevent the overuse \u2014 and the underuse \u2014 of tests and treatments.\n\n\"This ensures we do the tests that are truly appropriate,\" DeFranco said.\n\nIt also helps doctors keep up with the flood of new information.\n\nThere can be six or seven major changes every few years in any one of the 30 to 40 sets of cardiology guidelines, DeFranco said. And all of the changes affect the way he treats patients.\n\n\"It's impossible for an individual physician to keep up,\" he said.\n\nShared decision making\n\nAnother component will include software for shared decision making \u2014 helping patients make the best decisions for themselves on the care they want.\n\nA patient may want to treat his or her heart disease, for instance, with medication rather than angioplasty.\n\nAnother component will track outcomes to help researchers determine which treatments are the most effective. Patients' names will be removed from the data.\n\n\"This is all about improving best practice in health care,\" said Dianne Kiehl, executive director of the Business Health Care Group, an employer coalition, which wrote a letter in support of the grant.\n\nThe long-term goal is to help make it easier for health systems to accept a fixed payment for patients who have heart disease.\n\nHealth economists and policy experts across the political spectrum agree that developing new ways of paying hospitals and doctors will be essential in slowing the rise in health care spending.\n\nPatient concerns\n\nBut one concern is that patients may be wary that payment reform could lead to doctors skimping on care.\n\n\"We know there is a lot of overtreatment, but you don't want to go too far in the other direction,\" said Harold Miller, president and chief executive of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.\n\nMiller was a strong supporter of SMARTCare. He and others noted that it could become a model for other medical specialties.\n\nLewandowski, DeFranco and Bartholow refined the idea over several years, eventually partnering with two cardiologists in Florida and talking to people like Miller at health systems, businesses and a long list of organizations involved in health policy.\n\nThe organizations included the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Consumers Union, National Business Coalition for Health, and National Partnership for Women and Families.\n\nSeveral wrote letters supporting the grant application. Ten members of the Wisconsin congressional delegation did the same.\n\nAurora helped with the legal fees and gave advice on the design and information technology requirements. The Wisconsin Medical Society, the Alliance, an employer coalition based in Madison, and other groups also backed the idea.\n\nThe biggest commitment, though, was the time put into the proposal by Lewandowski, DeFranco and Bartholow.\n\n\"We need this level of physician leadership,\" Kiehl said. \"Physicians can make a difference.
