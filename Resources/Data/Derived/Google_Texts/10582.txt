(Photo: CPR/John Daley) Colorado’s healthcare exchange said it saw a spike in complaints as more people tried to sign up for health insurance before an enrollment deadline Monday.

On Monday, 12,600 people enrolled in health insurance and dental coverage on the exchange, more than any single day ever before, said Connect for Health Colorado Spokesman Luke Clarke.

Enrollment in the program has far outpaced last year's numbers.

The high volume is mostly what created longer waits and caused some people technical problems on the exchange website, Clarke said, adding that there were far more successful enrollments than signup problems.

Clarke said anyone who started the application process before Dec. 15 will be able to get coverage at the start of the new year.

Carol McClure of southeast Denver said she’s encountered problems on the website for several weeks.
