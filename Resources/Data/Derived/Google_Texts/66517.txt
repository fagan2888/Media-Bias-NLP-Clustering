Washington (CNN) Rudy Giuliani is stepping back from his comments questioning President Barack Obama's patriotism -- finally, after sticking by those remarks repeatedly in recent days, and watching Republican 2016 presidential contenders distance themselves from him.

The former New York City mayor took to The Wall Street Journal opinion pages Sunday night seeking to move beyond the firestorm over his comments, saying his problem is really with Obama's policies.

"My blunt language suggesting that the President doesn't love America notwithstanding, I didn't intend to question President Obama's motives or the content of his heart," Giuliani wrote. "My intended focus really was the effect his words and his actions have on the morale of the country, and how that effect may damage his performance."
