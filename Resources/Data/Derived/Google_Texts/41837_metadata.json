The legislation setting up the ballot measure was very deceiving.\n\nSo please vote No to stand up for LSP and other state parks with their backlog of $400 million of needed capital improvements.\n\nIf measure #2 passes, the Friends will need your help in contacting legislators to advocate that the measure\u2019s \u201cenabling legislation\u201d ensures that some money goes to state parks and to work for other sources of state funds.\n\nSam Pesin\n\nFriends of Liberty State Park", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sam Pesin, of Friends of Liberty State Park, urges voters to not support New Jersey's ballot measure 2 regarding open space funding.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.1", "og": {"site_name": "Hudson County View", "description": "Sam Pesin, of Friends of Liberty State Park, urges voters to not support New Jersey's ballot measure 2 regarding open space funding.", "title": "LETTER: Please Vote NO on New Jersey Ballot Measure 2 - Hudson County View", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://hudsoncountyview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Friends-of-Liberty-State-Park-e1415056341562.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-03T19:31:19+00:00", "url": "http://hudsoncountyview.com/letter-please-vote-new-jersey-ballot-measure-2/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Hudson County View", "image": {"src": "http://hudsoncountyview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Friends-of-Liberty-State-Park-e1415056341562.jpg"}, "description": "Sam Pesin, of Friends of Liberty State Park, urges voters to not support New Jersey's ballot measure 2 regarding open space funding.", "card": "summary", "title": "LETTER: Please Vote NO on New Jersey Ballot Measure 2 - Hudson County View"}, "article": {"section": "Bayonne", "tag": "open space", "published_time": "2014-11-03T19:22:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-03T19:31:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc933\"", "article_summary": "Sam Pesin, President of Friends of Liberty State Park, urges voters to not support New Jersey\u2019s ballot measure regarding open space funding.\nLand trust organizations and other environmentalists who don\u2019t care about state parks or urban areas pushed for this ballot measure to support their mission.\nThe legislation setting up the ballot measure was very deceiving.\nSam PesinFriends of Liberty State Park\nWe apologize for the lateness of urging you now to vote No on ballot measure 2, which seemed from its innocent language to be another positive open space measure that would help state parks, as well as open space acquisition, with an increased source of sustainable funding."}
