In addition to carving out spots for new positions like the chief population health officer and chief incentive officer, some hospitals and healthcare systems hire chief data officers (CDOs) to oversee data collection.\n\nAlthough the position is relatively new to healthcare, it's one that industries such as banking, government and insurance embrace, according to InformationWeek.

That's now changing as more organizations realize that this is a business responsibility,\" they said.\n\nEven the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services sees the value of the position. Last month CMS named Niall Brennan its first CDO to oversee the new Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics and lead improvements in data collection and dissemination to make the information more transparent.\n\nHealthcare organizations that consider adding the position should seek someone who has strong communication skills, strategic thinking capabilities and a high-level understanding of technology, according to InformationWeek.
