Sheriff’s deputies in Eagle County are looking for a backpack full of drugs that allegedly was whisked away from the scene of a stabbing early Sunday in Beaver Creek.

The agency said a fight occurred at a party at the Tarnes at Beaver Creek, an apartment complex for the ski resort’s employees, at 12:30 a.m. Witnesses told investigators that 19-year-old Chase Allen Speegle and 18-year-old Aliyah Dolores McVay, both of East Wenatchee, Wash., showed up and started trouble.

Speegle told people at the party that the couple had just arrived in town from Washington then showed off a tan backpack containing cocaine, the methamphetamine derivative MDMA, commonly referred to as Molly, and LSD.

They were asked to leave and complied, according the sheriff’s department. Speegle allegedly returned and stabbed a 24-year-old man at the party in the back with a 7-inch knife.

The victim’s injuries are not life-threatening, officials said. While people at the party held Speegle down, McVay grabbed the backpack and ran away, witnesses told investigators.

When sheriff’s deputies caught up to her, she no longer had the backpack and refused to cooperate with investigators.

The Eagle County Drug Task Force is looking for the drugs. Anyone with information can call 970-328-8500 or Eagle County Crime Stoppers at 970-328-7007 or 1-800-972-8477.

There is a a $1,000 reward.

Speegle is being held on $7,500 bail in the Eagle County Detention Facility on several charges, including felony assault with a deadly weapon.

McVay is being held in the same facility on $2,000 bail on a felony charge of destruction of evidence and misdemeanor obstructing a peace officer.
