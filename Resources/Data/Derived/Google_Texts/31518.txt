ASBURY PARK —A powerboat that washed ashore in Asbury Park still sits forlornly on the beach while police try to track down its owner.

The boat ‘Brave Heart’ mysteriously appeared on the northern shore of Asbury Park directly across from Deal Lake on Christmas Eve.

Its propeller mangled and its electrical panel damaged, the boat has scrawled on its starboard side the words ‘I will miss you.’ It also has a 2015 registration sticker.

Asbury Park police officer Michael Casey said a check of the hull identification number – similar to a vehicle identification number on a car – shows the boat’s owner lives in Rockaway Beach on Long Island.

He said Asbury Park authorities contacted Rockaway police for that department to find the owner, but so far there has been no further word.

“We’re treating it now as found property,” Casey said. “We don’t suspect any type of suspicious activity or foul play.”

Mayor John Moor called the situation “screwy.”

“It seems awful strange they can’t get in touch with the owner,” he said. “Who the heck knows.”
