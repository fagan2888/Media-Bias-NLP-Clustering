The approach helped engineers secure the government\u2019s backing \u2014 crucial in acquiring the state-of-the-art combat jet engines indispensable to the project \u2014 after the daunting risks brought an initial point-blank refusal.\n\nScience classes at more than 5,000 British secondary schools are now linked into the project via the Bloodhound website, BloodhoundSSC.co.uk, which furnishes what the project\u2019s principals say is up-to-the-minute technical data that can be channeled into classroom projects. One school has a built a miniature version of Bloodhound and propelled it across the schoolyard at 240 m.p.h.\n\nNoble no longer travels that fast. Since setting his record two decades ago, he has handed the driving responsibilities to a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, Andy Green, an Oxford-educated mathematician and wing commander who flew combat missions in northern Iraq before the American-led invasion in 2003.\n\nPhoto\n\nGreen, 51, holds the current speed record, 763 m.p.h., making him the only man to exceed the speed of sound on land. He set the mark aboard Noble\u2019s second jet-powered vehicle, Thrust SSC, in 1997. Now he has teamed with Noble to raise the record by 250 m.p.h., which would be by far the biggest single jump in the record\u2019s history.\n\nGreen will make the bid without an ejector seat, or much else in the way of inbuilt survivability should Bloodhound crash; the project engineers have decided, in effect, that a catastrophic failure at 1,000 m.p.h. would be inescapably fatal.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nInstead, they have decided that Green\u2019s safety will be assured, as far as it can be, by the rigorous design of Bloodhound and the thousands of hours spent on computer simulations to prevent the vehicle from going airborne \u2014 the greatest fear of all aspiring record-breakers \u2014 or veering from the arrow-straight path it must follow.\n\n\u201cFundamentally, we\u2019ve solved the safety problems of supersonic speed on land,\u201d Green said, referring to his 1997 success. For this project, he said, engineers used supercomputers \u201c1,000 times more powerful\u201d than the ones used by Thrust SSC in 1997, which subsequent computer analysis showed to have come within a hairbreadth of going airborne on its record run.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve managed the airflow around Bloodhound so it doesn\u2019t push the car offline, it doesn\u2019t tear the surface of the desert and it doesn\u2019t tilt upwards,\u201d Green said.\n\nStill, he acknowledged, \u201cNot everything works in the real world exactly as you expect it to from computer simulations.\u201d That, he said, was one of the lessons emphasized by Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, when he visited the Bloodhound team a year before he died in 2012.\n\nThe Bloodhound team aims to achieve the 1,000-m.p.h. target at the Hakskeen Pan, a vast, dried-up lake bed in the Kalahari desert in South Africa\u2019s Northern Cape province. Hundreds of villagers recruited by the local government are already well advanced in readying the stretch of desert floor earmarked for the attempt, 12 miles long and nearly 600 yards wide, by removing more than 6,000 tons of surface stones.\n\nThe team has scheduled the vehicle\u2019s first rolling tests for an airfield in England in the spring of 2015. That will be followed by a series of runs at carefully ascending speeds on the Hakskeen Pan in August 2015. Finally, after Bloodhound has been fine-tuned back in England, an assault on the 1,000-m.p.h. mark is planned for August or September 2016.\n\nPhoto\n\nTo some of Bloodhound\u2019s critics, building a car to travel 1,000 m.p.h \u2014 faster than a bullet fired from a .357 revolver \u2014 seems ultimately pointless in an era when manned spacecraft have achieved 24,000 m.p.h. But Bloodhound is aiming to accomplish something that project leaders say is more difficult than a space launch.\n\nThe seven-ton vehicle, 44 feet long and 6 feet wide, will be powered by three engines: a Rolls-Royce jet engine developed for the Typhoon, the R.A.F.\u2019s current front-line fighter; an adapted version of an American-made Nammo rocket engine located beneath the jet; and a V8 Formula One engine that will act as the rocket\u2019s fuel pump. On the record run, the jet and rocket engines are expected to generate 21 tons of thrust, more than six times the power of all the Formula One cars that line up for Grand Prix races.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAt the height of the record attempt, Bloodhound is expected to cover nearly 1,500 feet, or about the length of five football fields, per second. No aircraft flying lower than 500 feet \u2014 a level at which shock waves generated by supersonic speeds resonate off the ground, causing massive challenges for stability \u2014 has gone that fast; the record for low-level manned flight is 988 m.p.h., set in the 1970s by a civilian, Darryl Greenameyer, piloting an American-built F-104 Starfighter.\n\nOn top of that, it will take almost five miles to bring Bloodhound to a halt with airbrakes, parachutes and, at under 200 m.p.h., inboard brakes on its cast-aluminum wheels, and only after it has passed through the \u201cmeasured mile\u201d that record-breakers are required to cover. Under rules set by the Paris-based governing body for motorsports, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l\u2019Automobile, record-breakers must complete two legs \u2014 outbound, then back over the course in the opposite direction \u2014 within 60 minutes.\n\nLike many who have challenged the land speed record, Noble has traveled a lonely and at times forlorn path since beginning the project in 2008. At times, the bid has survived month to month, through financing shortfalls and unexpected technical problems. Deadlines for the record attempt have repeatedly passed.\n\nNow, though he still has millions of dollars to raise, Noble is confident that his team of 60 designers, engineers and support staff members working in a chilly commercial warehouse at Avonmouth, just south of Bristol, will meet the 2016 deadline.\n\nBut he is wary enough, and experienced enough, to deliver a sobering note of caution.\n\n\u201cAndy Green wants to live a long time,\u201d Noble said of his pilot. \u201cHe wants to live long enough to sail his boat into harbor at a steady five knots. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure that he does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140302215152, "twitter": {"description": "Bloodhound, a car powered by jet and rocket engines, is part of a $70 million plan to reach 1,000 m.p.h. and shatter the land speed record, continuing a tradition of British zeal and risk.", "creator": "johnfisherburns", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/autoracing/driven-to-set-a-land-speed-record-zero-to-60-plus-940.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002745424"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "title": "Driven to Set a Record: Zero to 60, Plus 940", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/03/sports/jpBLOODHOUND1/jpBLOODHOUND1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/autoracing/driven-to-set-a-land-speed-record-zero-to-60-plus-940.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002745424", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/sports/autoracing/driven-to-set-a-land-speed-record-zero-to-60-plus-940.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/autoracing", "hdl_p": "Zero to 60, Plus 940", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 2, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Records and Achievements,Automobiles,Noble  Richard,Green  Andy,Automobile Racing,Rocket Science and Propulsion", "description": "Bloodhound, a car powered by jet and rocket engines, is part of a $70 million plan to reach 1,000 m.p.h. and shatter the land speed record, continuing a tradition of British zeal and risk.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "John F.
