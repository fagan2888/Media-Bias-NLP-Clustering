These returned cats face danger in many forms: being struck by cars; attacked by dogs, foxes, coyotes and other cats \u2014 not to mention their suffering and death by disease. An indoor cat lives 15 years, but a feral cat lives only two to five years.\n\nOne returned feral cat still will kill native birds. In the U.S., 2.4 billion birds are killed by cats annually, according to a 2013 report by the Smithsonian Conservation Biology and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This number is 15 percent of all birds in the U.S. These birds are vital to maintaining biodiversity by being pollinators, seed dispersers, predators of insects and rodents and food for other wildlife. Remember, cats are non-native, exotic, invasive species!\n\nWhy should residents of Wausau care about this issue? Birding is big business! In 2015, two bird-related conventions brought almost 400 people to the area, and two more conventions are scheduled for 2016. These attendees all spent money on lodging, food, gas, etc. In 2011, the Fish and Wildlife Service found in a survey that $107 billion was spent on bird watching activities, which supports 650,000 jobs. What revenue do feral cats bring to the local economy?\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg on the problems returned feral cats pose to the area.\n\nSusan Haug\n\nRingle\n\nThe writer is Wausau Bird Club spokeswoman and the author of Wausau\u2019s Bird City Application.\n\nOur guidelines for letters to the editor have changed.
