Bush\u2019s administration. \u201cIt may not be great for America, but that\u2019s the reality.\u201d\n\nScully says Republicans may be able to make substantial changes but not repeal Obama\u2019s law entirely.\n\nWhat would a different health care conversation sound like? Some possibilities:\n\nPRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES\n\nNearly three-quarters of the general public see prescription drug costs as unreasonable, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey. That concern seems to be driven by new breakthrough drugs that can cost $100,000 a year and even more. Last year it was Sovaldi, a cure for liver-wasting hepatitis C infection. Next it could be skin cancer drugs in the approval pipeline.\n\nEconomist Len Nichols of George Mason University in Virginia says the cost of new medications is \u201cunsustainable,\u201d but government price controls could stifle innovation.\n\nMost patients are not exposed to those excruciating cost pressures because the vast majority of prescriptions are for lower-priced generic drugs. Overall, only 1 in 5 people taking prescription drugs say it is difficult to afford their own medications, the same survey found.\n\nHIGH INSURANCE COSTS\n\nThe value of a health insurance card is being eroded as employers and insurers impose higher deductibles, copayments and other cost-sharing on top of premiums.\n\n\u201cWhen people ask me what is the No. 1 change I want to make in the Affordable Care Act, my answer is that it\u2019s not affordable enough,\u201d said John McDonough, a former Democratic Senate aide who helped steer the health law to passage. \u201cMoving forward, one of the challenges is how we\u2019re going to address this new world of cost sharing.\u201d\n\nGETTING EVERYONE COVERED\n\nWhen the health care law passed, a little more than 80 percent of people under 65 \u2013 the age to qualify for Medicare \u2013 had health insurance. That share is now up to around 90 percent, largely the result of the law.\n\nYet covering the remaining uninsured will be a challenge. Much depends on some 20 states \u2013 mainly GOP-led \u2013 that have not accepted the health care law\u2019s Medicaid expansion. The ruling may budge a couple, but probably not Texas, the biggest prize.\n\n\u201cThe people who are going without coverage in states whose leaders are denying them a chance to get Medicaid are pawns in a political game,\u201d said former California Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman, one of the main authors of the health law.\n\nLONG-TERM CARE\n\nEconomist Gail Wilensky, an adviser to Republicans, says the patchwork system for caring for frail older people and the disabled \u201cis an issue that isn\u2019t going away.\u201d She\u2019s involved with an informal discussion group that spans the political spectrum, looking for long-term care ideas that might find support. It could take years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any stomach for taking on these issues post-King v. Burwell,\u201d she said, referring to the name of the Supreme Court case decided this past week. \u201cPeople are going to need time.\u201d\n\nPAYING FOR QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY\n\nRevamping the way hospitals and doctors are paid for their services is the top issue for employers, insurers and government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Everyone wants to get away from compensating providers on a piecemeal basis for the sheer volume of services. But defining what constitutes quality care turns out to be not so easy, and it\u2019s unclear whether the new approaches will produce significant savings.\n\nLook for these changes to continue at full speed, aided by the spread of computerized medical records and increasingly sophisticated data analysis.\n\nThere could be a downside, says Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. \u201cYou\u2019re getting hospitals merging, and they are becoming mega-operations,\u201d she said. \u201cSmall doctors\u2019 groups feel like they are just being swallowed up.\u201d\n\nCONTROLLING COSTS\n\nWhen all is said and done, the U.S. still spends too much for health care. After a lull the last few years, spending is expected to pick up again. The government has its fingers in practically every pot, with a jumble of laws and regulations that create conflicting incentives, said economist Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan public policy center.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got multiple and largely uncoordinated subsidies and rules,\u201d said Steuerle. \u201cOn the cost side, what I see is more and more efforts to put budget constraints on the system.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's no shortage of pressing issues, including prescription drug prices, high insurance deductibles and long-term care.", "pubdate": 20150628, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "There's no shortage of pressing issues, including prescription drug prices, high insurance deductibles and long-term care.", "title": "What's next for U.S. health policy?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RTR4YXBA1.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/democrats-health-care-conversation-must-shift/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "There's no shortage of pressing issues, including prescription drug prices, high insurance deductibles and long-term care.", "title": "What's next for U.S. health policy?", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/RTR4YXBA1.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, health care, obamacare, PBS NewsHour Weekend"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba2e\"", "article_summary": "Much depends on some 20 states \u2013 mainly GOP-led \u2013 that have not accepted the health care law\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\u201cIt would be great if the health care conversation moves to where people are, not relitigating these insurance issues.\u201dWishful thinking, say Republicans.\nHIGH INSURANCE COSTSThe value of a health insurance card is being eroded as employers and insurers impose higher deductibles, copayments and other cost-sharing on top of premiums.\n\u201cSmall doctors\u2019 groups feel like they are just being swallowed up.\u201dCONTROLLING COSTSWhen all is said and done, the U.S. still spends too much for health care.\nWhat would a different health care conversation sound like?"}
