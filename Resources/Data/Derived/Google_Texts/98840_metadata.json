Later in the episode, Jackman and host Jimmy Fallon drank a few when they played Musical Beers with some very special guests, including Bobby Moynihan, Questlove, Kate McKinnon, Colin Jost and Chris Hemsworth. The second guest of the Tonight Show was actress Tiffani Thiessen, who stars in the show Dinner at Tiffani\u2019s. The musical artist, Hozier, was also an awesome addition to the show.\n\nJimmy Fallon started off the show with his always funny monologue, cracking witticisms about topics torn from today\u2019s headlines. For example, Jimmy Fallon joked about the snow, and then he talked about the Supreme Court listening to arguments about whether ObamaCare is \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d Or, as Jimmy Fallon said that most people call it, \u201cThanksgiving dinner.\u201d\n\nJimmy Fallon mentioned Hillary Clinton\u2019s remark during a speech asking \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to see a woman President?\u201d He joked that Biden said he might \u201chave to pull a Mrs. Doubtfire.\u201d\n\nJimmy Fallon joked about airlines in the U.S., which now will have fewer seats but will charge more money. Then, a high-speaking conspiracy theorist in the audience rose up to question what Fallon was saying. The guy in the audience was trying to talk about his various conspiracy theories, while Jimmy Fallon kept asking about a raccoon the guy had said bit off a delicate part of his anatomy.\n\nThe house band, The Roots, played Jimmy Fallon to his desk, where he mentioned tonight\u2019s guests like Hugh Jackman from Chappie, who will also play Musical Beers with him and some surprise guests. His guest, Tiffani Theissen, is on the Cooking Channel with a cooking series called Dinner at Tiffani\u2019s. She was also in Fallon\u2019s recent Saved By The Bell reunion skit. Later on, Hozier was the musical guest.\n\nJimmy Fallon introduced his weekly hashtag comedy segment. He had started the hashtag #SpringBreakRaps. He shared some of the tweets, but they are not included here. Hearing them sung is what really helped add humor to the bit. Some of them were pretty funny.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please welcome Hugh Jackman!\u201d Jimmy Fallon said. \u201cYou\u2019re here; that\u2019s all we want,\u201d he added.\n\nFallon asked Jackman if he was \u201ca cigar afficionado.\u201d Jackman said \u201cIf smoking one a year counts.\u201d He did say that his dad was one, and he occasionally liked smoking a good cigar. Jackman said he had even flown to Cuba and bought some cigars there.\n\nJimmy Fallon related how he had bonded with his dad, and Arnold Schwarzeneggar, by smoking cigars. He said that he had licked the cigar, though, and Arnold had told him \u201cStop licking the cigar!\u201d\n\nHugh Jackman had also been in District 9, by the same director as the guy who directs Chappie. He stars with actress Sigourney Weaver in Chappie. Jimmy Fallon showed a couple of photos of Hugh Jackman, one in black-and-white when he had a mullet. Jackman said that his hair \u201calso had blond tips,\u201d and his wife had not liked it at all.\n\nThen, Jimmy Fallon and Hugh Jackman each put on crazy-looking wigs, complete with mullets. \u201cCute girls, what do you think \u2014 yes or no?\u201d Hugh Jackman asked. The females in the audience screamed their approval of their new looks.\n\nFallon said \u201cI look like a contest winner or something.\u201d He said that \u201cIt\u2019s the first time that a robot has AI and acts like a human.\u201d He showed a clip from Chappie, and if the clip is any indication of what the rest of the movie will be like, it should be an action-packed blockbuster.\n\nWhen the Tonight Show came back from a commercial break, Jimmy Fallon, Hugh Jackman, and the show\u2019s surprise guests, mentioned above, played Musical Beers. Fallon and Jackman still wore their wigs as they played. Besides the three cast members of Saturday Night Live, the host of this week\u2019s SNL, Chris Hemsworth, also played the game.\n\nEverybody had to grab a cup of beer after the music stopped and drink it, and if a person was not able to get a cup, he or she would be eliminated. Kate McKinnon was the first to go. The Roots played Bang Bang. Jimmy Fallon ended up winning the game of Musical Beers.\n\nUpon returning from the next commercial break, Tonight Show host, Jimmy Fallon, introduced the show\u2019s second guest, actress Tiffani Thiessen. Tiffani wore a black dress and sported a baby bump. \u201cThis will be number two?\u201d Jimmy Fallon asked. Tiffani told him \u201cYes,\u201d and that her daughter was four-and-a-half. Her daughter said that the new baby should be named \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d if he was a boy.\n\nTiffani said that in the Saved By the Bell skit they had done, even the locker numbers had the same numbers as they did on the original show. The video had been watched by 40 million viewers on YouTube.\n\nJimmy Fallon told her \u201cI love your new show!\u201d He said that he \u201cloved cooking shows,\u201d and he had several cookbooks.\n\n\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s all about rhythm, and timing \u2014 and a lot of alcohol,\u201d Tiffani told him.\n\n\u201cThen, I am a cook,\u201d Jimmy Fallon replied.\n\nTiffani mentioned to host Jimmy Fallon that she had learned how to make several kinds of cocktails, and she brought Fallon \u201cCrunchy Peanut Butter Bites.\u201d She said she had brought enough for all of the members of The Roots, and also enough for the studio audience. Fallon said that Hozier will be performing next, as the Tonight Show headed to another commercial break.\n\nBack from the break, Jimmy Fallon introduced the show\u2019s musical guest, Hozier. Hozier performed the new song Work Song. Hozier was great, and brilliant song Work Song just might be another big hit, like Take Me to Church has become.\n\nAfter the Tonight Show came back from the last commercial break of the episode, Jimmy Fallon thanked all of his guests and another great Thursday night episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon concluded. Fallon\u2019s guests, Hugh Jackman and Tiffani Thiessen, were very entertaining, and the game of Musical Beers was one of the episode\u2019s highlights. Hozier capped the night off with the performance of the cool song, Work Song.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nChappie Official Trailer #2\n\n\n\nSources:\n\nNBC Universal Media Village\n\nHozier Official Site\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "On The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon this Thursday, March 5, 2015, Hugh Jackman from the science fiction movie Chappie was one of Fallon\u2019s guests.
