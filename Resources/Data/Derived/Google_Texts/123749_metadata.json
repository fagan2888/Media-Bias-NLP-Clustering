Thanks for joining us.\n\nPresident Obama reportedly will unveil a plan to offer tax relief for the middle class during his State of the Union address Tuesday night. The plan would be paid for by increasing taxes the rich pay on investments and inherited property.\n\nFor more about the president\u2019s proposal, its chances of success, and its political impact, we\u2019re joined now from Washington by Carol Lee. She is White House correspondent for The Wall Street Journal.\n\nSo, Carol, who does the administration say that this will help, and how?\n\nCAROL LEE, The Wall Street Journal: Their main target is the middle class.\n\nAnd they \u2014 their argument is that it will help the middle class by taking \u2014 closing certain tax loopholes that they say benefit the top 1 percent of Americans and making different changes to the tax code, including raising the capital gains tax from 23.8 percent to 28 percent by, as you mentioned, taxing some of these investments and assets that people transfer to their children that currently are not taxed and a number of other things.\n\nAnd what they do with that money, which is roughly several hundred billion dollars, is put it towards proposals such as tripling the child tax credit. So, that would go from $1,000 to $3,000. They\u2019re proposing to create a new tax credit for households where both spouses work.\n\nAnd they would \u2014 the president has unveiled a proposal to offer free community college for folks. And that\u2019s another thing that \u2014 that this would pay for. And so it\u2019s kind of \u2014 it\u2019s basically the president\u2019s opening bid on a number of tax issues that have been vexing Washington for a long time.\n\nAnd, so far, it has not gotten a very warm reception from Republicans. But the White House\u2019s argument is that this would help the middle class, the Republicans say that they are now focused on the middle class, the economy is doing better, and so now is the time to do things \u2014 things \u2014 take steps like this.\n\nAnd while conceding that they probably won\u2019t get everything that they want, which is a very optimistic view of this package, given the response we have seen from Republicans, the hope is that this is an opening bid to what the White House hopes are broader negotiations on some of these individual tax code issues.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Right.\n\nSo, what the political implications, even if it can\u2019t get through Congress?\n\nCAROL LEE: Well, it sets the parameters of the debate for 2015, which is turning into 2016.\n\nAnd the two things that the parties have agreed on \u2014 and you have seen this in a number of potential Republican presidential candidates, you have heard it from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the White House is really pressing on this issue \u2014 is that the middle class is need \u2014 in need of help, and that wages are stagnant, and while GDP is growing and unemployment rate is at new lows, the middle class is still really struggling and requires some targeted measures to try and build them up.\n\nAnd so what you\u2019re going to hear the White House and Democrats do when they get with these measures, this package that the president is going to roll out on Tuesday in his State of the Union address, is put the ball in Republicans\u2019 court to say, OK, well, what are your proposals? What do you \u2014 what do you want to do? And if you don\u2019t support this, then what do you support?\n\nAnd so it\u2019s the \u2014 it\u2019s designed to, even if it doesn\u2019t pass, move the debate along to where the two sides are having to stake out their territory ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Carol Lee, joining us from Washington from The Wall Street Journal, thanks so much.\n\nCAROL LEE: Thank you for having me.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama will reportedly unveil a plan to offer tax relief for the middle class during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night.
