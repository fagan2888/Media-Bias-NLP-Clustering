Dixon walks up to a woman, sitting near Orlando\u2019s Coalition for the Homeless shelter, and offers her a pack.\n\nThe woman says she already got some condoms from the health department. And she\u2019s trying to sell them.\n\n\u201cWell let me give you some more, then, you might want to sell them to somebody that can use them,\u201d said Dixon, a health educator. \u201cHelp save somebody\u2019s life, whether you make a dollar or not.\u201d\n\nThe day is hot, and threatening a Florida downpour. A man sitting in an SUV cracks a joke to the HIV educators about the number of condoms he\u2019s handed.\n\n\u201cNot that much Viagra in the world, man,\u201d he cackled.\n\nThese activists say there\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re handing out condoms in this historically poor, predominantly African American neighborhood in Orlando\u2019s urban core. HIV and AIDS is a problem in Parramore. More than three people out of every 100 are infected.\n\nParramore also is where an empty lot soon will be transformed into the new Orlando City soccer stadium. Hope and Help peer mentor Steve Addona wonders aloud what that change will bring, when the stadium turns Parramore into an extension of downtown?\n\nHe worries because of how geography already plays a role in HIV\u2019s prevalence in Parramore. Interstate 4 stands as a barrier, strangling and isolating the neighborhood off from the rest of Orlando.\n\nResidents in this situation often stay put, so once HIV is introduce into the area, the virus spreads from partner to partner in what experts call a \u2018closed\u2019 system.\n\n\u201cWhere are these people gonna go?\u201d Addona asked. \u201cAre they gonna be pushed closer to the Pine Hills area? They\u2019re certainly not gonna disappear.\u201d\n\nDixon, one of the team handing out condoms, leads the group deeper into the Parramore neighborhood. Boarded up empty homes dot the area. Residents hang out in clusters outside them.\n\nHope and Help Health Educator Seantele Jarrett spots a middle-aged woman standing in her front yard and hands her a pack of condoms. The woman says her brother just got out of jail, where he took an HIV test. He\u2019s not positive, she tells them.\n\n\u201cTell him he wants to stay that way,\u201d Jarrett said.\n\nA woman Jarrett knows walks up and gives her a big hug. Another man approaches the pair and asks for condoms.\n\n\u201cI just thought about it, I\u2019m going where a gang of freaks at,\u201d the man said.\n\n\u201cOh lord, I better give you three or four packs,\u201d Jarrett says. \u201cGive em to the freaks, tell \u2019em use \u2019em. And tell them make sure they wear they right size. Don\u2019t put on a magnum if they don\u2019t need it.\u201d\n\nSome residents turn down the condoms. Most residents thanked the group, and found some humor in the situation. One mother yelled at her son, telling him he doesn\u2019t need a baby.\n\n\u201cOur prevention team loves to work in Parramore because they are so appreciative of our help,\u201d said Lisa Barr, executive director of Hope and Help.\n\nProblems such as poverty, crime and low education levels add up against Parramore residents, she said. Only about half of adults have a high school diploma or GED.\n\n\u201cBut there are factors stacked up against them that make them more susceptible to HIV and other infections,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the rates in that area are quite high.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Orlando\u2019s infamous Orange Blossom Trail and its high homeless population, sex workers and drug addicts. All are big risk factors for HIV and AIDS.\n\nBarr said she wants to put her Hope and Help program smack dab into Parramore to address the needs. They even picked out a site.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s a city ordinance that prohibits social service organizations from being in that area,\u201d she said.\n\nThe ordinance she mentions is Orlando\u2019s \u201cParramore Heritage Overlay District.\u201d It prohibits new social service organizations from coming into the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want the homeless to gather,\u201d Barr said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the service we provide.\u201d\n\nOrlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said the ordinance pre-dates his administration.\n\n\u201cBefore I took office, there was some recognition that virtually all of the social services were being located in one neighborhood, which is Parramore,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cSo there was a ban, not on social services, but the expansion of social services.\u201d\n\nSo Dixon and his crew continue to share their message \u2013 and the condoms \u2013 out on the sidewalks of Parramore. In total, nearly 3,000 condoms were handed out in one afternoon.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
