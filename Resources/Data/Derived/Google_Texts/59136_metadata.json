(Hudson Star-Observer photo by Chuck Nowlen)\n\nMax Schramm didn\u2019t know he was a finance natural until he graduated from college -\u2013 that\u2019s when he finally saw how his language degree could give him a professional edge.\n\n\u201cPart of what I do is finance and financial planning, and part of it is also teaching and communicating,\u201d says the 25-year-old Oregon native, who started Hudson\u2019s Schramm Investment Advisers in December after getting a French Studies degree three years ago from the University of Minnesota.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good at explaining how this stuff works in layman\u2019s terms, and that part of the adviser-client relationship is one of the most valuable. The adviser-client relationship is built on trust, and it\u2019s so much easier to trust people when you know exactly where they\u2019re coming from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in that. I like answering all the questions that my clients have.\u201d\n\nAdds Schwann, a certified fund specialist, the oldest professional designation in the mutual funds industry, granted and administered by the Institute of Business and Finance:\n\n\u201dOne of the biggest reasons I got into this business is that I really like talking about it \u2013- I like talking about it a lot. I never want to leave anyone in the dark about their investments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sugar-coat my advice or tell them they\u2019re doing something right when they\u2019re not just to please them. I\u2019m a pretty open guy anyway, but I\u2019m also legally bound to work only in their best interests and no one else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSchramm Investment Advisers\u2019 specialties: asset management, financial planning -\u2013 \u201ceverything from drawing up a budget to projecting cash flow for retirement or college planning\u201d \u2014 and retirement-account management.\n\nAll are anything but one-size-fits-all propositions, Schramm notes. All three depend on a client\u2019s individual circumstances and financial goals, and they\u2019re all full of pitfalls as well.\n\nYet many people have no idea about the intricacies of how financial instruments work.\n\nSchramm says of retirement-account management, for example:\n\n\u201cA lot of people get enrolled in their employer\u2019s 401k program, but they don\u2019t get a lot of guidance on what\u2019s really going on with it. If they have questions, often their employer tells them, \u2018Talk to an administrator.\u2019 But administrators usually don\u2019t have the ability to tailor their advice to an individual.\n\n\u201cAnyone can learn how to read, say, a balance sheet or an income statement, but to really draw up an investment thesis for someone based on the fundamentals, you have to paint an overall picture with a pretty sophisticated brush and a delicate hand.\u201d\n\nCore values\n\nAnother uncommon trust-building aspect of the Schramm Investment Advisers business model: its basic flat-fee compensation philosophy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get any commissions on anything or require special fees,\u201d Schramm explains. \u201cOne of the values I have is that I\u2019m basically on call for my clients whenever I\u2019m needed. My relationships with my clients are very close and very collaborative.\u201d\n\nAnd the age factor?\n\n\u201cActually, I think it works in my favor,\u201d Schramm says, while also acknowledging the value of older pros\u2019 experience. \u201cI\u2019m not bound to a paradigm that I\u2019ve been working under for 25 years.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t start working during the great bull market of the 1990s, so I\u2019m not working from that perspective. I operate under a more new-school investing approach that draws on many diverse schools of thought.\u201d\n\nAnother plus: \u201cPeople want to know that their relationship with their adviser won\u2019t be eclipsed by the adviser\u2019s own retirement at some point. Eventually, I suppose, retirement will be a possibility for me, but not for a long time at the age of 25.\u201d\n\nSchramm was inspired to look at financial advising as a career by his older brother Victor, who also started his own office \u2014 in Portland, Oregon \u2014 last year. Max still talks shop with Victor \u201calmost every day.\u201d\n\nWhile Schramm\u2019s college major took him in another direction, he had been interested in economics all along.\n\n\u201cSince long before college, there was always something about economics that I found attractive,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cEconomics in general is a very deep and rich pool of theory. There\u2019s a lot of depth in figuring it all out because it\u2019s neither an art nor a science \u2013- it\u2019s both. It\u2019s not just crunching numbers; it\u2019s learning the scientific economic basis and then applying it to the real world in kind of an artful way for your clients.\u201d\n\nSchramm had planned to return to his home town, Eugene, after graduating from the University of Minnesota. Then he met his fianc\u00e9e, fellow French Studies major Annie Bearss, who is now finishing her master\u2019s degree in architecture at UMN.\n\nVictor sold Max on financial advising, and the more he learned, the more he liked it.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re involved in a liberal arts education, you tend to take on pretty negative ideas about so-called \u2018business types,\u2019\u201d he laughs. \u201cAll your peers have their noses turned up at all those business kids wearing ties to class.\n\n\u201cBut once I explored it after college, I figured out that I kind of have a knack for this. I found out that I really do have all the skills for this field.\u201d\n\nSchramm\u2019s office is in the Hudson Professional Building, 901 Fourth St. For more information, contact him at (651) 249-0496 or go to the company website: www.schrammadvisers.com.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,business,news,Business,Hudson,investments,Financial", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chuck Nowlen", "og": {"site_name": "Hudson Star Observer", "description": "Max Schramm didn\u2019t know he was a finance natural until he graduated from college -\u2013 that\u2019s when he finally saw how his language degree could give him a professional edge.\r\n\u201cPart of what I do is finance and financial planning, and part of it is also teaching and communicating,\u201d says the 25-...", "title": "Schramm Investment Advisors: hard-wired skill; 'new school' ...", "url": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/business/3667213-schramm-investment-advisors-hard-wired-skill-new-school-approach", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/square_300/public/field/image/bu-SchrammInvestment.jpg?itok=me9s_EW6", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Max Schramm didn\u2019t know he was a finance natural until he graduated from college -\u2013 that\u2019s when he finally saw how his language degree could give him a professional edge.\r\n\u201cPart of what I do is finance and financial planning, and part of it is also teaching and communicating,\u201d says the 25-...", "title": "Schramm Investment Advisors: hard-wired skill; 'new school' ...", "url": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/news/business/3667213-schramm-investment-advisors-hard-wired-skill-new-school-approach", "image": "http://www.hudsonstarobserver.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_430/public/field/image/bu-SchrammInvestment.jpg?itok=HGIgDdfg", "site": "hudsonwi", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 558004674284026}, "keywords": "News,business,news,Business,Hudson,investments,Financial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hudsonstarobserver", "tag": "News,business,news,Business,Hudson,investments,Financial", "modified_time": "2015-02-01T01:32:24-06:00"}, "image": {"alt": "Max Schramm in his office in the Hudson Professional Building on Fourth Street.
