Her training is paid for by a provision of the Affordable Care Act called the Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program, which is up for renewal this year. The program has allocated $230 million nationwide over five years to try to tackle a worsening shortage of primary care physicians and draw eager young doctors to places where they are sorely needed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut if Congress does not reauthorize the program, it is unclear what will happen to Dr. Gopal, the 31 other residents at the Harlem center and the hundreds of other residents under the program working at similar centers across the nation.\n\n\u201cLosing them would greatly reduce the care we can provide to the people of Harlem,\u201d said Dr. Neil Calman, the chief executive of the Institute for Family Health, which operates the center in Harlem.\n\nResidents at the center, he noted, handle almost one-third of the 47,000 annual primary care visits there.\n\nPhoto\n\nA provision to finance the program for the next two fiscal years is included in a health care bill that is expected to go to a vote in the House of Representatives on Thursday. The bill will also need approval from the Senate and President Obama.\n\nAdvocates for the program say it enjoys support among individual politicians, including Republicans. But its roots in the Affordable Care Act mean it could expire, the collateral damage of a deeply polarized Congress.\n\nRepresentative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat, whose district includes the Harlem center, called the residency program, and health centers in general, \u201ctremendously successful.\u201d But he also said in a recent telephone interview that he was worried that political concerns might destroy the program.\n\n\u201cWe have to determine just what kind of Congress we\u2019re going to have here,\u201d Mr. Rangel said. \u201cWill they ever stop fighting health care, for their own constituents?\u201d\n\nRepresentative Chris Gibson, Republican of New York, said in a statement that he appreciated the young doctors the program had attracted to a health center in his district, in Kingston.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe training supported by this program improves the odds that my constituents have access to primary care providers,\u201d Mr. Gibson said. \u201cToo many upstate New Yorkers have to drive 30 minutes or more to see a doctor. By training and keeping doctors in underserved areas, we\u2019re working toward a goal of increasing access to quality health care for more of our communities.\u201d\n\nDr. Calman cautioned that even if the program were refunded, it would not permanently address the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a short-term fix that leaves programs with anxieties about their futures,\u201d he said.\n\nThe teaching program\u2019s residencies train primarily in health centers, rather than traditional teaching hospitals. Health centers, which are based in underserved communities, provide outpatient medical services and often have a sliding pay scale for patients who are uninsured or on Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor.\n\nThe idea is that dealing with preventive medicine for ambulatory patients in such settings will connect primary care doctors to the communities and teach them how to best serve their patients.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration, which manages the program, has not yet released an official evaluation.\n\nBut a recent policy brief from the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University indicated that the program has had positive results. The report found that by 2014, 60 residency programs were training more than 550 physicians in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Those doctors could soon serve up to nearly a million patients annually.\n\nIn addition to at the centers in Harlem and Kingston, program residents in the area are training at two centers in Brooklyn; one in East Meadow, on Long Island; and one in Danbury, Conn.\n\nThe report found that three times as many doctors who served their residencies in the health centers stayed in underserved communities and 91 percent remain primary-care doctors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDespite the report, Tannaz Rasouli, the director of government relations for the American Association of Medical Colleges, warned against funding the program if it detracted from existing options.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of ensuring that we\u2019re not investing in one priority at the expense of another,\u201d she said.\n\nLast Thursday, Dr. Gopal determined that Jacob\u2019s hallucinations were a reaction to steroids he received at a hospital to treat his asthma. After consulting with Dr. Venis Wilder, a faculty physician who was training her, Dr. Gopal prescribed higher doses of his asthma medicines to avoid a similar reaction.\n\nJacob spoke highly about the attention he received at the clinic. \u201cThey really care about you,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Gopal may be worried about her own future, but she said that was not her main concern.\n\n\u201cThe patients are the ones who would be losing out in the long run,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150325200405, "twitter": {"description": "The future is uncertain for a program that trains doctors in underserved communities as it tries to tackle a worsening shortage of primary care physicians.", "title": "Amid Affordable Care Act Fight, a Health Center Program Struggles to Stay Alive", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/nyregion/amid-affordable-care-act-fight-a-health-center-program-tries-to-stay-alive.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003556535"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "DSlotnik", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/26/nyregion/CLINICweb1/CLINICweb1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/nyregion/amid-affordable-care-act-fight-a-health-center-program-tries-to-stay-alive.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003556535", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/26/nyregion/amid-affordable-care-act-fight-a-health-center-program-tries-to-stay-alive.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "nyregion", "hdl_p": "Divide in Congress Threatens a Residency Program", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/nyregion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 25, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Health Resources and Services Administration", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Medicine and Health,Doctors,United States Politics and Government,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Harlem (Manhattan  NY),Health Resources and Services Administration", "news_keywords": "Doctor", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Daniel E.
