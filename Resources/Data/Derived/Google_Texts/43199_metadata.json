Joe Pitts (R-Pa.), the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee, told The Hill that other elements include allowing insurers to sell across state lines and \"beefing up\" health savings accounts.\n\nPitts also floated a tax credit to help people afford coverage and high-risk pools for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nHowever, the coming plan will not take the form of legislative text but instead will be a \"white paper,\" Pitts said. That means the plan will not actually be voted on by the House and won't be as specific as a bill would be, making it harder to assess factors like the cost of the plan or how it will affect the number of people with coverage.

But he dismissed the measures, saying they lack \"substance.\"\n\nHe noted that Speaker Paul Ryan's (R-Wis.) office has complained that the series of 18 bills has not received widespread attention because of the raucous Republican presidential primary.\n\n\"My observation would be: If there were actually some substance behind this legislative effort, it might get some more deserved attention,\" Earnest said.

Susan Brooks (R-Ind.), one of 18 House bills this week aimed at halting the scourge of drug overdoses over the last decade.\n\nThe task force would be led by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and would include a voice from nearly every corner of the healthcare sector, from hospital CEOs to patients suffering from chronic pain.
