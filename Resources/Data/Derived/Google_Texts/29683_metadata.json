It wasn\u2019t quick. It was over a long period of time that they just had to lay there and die. It\u2019s tragic,\u201d the property owner Allaura Henry said.\n\nHenry said she leased the property to a woman who brought the dogs there.\n\nNeighbors saw someone come by every so often to check on them, but then it just stopped.\n\n\u201cThese dogs are chained up and caged in why would you not just let them off and out where they had a fighting chance of their own?\u201d Henry asked.\n\nHenry blamed the renter for this disturbing situation.\n\nDespite her attempts to get in touch with her, she said the woman's relatives were the only ones to ever respond, saying another person was supposed to come pick them up long ago, and apparently didn't come through.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unreal that somebody would just do that. Just leave it there to die, not come check on it, make sure it went to whatever home it was supposed to go to, to whoever was supposed to pick it up,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile justice is in the works, Henry wants the dogs removed from the rain and laid to rest. She cannot go near them now because of the investigation.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re owed that. They\u2019re owed that respect being that they were disrespected in their time living,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Oklahoma Animal Alliance also contacted News 9 about this, saying these dogs could have been theirs.\n\nIf so, they were being fostered by the same woman Henry reported as the renter.\n\nCleveland County sheriff\u2019s deputies took the report of possible animal neglect Saturday evening. More details could be released by authorities about the case on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "On a property outside of Lexington in Cleveland County, two companions were completely failed by their caretakers.", "author": "Christy Lewis", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30074724/2-dogs-found-dead-near-lexington-property", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8840578_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "On a property outside of Lexington in Cleveland County, two companions were completely failed by their caretakers.", "title": "2 Dogs Found Dead Near Lexington Property"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8840578_G.jpg", "description": "On a property outside of Lexington in Cleveland County, two companions were completely failed by their caretakers.", "card": "summary", "title": "2 Dogs Found Dead Near Lexington Property"}, "wnreadableurl": "2-dogs-found-dead-near-lexington-property", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/09/20", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Animal Cruelty, Dog", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS30", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Animal Cruelty, Dog"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda05d\"", "article_summary": "If so, they were being fostered by the same woman Henry reported as the renter.\nThe Oklahoma Animal Alliance also contacted News 9 about this, saying these dogs could have been theirs.\nThe bodies of two dogs are there, and it appeared they were imprisoned on the property, left to die without food or water in sight.\nOn a property outside of Lexington in Cleveland County, two companions were completely failed by their caretakers.\nHenry said she leased the property to a woman who brought the dogs there."}
