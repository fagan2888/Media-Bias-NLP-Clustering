While 73 percent of Democrats have a favorable opinion of the law, 85 percent of Republicans and 71 percent of independent voters view it unfavorably.\n\n\u201cThis is something the Obama people have said from Day One \u2014 that they\u2019ve got all of these things that test very well,\u201d said Daron Shaw, a professor of government at the University of Texas at Austin and co-director of the poll. \u201cBut people don\u2019t like the totality of it.\u201d\n\nThat said, a number of the law\u2019s requirements have a lot of support in Texas. Two-thirds of voters support giving states the option to expand their Medicaid programs for low-income, uninsured adults. That majority spanned the ideological spectrum on an issue that Texas lawmakers ducked last session, opting not to expand that coverage.\n\nThree-quarters of Texas voters like the idea of tax credits for small businesses that offer health insurance to their employees. Nearly as many \u2014 73 percent \u2014 support creation of health care marketplaces where small businesses and people without health coverage can shop for it.\n\nProhibiting insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions has the support of 76 percent of registered Texas voters, and 61 percent, led by Democratic and independent voters, said they would support increasing the Medicare payroll tax on upper-income Americans.\n\nA slight majority of Republicans support allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance until age 26, but independents are more strongly in favor and Democrats overwhelmingly support that provision. A slight majority of those who identified themselves as Tea Party voters oppose it.\n\n\u201cThere is some small-ball stuff that people love,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThings that really test off the charts are allowing kids to stay on and no pre-existing conditions. If the Republicans are smart, any revision has to include those two critical elements.\u201d\n\nThe voters don\u2019t like other provisions, especially fines for individuals who don\u2019t have health insurance by 2014 \u2014 66 percent oppose that, including 54 percent who \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d it. A slight majority of Democrats support the mandate, but independents and Republicans are strongly opposed to it.\n\nA provision that would fine larger employers who don\u2019t offer health insurance to workers had the support of 49 percent, but 43 percent oppose that requirement. Democrats and independents support that option, but Republican voters said they were strongly against it.\n\nTwo-thirds of voters support subsidies for low-income Americans without health insurance, but that support is split along ideological lines: Liberals strongly support it, while conservatives oppose it.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that really begins to generate a significant degree of rejection is requiring large businesses to provide insurance, and the individual mandate,\u201d said Jim Henson, who runs the Texas Politics Project at UT-Austin and co-directs the poll. \u201cYou get more division where you introduce class items, but on a bunch of other things, there is a lot of consensus.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the unpopular parts of the program are critical to its overall success,\u201d Henson said.\n\nTexans' views on abortion remain about where they have been over time, with 12 percent saying abortion should never be permitted and 29 percent saying it should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest and when the mother\u2019s life is in danger. Another 16 percent said the law should permit abortions in other cases \u201cafter the need for the abortion has been clearly established,\u201d and 37 percent would allow abortions as a matter of personal choice.\n\nThe University of Texas/Texas Tribune internet survey of 1,200 registered voters was conducted Oct. 18-27 and has an overall margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points. Results among self-identified Republican primary voters carry a margin of error of +/- 5.02 percentage points; among Democratic primary voters, +/- 6.03 percentage points. Numbers in the charts might not add up to 100 percent, because of rounding.\n\nThis is one of six stories on the latest University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll. Also today: the mood of the state. Yesterday: Ted Cruz and the 2016 race for president.
