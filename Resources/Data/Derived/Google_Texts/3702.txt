Fool's gold

"Penn & Teller: Fool Us" has an intriguing setup: Watch budding magicians try to outfox the world-famous duo with a cutting-edge trick. Those who manage to stump the pair get a chance to perform in Las Vegas (and presumably get all the leftover Twinkies that Penn Jillette has given up since going on a serious diet). Watch the team reappear immediately following the one-hour episode on "Whose Line Is it Anyway?" 7 p.m. WUCW, Ch. 23

Toast of the town

The current season of "The Bachelorette" continues to play out in Killarney, Ireland, which means it's only a matter of time before Kaitlyn comes to her senses and dumps those wimpy Americans for a good Irish lad who will teach her all about falling in love with Guinness beer. 7 p.m. KSTP, Ch. 5

I will survive

For the season finale of "The Island," survivalist Bear Grylls returns to chastise the male contestants for, after 28 days in survival mode, failing to build a radio transmitter out of coconuts. 9:01 p.m. KARE, Ch. 11
