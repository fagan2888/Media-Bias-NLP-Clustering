And inside, those who worked closely with the 24-year-old hold a cut-a-thon to keep her memory alive.\n\n\"It's just kind of a way to remember her and let everyone know what a great person she was,\" General Manager Kaylee Spolum said.\n\nSpolum was training Connors who had recently been promoted to manager last year.\n\n\"She always wanted to get it right,\" Spolum said. \"A lot of people I have trained just walked through the steps but she had a good heart and I was really excited about what she was going to do with this store. She would have been great.\"\n\nSioux Falls Police say Tyrone Smith shot Connors before locking himself inside the 41st Street salon and tying up his ex-girlfriend and coworkers. He reportedly killed himself after letting the hostages go.\n\nBoth close friends and complete strangers stop by to get their hair cut. Staff says they're serving 50 percent more customers than a regular day, including Cam Jensen who didn't know Connors but wanted to pitch in.\n\n\"I think everyone is happy to help,\" Jensen said. \"I think this community really pulls together when the chips are down and tough things happen in life.\"\n\nStaff members say many of the people coming through the doors aren't asking for haircuts, but instead giving cash donations, sometimes $100 at a time.\n\n\"If everybody who came in and dropped off money, we'd be swamped,\" Spolum said. \"It's just been awesome the people that come in and drop money off.\"\n\nAnd by 2:00 more than $1,800 had been raised to go toward a cosmetology scholarship in Connor's name.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Outside Cost Cutters, a picture of Amanda Connors is surrounded by flowers and balloons on the one year anniversary of her death.
