The radio and TV spots showed up in mid-August, along with six billboards placed along key interstate highways. A sleeker website will be unveiled soon.\n\nThe message: Insure Oklahoma is still open for business, and ready to grow.\n\nThe $450,000 marketing campaign came after five years of steady shrinkage in the 10-year-old, tax-supported health insurance program for Oklahoma\u2019s working poor.\n\nIt was accompanied in late September by a program expansion that opened Insure Oklahoma to a new group of businesses, those with 100 to 250 employees.\n\nIn a state that refused to accept federal money to expand Medicaid, some officials say Insure Oklahoma is the best available option to cover more of the uninsured.\n\nThe marketing campaign and program expansion were launched to reverse a decline that began about the same time as congressional debate and enactment of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.\n\n\u201cThat was a game-changer,\u201d said Nico Gomez, CEO of the Oklahoma Health Care Authority.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of court cases, there were a lot of changes, just a tremendous amount of chaos in the health care market.\u201d\n\nBusinesses became wary of staying in or signing up for a state program that kept being extended a year at a time, while state and federal officials were in a political standoff over health care policy, he said. Even today, Insure Oklahoma is operating under an extension that will expire at the end of next year.\n\n\u201cThey (businesses) did not want to get involved in a program and provide a benefit to their employees that they would then have to take away,\u201d Gomez said.\n\nThe number of small businesses participating in the program has fallen by 35 percent over five years. The number of people covered has dropped by 47 percent over a four-year period.\n\nAbout 7,000 people dropped off the rolls on Jan. 1, 2014, when the state lowered the income limit for individuals who can receive subsidized coverage through Insure Oklahoma. But that accounted for less than half of the total shrinkage, data shows.\n\nWarren Vieth / Oklahoma Watch\n\nThe Health Care Authority, which administers the program, essentially shut down its marketing and recruitment efforts when the Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. Gomez said he decided to crank it back up this year because he\u2019s convinced Insure Oklahoma is the most viable platform to expand health care coverage in the state.\n\nSuch an expansion faces challenges.\n\nAmong them is an unresolved impasse between Gov. Mary Fallin\u2019s office and the Obama administration over Oklahoma\u2019s refusal to go along with a proposed expansion of the state\u2019s Medicaid program, called SoonerCare.\n\n\u201cThere are federal dollars available to expand Medicaid. Our state is not interested in doing that,\u201d said Craig Jones, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cWe keep talking about Oklahoma wanting its own plan,\u201d Jones said. \u201cOklahoma has its own plan. It\u2019s called Insure Oklahoma. But it\u2019s only benefitting 17,000 people right now.\u201d\n\n\"'Obamacare' is just a toxic term in the current political environment.\" - Craig Jones, president, Oklahoma Hospital Association.\n\nIn its current form, Insure Oklahoma provides subsidized health insurance to working people earning as much as 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Those who receive policies through participating employers pay 15 percent of the premium cost. The employer pays 25 percent, the state pays 23 percent and the federal government covers the remaining 37 percent.\n\nThe program had been open to employees of businesses with fewer than 100 workers as well as some self-employed people, disabled people and students. Unemployed people also qualify under some circumstances.\n\nOn Sept. 21, Fallin and Gomez announced that Insure Oklahoma was being expanded to include businesses with 100 to 250 employees, effective immediately. The expansion increases the odds that the program can reverse its membership decline.\n\n\"It\u2019s an important step to make insurance available to more Oklahoma businesses,\" Gomez said in a phone interview. \"We believe there is a demand for that.\"\n\nGomez acknowledged, though, that Insure Oklahoma's maximum capacity was still limited to about 30,000 people.\n\n\"Right now we only have about 17,000 Oklahomans participating. We actually have room to serve another 13,000 to 15,000 Oklahomans,\" he said.\n\nMoving beyond that would require legislative changes to provide more state revenue and a negotiated agreement with the federal government to obtain more federal funds.\n\n\"We\u2019re still negotiating,\" Gomez said. \"That\u2019s an ongoing conversation to secure a long-term agreement for federal support of Insure Oklahoma.\"\n\nThe program's Sept. 15 headcount includes 13,117 workers, spouses, students and other dependents enrolled in the employer-sponsored plan, and 3,981 people enrolled in the individual plan.\n\nThe state\u2019s contribution comes entirely from tobacco tax revenue. Because that funding pool is limited, Insure Oklahoma could accommodate about double the current enrollment before it ran out of state money.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how long the federal government might continue offering one-year extensions of Insure Oklahoma. The latest one will expire Dec. 31, 2016. A new president will take office in early 2017, and the Affordable Care Act might undergo significant changes at the hands of Congress.\n\nBut it\u2019s only a fraction of Oklahoma\u2019s low-income uninsured population. About 104,000 Oklahomans are in a \u201ccoverage crater\u201d caused by Oklahoma\u2019s rejection of the Obama administration\u2019s Medicaid expansion proposal, according to recent estimates by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe Oklahoma Hospital Association estimates that as many as 200,000 Oklahomans could obtain health coverage if Insure Oklahoma were expanded. That would require passing legislation to broaden eligibility criteria and striking a deal with the federal government to use funds originally intended for Medicaid expansion.\n\nTV PROMOTIONS\n\nThe Oklahoma Health Care Authority has released two television spots promoting Insure Oklahoma.\n\nFor employers\n\n\n\nFor individuals\n\n\n\nTeresa Meinders Burkett, a Tulsa health care attorney who is encouraging state officials to strike such a bargain, says the state is losing about $2 million a day by rejecting federal funds available for Medicaid expansion, including state-based alternatives.\n\nBurkett noted that the state of Arkansas obtained federal approval to use Medicaid expansion money to finance a state-operated program that is similar in many respects to Insure Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cInsure Oklahoma is popular,\u201d Burkett said. Working within its framework might be the best way to expand health coverage in Oklahoma, she said. \u201cI think everybody knows really that this is good for Oklahoma.\u201d\n\nIn her January 2013 state of the state address, Fallin promised to develop an \"Oklahoma Plan\" to address the state's health issues, including improved access to \"quality and affordable health care.\"\n\nLater in 2013, a private consulting firm hired by the state recommended that Oklahoma develop an alternative to Medicaid expansion, using Insure Oklahoma as the platform. The plan proposed by Leavitt Partners was not adopted.\n\nThe governor's office said in a statement Thursday that an expansion of Insure Oklahoma was something the Legislature could consider in 2016.\n\n\"Insure Oklahoma has been successful in its present form, and Gov. Fallin\u2019s administration continues to work with federal officials to make the program permanent,\" said Alex Weintz, the governor's spokesman. \"Gov. Fallin believes Insure Oklahoma is the kind of state-based health care option the federal government should be supporting.\"\n\nState Rep. Doug Cox, R-Grove, chairman of the Conference Committee on Public Health, said discussions are under way that could lead to an expansion of Insure Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Cox said. \u201cThey have to make it more politically acceptable than just a straight Medicaid expansion. That\u2019s why the public-private partnership that involves Insure Oklahoma, which has worked so well, might be feasible.\u201d\n\nWarren Vieth / Oklahoma Watch\n\nHospital Association President Jones said his organization sees Insure Oklahoma as the best bet to expand access to affordable health care for uninsured Oklahomans.\n\n\u201c'Obamacare\u2019 \u2026 is just a toxic term in the current political environment,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThis is not Obamacare. It is within the framework of what the Affordable Care Act outlined. But really, what we\u2019re doing is taking available dollars through that plan and applying them as Oklahoma wants to apply them. No different than what we\u2019re doing with roads, no different than what we\u2019re doing with education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://oklahomawatch.org/2015/09/04/with-many-uninsured-state-pushes-program-for-working-poor/", "description": "Tens of thousands of Oklahomans lack health insurance, and current prospects for Medicaid expansion are slim.
