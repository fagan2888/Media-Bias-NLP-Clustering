SIB works with multiple-location companies such as restaurant groups, retail stores, grocers and health care providers to review their fixed costs and reduce their expenses.\n\nSIB said the work pays for itself with the savings it creates and now has a nationwide client base.\n\n\u201cWe have found plenty of ways to be more efficient, but ultimately our work requires the human touch and a lot of personal attention for our clients,\u201d said CEO Dan Schneider.\n\n\u201cTo keep up with the workload, we have hired a lot of talented new people. Our growth over the past couple of years has been tremendous, and now our head count is at just under 60 people. Our new building at Half Mile North will serve us perfectly and give us the space to grow to 100 people in the future.\u201d\n\nHalf Mile North, located between Meeting Street and Morrison Drive near Brigade Street, is a new development by Raven Cliff Co. SIB will soon be joined by other tenants. They include new brew pub Edmund\u2019s Oast and e-commerce company Blue Acorn.\n\nRaven Cliff Company collaborated with SIB to renovate an old warehouse and build an updated office building with customized amenities for the consulting company\u2019s personnel. Features include an outdoor conference room, an on-site dog park, a gym and a full kitchen and dining area where the company chef will provide a free daily lunch for staff members.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to be here, and we\u2019re excited to see the continued development of the area and get to know our new neighbors,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cBlue Acorn and Edmund\u2019s Oast obviously saw the same potential in this neighborhood that we did, and we can\u2019t wait to have them join us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Consulting company moves to Charleston\u2019s upper peninsula, Business Review, \r\nBusiness ReviewFP LatestNews, \r\nBusiness-Local, \r\nrssbusiness, \r\nrssbusiness,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "SIB Development &amp; Consulting, a company that helps businesses save money on their operating expenses, has completed a move to its newly renovated 10,400-square-foot headquarters building in the Half Mile North development on Charleston\u2019s u", "title": "Consulting company moves to Charleston\u2019s upper peninsula", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20131124/131129745/consulting-company-moves-to-charleston-x2019-s-upper-peninsula", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@postandcourier", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "description": "SIB Development &amp; Consulting, a company that helps businesses save money on their operating expenses, has completed a move to its newly renovated 10,400-square-foot headquarters building in the Half Mile North development on Charleston\u2019s u", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Consulting company moves to Charleston\u2019s upper peninsula"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 131129745}}, "keywords": "Consulting company moves to Charleston\u2019s upper peninsula , Business Review, \r\nBusiness ReviewFP LatestNews, \r\nBusiness-Local, \r\nrssbusiness, \r\nrssbusiness", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-24T13:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2013-11-22T19:04:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "SIB Development &amp; Consulting, a company that helps businesses save money on their operating expenses, has completed a move to its newly renovated 10,400-square-foot headquarters building in the Half Mile North development on Charleston\u2019s u"}, "article_summary": "SIB Development & Consulting, a company that helps businesses save money on their operating expenses, has completed a move to its newly renovated 10,400-square-foot headquarters building in the Half Mile North development on Charleston\u2019s upper peninsula.\nRaven Cliff Company collaborated with SIB to renovate an old warehouse and build an updated office building with customized amenities for the consulting company\u2019s personnel.\nPreviously located in a smaller suite of offices in downtown Charleston, SIB made the move to accommodate its growing staff.\nSIB said the work pays for itself with the savings it creates and now has a nationwide client base.\nThey include new brew pub Edmund\u2019s Oast and e-commerce company Blue Acorn."}
