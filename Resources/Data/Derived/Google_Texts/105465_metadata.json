Bush, Jeffrey Holmstead, said the process under Bush was much less manipulated.\n\n\u201cThere was no formalized process by which you had to get permission to send them over,\u201d Holmstead said of submitting rules to the Bush administration.\n\nObamacare implementation was significantly slow due to the continued unpopularity of the law in 2012, despite Obama administration officials claiming to have won on health care.\n\nThe rule that defined \u201cessential health benefits\u201d under Obamacare was delayed until after the election, as well as information pertaining to which Americans would qualify for federal subsidies in the exchanges. Essentially, the rules pertaining to \u201caffordable\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d were delayed for political purposes.\n\nThe Treasury Department also held back finalizing tax-credit rules until after the election as well.\n\nTo avoid angering the oil industry, the administration delayed EPA rules requiring lower-pollution vehicles and a reduction in the amount of sulfur in gasoline. Agency officials were purportedly told to delay the rule \u201cbecause critics could use it to suggest that the administration was raising gas prices,\u201d according to the Post.\n\nThe now-infamous EPA rule that makes it nearly impossible to open a new coal plant was also delayed.\n\nIf the regulations were so good for the country, Obama should have been able to run on them for re-election.\n\nAfter Obama took office in 2009, the number of reviews for significant rules increased each year until 2012, when the number dropped from over 700 reviews to just 424, a more than 60 percent reduction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "White House officials delayed Obamacare, environmental and worker safety regulations until after the 2012 election to help President Obama's re-election chances, according to a new report from the Washington Post.\nThe Obama administration tried to claim that the delays were due to careful consideration of the rules, but the chart below proves that to be false:\nAfter Obama took office in 2009, the number of reviews for significant rules increased each year until 2012, when the number dropped from over 700 reviews to just 424, a more than 60 percent reduction.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Examiner.
