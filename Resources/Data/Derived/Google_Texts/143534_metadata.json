Inferences from the Constitutional Text\n\nThe constitutional text offers hints as to the meaning of the terms examined in this study. The following discussion addresses that text as it stood at the time of the Constitution\u2019s ratification, without the changes wrought subsequently by the Sixteenth Amendment and by court decisions.\n\nThe Constitution imposed two limits on state financial exactions: (1) a requirement of congressional consent before a state could \u201clay any Duty of Tonnage\u201d and (2) with one exception, a like requirement before a state could \u201clay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports.\u201d The Constitution also authorized Congress to impose financial exactions. The Taxation Clause empowered Congress to \u201clay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.\u201d The Commerce Clause empowered Congress to \u201cregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\u201d During the founding era, commercial regulation was understood to entail financial impositions.\n\nThe Constitution qualified these grants to Congress. Among the qualifications were the following three:\n\n\u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue\u201d had to originate in the House of Representatives;\n\nCongress could impose no \u201cTax or Duty\u201d on exports; and\n\nuntil 1808, Congress was prohibited from levying any \u201cTax or duty\u201d on imported slaves in excess of ten dollars per person.\n\nIn addition to these qualifications, the Constitution included several that reflected the Founders\u2019 belief that government was a fiduciary institution, and, to the extent possible, should serve its constituents in an impartial manner. These were as follows:\n\nTaxes, duties, imposts, and excises were to be levied \u201cto pay the Debts and provide for the Common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court no longer treats this as much of a restriction, but the Founders understood it to limit Congress to imposing only those taxes, etc., as would raise revenue for \u201cgeneral\u201d (national) purposes rather than merely for regional or special-interest (\u201cpartial\u201d) purposes. This provision curbed congressional taxing authority even within the scope of Congress\u2019s enumerated powers.\n\n\u201cDuties, Imposts and Excises\u201d were to be \u201cuniform throughout the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution prohibited any \u201cPreference [being] given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another.\u201d\n\nTwo clauses required that \u201cCapitation[s]\u201d and other \u201cdirect Taxes\u201d be apportioned among the states according to their population, with the provisos that (1) Indians who did not pay taxes were excluded and (2) five slaves were to be counted as three free persons. These clauses were unamendable until 1808.\n\nThe terms examined in this study all occurred in the grants and limitations just summarized. \u201cTax,\u201d \u201cDuty,\u201d \u201cExcise,\u201d \u201cImpost,\u201d and \u201cTonnage\u201d occurred in the Taxation Clause. Three of those five words also appeared elsewhere in conjunctive and disjunctive expressions: \u201cTax or duty,\u201d \u201cImposts or Duties,\u201d \u201cDuties and Imposts.\u201d The phrase \u201cdirect . . . Taxes\u201d appeared in two other locations. It is therefore reasonable to infer that, in accordance with the canon of construction against surplus, none of these individual terms was a synonym for any of the others. This does not preclude the possibility of overlap.\n\nThe Constitution usually employed the word \u201cDuty\u201d in the context of trade: \u201cDuty of Tonnage,\u201d duties on imported slaves, duties on imports and exports. We can deduce that at least some duties were commercial in nature and that they were subject to the requirement of uniformity of \u201cRegulation[s] of Commerce or Revenue.\u201d\n\nThe text further distinguished between \u201cdirect Taxes\u201d and other taxes. It stated outright that a \u201cCapitation\u201d was a direct tax, and it implied that there were other kinds of direct tax. Only direct taxes were to be apportioned among the states by population. Other taxes, presumably indirect, were not to be apportioned. A different requirement\u2014uniformity\u2014applied to duties, imposts, and excises. This suggests that to the extent the latter exactions were \u201ctaxes,\u201d they were indirect.\n\nIn sum: The text appeared to distinguish between regulations of commerce and taxes (\u201cRevenue\u201d); between taxes, duties, excises, and imposts; and between direct taxes and other (presumably indirect) taxes. It stated that capitations were direct and implied that there were other direct taxes as well. The text further implied that taxes in the form of duties, excises, or imposts were indirect. It stated explicitly that \u201cduties\u201d included \u201ctonnage,\u201d and it implied that duties were associated with commerce. Finally, the text imposed an apportionment rule on direct taxes and a uniformity requirement on other financial exactions.\n\nWe now turn to sources of meaning outside the text of the Constitution.\n\nDownload the full paper here.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "Was the Supreme Court right to call Obamacare\u2019s insurance penalty a \u201ctax?\u201d Not according to the Founders.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "Was the Supreme Court right to call Obamacare\u2019s insurance penalty a \u201ctax?\u201d Not according to the Founders.
