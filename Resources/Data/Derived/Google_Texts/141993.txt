BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - Planned Parenthood is closing its Battle Creek clinic, claiming that the Affordable Care Act was a factor in the decision.



Employees say health care services have declined since the Affordable Care Act took effect.



The law greatly improved access to subsidized contraceptives and women's health services.



So now, women who once relied on Planned Parenthood's services can get them elsewhere, and in some cases without a deductible or co-pay.



The Battle Creek location will close on January 31.
