Most women have set limits for themselves on how many babies they have based on any number of factors, such as socio-economic status and age. But 37-year-old British mom Tara Sawyer is addicted to pregnancy, and won\u2019t stop until her \u201cwomb falls out.\u201d Sawyer has given birth to seven kids, four of which are her own, and is a surrogate mother of three.\n\n\u201cSurrogacy is very addictive. It\u2019s a huge rush from the moment the test comes back positive,\u201d said Sawyer to Barcroft TV in a video. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling to hand over a child to someone who desperately wants it, and I feel at my best whilst pregnant.\u201d Surrogates carry and give birth to babies for couples who want to have children but cannot due to medical conditions such as recurrent pregnancy loss.\n\nSawyer, who was adopted as a child, considered surrogacy to provide couples like her parents an opportunity to have a family. In England, according to surrogacy laws, she is entitled to 15,000 euros in expenses, but she refuses to take any payment, being a surrogate for free, the DailyMail reported. Two years ago, she gave birth to her first surrogate baby, who is her biological daughter. However, Sawyer did not feel the \u201cmaternal love,\u201d for the infant, and handed over a child that she said, \u201cwas never mine to keep.\u201d\n\nAt the root of her her addiction to pregnancy are her twin boys Jack and Noah, who are now four. Sawyer delivered the boys prematurely at just 29 weeks via C-section after they developed Twin to Twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). TTTS occurs when the blood supply of one twin moves to the other the shared placenta, according to Medline Plus, possibly leading to health problems for both infants. After the birth of the twins, Sawyer admitted she felt deprived of the pregnancy, and although she didn\u2019t want any more children, she still craved to be pregnant.\n\nSawyer couldn\u2019t do all this without the support of her husband, Matt, who understands the void she feels post pregnancy. \u201cIt made us stronger as a couple,\u201d he told Barcroft TV. Matt\u2019s main concern was whether his wife, Tara, would be able to hand over the baby at the end of the pregnancy. Now, together, they continue to have surrogate pregnancies. In January, she just gave birth to twin boys, and has already spoken to another gay couple, hoping to be pregnant by the end of the year.\n\nToo many pregnancies do have an impact on the women\u2019s bodies. Having pregnancies too close together doesn't provide the mother time to recover after losing nutrients such as iron and folate after pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is known as maternal depletion syndrome. According to the Mayo Clinic, a pregnancy within 12 months of giving birth can also lead to placental abruption, placenta previa, and autism in second-born children. Tara isn\u2019t afraid of the effects of pregnancy on her body, as she claims she feels at her \u201cbest physically\u201d when pregnant. \u201cI take vitamins, go swimming, do yoga and eat healthily.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love having a bump and people cooing over the precious little gift inside,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "surrogate mother, pregnancy bump, addicted to pregnancy, twins, premature birth, womb, couples, vaginal, childbirth, women's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "37-year-old mother, Tara Sawyer, who has given birth to seven children, is addicted to the \u2018buzz of pregnancy,\u2019 offering to be a surrogate for free for couples who can\u2019t conceive, or have full-term pregnancies.", "title": "Mom Addicted To Pregnancy Offers To Be Free Surrogate [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tara-sawyer-37-year-old-surrogate-mother-addicted-pregnancy-wont-stop-until-her-womb-falls-out", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/20/tara-doctor.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "37-year-old mother, Tara Sawyer, who has given birth to seven children, is addicted to the \u2018buzz of pregnancy,\u2019 offering to be a surrogate for free for couples who can\u2019t conceive, or have full-term pregnancies.", "title": "Mom Addicted To Pregnancy Offers To Be Free Surrogate [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/tara-sawyer-37-year-old-surrogate-mother-addicted-pregnancy-wont-stop-until-her-womb-falls-out", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/20/tara-doctor.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/20/tara-doctor.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-20T14:15:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-23T14:41:53-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "37-year-old mother, Tara Sawyer, who has given birth to seven children, is addicted to the \u2018buzz of pregnancy,\u2019 offering to be a surrogate for free for couples who can\u2019t conceive, or have full-term pregnancies."}, "article_summary": "But 37-year-old British mom Tara Sawyer is addicted to pregnancy, and won\u2019t stop until her \u201cwomb falls out.\u201d Sawyer has given birth to seven kids, four of which are her own, and is a surrogate mother of three.\nNow, together, they continue to have surrogate pregnancies.\nSawyer delivered the boys prematurely at just 29 weeks via C-section after they developed Twin to Twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS).\nTara isn\u2019t afraid of the effects of pregnancy on her body, as she claims she feels at her \u201cbest physically\u201d when pregnant.\nSawyer couldn\u2019t do all this without the support of her husband, Matt, who understands the void she feels post pregnancy."}
