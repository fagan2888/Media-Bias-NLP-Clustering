The sector has faced tough competition from fast-fashion retailers including Forever 21 and H&M that offer the latest styles at lower prices.\n\nFor the quarter ended Aug. 1, American Eagle reported a profit of $33.3 million, or 17 cents a share, up from $5.8 million, or three cents a share, a year earlier. The company's earnings benefited from a favorable income tax settlement that contributed about $2.5 million.\n\nThe company had expected per-share earnings between 11 cents and 14 cents.\n\nRevenue increased to $797.4 million, above analysts' expectations for $770 million.\n\nSales excluding newly opened or closed locations rose 11%, compared with a 7% decrease last year.\n\nFor the current quarter, the retailer said it expects adjusted earnings of 28 cents to 31 cents a share, and comparable sales growth in the mid single-digit range.\n\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com\n\nSubscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"page.site": "marketwatch", "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "author": "Ezequiel Minaya", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/american-eagle-outfitters-profit-buoyed-by-sales-2015-08-19", "type": "article", "image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "title": "American Eagle Outfitters profit buoyed by sales"}, "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_mark.svg", "height": 630}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"id": 624413}}, "parsely-title": "American Eagle Outfitters profit buoyed by sales", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-19T09:17:00-04:00", "ob": {"image": "http://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}, "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "parsely-author": "Ezequiel Minaya", "position": 1, "lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/american-eagle-outfitters-profit-buoyed-by-sales-2015-08-19", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.id": "5CE47FC8-C2D4-4C22-8CB9-0CA43BE488C2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe18b3\"", "article_summary": "American Eagle Outfitters Inc. reported a stronger-than-expected profit in its latest quarter as revenue jumped 12%.\nTeen retailers such as American Eagle and rivals like Abercrombie & Fitch Co. have been trying to revive sales after a long slump.\nFor the quarter ended Aug. 1, American Eagle reported a profit of $33.3 million, or 17 cents a share, up from $5.8 million, or three cents a share, a year earlier.\nFor the current quarter, the retailer said it expects adjusted earnings of 28 cents to 31 cents a share, and comparable sales growth in the mid single-digit range.\nSales excluding newly opened or closed locations rose 11%, compared with a 7% decrease last year."}
