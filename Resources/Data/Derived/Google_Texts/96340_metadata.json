I am so proud of this community of believers where we can, at least on this one day, focus on what unites us,\u201d Vashon said.\n\nEach choir from participating houses of worship will perform a sacred work of their choosing.\n\nIn addition to Immaculate Conception, participating churches and groups are Lower Valley Presbyterian Church in Califon, Clinton Church of the Nazarene in Clinton; Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Annandale Reformed Church and the Hunterdon Harmonizers.\n\nSome of the pieces to be performed:\n\nImmaculate Conception adult choir: \"See Amid the Winter Snow\u201d\n\nImmaculate Conception jazz band: \"Hallelujah\u201d\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 adult choir: \"Far Far Away on Judean Plains\u201d\n\nLower Valley Presbyterian Bell Choirs: Agape Ringers \"Christmas Joy\u201d\n\nFaith Ensemble Ringers: \"Now Sing We All of Christmas\u201d\n\nAnnandale Reformed Church: \"The Little Road to Bethlehem.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton Church of the Nazarene had not announced its selection.\n\nOne of the highlights of the evening is sure to be the performance by children in grades 2 to 8 from all the participating churches, who will sing \"Away in a Manger\" \u2014 complete with costumes of shepherds, donkeys, angels and more. In addition, a contingent of Hunterdon Harmonizers, who will perform a medley of sacred carols in their signature \"barbershop\" style.\n\n\u201cThis event has become a personal favorite for me and my family because it blends together so many elements of community in celebration of the spirit of giving, which is Christmas,\u201d added Don Reckenbeil, musical director of the Hunterdon Harmonizers Men\u2019s Barbershop Chorus.\n\nThe concert finale will be all the church groups performing Handel's \"Hallelujah Chorus\" together.\n\nFollowing the concert, refreshments will be served in Immaculate Conception\u2019s parish hall. ShopRite in Clinton has donated refreshments for the concert, Korkuch said.\n\nAlthough there is no fee to attend the concert, guests are asked to bring canned or nonperishable food items to donate, benefiting the Open Cupboard Food Pantry.\n\nThis year\u2019s youth volunteer is Sophie Martin, a seventh-grade student at Warren Hills Middle School in Washington Borough. She will be assisting with food collection.

They\u2019re really nice people and their program is really lovely. \u201c\n\nImmaculate Conception Catholic Church is at 316 Old Allerton Road in the Annandale section of Clinton.\n\nFor information visit, www.facebook.com/interfaithchristmasconcert.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1jl2Ixr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hundreds of guests are expected to gather at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the Annandale section of Clinton Township on Sunday, November 29, 2015 to enjoy sounds of the season from soloists, instrumentalists, choirs and musical groups at the 5th annual Joyeux Noel Interfaith Christmas Benefit Concert.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "Hundreds of guests are expected to gather at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the Annandale section of Clinton Township on Sunday, November 29, 2015 to enjoy sounds of the season from soloists, instrumentalists, choirs and musical groups at the 5th annual Joyeux Noel Interfaith Christmas Benefit Concert.", "title": "Interfaith holiday concert planned in Hunterdon County", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/news/local/hunterdon-county/2015/11/26/interfaith-holiday-concert-planned-hunterdon-county/75997044/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hundreds of guests are expected to gather at Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in the Annandale section of Clinton Township on Sunday, November 29, 2015 to enjoy sounds of the season from soloists, instrumentalists, choirs and musical groups at the 5th annual Joyeux Noel Interfaith Christmas Benefit Concert.", "title": "Interfaith holiday concert planned in Hunterdon County", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3deb95f4310dcf2a067468c029d50435df983132/c=129-0-1641-1512&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/11/23/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635838814037704958-Interfaith-1.jpg", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Hunterdon County, Interfaith holiday concert, Hunterdon interfaith holiday concert"}, "article_summary": "(Photo: ~Courtesy of Marylu Korkuch) Story Highlights Free interfaith concert brings together churches from throughout Hunterdon County.\nRenaye Wimmer, who is co-chairing this event with Marylu Korkuch, choral director of Immaculate Conception, said this concert truly exemplifies the holiday season.\nThe concert finale will be all the church groups performing Handel's \"Hallelujah Chorus\" together.\nShopRite in Clinton has donated refreshments for the concert, Korkuch said.\n\u201cImmaculate Conception Catholic Church is at 316 Old Allerton Road in the Annandale section of Clinton."}
