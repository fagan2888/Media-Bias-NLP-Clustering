I add today a discussion of another con game by Republicans, the suggestion that they will repeal ObamaCare, which they know they will not do, but pretend they will to give red meat to the right-wing base; a promise they know they will not keep.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd now comes Rove, on the op-ed page of The Wall Street Journal and the other places he inhabits, telling Republicans (correctly) that their pledge to repeal ObamaCare is a bad and politically stupid idea. Rove's acknowledges (correctly) that it will not be repealed, and warns Republicans (correctly) they could pay a heavy price with voters if the Supreme Court overturns ObamaCare and Republicans have to face endless news stories about the bad things that happen to Americans if ObamaCare is overturned or repealed and Republicans have nothing to offer instead (which they don't).\n\nI believe Chief Justice John Roberts and a Supreme Court majority will uphold ObamaCare in its upcoming and monumental decision. I believe the court will agree with me that the legislative intent of the law is clear, that all exchanges should receive subsidies, and that they will agree with me that the havoc to healthcare and the painful damage to Americans from a decision against ObamaCare, or repeal of ObamaCare, would be a disaster.\n\nRove's surrender to ObamaCare, advising Republicans against pretending they would repeal ObamaCare, is politically very wise. Rove's fear about what happens to Republicans if the court does overturn ObamaCare provisions and the world witnesses horror stories of Americans being hurt because of Republican anti-ObamaCare politics \u2014 without any Republican policy to undo the damage \u2014 is politically brilliant.\n\nImagine daily stories on television about very ill Americans being stripped of healthcare, about children losing their insurance because they would no longer be covered by their parent's policies, about Americans with preexisting conditions being thrown to the insurance wolves without ObamaCare, and about huge insurance premium increases that would\n\npunish many millions of Americans because of the Republican war against ObamaCare.\n\nWhen the first American dies because of the loss of ObamaCare, the world will witness the mother of all Republican and conservative cons: the death panels were not caused by ObamaCare; they were prevented by ObamaCare, and without ObamaCare, people will die and voters will blame Republicans for the real equivalent of death panels, created by the Republicans in their war against ObamaCare.\n\nFor once, Rove is right: Republicans should surrender in their war to repeal ObamaCare, and if they do not, Democrats will win big and Republicans will lose big \u2014 no matter how the Supreme Court decides.\n\nBudowsky was an aide to former Sen.
