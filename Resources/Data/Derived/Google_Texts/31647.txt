A small single-engine plane crashed on the west side of state Colorado 82 in Garfield County Sunday, injuring the pilot and a passenger.

The accident happened just off the Rio Grande Trail at 10:15 a.m.

Emergency workers freed the pilot, who was trapped in the plane, according to Garfield County Sheriff’s Office release.

“He was pinned in the aircraft and had injuries to his head and legs,” said Walt Stowe, spokesman for the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office.

The pilot and passenger were taken to a local hospital to be treated for their injuries.

Officials are waiting for investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board to arrive and investigate the accident.

“The site has been secured and will wait for the arrival of representatives from the NTSB to arrive,” and investigate the crash.

The Rio Grande Trail will be closed in the vicinity of the crash to preserve the scene. People who want to use the trail from Glenwood to Carbondale should take the alternative path along County Road 109 from the Hardwick Bridge, the release said.
