Getty Images\n\nOne of the biggest proponents of gender balance in U.K. corporate boardrooms has taken the helm of the trade body that represents the interests of asset managers in the U.K. managing \u00a35 trillion ($8.45 trillion).\n\nHelena Morrissey, chief executive of \u00a352 billion Newton Investment Management and well known as founder of the 30% Club, which advocates for 30% representation by women in U.K. boardrooms, is to become chairman of the Investment Association. The trade body was created via a merger of the Investment Management Association and the Association of British Insurers, and Ms. Morrissey replaces Douglas Ferrans at the helm.\n\nThe IMA represents asset managers across U.K. in their dealings with governments and regulators. It provides industry data and advises its members on how to promote their funds and achieve corporate governance objectives.\n\nMs. Morrissey\u2019s 30% Club was officially launched in the U.K. in November 2010. It had the \u201caspirational goal\u201d of hitting a 30% female board representation by the end of 2015. Its influence helped boost the proportion of female directors at FTSE 100 companies from 12.5% in 2010 to beyond 20% for the first time this year, according to a statement from the club. Its members include Goldman Sachs International co-chief executive Richard Gnodde, Philip Hampton, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland and David Walker, chairman of Barclays.\n\nIn April it launched in the U.S., garnering support from top-level figures from the U.S. professional and financial services and other sectors. Its founding chairman in the U.S. is Bloomberg chairman Peter Grauer, who will be the founding chair of the 30% Club in the U.S.\n\nMs. Morrissey also chairs the advisory board of Opportunity Now, a gender equality campaign.\n\nWriting in January in sister title Financial News about the paucity of women at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she said: \u201cThere has, I believe, been an epiphany here in the U.K. over the past few years. The paucity of women at the top is now seen by many as a business issue, not a special-interest issue. The financial crisis was one catalyst for change \u2013 the zeitgeist now is firmly in favour of more diversity, and less homogeneity, in the boardroom and beyond.\u201d\n\nVivek Ahuja contributed to this post.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "One of the biggest proponents of gender balance in U.K. corporate boardrooms has taken the helm of the trade body that represents the interests of asset managers in the U.K. managing \u00a35 trillion ($8.45 trillion).", "title": "Gender Diversity Champion Takes Top Asset Management Lobbying Role", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/18/gender-diversity-champion-takes-top-asset-management-lobbying-role/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH629_0618mo_P_20140618072414.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Gender Diversity Champion Takes Top Asset Management Lobbying Role", "description": "One of the biggest proponents of gender balance in U.K. corporate boardrooms has taken the helm of the trade body that represents the interests of asset managers in the U.K. managing \u00a35 trillion ($8.45 trillion).", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Mike Foster", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "One of the biggest proponents of gender balance in U.K. corporate boardrooms has taken the helm of the trade body that represents the interests of asset managers in the U.K. managing \u00a35 trillion ($8.45 trillion).", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-18T11:32:59-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/18/gender-diversity-champion-takes-top-asset-management-lobbying-role/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-22817", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "One of the biggest proponents of gender balance in U.K. corporate boardrooms has taken the helm of the trade body that represents the interests of asset managers in the U.K. managing \u00a35 trillion ($8.45 trillion).", "title": "Gender Diversity Champion Takes Top Asset Management Lobbying Role", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/06/18/gender-diversity-champion-takes-top-asset-management-lobbying-role/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DH629_0618mo_P_20140618072414.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-22817", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-18T11:40:45-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The trade body was created via a merger of the Investment Management Association and the Association of British Insurers, and Ms. Morrissey replaces Douglas Ferrans at the helm.\nHelena Morrissey, CEO of Newton Investment Management.\nMs. Morrissey\u2019s 30% Club was officially launched in the U.K. in November 2010.\nHelena Morrissey, chief executive of \u00a352 billion Newton Investment Management and well known as founder of the 30% Club, which advocates for 30% representation by women in U.K. boardrooms, is to become chairman of the Investment Association.\nThe paucity of women at the top is now seen by many as a business issue, not a special-interest issue."}
