A trademark was registered in 2010.\n\n, said Trader Joe's version was more rectangular but had rounded edges, \"mimicking an overall oval shape.\" It also accused Trader Joe's of using similar packaging. \"The acts of Trader Joe's have been malicious and calculated to injure Pepperidge Farm,\" whose Milano has generated hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue in the last decade, the complaint said. Pepperidge Farm is seeking a halt to sales of the Trader Joe's cookie, plus compensatory and punitive damages. \"The trust Pepperidge Farm has built with consumers is of utmost importance to us,\" a spokeswoman said. Pepperidge Farm is based in Norwalk, Connecticut; Campbell in Camden, New Jersey; and Trader Joe's in Monrovia, California.
