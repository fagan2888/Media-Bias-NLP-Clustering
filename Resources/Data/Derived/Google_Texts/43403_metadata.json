And now, the Affordable Care Act has made it even easier for women to get the proper screenings and care they need \u2014 for free.\n\nYesterday Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced steps that close major loopholes for health consumers. All Marketplace plans and many insurers must now cover all important preventive services, such as contraception, well-woman visits, breast cancer screening with mammograms, maternity and newborn care, breastfeeding support and supplies, and screenings for domestic violence \u2014 without any out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nMany health insurance companies had failed to meet the federal requirement to cover all approved birth control methods for women without co-payments. The HHS has now made it very clear that insurers must cover the following:\n\nOne form of contraception in each of the 18 available birth control methods that the FDA has approved for women. This includes the Pill, the ring, the patch, and intrauterine devices (IUDs).\n\nin each of the 18 available birth control methods that the FDA has approved for women.
