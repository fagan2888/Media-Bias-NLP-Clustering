All that's missing is for Amnesty money to be used to promote Ebola and ISIS and the snake will have eaten its own tail.

In a letter to House Appropriations Chair Harold Rogers (R-Ky.) on Tuesday, Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) called for defunding a provision in Obamacare that has been allowing taxpayer dollars set aside for public health initiatives to fund television ads for President Obama’s illegal alien amnesty programs. Newsbusters (which like CNSNews.com is part of the Media Research Center), reported earlier this month that the California Endowment last year signed a $20 million deal with the Spanish-language TV outlet “Univision” to help promote Obamacare. Using federal tax dollars from the health fund, the foundation then sponsored ads on Univision reminding qualifying illegal aliens to renew their Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) permits before they expire.

Liberalism is a lot like organized crime. Money is funneled from one operation to another. Everything is tied up by syndicates. The entire system is totally intertwined and one dirty party of it goes to fund another dirty part of it.

There's no end to it because it's all the same thing. ObamaCare and Amnesty are both policy agendas. So money is moved around. Every individual liberal policy agenda helps push all the other ones.

Grants to a liberal organization are going to end up promoting the full spectrum of liberal causes from jailing fishermen to tranny rights. If you give to one, you give to all.

This is what helped build the octopus we're dealing with now, but it also makes it extraordinary vulnerable. Shut off the flow of money and suddenly a lot of the infrastructure goes dark.
