I had a heck of a good ride serving the people of the 8th District back home,\" Rogers said in a House floor speech.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRogers said that even after seven terms in Congress, he never lost a sense of reverence for Capitol Hill.\n\n\"To everybody who has the great privilege to walk these halls, including the visitors and folks at home, I hope you still have that reverence for this building, for this institution. For what it means not just to America, but to the world,\" Rogers said.\n\n\"I know I did every single day that I walked these halls. This morning when I came in, still got that little tingle about what it meant to be a member of Congress in this great institution,\" Rogers added.\n\nRogers also thanked the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.), who he called a \"good friend.\"\n\n\"For any success I've had as chairman, I have to thank a good friend of mine, Dutch Ruppersberger,\" Rogers said.\n\n\"I know in this town that saying you have a friend that's a Democrat as a Republican could get you thrown out \u2014 oh, that's right, I'm leaving,\" he joked.\n\nThe Michigan Republican further urged Congress to embrace bipartisanship.\n\n\"We ought to have big ideas to solve big problems. And not let the small ideas choke out. Let us find the better part of our angels in us to do something pretty amazing and incredible as we move forward,\" Rogers said.\n\nIn concluding his farewell address, Rogers said he would still have a title he cherishes.\n\n\"When I walk out that door ... no longer a member of Congress, I will have an even more revered title in the world: citizen of the greatest nation on the face of the earth, the United States of America,\" Rogers said.\n\nAnd with a salute to the House chamber, Rogers left the podium.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"This is my chance to really say thank you,\" Rep.
