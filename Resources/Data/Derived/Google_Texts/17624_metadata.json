The measure now moves to the president\u2019s desk for approval.\n\nThe omnibus spending bill includes a $680 billion tax cut package\u2014which was voted on separately by the House Thursday afternoon, and passed 318 to 109. Virtually all Republican House members, 241 total, voted for the tax cut package.\n\nThe vote for the larger appropriations bill, which funds the government through Sept. 30, 2016, passed the House by 316 to 113, with 150 Republicans and 166 Democrats voting in favor. Ninety-five Republicans and 18 Democrats voted against.\n\nThe Senate took up the bill shortly afterwards, approving it with a 65-33 vote.\n\nPresidential candidates Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) voted against the bill; Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) voted yes. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) missed the vote on the bill.\n\nThe tax cut portion of the bill postpones two taxes set in the Affordable Care Act for two more years. One is on expensive health care insurance plans, the other, a 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of medical devices.\n\nThe omnibus bill mandates a two-year delay on the implementation of draft recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force on breast cancer mammography screening.\n\nThe task force had given a C rating to routine screening of women ages 40\u201349, and a B to screening women ages 50\u201374 every other year. The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover procedures given grades of B or higher by the task force.\n\nThe bill also caps multiple procedure payment reductions to Medicare reimbursement for interpretation of advanced imaging scans performed on the same patient in the same session on the same day, according to the American College of Radiology.\n\nIn recent years, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services applied a 25 percent MPPR to the professional component of these services. Beginning Jan. 1, 2017, the bill caps any reduction at 5 percent, the ACR says.\n\nThe votes come just before Congress\u2019 scheduled winter recess, following weeks of pushing back deadlines and passing multiple short-term resolutions to keep the government open while leaders hashed out the larger budget deal.\n\n\u201cIt is so important to see this proposed increase in support of life saving cancer research,\u201d said Louis Weiner, director of the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.\n\n\u201cDollars spent in biomedical research \u2013 and particularly cancer research\u2014is directly associated with a decrease in the number of people who die from cancer. Therefore, the health of America is directly related to our investment in research,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cAn increase in NIH funding will boost progress and restore the pace of discoveries.\u201d\n\nThe full omnibus bill was made public late Tuesday night, generating praise from professional societies and research advocacy groups. The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology urged Congress to pass the appropriations bill.\n\n\u201cThe legislation includes a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, $119 million increase for the National Science Foundation, $279 million increase for the Department of Energy Office of Science, $41.8 million increase for Veterans Medical and Prosthetic Research, and $25 million increase for the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative,\u201d FASEB said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased to see the $2 billion dollar increase for NIH in the FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill,\u201d said FASEB President Parker Antin. \u201cI appeal to scientists across the United States to contact their representatives and urge speedy passage of this essential legislation.\u201d\n\nMarc Casper, speaking for United for Medical Research, said, \u201cWe are very pleased with the critical funding Congress has included for NIH.\n\n\u201cBoosting the NIH budget to just over $32 billion is a significant increase over 2015\u2014more than five percent\u2014and demonstrates the strong bipartisan support for biomedical research as an engine for innovation and a pathway to hope for patients. United for Medical Research commends those members of Congress who worked tirelessly to make this possible,\u201d said Casper, president and CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific.\n\nMary Woolley, president and CEO of Research!America, said: \u201cThe FY16 omnibus and the tax extenders measure bring a healthy helping of glad tidings for patients with a significant boost in funding for medical research and tax provisions that will advance innovation.\n\n\u201cThe bills help accelerate the pace of medical progress in profoundly important ways; working to defeat Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, heart disease and other serious conditions, bringing new lifesaving treatments and ultimately cures within our reach.\n\n\u201cIn particular, provisions in the bills that bolster funding for the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Food and Drug Administration, suspend the medical device excise tax and make the Research and Development tax credit permanent, signal a solid bipartisan commitment by members of Congress determined to reduce the prevalence of deadly and disabling disease, and protect the health of Americans.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, funding for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality remains below what is necessary to address inefficiencies in health care delivery.\n\n\u201cAmong the many congressional champions who took decisive action on behalf of patients, Senators Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Representatives Tom Cole (R-Okla.), Kevin Brady (R-Texas), Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Sandy Levin (D-Mich.) merit special recognition for their extraordinary vision and leadership.\n\n\u201cWe urge Congress to approve the package to ensure we continue to make headway in finding solutions to pressing health challenges.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "2015-12-18 19:43:25", "description": "The authority on the business side of cancer research, the Cancer Letter has been publishing for 40 years.
