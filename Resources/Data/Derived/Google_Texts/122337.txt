Attention all Trekkies! Coming up tonight at 9, Piers Morgan welcomes actor, author, director and musician William Shatner to his studio for a wide-ranging conversation. The iconic actor, best known for his roles as Captain Kirk on the legendary TV series “Star Trek” and more recently as Denny Crane on “Boston Legal,” is here to promote his latest music project, “Ponder the Mystery.” However, he weighed in on some news topics as well.

“Why have you never become an American citizen,” Morgan asks Shatner, who has lived in the U.S. through the last 11 administrations while maintaining his Canadian citizenship. Shatner joked “all those lines I had to learn ... I had to memorize stuff.”

On a serious note he adds, “I’m sort of proud of the idea that I’m Canadian ... We contribute a lot to the American culture. And we’re part of the American culture, although we’re uniquely Canadian.”

Moving on to Obamacare, Morgan asks Shatner his thoughts about the program. “Ponder the mystery of Obamacare,” encourages Shatner, eluding to the title of his new album. “We need to wait and see ... but if Obama is correct, that the health program lessens the cost of this extraordinary accounting of the medical costs, then we’re home free.”

When Morgan asks Shatner what his alter ego, Capt. Kirk, would do if he were president, Shatner’s answer is unequivocal: “Fire them all and have a new election. Given what the American people in polls are saying, there would be a really rational decision to have elections.”
