Insurers must keep covering children up to age 26 on their parents\u2019 plans, while low-income people can get federal subsidies to buy private plans or enroll in expanded Medicaid programs in about half of the states.\n\nBut convincing them to sign up is still tricky. According to the latest estimates by the Congressional Budget Office released Monday, 31 million people will remain uninsured next year, and 30 million the year after.\n\nRespondents to the Kaiser poll listed their top reasons for not buying coverage: It was too expensive; they were confused about where to buy it; or they didn\u2019t know whether they\u2019d be eligible for subsidies to help lower their monthly costs.\n\nThat first reason \u2014 cost of coverage \u2014 was the biggest factor, with nearly half saying they couldn\u2019t afford to pay the monthly premium. That was the case even if they qualified for a subsidy, with 53 percent of the subsidy-eligible citing cost as the reason for not having coverage.\n\nVery few \u2014 just 3 percent \u2014 said they\u2019re choosing to remain uninsured either because they are opposed to the Affordable Care Act or would prefer to pay the penalty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tens of millions of Americans remain uninsured even though most of the Affordable Care Act has been been rolled out so far.
