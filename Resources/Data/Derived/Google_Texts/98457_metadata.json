The allocation was part of a $295 million federal package announced Friday.\n\nPeninsula Community Health will use its share of the money to expand its adult dental program, which has been swamped with demand since dental care was added back into Apple Health (Medicaid) coverage. CEO Barbara Malich said Peninsula will add a 0.5 full-time equivalent dentist and 0.5 FTE dental hygienist, allowing the center to admit more adult patients.\n\nPeninsula began offering nonemergency adult dental care on a limited basis this year. The center only offered emergency dental care for adults and general dental care for children in the past.\n\nMalich hopes to continue expanding the program and eventually dedicate a full-time dentist to adult care. Even with increased staffing, Peninsula Community Health can only begin to meet the need for services in the county.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very modest start,\u201d Malich said.\n\nThe reinstatement of dental care in Apple Health coincided with a vast expansion of Medicaid. Nearly 13,000 Kitsap residents signed up for Apple Health for the first time between October and March, and enrollment continues.\n\nThough dental work is covered under Apple Health, very few dentists are willing to take on adult Medicaid patients, citing rock-bottom reimbursement rates. Services are more readily available for children, who are covered under a separate program with higher reimbursements.\n\nAlong with new an expanded dental program, Peninsula Community Health will use the federal appropriation to hire support staff and extend the hours of operation at its 616 Sixth St. medical clinic. The clinic will stay open until 8:30 p.m. weekdays. The current hours are 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Malich said the changes will take effect by the end of the year.\n\nA general expansion may be on the horizon for Peninsula. Malich said the center has nearly reached capacity for the services it can offer. The center is on pace to serve about 86,000 patients in 2014, compared with 77,000 in 2013.\n\nFor more information on Peninsula Community Health, go to www.pchsweb.org or call 360-377-3776.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Health agency expands dental offerings", "og": {"url": "http://www.kitsapsun.com/news/local/health-agency-expands-dental-offerings-ep-615809136-355293601.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/peninsulacommunityhealthmug_8075070_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 406}, "type": "article", "description": "A $262,000 boost from the federal government will help Peninsula Community Health Services provide dental care for more low-income adults.", "title": "Health agency expands dental offerings"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/KitsapSun", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/peninsulacommunityhealthmug_8075070_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "A $262,000 boost from the federal government will help Peninsula Community Health Services provide dental care for more low-income adults.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Health agency expands dental offerings"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-ksun-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The center only offered emergency dental care for adults and general dental care for children in the past.\nPeninsula Community Health will use its share of the money to expand its adult dental program, which has been swamped with demand since dental care was added back into Apple Health (Medicaid) coverage.\n<p>LARRY STEAGALL / KITSAP SUN Peninsula Community Health Services on Sixth Street in Bremerton.</p>SHARE MEEGAN M.
