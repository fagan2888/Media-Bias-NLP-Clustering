But it is good news for bargain-hunters who hate crowds.\n\nWhether it\u2019s good news for retailers remains to be seen. Sales estimates for the start of the holiday shopping season will start trickling out later in the weekend.\n\nStores such as Wal-Mart and Target reported brisk Thanksgiving crowds. The colossal Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, said it drew 100,000 people between 5 p.m. Thursday and 1 a.m. Friday, nearly what it draws over a typical full day.\n\nOn Friday, plenty of shoppers were out, but it wasn\u2019t elbow-to-elbow, said Moody\u2019s analyst Michael Zucchero, at a mall in northern Connecticut.\n\n\u201cTraffic seems a little light,\u201d he said. \u201cStores being open last night takes away some of the early birds.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn residents Paul and Mary Phillips shopped at Target, Old Navy and Marshalls on Friday at the Atlantic Terminal Mall in New York City. They picked DVD box sets for $5, marked down from $45, and speakers for $19, down from $50. They didn\u2019t even have to wait in line.\n\n\u201cBecause stores were open on Thursday, they\u2019re not as crowded now,\u201d Paul Phillips said.\n\nThere were scattered reports of shopper scuffles and arrests. In addition, protests were planned nationwide over minimum-wage laws and the grand jury decision in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nProtesters interrupted holiday shopping at major stores around St. Louis to vent their anger over the decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown.\n\nAbout two dozen people chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police!\u201d and \u201cNo more Black Friday!\u201d after police moved them out of a Wal-Mart in Manchester, a St. Louis suburb.\n\nIn Chicago, about 200 people demonstrated in a plaza near the historic water tower along Michigan Avenue, calling on people to boycott Black Friday shopping to show their solidarity with protesters in Ferguson.\n\nOther disruptions: Best Buy\u2019s website went down on Friday morning for about an hour. Spokesman Jeff Shelman said \u201ca concentrated spike in mobile traffic\u201d prompted the company to temporarily shut down the site. Online monitoring firm Dynatrace said Cabela\u2019s, Foot Locker and J.C. Penney also had website problems.\n\nOnline shopping, especially on phones and tablets, may be siphoning off some shoppers from the malls.\n\nIBM, which tracks online sales, said they rose 8 percent compared with Black Friday last year as of 3 p.m. E.T., with much-increased shopping on mobile devices.\n\nIn the stores, Toys R Us and Target executives said shoppers seem to be buying more than just the doorbusters and are filling their carts with items not on sale. That\u2019s a sign that lower gas prices and an improving job picture are making shoppers more confident about opening their wallets.\n\nAt clothing stores, discounts were steep, with Old Navy offering up to half off everything. Best Buy offered $100 off some iPads. And Target slashed prices on TVs and video game consoles.\n\nAt the Westfield Fox Valley mall in Aurora, Illinois, the mood was calm. Some groggy shoppers were still in pajama pants, coffee in hand.\n\nKimberly States, shopping with her 11-year-old daughter, said it was markedly quieter around 6:30 a.m. Friday than the night before.\n\n\u201cIt was a zoo last night around 10 p.m.,\u201d States said. \u201cNow it seems like more of the old folks.\u201d\n\nLast year, sales on Black Friday slumped 13.2 percent to $9.74 billion, according to ShopperTrak, which tracks data at more than 70,000 stores globally. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, said it is unclear how stores will fare this year.\n\nRetailers have turned to Thanksgiving openings to stay competitive and avoid losing sales that have shifted earlier into the holiday, said Ramesh Swarmy, a retail partner at the Deloitte consulting firm.\n\nThe holiday weekend still sets the tone for the shopping season, whose sales this year are expected to rise 4.1 percent to $611.9 billion. That would be the biggest increase since 2011. Black Friday has been the biggest shopping day of the year since 2005.\n\nBrian Cornell, who became Target\u2019s CEO in August and was at a Target store in New York\u2019s East Harlem neighborhood Friday morning, said shopping traditions have changed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been more of a week event,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a result, some Black Friday shoppers were disappointed by what was left on shelves.\n\nKathy Wise of Scottsdale, Arizona, started shopping at 5 a.m. with her mother-in-law, hitting Wal-Mart, Target, Toys R Us and Sports Authority.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as busy today,\u201d Kathy Wise said as the two combed through a shelf of Monster High dolls. They couldn\u2019t find the one Kathy\u2019s daughter wanted, and said it seemed as if some of the best deals and items were already gone.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a bummer,\u201d Wise said.\n\n__\n\nAP Writers Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Kansas; Dan Sewell in Cincinnati; Sara Burnett in Aurora, Illinois, and Tali Arbel in Phoenix contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Black Friday seemed a little less crazy this year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Black Friday seemed a little less crazy this year.", "title": "Black Friday gets a little less frenzied", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/second-act-of-black-friday-shopping-in-full-swing/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/379d9fadc1dbaf2e660f6a706700ed6a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/379d9fadc1dbaf2e660f6a706700ed6a.jpg", "description": "Black Friday seemed a little less crazy this year.", "card": "summary", "title": "Black Friday gets a little less frenzied"}, "Author": "Anne D'Innocenzio and Mae Anderson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Target, Wal Mart, New York, Thanksgiving"}, "article_summary": "Sales estimates for the start of the holiday shopping season will start trickling out later in the weekend.\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Black Friday seemed a little less crazy this year.\nIBM, which tracks online sales, said they rose 8 percent compared with Black Friday last year as of 3 p.m.\nAs a result, some Black Friday shoppers were disappointed by what was left on shelves.\nProtesters interrupted holiday shopping at major stores around St. Louis to vent their anger over the decision not to indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown."}
