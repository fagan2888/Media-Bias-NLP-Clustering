Continuing his critique of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, Sen. Ted Cruz said Friday that the rulings mark “some of the darkest 24 hours in our nations history.”

Cruz made the comments in an interview on Sean Hannity’s radio show Friday afternoon.

“Today is some of the darkest 24 hours in our nation’s history,” Cruz said.

“I couldn’t say it more eloquently,” Hannity responded.

“Yesterday and today were both naked and shameless judicial activism,” Cruz said. “Neither decision — the decision yesterday rewriting Obamacare for the second time. Six justices joined the Obama administration. You now have President Obama, Kathleen Sebelius and six justices responsible for forcing this failed disaster of a law on millions of Americans, and simply rewriting the law in a way that is fundamentally contrary to their judicial oaths.”

“And then today, this radical decision purporting to strike down the marriage laws of every state. It has no connection to the United States Constitution. They are simply making it up,” Cruz said. “It is lawless, and in doing so, they have undermined the fundamentally legitimacy of the United States Supreme Court.”

Cruz went on to blast many Congressional Republicans for not standing up to Obamacare, saying that some are “popping champagne” in celebration.

“The sad part is leadership supports each of those decisions. A lot of Republicans put out statements today saying they were unhappy and crying crocodile tears because privately they are celebrating and popping champagne,” Cruz said. “They’re thrilled, number one, that the court didn’t throw Obamacare back in the laps of Congress. That they don’t want to actually stand up and do anything to stop it, and they were overjoyed at the marriage decision because they don’t want to defend marriage and they are running away from it. And it is fundamentally dishonest and corrupt.”
