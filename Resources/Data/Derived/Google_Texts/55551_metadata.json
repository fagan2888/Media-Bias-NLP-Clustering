The halls of power in Washington, D.C. are filled with the influential and the important: senators, representatives, lobbyists, journalists, political power brokers and politicos (and interns).\n\nThat was the view of many of the students in the St. Thomas Health Care MBA program who each spring travel as a cohort to Washington for the program\u2019s Health Policy Seminar. But from the moment the seminar started, those assumptions about political life in Washington were challenged.\n\nJack Militello, Ph.D., professor of management and senior executive fellow in St. Thomas\u2019 new Center for Business Innovation in Health Care, served as academic director for the Health Care MBA for the past 12 years. The Health Policy Seminar was designed, he explains, to \u201cshow how government policy affects health care. It is part of our understanding of how everything fits together in the MBA.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you see depends on where you stand,\u201d former Senator David Durenberger told the cohort.\n\n\u201cI will never forget when former Senator Durenberger said that,\u201d said Caitlin Dattilo, vice president of account management at UnitedHealthcare. \u201cThis has been pinned up on my wall in the office since the trip. I found myself making assumptions because of my background in health insurance, and I now try to approach every situation from both perspectives.\u201d\n\nDurenberger, who represented Minnesota from 1978 to 1995, has led this annual trip to Washington since the program\u2019s inception. Though he hasn\u2019t been in office for two decades, it isn\u2019t evident. He can still be counted among the political elite in Washington and is widely recognized across the Hill. His prominence brings some of Washington\u2019s most influential players in the health care policy world to speak at the seminar.\n\nNearly two dozen politicians, congressional staffers, lobbyists, and industry experts addressed the seminar this year, including Liz Fowler, who, before becoming vice president of Global Health at Johnson & Johnson, was the \u201carchitect\u201d of the Affordable Care Act; Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS); Chris Jennings, President Obama\u2019s one-time coordinator of health reform; Chip Kahn, president of the Federation of American Hospitals; and Tom Scully, who was administrator of CMS from 2001 to 2004.\n\n\u201cWhat we try to do is open the minds and hearts of Washington to show a smorgasbord of points of view,\u201d said Len Nichols, director of the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University, who helped coordinate the seminar agenda, \u201cbut also show the basic similarity in the way folks do business here.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the things that you learn about Washington is that it takes virtually everything that you had in your MBA program and it puts it into a package,\u201d said Scott Kulstad \u201906 M.B.A., executive director of Musculoskeletal Services at Fairview, who was an instructor in the health policy course. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about policy without talking about [other courses in the program].\u201d\n\nMilitello echoed that assessment, explaining, \u201cThe MBA looks at health care in three ways. First, the policy that drives decision making; the federal government dictates all industry regulations but is particularly noticeable in health care. Second we deal with institutions which we have to manage within the boundaries of policies\u2014legacy institutions. Third is entrepreneurial organizations that challenge policy.\u201d\n\nThe Real Washington\n\nThe real insight for many students in the seminar was the realization that Washington\u2019s political elite are people, too.\n\n\u201cThe people in power are human!\u201d said Molly McMillen, director of public relations for UnitedHealthcare Community & State. \u201cTo hear each speaker share their candid insights and lessons learned was empowering. They are subject matter experts in their fields, but none believed they were the only lever in making change.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur health care leaders are people who need to hear from us to make a difference,\u201d said Patrick Coleman, senior neuroscience sales, Allergan. \u201cTo make improvements in U.S. health care policy we need to be more proactive in voicing our opinion.\u201d He plans to communicate more \u201cwith my city and state officials on topics I am passionate about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe experience of seeing real life people that are dealing with real life problems and that appreciate our input was eye opening for me,\u201d said Dr. John Cumming. \u201cWhat [our representatives] need is a perspective from people who are doing the work, that are being affected by the policy that\u2019s being developed.\u201d Since returning from Washington he has reached out to Representative Erik Paulsen and Senators Klobuchar and Franken.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the honesty of our speakers, sharing the good, the bad and the ugly about what works (and doesn\u2019t work) in Washington,\u201d said Dattilo. \u201cSo often we heard the same frustrations from both sides of an issue about finding a middle-ground and collaborating, but being stilted by some of the external forces at work, like a campaign year.\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting an inside view of the history, politics and decision making around health reform and policy truly was an eye opening experience,\u201d said O\u2019Brien. \u201cNot only did the experience deepen my understanding of the process and relationships by which work gets done in Washington, but I was struck by how, despite very strongly and emotionally held points view, the individuals we spoke with all seemed to fundamentally respect one another and are genuinely committed to improving the health care system.\u201d\n\nCumming saw it in a different light. The stereotype of Capitol Hill, he said, \u201cis Washington DC. They\u2019re doing the policy analysis and trying to do what\u2019s right, but then all of those issues are politicized.\u201d Congressional staffers\u2014\u201cthey\u2019re just doing a job. They\u2019re just people trying to learn as much as they can and get through their day and do their work. The politicians,\u201d on the other hand, \u201care keeping their jobs.\u201d\n\nThe biggest change in O\u2019Brien\u2019s thinking is that \u201cI now understand that health care reform is an iterative process \u2013 we\u2019ve been working on it in the U.S. since Teddy Roosevelt. It is also clear to me that reform will need all of us, in our jobs, as members of our communities and individually in the health decisions we make to lead the way to a better system.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow health care policy gets made is like watching sausage be made,\u201d said Cumming. \u201cYou like to eat sausage, sure, but you don\u2019t really want to see how it\u2019s made. [But] that\u2019s the part that you need exposure to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see that policy work is done by talented but normal people. That they\u2019re not evil geniuses, they\u2019re not grimy lobbyists, they\u2019re not dumb bureaucrats,\u201d said Militello. \u201cThey\u2019re actual people who are trying to do a good a job, and the constraints of the system define what their good job is.\u201d\n\nAs part of the seminar, the class took a behind the scenes tour of the Capitol, led by Senator Durenberger. It was a beautiful spring afternoon in Washington as the cohort walked from their hotel and across the Capitol grounds. Colorful tulips and fragrant cherry blossoms filled the gardens around the building and the city. The heavy concrete planters surrounding the Capitol also serve as hidden security measures along with the more obvious security booths and barricades that limit entry.\n\nCumming recalled, \u201cI happened to be walking right next to Senator Durenberger. It was almost surreal, I was walking along, just having a conversation about his days on Capitol Hill\u2026and you know, I was able to ask him any question at all and we were just having a really delightful conversation.\u201d\n\nFor all the security and imposition of the capitol\u2019s halls of power, for the students in the Health Care MBA Policy Seminar, the truth is that their work and input is as important to the future of health care in the United States as is that of the political elite.\n\nFor Cumming \u201cthat is something that I will never ever forget, as long as I will live.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Health Care MBA offers an insider\u2019s look at policy in the making", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Newsroom", "description": "The Health Care MBA offers an insider\u2019s look at policy in the making", "title": "Inside Politics - Newsroom", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://static.stthomas.edu/newsroom/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3786.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-18T10:36:49+00:00", "url": "http://www.stthomas.edu/news/inside-politics/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Newsroom", "description": "The Health Care MBA offers an insider\u2019s look at policy in the making", "title": "Inside Politics - Newsroom", "image": "http://static.stthomas.edu/newsroom/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/IMG_3786.jpg", "creator": "@uofstthomasmn", "site": "@uofstthomasmn", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#510C76", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#510C76", "theme-color": "#510C76", "msapplication-TileImage": "/ms-icon-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UofStThomasMN", "section": "B.
