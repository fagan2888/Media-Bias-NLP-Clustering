(AP) \u2014 It doesn\u2019t take long during a visit to the Feed My Sheep day center for the homeless in downtown Glenwood Springs to feel the sense of respect shown for longtime director Karen Peppers by those she was called to serve.\n\n\u201cJust the way she picks people up and engages them, it\u2019s always \u2018Ms. Karen\u2019 this or \u2018Ms. Karen\u2019 that,\u201d observed Michael Pollock.\n\nPollock is one of the local homeless men who landed on the doorstep of \u201cThe Sheep,\u201d as those who frequent the center refer to it. Pollock this past summer fell on hard times in Denver and returned to his hometown of Glenwood, where he used to help his parents run a hardware store.\n\n\u201cYeah, some of these guys look kind of ruffian, and some of them have done prison time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, you know, it\u2019s a necessity to have a place like Feed My Sheep in this modern age.\u201d\n\nNot only the place, but the personal touch Peppers and her many volunteers provide endeavor to make people who don\u2019t have a regular roof over their heads feel at home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen her be utterly tireless in offering abundant good wishes for everybody, along with a shared sense of concern,\u201d Pollock said.\n\nPeppers learned from one of the best, after all.\n\nShe began volunteering with Feed My Sheep soon after the late Karolyn Spencer founded the organization during the winter of 2003-04 to serve the growing contingent of homeless people in the community by providing warm clothes, camping supplies, food, a place to clean up and, eventually, a place to stay overnight during the winter for those who really needed it.\n\nAt the time, Karen and Mike Peppers had been in Glenwood Springs for several years operating a construction business together.\n\nOne day at church she learned about the Extended Table soup kitchen operated by the poverty relief organization LIFT-UP. Each week night, volunteers from different churches and other organizations serve up a hot meal to the homeless and destitute, or anyone who wants to come, in the downstairs fellowship hall at the First United Methodist Church in Glenwood.\n\n\u201cIt was a God thing, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Peppers said of her first volunteer experience at the Extended Table.\n\nWhen she heard about Spencer\u2019s efforts to serve the homeless in other, more substantive ways, Peppers was on board.\n\n\u201cShe just loved the work, and put a lot into it,\u201d Peppers said of Spencer, who was in her 70s when she started the organization. \u201cI was always impressed with her drive, and nothing could bring her down.\u201d\n\nPeppers said she had always struggled to communicate with people who found themselves in bad circumstances.\n\n\u201cKarolyn taught me how to let those walls down and to speak what I really wanted to express to people,\u201d she said.\n\nALLEGHENIES TO ROCKIES\n\nPeppers was born in the Allegheny Mountain region of western New York. Her mother was a private investigator, so the family, including Karen and one brother, traveled from place to place.\n\n\u201cI saw a lot of country growing up,\u201d she said, adding that they eventually wound up in Tennessee where she spent her formative years.\n\n\u201cLife was pretty simple and easy . a lot of church activities,\u201d Peppers said.\n\nAfter high school, though, \u201cI wanted to do my own thing,\u201d she said.\n\nThat ultimately landed her and her husband of nearly 37 years, Mike, in Glenwood Springs, where they worked \u201cside by side\u201d in the construction business building homes up and down the Roaring Fork Valley.\n\nPeppers said she always sensed that Spencer was preparing her to take over Feed My Sheep one day. But she was called away from Glenwood about seven years ago when Mike was diagnosed with lung cancer, and they moved to Arkansas for his treatments.\n\nSoon after that, in February of 2009, they received word that Spencer had passed away after her own battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnother Feed My Sheep volunteer at the time, Kenneth Williams, served as director for about a year before he resigned. That\u2019s when Peppers got a call from a board member.\n\n\u201cThey basically told me, you\u2019re going to take over Feed My Sheep. No conversation, the decision had been made,\u201d Peppers recalled.\n\n\u201cWe talked about it and decided we had to come back, that this is where God wanted us to be,\u201d she said.\n\nSince then, Peppers, with regular help from her husband and a core group of about 36 year-round volunteers, live and breathe Feed My Sheep\u2019s mission:\n\n\u201cTo provide the basic necessities for the survival of the local homeless in the Roaring Fork Valley and surrounding counties. We offer love, compassion, encouragement and hope for their futures. Our mission is to aid the homeless in reaching self sufficiency through case management and substance abuse programs.\u201d\n\nPeppers notes that Spencer combined her love for the people she served with a sternness about making sure they followed the rules, stayed away from alcohol and other drugs and didn\u2019t cause problems for the local residents, business owners and tourists in the community.\n\n\u201cYou have to be stern at times, sure,\u201d Peppers said in reference to growing concerns about some of the more transient, vagrant types who are prone to cause problems and who aren\u2019t necessarily the ones using Feed My Sheep\u2019s services.\n\n\u201cWe try to be one big, happy family here,\u201d she said.\n\nNO PLACE LIKE \u2018HOME\u2019\n\nThe current day center opened in the downstairs portion of the Catholic Charities building at 10th and Grand in downtown Glenwood 10 years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s where the local homeless population \u2014 a mix of longtime locals who are down on their luck, families, veterans who are struggling, and drifters who happen in and out of town \u2014 can get a hot breakfast, lunch, showers, do laundry, store some of their things and make phone calls or use a computer to stay in touch with family or line up work.\n\nThe center provides supplies for those who choose to sleep on the hillsides above town, such as tents, sleeping bags, blankets, flashlights and personal care items.\n\n\u201cThe center is not just a place for these services, it\u2019s a place where men and women can share, plan for the future, renew family relationships, search for work, receive respect and acceptance,\u201d according to the narrative on the organization\u2019s website.\n\nStaff can also help people find temporary or long-term housing, restore lost identification, and provide referrals for mental and medical care.\n\nThe open setting includes a living and dining area, kitchen, a laundry room, restrooms and shower facilities, reading and study areas.\n\nHours are from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Clients can stay for the day, but are encouraged to do something to better their situation for most of the time.\n\n\u201cThe TV doesn\u2019t go on until noon,\u201d Peppers said. \u201cThen, they can watch a show or a movie if they want.\u201d\n\nThe day center logged 9,217 visits last year, serving a total of 237 people, she said.\n\nAfter hypothermia claimed the life of a local homeless woman in December of 2005, Feed My Sheep responded by starting an overnight shelter during the winter months. The shelter began with two motel rooms in 2006, and now uses the basement at the Church of Christ in West Glenwood, operating from late November through March.\n\nSeparate areas are provided for men and women, couples and families with children. An average of 28 to 30 people use the shelter each night, including families in a crisis situation such as a sudden eviction, job loss, fire, or even those who are stranded and can\u2019t afford a motel room.\n\nA FRIENDLY SMILE\n\nRecently, Peppers said she was driving \u201cone of the guys\u201d to a job, when he turned to her and asked, \u201cWhy are you always so happy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause my mom always said to,\u201d she replied.\n\n\u201cI learned early on that when you open your eyes in the morning you have a choice,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can either be ugly and mean, or you can smile and be happy. I always chose the latter.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a way of approaching life that rubs off on the people she touches.\n\nLike Pollock, who can often be seen patrolling downtown Glenwood Springs picking up cigarette butts and trash, and even offering to sweep the front sidewalk for local businesses.\n\n\u201cIt feels really good to do that,\u201d Pollock said. \u201cGiving back to the community, even in that little way, is something that has really resonated with me.\u201d\n\nAnd like Mark Elliott, who said he met Peppers when he had regular carpentry work, before he himself found the need to utilize The Sheep\u2019s services when he suffered spinal damage and wasn\u2019t able to work, and also came to terms with a drinking problem.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just a real asset to the community, and I\u2019ve always had great respect for her,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Karen reach out to people in really tough situations and go above and beyond to help them.\u201d\n\nElliott acknowledged an \u201coutside perception\u201d that isn\u2019t all that positive about Feed My Sheep and the homeless population of Glenwood Springs and the valley.\n\n\u201cThe guys out causing trouble, they don\u2019t come down here, and we really don\u2019t want them to tarnish our image,\u201d Elliott said in reference to the problems some within the larger homeless population have caused.\n\n\u201cThis is actually a pretty typical day here,\u201d he said, scanning the room where day center clients were quietly going about their routines.\n\nIt\u2019s where Kelley Cullen of New Castle decided about a year ago to start doing weekly volunteer work with her two young children, Ashley, 6, and Brodie, 3.\n\n\u201cI was looking for something to do with the kids that would teach them about giving back,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cThey\u2019re really quiet, so this gives them the conversation and companionship piece, and just a different social experience from a play date.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place to communicate with all kinds of people in a safe environment, and helps them open their minds to what\u2019s around us and what different people\u2019s situations are,\u201d she said.\n\nCullen acknowledged that some people might be too afraid or uncomfortable going into an environment like that, especially exposing their children to it.\n\n\u201cSure, it can be awkward,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s good to let yourself experience that discomfort.\u201d\n\nBesides, Ashley and Brodie love playing with and helping to take care of the Sheep\u2019s pet rabbit, Angel.\n\nAnd, \u201cKaren is amazing, just her devotion and her passion for working with the people who come here,\u201d Cullen said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nInformation from: Post Independent, http://www.postindependent.com/", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u2018Ms. Karen\u2019 peppers homeless with love, support", "title": "\u2018Ms. Karen\u2019 peppers homeless with love, support", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/ms-karen-peppers-homeless-with-love-support/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T08:22:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-29T08:22:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16db\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is actually a pretty typical day here,\u201d he said, scanning the room where day center clients were quietly going about their routines.\nAt the time, Karen and Mike Peppers had been in Glenwood Springs for several years operating a construction business together.\nHer mother was a private investigator, so the family, including Karen and one brother, traveled from place to place.\n\u201cThen, they can watch a show or a movie if they want.\u201dThe day center logged 9,217 visits last year, serving a total of 237 people, she said.\nWhen she heard about Spencer\u2019s efforts to serve the homeless in other, more substantive ways, Peppers was on board."}
