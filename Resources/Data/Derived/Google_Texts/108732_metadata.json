Ted Cruz will complain some more, Senate Republicans will roll their eyes at him and clear the way for Democrats to strip the defunding rider from the government spending bill. Then in the most predictable denouement since the outcome of the last Washington Racial Epithets game, House Republicans will shrug, fund the government, and Obamacare enrollment will open on schedule.\n\nSeveral commentators have watched the defund campaign go flaccid and responded by reissuing breathless exhortations that the risk of a debt default next month is much more severe than the risk of a shutdown ever was.\n\nHere\u2019s Steve Benen, Ezra Klein and Jonathan Chait, just today.\n\nBut it seems to me the past week\u2019s events set up the following equation \u2014 cave on defunding Obamacare + ??? = win the debt limit fight \u2014 and it\u2019s up to one of these guys to solve for ???\n\nThey all proceed from the same basic premise \u2014 the GOP\u2019s demands are so extreme, and the Democrats\u2019 commitment not to negotiating so ironclad, that Congress simply can\u2019t increase the debt limit without one party folding. Parties don\u2019t like to fold, ergo the risk of default is high.\n\nI think this logic is flawed for a few reasons. Parties fold all the time. The GOP\u2019s demands are actually wishes couched as demands. Their insistence on concessions from President Obama isn\u2019t actually as black and white as the doomsayers portray it.\n\nBut on top of these misapprehensions, the debt limit freakout caucus also misrepresents a straightforward argument that the fight will be resolved fairly harmlessly as a lazily reductive assumption.\n\nChait says, \u201cThe debt-ceiling showdowns of 2011 and last spring both resolved themselves without triggering an economic meltdown, and so most people have come to assume the same will happen again this fall.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are painting their way to a debt limit cave, and the government (and Obamacare) will be funded", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s complaints are meaningless", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Republicans are painting their way to a debt limit cave, and the government (and Obamacare) will be funded", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s complaints are meaningless", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/24/ted_cruzs_complaints_are_meaningless/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/boehner_cruz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans are painting their way to a debt limit cave, and the government (and Obamacare) will be funded", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s complaints are meaningless", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/boehner_cruz.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, credit default, Government shutdown, John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, Obamacare, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0fc9\"", "article_summary": "But it seems to me the past week\u2019s events set up the following equation \u2014 cave on defunding Obamacare + ???\n= win the debt limit fight \u2014 and it\u2019s up to one of these guys to solve for ???\nBut on top of these misapprehensions, the debt limit freakout caucus also misrepresents a straightforward argument that the fight will be resolved fairly harmlessly as a lazily reductive assumption.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t happen to think filibustering a bill that defunds Obamacare is the best route to defunding Obamacare,\u201d Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.\nTed Cruz will complain some more, Senate Republicans will roll their eyes at him and clear the way for Democrats to strip the defunding rider from the government spending bill."}
