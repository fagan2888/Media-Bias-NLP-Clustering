But few have done it after waiting in a hospital as their spouse was treated for cancer.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Lizza Miller seven years ago as she brought her husband \u2014 also her best friend and co-founder \u2014 to another doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nWhen George Dittmeier was diagnosed with a rare form of blood cancer, Lizza helped her soulmate organize a thick notebook filled with detailed diagnosis information, medications, treatment options, advice, and other related papers. She would reference this notebook every time another big decision needed to be made.\n\nBut one day inside a hospital, Miller started thinking about how antiquated and inefficient that notebook really was.\n\n\u201cI was just so frustrated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was such an archaic way of trying to make sense of things. There had to be a better way.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Miller had an epiphany. Her 11-year-old company, DatStat, was already helping researchers automate their workflow and engage study patients with a software solution \u2014 why couldn\u2019t the same technology be used for point-of-care patients inside hospitals and clinics?\n\nHer husband survived, but the experience had a lasting impact. Fast forward seven years, and DatStat now not only builds software for researchers, but also helps patients capture their own health data that ultimately lets physicians better provide more personalized care.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, I was a researcher developing DatStat for my world of research,\u201d Miller says now. \u201cBut later on, it became very personal.\u201d\n\nDatStat is now a 45-person company in Seattle that has customers like Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Kaiser Permanente, and Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital all using its cloud-based software for both research and patient care purposes.\n\nMiller explained that there\u2019s a problem in existing healthcare today with fragmentation of data and a lack of engaged focus on patients. As a result \u2014 and thanks in part to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 more industry leaders are pushing for what\u2019s called \u201cvalue-based care,\u201d or the concept that doctors should be paid based on quality, not quantity, of care.\n\n\u201cThis has forced institutions to stop trying to profit per visit and drive people needlessly into clinics,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt is now set up to drive value-based interactions.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is a shortage of doctors in both primary and speciality care. This means that doctors need to see more patients per day, but also improve the quality of their care.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can solve this problem is with technology,\u201d Miller noted.\n\nDatStat\u2019s software is designed to help doctors be more efficient with patients. For example, instead of patients filling out an intake form each time they arrive at the doctor\u2019s office, DatStat digitizes the process so patients can provide that information prior to an appointment, and clinicians can see the data in an organized format. It also offers a way for patients to consume tailored content while they wait for the doctor based on their survey answers. After an appointment, patients can continue using the software to track treatment over time. DatStat also lets hospitals and clinics easily collect feedback from patients on the quality of their visit.\n\n\n\nPerhaps most importantly, DatStat provides a place to easily access and manage all that information. The idea is to help doctors connect dots and offer better care by using the technology-enabled tools.\n\n\u201cWithout a platform-based solution, that data is in a whole bunch of different places,\u201d said DatStat COO Amber Ratcliffe. \u201cElectronic health records are intended to facilitate billing \u2014 they do not facilitate patient interaction.\u201d\n\nHelping researchers is still a big part of DatStat\u2019s business, and this week the company announced Illume Next, the next generation of its enterprise software for health researchers and clinicians. Illume Next is essentially survey software on steroids, offering researchers a data collection and study automation platform that helps retain participants and pull insights from fragmented data sets.\n\nDatStat, which has been profitable since it took a small amount of angel funding early on, works with a variety of research customers. One of those is the Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, which uses the software to help workers in Zambia organize HIV and AIDS data collection across 21 communities. The company is also working with Group Health on a groundbreaking study that aims to learn more about how to prevent suicide.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are doing all of this with our technology as the backbone that engages participants, puts them in different conditions, tracks them over time, makes them follow a protocol, and then delivers the communication and content that\u2019s relevant to what they are doing,\u201d Miller said.\n\nTechnology really can be used for the greater good. Both parts of DatStat\u2019s business utilize the same underlying technology, and for Miller, it\u2019s a combination that helps fulfill the company\u2019s original mission.\n\n\u201cBoth applications do the same thing: Take care of and support that longitudinal process of chronic care,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen a customer asks us to support them, we ask ourselves if it fits within what we can do to help them make the world a healthier place. If so, then it\u2019s absolutely right for us.\u201d\n\nMiller said she never envisioned becoming an entrepreneur until learning how much she enjoys taking risks to help solve people\u2019s problems. She encouraged other entrepreneurs and technologists to do the same.\n\n\u201cTechnology really can be used for the greater good,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI hope entrepreneurs that are starting out can look at the bigger picture and say, \u2018what huge problem do we need to solve?\u2019 I hope they can use their great minds and abilities to bring resources together to solve those problems. We are carving that out in our world, and I want to see more people do some of that, too.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most founders build businesses because of a problem they've experienced first hand.
