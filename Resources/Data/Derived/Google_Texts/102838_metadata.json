Sure, his face may be a bit squishy, but that\u2019s no reason to squish-shame this total non-squish. Especially since Ted Cruz is, apparently, the arbiter of squish, which is one of the reasons you should vote for him in the primary, instead of some pansy squish like Mitt Romney.\n\n.@TedCruz ribs @MittRomney for general squishiness: \"I think in the third debate Romney actually walked over and kissed Obama on the lips.\" \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) October 12, 2015\n\nCruz, who may or may not have walked over and kissed Donald Trump somewhere other than on the lips a few times during this presidential campaign, has made standing tall in the face of all things liberal central to his campaign\u2019s narrative. Unlike the squishes in Congress who care about things like \u201ccloture\u201d and \u201cvetoes,\u201d Cruz knows that Republicans in the House and Senate can repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood and carve the Ten Commandments into every government building in the country with the right combination of \u201ccourage\u201d and \u201cleadership.\u201d He knows that all our foreign policy really needs right now is for the president to call noted squishes Vladmir Putin and Ayatollah Khamenei on the phone and say \u201cstop it,\u201d and they will do whatever we want. And he most definitely knows that, beyond its politics, American culture needs to de-squish itself and stop condoning that which is squishy, including but not limited to abortion, secularism and men kissing on national television.\n\nLost in the homophobia of Cruz\u2019s joke is the fact that it\u2019s logic is also all wrong. Had Mitt Romney walked over to President Obama and open-mouth kissed him, it would undoubtedly be the most assertive thing anyone has ever done on a presidential campaign. More assertive than \u201cI\u2019m paying for this microphone.\u201d More assertive than \u201cSenator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d More assertive than \u201cWe also have fewer horses and bayonets.\u201d\n\nCruz later clarified that he took \u201csome poetic license\u201d with the joke.
