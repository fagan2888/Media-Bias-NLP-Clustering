And then, lo and behold, we actually don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy at all, and the premium is astronomical.\u201d\n\nThe Wendts were paying $221 a month to cover their family of seven. They are now paying a monthly premium of $381 under a temporary stop-gap plan that will be canceled next year, when the family is forced by law to register for an Obamacare plan.\n\nUnder this new plan, the family will be forced to pay around $24,000 a year, nearly double the cost of the $12,000 they pay under their current plan, Wendt said.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s four times the premium we were paying last year and the out of pocket liability is double,\u201d Wendt said.\n\nThis will lead to overtime work for Shannon\u2019s husband and force her to restart a jewelry business that had been on the backburner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh we\u2019ll just create another $12,000 dollars,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. My husband is having to think a little different and come up with different strategies\u201d in a bid to earn the extra income needed to pay for Obamacare.\n\nWendt said that it is \u201cfrustrating\u201d to be called a liar by powerful Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.), who has deemed stories like Shannon\u2019s untrue.\n\nAdditionally, \u201cthe hate mail I\u2019m getting\u201d from Obama\u2019s backers \u201cis just very sad,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSome of them say, \u2018I think you\u2019re a lying bitch,\u2019\u201d while others send her \u201clong nasty e-mails how they hope I get sued, and how my children should be taken away, and how can I homeschool them, and that I\u2019m so ignorant. I mean, just nasty things.\u201d\n\nWendt said these critics are trying to intimidate Obamacare critics into silence.\n\n\u201cI do have to think a little bit, though, that it is kind of the plan of the left to just kill the messenger,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re calling me a liar and saying all these terrible things and calling me nasty names. It\u2019s horrible what people will say. And you think you\u2019ve got thick skin, but the hate feeding it is all over the social media sites and it takes time to go and delete the comments and respond to some of them that are less nasty.\u201d\n\nWendt said that she is braving the attacks in order to help other families who are in a similar position.\n\n\u201cI think other people wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that [backlash], the fear of other people when you stand up, what backlash they would get, it\u2019s keeping people quiet,\u201d she said, noting that she personally knows of several other Michigan families who have shared the same horror stories.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be hundreds of thousands of families that are being affected by this,\u201d\n\nshe said.\n\nWendt said she believes America can solve its healthcare crisis without putting the burden on hardworking average families.\n\n\u201cThis was the wrong thing,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially in my situation, forcing families to choose between an inexpensive plan and the doctors that they need and love on a private plan, that\u2019s a choice you shouldn\u2019t have to make. It didn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A Michigan mother of five says that the crushing new costs associated with Obamacare have imperiled her family\u2019s financial future and will burden the household with thousands of dollars in unexpecte", "title": "Mother of Five: Obamacare Jeopardizing My Family\u2019s Financial Future", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/mother-of-five-obamacare-jeopardizing-my-familys-financial-future/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Shannon-Wendt-AFP-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Michigan mother of five says that the crushing new costs associated with Obamacare have imperiled", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Shannon-Wendt-AFP-150x150.png", "title": "Mother of Five: Obamacare Jeopardizing My Family\u2019s Financial Future", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf5ff\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @Kredo0A Michigan mother of five says that the crushing new costs associated with Obamacare have imperiled her family\u2019s financial future and will burden the household with thousands of dollars in unexpected expenses.\nThey are now paying a monthly premium of $381 under a temporary stop-gap plan that will be canceled next year, when the family is forced by law to register for an Obamacare plan.\nThe burden of Obamacare has sparked worry and anxiety in the Wendt household.\nUnder this new plan, the family will be forced to pay around $24,000 a year, nearly double the cost of the $12,000 they pay under their current plan, Wendt said.\nMy husband is having to think a little different and come up with different strategies\u201d in a bid to earn the extra income needed to pay for Obamacare."}
