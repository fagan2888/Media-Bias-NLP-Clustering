All of the more than 400,000 people who were either able to navigate the state\u2019s fumbled rollout of the previous online marketplace or those placed in temporary coverage will have to reapply during the 90-day period using the state\u2019s new website. Starting in December, those coverage programs will end in waves, according to the Connector\u2019s executive director Jean Yang.\n\n\u201cLet me just say very explicitly that this is going to be a challenging task,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThis to some extent is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nThe old website was created to comply with the federal Affordable Care Act, a plan that was built on Massachusetts\u2019 existing public healthcare law. Yang was open about the website\u2019s failures.\n\n\u201cWe had problems last year,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to apologize for all the difficulties, the confusion, the frustration that many people in the state experienced. That was not a good experience. No one was more frustrated than we were and we learned a lot from that experience.\u201d\n\nFollowing the struggles, the state changed leadership and oversight of the Connector and dumped its IT-vendor CGI Group. In May, the commonwealth outlined a plan for the new website using an off-the-shelf application called hCentive and enlisting Optum to serve as the new vendor. After adding 430 staffers and conducting more than 3,000 tests, Yang is confident the November re-launch will be successful, but adds around the clock work will continue.\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re making progress,\u201d Yang said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen enough to feel that this is going to be a reliable rollout [and] that we\u2019re going to have the right IT system to serve its people. We\u2019re very excited about that. We know we have a lot to prove to you all and we are looking forward to the opportunity to prove that it\u2019s going to work.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Boston Globe editorial by Maydad Cohen, Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s special assistant for project delivery, the original IT budget was $175 million. It is now $254 million dollars, with the state expected to carry $42 million, $26 million dollars more than expected. The federal government is expected to pick up the rest of the tab.\n\nTo help those 400,000 people and others enroll, the state has enlisted the help of 15 navigator organizations, up from 10 last year. Chip Joffe-Halpern of North Adams-based Ecu-Health Care directs one of those navigators.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure that all these individuals reapply for coverage,\u201d Joffe-Halpern said. \u201cEveryone has to reapply. No one wants to see anyone experience any gaps in their health insurance. I think in Berkshire County we\u2019re well equipped to offer county residents the support they need to complete the application process.\u201d\n\nThe two other county organizations are Community Health Programs and Advocacy for Access. Acknowledging state leaders were caught off guard last year, State Representative Tricia Farley-Bouvier of Pittsfield insists those who don\u2019t get health insurance through their employers will be able to this year.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be standing here if I didn\u2019t feel really confident that this year it\u2019s going to go smoother and that people in the community that need to be enrolled, need access to health insurance are going to be able to get it,\u201d said Farley-Bouvier.\n\nThe outreach campaign includes phone calls, mailings and going door to door. Overall 97 percent of Massachusetts residents have health insurance. Yang says the state is trying to reach those totally uninsured as well.\n\n\u201cWe will chase them down,\u201d said Yang chuckling. \u201cUntil we find every single one.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "New England News", "description": "The director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state\u2019s online health insurance marketplace, met with Berkshire healthcare agencies Thursday ahead", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wamc.org/post/health-insurance-enrollment-campaign-comes-berkshires", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wamc/files/styles/medium/public/201410/jeanyang.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "The director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state\u2019s online health insurance marketplace, met with Berkshire healthcare agencies Thursday ahead", "title": "Health Insurance Enrollment Campaign Comes To Berkshires"}, "story_id": 356767587, "twitter": {"site": "@WAMCRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@WAMCRadio"}, "author": "Jim Levulis", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Health Insurance Enrollment Campaign Comes To Berkshires"}, "nid": 101081, "datePublished": "2014-10-16", "keywords": "Massachusetts Health Connector, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 736, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20e9\"", "article_summary": "The director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, the state\u2019s online health insurance marketplace, met with Berkshire healthcare agencies Thursday ahead of the upcoming open enrollment period.\nNo one wants to see anyone experience any gaps in their health insurance.\nOverall 97 percent of Massachusetts residents have health insurance.\nAcknowledging state leaders were caught off guard last year, State Representative Tricia Farley-Bouvier of Pittsfield insists those who don\u2019t get health insurance through their employers will be able to this year.\nIt is now $254 million dollars, with the state expected to carry $42 million, $26 million dollars more than expected."}
