A 19-year-old Hartford woman has a "significant" head injury after falling off her bicycle Saturday, authorities said.

Officials responded to Kings Way in the Town of Hartford after getting a report about a woman who fell off her bike and was unresponsive at 11:13 a.m., according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office. She was taken to an area hospital before being flown to Froedtert Trauma Center in Milwaukee by Flight for Life.

Because of her head injury, the victim was unable to give her name. Officials were able to identify her through a door-to-door canvas of the neighborhood and inform her family. Her name was not available at this time.

Officials learned the 19-year-old was riding a homemade bicycle made of various bicycle parts. She was not wearing a helmet.
