The program aims to enable the entire campus community to identify and intervene with students in distress.\n\n\n\nFunds will support the Noles CARE in Academics program, designed to focus mental health resources within academic departments. Assistant Professor Marty Swanbrow Becker says this approach builds on students\u2019 existing support systems: their friends and teachers.\n\n\u201cWell our goal is to make suicide prevention easier on campus and to demystify and destigmatize the process. And so our plan is to train key people within departments, so maybe department chairs, student leaders, some key faculty members, on suicide prevention,\u201d he said.\n\nThe program includes training to address the specific needs of high risk groups, including veterans, minorities and LGBTQ students. The university will also hire Suicide Prevention Coordinator. The initiative is expected to launch campus-wide in the fall of 2016.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Florida State University is expanding its suicide prevention program, with a $306,000 dollar grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services,", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/fsu-expands-suicide-prevention-efforts", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201509/443224851.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Florida State University is expanding its suicide prevention program, with a $306,000 dollar grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services,", "title": "FSU Expands Suicide Prevention Efforts"}, "org_id": 390, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Kate Payne", "wordCount": 255, "dc": {"title": "FSU Expands Suicide Prevention Efforts"}, "nid": 12095, "datePublished": "2015-09-25", "story_id": 443224620, "keywords": "suicide, suicide prevention, Florida State University", "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWell our goal is to make suicide prevention easier on campus and to demystify and destigmatize the process.\nFlorida State University is expanding its suicide prevention program, with a $306,000 dollar grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nAnd so our plan is to train key people within departments, so maybe department chairs, student leaders, some key faculty members, on suicide prevention,\u201d he said.\nThe university will also hire Suicide Prevention Coordinator.\nFunds will support the Noles CARE in Academics program, designed to focus mental health resources within academic departments."}
