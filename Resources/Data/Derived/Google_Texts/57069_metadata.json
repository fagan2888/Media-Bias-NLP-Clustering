Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters\n\nThe Costa Concordia cruise liner began its final voyage Wednesday, slowly being towed away from the tiny Italian island where it capsized more than two years ago, killing 32 people, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe ship, now hoisted afloat by massive air chambers, will be tugged to the port of Genoa in northwest Italy, expected to arrive on Sunday, where it will be dismantled and scrapped.\n\nThe Concordia will make the 200-mile journey at about two nautical miles per hour, to reduce the stress on the ship\u2019s weakened hull. Accompanying the tugs and Concordia are several boats monitoring for any pollution in the waters, which are home to dolphins. Nets have been attached to sides of the liner in case any remnants of the Concordia\u2019s last passenger cruise \u2014 dishware, pots and pans, bed linen, chairs and other furnishings \u2014 tumble out of the ship during towing.\n\nTugboats spray water as the Costa Concordia begins its final journey.
