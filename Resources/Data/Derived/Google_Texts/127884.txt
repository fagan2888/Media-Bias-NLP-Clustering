For those who thought that the departure of Mike Bloomberg would mean an end to nannyism, fear not.

The federal government has stepped into the breach left by the man who warred on Big Gulp sodas, transfats, salt, cigarettes and certain forms of circumcision. Starting today — New Year’s Day — it will be lights out for the popular 40- and 60-watt incandescent bulbs.

It’s for our own good, we are told. As then- Energy Secretary Steven Chu so memorably put it two years ago, the feds are “taking away a choice that continues to let people waste their own money.”

Really? If that’s really the sacred principle here, young healthy Americans might rightly ask why the administration is taking the exact opposite position on ObamaCare, Here the law requires young Americans to “waste” money on health insurance some don’t think they need just so the government can spend it on care for the rest of us.

We don’t deny that incandescents give out more heat than light. But so does meddling government. If you build a better light bulb — at a good price — consumers will come to it of their own accord.
