LeBron James, for one, already is the best at playing basketball, yet his \u201cKing James\u201d moniker anoints him as sports royalty. The whole thing, really, seems over the top, until you look at Roland Bailey.\n\nThey call him Champ. The Broncos cornerback exudes all of the virtues of what fans desire in a champion. He\u2019s cool by not acting cool. He has this aura around him, but not because he\u2019s a self-proclaimed stud. It\u2019s because he\u2019s revered in football circles. It\u2019s because he speaks softly, yet with resonance. It\u2019s because he\u2019s actually so humble, it\u2019s hard to believe that someone with his talent isn\u2019t shouting about it.\n\nReally, the only problem with the nickname Champ is that he\u2019s not a champ.\n\nBut, after 15 seasons in the NFL, this sure Pro Football Hall of Famer finally will play in the Super Bowl. The 35-year-old cornerback faces the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Winners get title rings.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I still lace them up,\u201d Bailey said, \u201cbecause I want to play in games like this.\u201d\n\nFather Time must be an Oakland Raiders fan. How else could you explain how he treated this legendary Bronco? In what seemed destined to be a Super Bowl run, Bailey missed 11 games this season because of a foot injury. And when he did play, he seemed slow-footed at times, looking more Roland than Champ.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been hurt. Everyone thinks he\u2019s old and over the hill. But great players, when it matters most, play great,\u201d said former Broncos safety John Lynch. \u201cAnd he really did that against New England.\u201d\n\nIn the AFC championship game against the Patriots on Jan. 19, Bailey didn\u2019t just cover slot receivers, he smothered slot receivers. It was an eye- watering performance, the aging warrior mustering up one more fight.\n\nAnd now, his lifelong goal is attainable. Sports are cruel because, well, even a transcendent cornerback has no control over the success of his team\u2019s offense, just like an ace pitcher needs his offense to score. As such, some men like Champ never become champs. Bailey is a 12-time Pro Bowl selection, an NFL record for a cornerback, but only now will he play in the only bowl that matters.\n\n\u201cYou think of all the great players who never made it to a Super Bowl and how hard it is to get there,\u201d said Boss Bailey, Champ\u2019s brother and a former NFL linebacker. \u201cI played six years in the league, and I never even had a winning season. He\u2019s been a great pro all of his career. It\u2019s been 15 years and he still plays at a high level, so the timing couldn\u2019t be more perfect for him.\u201d\n\nFront yards do something to boys. It\u2019s where they escape. It\u2019s where playing make-believe and playing football become the same thing.\n\n\u201cWe always pretended we were great athletes. Deion Sanders \u2014 oh, my God \u2014 Darrell Green, these are the guys we\u2019d emulate,\u201d said the Broncos\u2019 Bailey, who was raised in tiny Folkston, Ga.\n\nA rookie with the Washington Redskins in 1999, Bailey sure enough played with Green, an iconic cornerback who was a two-time Super Bowl champion. The next season, Sanders and his two title rings joined the Washington secondary.\n\n\u201cYou were them in the front yard and then you were their teammates,\u201d Bailey was told.\n\n\u201cHow unbelievable is that?\u201d he replied during a quiet moment amid Super Bowl preparation.\n\n\u201cA dream come true?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never dreamed that,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I never thought it could happen.\u201d\n\nBailey has joined Sanders and Green on the shortlist of all-time great cornerbacks. At his best, Bailey not only is track-star stealth but freakishly strong, a rare combination at cornerback. He cherishes open-field tackling, which some diva cornerbacks look as dirty work that is saved for safeties. For years, quarterbacks chose to throw to a lesser receiver than throw to their best guy if he was being covered by Denver\u2019s best guy. In perhaps Bailey\u2019s greatest season, 2006, quarterbacks threw at him only 35 times. He intercepted 10 of those passes, allowing only four receptions. That\u2019s right, four.\n\n\u201cHe should have been the defensive MVP in 2005 and 2006, especially 2006,\u201d said Andrew Mason, a longtime statistics analyst of the NFL. \u201cThe best play from a cornerback in my lifetime. Insane stuff.\u201d\n\nBut first it was Folkston that made Bailey, well, Bailey. His mother, Elaine, said she started calling him Champ when he was a baby, a preordained nickname for a boy who would become a pro\u2019s pro. Elaine, who still lives in Folkston, flies to numerous Broncos games, wearing a jersey with MOM BAILEY above the No. 24. She, Boss and 35 family members came to Denver for the AFC championship game, a heck of a locale for a family reunion.\n\n\u201cWe had a pretty close family. We lived right next door to my grandmother. That\u2019s one thing we had \u2014 each other,\u201d Boss Bailey said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t rich by any means, and we definitely didn\u2019t have it all, but at the same time, we had so much family support that we were able to play sports, and (received rides) to games. They put in a lot of hours on the road, getting us to different games in different cities.\n\n\u201cAnd, shoot, we\u2019d play out there in the front yard or whatever yard we could find. Family reunions with the cousins, just around the neighborhood. We used to go around town and play pickup games.\u201d\n\nAnd now, Champ will play a game in the front yard of front yards.\n\nHe is beloved from Folkston to Fort Collins. Dads in Colorado dress in No. 24 jerseys, while their boys pretend they\u2019re Bailey in front yards. Broncos cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie even wore a Bailey jersey on campus while he was a college student. Bailey\u2019s aura touched a generation.\n\n\u201cIt was just a pleasure for me to finally get a chance to play with him and see how he handles himself,\u201d said former Broncos safety Brian Dawkins. \u201cSee, he was a professional. A lot of guys that have success aren\u2019t professionals.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s matchup is fitting \u2014 the Broncos have the quiet, cool cornerback, while the Seahawks have the brashest dude in the NFL. For years, everyone just knew Bailey was the best cornerback in the league. He didn\u2019t have to scream that line on national TV, as all-pro Richard Sherman of the Seahawks did after the NFC championship game.\n\n\u201cChamp\u2019s humble, and you don\u2019t see Champ being flashy or demanding respect or using his seniority to get things,\u201d said Broncos safety Mike Adams. \u201cHis presence alone \u2014 when Champ walks in the room, it\u2019s like, \u2018that\u2019s Champ.\u2019 His presence alone says enough.\u201d\n\nBut Bailey is famous for flipping the switch, nice to nasty in the snap of a football. And with Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin now healthy for Super Bowl XLVIII, Bailey\u2019s performance Sunday will be crucial for Denver to stop this suddenly bolstered Seattle offense. When Harvin lines up in the slot, it\u2019s likely Bailey who will be opposite him.\n\nNeither Champ nor Boss has ever attended a Super Bowl. The brothers never wanted to go unless they were playing. So, when Denver defeated New England, Champ Bailey suddenly was whipped into the whirlwind that is Super Bowl week.\n\nSitting at a podium during Super Bowl media day last week, dozens of reporters peppered him with questions \u2014 until he was interrupted by an old friend. Deion Sanders now works for NFL Network, and he wedged his way next to the podium for a fun-loving interview with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nAsked why he doesn\u2019t boast loudly like Sherman, Bailey told Sanders: \u201cMy game speaks for itself. I\u2019m still here, ain\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ready to go,\u201d Sanders asked, \u201cafter all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I am. Come on, man \u2014 I\u2019m always ready,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cI feel good. It\u2019s been a long year, but I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nAfter Sanders left, Bailey was asked about his early days with the Redskins, when he played alongside the man he emulated in the front yard.\n\n\u201cMan, he\u2019s one of a kind with his personality, the way he played the game,\u201d Bailey said in his slow, soft, Southern cadence. \u201cOne thing about him, though \u2014 people don\u2019t understand how hard he worked. You don\u2019t just strap them up and think it\u2019s going to happen. He made it seem like that, but that man put the time in. And that definitely rubbed off on me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m still sitting here.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Hochman: bhochman@denverpost.com or twitter.com/hochman", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey ready to be a champion", "title": "Broncos cornerback Champ Bailey ready to be a champion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/01/broncos-cornerback-champ-bailey-ready-to-be-a-champion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__20140202_A1_SP01FBNCHAMPp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140201__20140202_A1_SP01FBNCHAMPp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-01T19:58:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T15:48:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7f45\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos cornerback exudes all of the virtues of what fans desire in a champion.\nSo, when Denver defeated New England, Champ Bailey suddenly was whipped into the whirlwind that is Super Bowl week.\nBroncos cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie even wore a Bailey jersey on campus while he was a college student.\nIn what seemed destined to be a Super Bowl run, Bailey missed 11 games this season because of a foot injury.\nBut, after 15 seasons in the NFL, this sure Pro Football Hall of Famer finally will play in the Super Bowl."}
