But I don\u2019t know what anyone could say that was worth that amount of money, unless the speaker was Warren Buffet. Likewise, I don\u2019t know how I would justify asking to borrow $1 million dollars from Goldman Sachs to use in a potential run for the White House the way Ted Cruz did.\n\nBankers are really nice guys who normally want collateral to guarantee a loan. It is worth noting, however, that Hillary got her money up front but Canada-born Ted is on the hook for his. That\u2019s why I hope to learn Ted\u2019s secret before my next refi.\n\nI wonder what he used for collateral?\n\nThis is the way life usually goes for most of us. The big guys with their hands out are always the ones to get help. Whether it\u2019s big banker bailouts or regulatory get-out-of-jail-free cards, political loans or speakers fees, the little guy with only his pride and not much else doesn\u2019t stand a chance, especially in the farming game.\n\nTake beef for instance.\n\nWe just got our heads handed to us by Canada, a country with fewer residents than California. Canada is bilingual, they haven\u2019t even adopted English as their exclusive primary language, and they don\u2019t have a border fence.\n\nBut they have national healthcare better than Obamacare.\n\nThat\u2019s just sick.\n\nYet even while Canadians have their own law for country-of-origin labeling for beef they were able to defeat us in international courts and take away our right to do the same thing. Apparently, they have awfully good lawyers in Canada, eh Ted?\n\nThis has played right into the hands of foreign multinational corporations like Brazilian owned JBS and China\u2019s Smithfield Foods, as they blend our food around the world in ways we can no longer see, thanks to corporate hall passes and opaque one-sided trade agreements.\n\nAccording to free traders, it\u2019s OK for foreign governments to assume control of parts of our food industry (so long as they aren\u2019t stealing from another mega corporation). But what if state and national policy defended the rights of workers, family farmers, and rural communities as well as it has defended those corporations?\n\nNow that JBS controls a big part of the beef-packing industry, they\u2019re having problems and their bonds are almost junk. And China\u2019s slow down has affected stock and bond prices in America because international trade and bank profits are threatened. That\u2019s even as Smithfield tries to tear down more barriers to its business plan by defeating laws in Nebraska that protect family farmers. As usual, no one wants to talk about this, especially not corporate donation-dependent presidential candidates in farmy Iowa.\n\nBut in Canada they seem to be doing everything just right \u2014 except the oil boom.\n\nHow can good news be so bad? Low oil prices have affected the preferred Canadian vegetable, cauliflower, the price of which is up to $8 Canadian. That\u2019s because their currency value has fallen way below the U.S. dollar and their cauliflower comes from California. On the other hand, without country-of-origin labeling (COOL) their beef undercuts our beef to the same tune.\n\nCurrency value lets Canadian T-bones \u2014 and oil \u2014 come across the border at a significantly lower price than those U.S. products. We\u2019ve got the same thing going on with a lot of other trading partners, including China.\n\nUnder trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the newest one called Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP, we keep agreeing to do things against the best interests of our own people. Currencies are manipulated, jobs are outsourced, and big corporations hide profits offshore to avoid taxes that average American citizens have no choice but to pay.\n\nStudies of TPP are mixed, but most agree it will be years at best before Americans see an advantage. In the meantime, jobs will shift or disappear altogether, factories will close, and a significant number of U.S. workers will be destabilized as they seek new jobs wherever they can find them. That\u2019s the same scenario played out across the country in the past as our leaders hailed the new service economy and its low paying McJobs as corporate manufacturers expanded third-world sweat-shops making all the things Americans used to make.\n\nAgriculture and many farm groups chase these trade agreement jalopies like a delinquent dog off his leash. All they want to talk about is exports. But the fact is our biggest customer is right here at home. Trade agreements allow more foreign access to U.S. food markets than they grant new markets to U.S. farmers. We\u2019re always subject to quotas, manipulated monetary values, and restrictive policies built into trade agreements.\n\nAnd since food demand is inelastic (finite numbers of people only eat when they\u2019re hungry), food sales lost today are never made up.\n\nWhen worse trends toward worst, though we may weather the storms of unfair free trade and our economy does well, our stock market goes to pot taking a lot of retirement savings and equity with it when free-trade partners fall apart.\n\nThis I know for sure: An undeniable fact of weathering storms is that when cold winds blow, everyone wants in. The caulking gun and I have been around the outside of this old farm house more than once. In spite of that, come January a few field mice along with the occasional cat or dog sneak by. What with all the hunger and poverty in the world, when global markets crash, it\u2019s that way with people too.\n\nBaby, thanks to corporate-promoted and dominated free trade, it\u2019s cold outside.\n\nPart of the political talk going on now is about a fence to keep the field mice (also known as illegal immigrants) out of our national home. But even with illegal immigrants, our economy has managed to improve because immigrant mice put more into the pantry than they take. Anyhow, that fence won\u2019t happen because it\u2019s not like big business or big agriculture (fruit and vegetable production, meat packers, dairies, field workers, the guys who clean Wal-Mart, etc.) want to close the holes.\n\nImmigration never trashed the economy in the first place, and big business needs it like corn needs the rain.\n\nThose people come because they\u2019re willing to work long hours on the cheap, and corporate board rooms want them here. That\u2019s why U.S. trade policy does little or nothing to defend family farmers and laborers who earn less in a year than the typical corporate political contribution \u2014 or speaker\u2019s fee.\n\nCorporate board rooms want that too.\n\nBut what if our country allowed immigration and jobs here at our home to grow by not giving away our production and manufacturing advantage in the form of unequal corporate taxation, trade agreements, human rights, and currency manipulation? And what if all those workers who came here to punch up the work force, punched a time card instead and were legal, subject to open wage competition, and paid taxes including Social Security on their earnings? And what if a certain percentage of citizen workers weren\u2019t forced to start over every decade due to corporate outsourcing, relocating and start over with buying a house, saving for retirement, and paying for healthcare?\n\nOne last thing. What if all of them, and their elected government representatives, too, believed in buying labeled American products they made themselves?\n\nIf Ted came out in favor of that, I might loan him a buck or two myself.\n\nRichard Oswald, president the Missouri Farmers Union, is a fifth-generation farmer from Langdon, Missouri. \u201cLetter From Langdon\u201d is a regular feature of The Daily Yonder.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Baby, thanks to corporate-promoted and dominated free trade, it\u2019s cold outside.\nLetter from Langdon: Free Trade\u2019s Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose By Richard OswaldReaders who keep up with current events know that our front-running presidential candidates have something in common.\nUnder trade agreements, like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the newest one called Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP, we keep agreeing to do things against the best interests of our own people.\nIt is worth noting, however, that Hillary got her money up front but Canada-born Ted is on the hook for his.\nWhat if all of them, and their elected government representatives, too, believed in buying labeled American products they made themselves?"}
