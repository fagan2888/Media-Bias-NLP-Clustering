So with the 2014 midterm election rapidly disappearing in the rearview mirror, I thought I\u2019d reckon with my one big political mistake this past election cycle, as well as one big thing I got, sadly, right.\n\nIn July 2013, long before the midterm, I wrote this piece: \u201cRed state women will transform America.\u201d I was pretty darn excited about the prospect of Wendy Davis, Alison Lundergan Grimes and Michelle Nunn stepping up and running in Texas, Kentucky and Georgia. In hindsight \u2013 or maybe even at the time \u2013 I showed some irrational exuberance. So did a lot of Democrats.\n\nMaybe more significantly, I participated in wishful thinking shared by many more Democrats \u2013 believing that the women\u2019s vote is the party\u2019s ace in the hole and that, in addition to solid support from non-white voters, it will give them a lock on the White House, and will even turn red states blue over time. I\u2019m less optimistic about that now. The Democrats\u2019 continuing troubles with white women, and white married women, doomed all three once-promising white female Democratic candidates.\n\nOf course, none of them were perfect candidates. I will always be grateful for Davis\u2019s brave filibuster of horrible Texas anti-abortion legislation. But I overestimated her political skills. Reams have been written about her poor campaign; I don\u2019t need to kick her here. In the days before the election, silly #tcot folks tried to pretend I\u2019d written my Davis praise recently, not more than a year before the race. But I did get overexcited.\n\nLikewise, Grimes wasn\u2019t quite the pro I thought she was, although she had admirable political skills. Michelle Nunn, who actually came closest to being elected of the three, had little to recommend her besides her father\u2019s famous name and her detachment from partisan bickering thanks to a career in business, not politics.\n\nEven at the time, I overlooked what is still the tough reality of politics for women: Frequently, they get their big political breaks only when more experienced men size up a race and find it too dangerous. I still believe Texas will turn blue again, but state and national Democrats knew it wouldn\u2019t happen in 2014. In Kentucky, experienced pols like Rep. John Yarmuth and Gov. Steve Beshear didn\u2019t take on Mitch McConnell. And in Georgia, ambitious Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed knew he was at least a cycle too early for Georgia to turn blue.\n\nI\u2019m not blaming any of these men, by the way, for making the women in question sacrificial lambs or scapegoats. But the truth is, women often get their big \u201cchances\u201d when they run as sacrificial lambs. I should have reined in my optimism about their political potential much sooner.\n\nMy faith that white Democratic women could win over red state white women voters was particularly misplaced. CNN exit polls showed that Michelle Nunn lost white women to David Perdue 69-27; Wendy Davis lost them 66-31; Alison Grimes lost them 55-41. For now, the Democrats\u2019 oft-touted advantages with \u201cwomen\u201d \u2013 which should always be described as \u201call women except for white women\u201d \u2014 are outweighed by their difficulties with whites.\n\nRight now, for complicated historical, cultural and racial reasons, white women vote more like \u201cwhites\u201d \u2013 mostly Republican, though less than white men \u2013 and less like other women. Single white women and college-educated white women defy that trend more than others, but any 2016 prognosticating that relies on white women as Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret weapon shouldn\u2019t be trusted unless there\u2019s data behind it. And I haven\u2019t seen any.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No, red state women didn't save the party.
