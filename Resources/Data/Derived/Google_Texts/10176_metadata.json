The formula is supposed to pay health plans more for sicker patients and less for healthy people \u2014 but it often pays too much. Medicare Advantage plans now cover nearly 16 million seniors at an estimated cost to taxpayers of more than $150 billion last year.\n\nThe series also explained how the federal government has for years missed opportunities to corral overcharges and other billing errors tied to the abuse of risk scores. It painted a picture of the growing power of the Medicare Advantage industry and its sway over members of Congress. The series also foreshadows possible problems with the Affordable Care Act as it uses the risk score system.\n\nThe project was built from the reporting efforts of senior health care reporter Fred Schulte, an analysis of Medicare Advantage risk score data by former Center data editor David Donald and intern Erin Durkin, and interactives and visualizations by news developer Chris Zubak-Skees, who were individually cited as part of the award. The series was edited by executive editor Gordon Witkin.\n\nThe Center team spent months searching public records, including federal and state court records, and interviewing experts, health lawyers and data companies.\n\nJudges called the series \u201csuperb\u201d and noted that despite numerous obstacles, the Center's journalists \u201captly dissected the shocking shortcomings\u201d of the Medicare Advantage program. They noted that the explanation of the risk score system and the analysis of how it is manipulated was \u201cparticularly lucid.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Center\u2019s ground-breaking Medicare Advantage investigation named first-place winner of the 2014 Philip Meyer Journalism Award.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Center\u2019s Medicare Advantage Money Grab series wins Meyer Journalism Award", "og": {"site_name": "Center for Public Integrity", "description": "Center\u2019s ground-breaking Medicare Advantage investigation named first-place winner of the 2014 Philip Meyer Journalism Award.", "title": "Center\u2019s Medicare Advantage Money Grab series wins Meyer Journalism Award", "url": "https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/01/14/16605/center-s-medicare-advantage-money-grab-series-wins-meyer-journalism-award", "image": "https://static-00-www.publicintegrity.org/files/styles/12col/public/img/chris-and-fred.png?itok=KhcIOUMw", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://static-00-www.publicintegrity.org/files/styles/1x1-3col/public/img/chris-and-fred.png?itok=3Aw8-MYl", "site": "@Publici", "card": "summary", "creator": "@BGPublic"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-14T16:36:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 59300693, "app_id": 208489549167264}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/publici", "published_time": "2015-01-14T11:36:00-0500", "author": "https://www.publicintegrity.org/authors/william-gray", "section": "Inside Publici", "modified_time": "2015-01-15T08:28:10-0500", "tag": "Philip Meyer Journalism Award"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Medicare Advantage plans now cover nearly 16 million seniors at an estimated cost to taxpayers of more than $150 billion last year.\nIt painted a picture of the growing power of the Medicare Advantage industry and its sway over members of Congress.\nJudges called the series \u201csuperb\u201d and noted that despite numerous obstacles, the Center's journalists \u201captly dissected the shocking shortcomings\u201d of the Medicare Advantage program.\nA Center for Public Integrity investigation detailing questionable spending by private Medicare plans has been awarded the prestigious Philip Meyer Journalism Award for social science reporting.\nThe series, Medicare Advantage Money Grab, documented how Medicare Advantage plans, created more than a decade ago to control health care spending on the elderly, have instead wasted $70 billion dollars through manipulation of a tool called \u201crisk scores\u201d from 2008 through 2013."}
