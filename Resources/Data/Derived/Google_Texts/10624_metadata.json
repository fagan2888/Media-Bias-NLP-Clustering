Ben Cardin (D-Md.) talk about foreign relations and domestic policy.\n\nComing just hours before Congress was scheduled to return from a five-week vacation, Cardin\u2019s address headlined the opening dinner of the BHC brotherhood\u2019s 96th year.\n\nCardin, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened his talk by discussing the recent conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe de-militarization of Gaza must be one of Congress\u2019 top priorities this session, said Cardin. The United Nations is \u201canything but objective when it comes to these accusations,\u201d he added, referring to the international organization\u2019s criticism of Israel. Consequently, he suggested NATO be tasked with the de-militarization process.\n\nCardin later elaborated on his criticism of the U.N. when, after the floor opened for questions, a dinner attendee asked why the U.S. did not just leave the organization.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the U.N. is just horrible to Israel,\u201d said Cardin. Part of the reason behind the international body\u2019s harshness toward Israel, he suggested, has to do with the religious and cultural makeup of the U.N.\n\n\u201cThey do that because there are more Muslims in the world than there are Jews,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Cardin pointed out, he will be on the next Senate delegation to the U.N. and he wants to address this hostility\n\n\u201cThere must be a price to pay for countries that blindly follow this anti-Israel sentiment in the United Nations,\u201d he charged. Another major topic of conversation was healthcare.\n\n\u201cWas it perfect? No,\u201d Cardin said of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act last fall. But the ACA will not be repealed, he continued, so Democrats and Republicans will need to find a way to cross party lines and work together to make sure the American people receive the maximum benefit.\n\nOne dinner attendee who also works at a local hospital asked Cardin about Maryland\u2019s health care wavier, which rewards hospitals for keeping people out of the hospital rather than tying funding to the volume of people admitted. The questioner charged that the new system essentially requires hospitals to cut their budget every year.\n\nCardin responded by defending the waiver, which he played a role in approving while he was still in the Maryland state legislature.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going to play out? I\u2019m not sure, because there\u2019s risk factors,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we do it right, we\u2019re going to be a model for the whole rest of the country.\u201d\n\nAnother questioner asked about the criticism President Barack Obama has faced from many in the Jewish community over Israel. In recent months, some have accused Obama of being unsupportive of Israel and an August survey by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press revealed that 45 percent of Republicans believe Obama had been favoring the Palestinian side too much over the course of the summer conflict.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand,\u201d Cardin told the brotherhood and their guests.\n\nHe said he has talked to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and that the leader has been nothing but pleased with Obama\u2019s handling of the situation.\n\nHe added that part of the fuel contributing to the anti-Obama fire might be politicians and partisans trying to use the international conflict to advance their own politics.\n\nCardin was 96th in a long line of past speakers at BHC that include people from all kinds of professions, from politicians to sports personalities to religious figures. While brotherhoods are struggling to maintain membership in other parts of the country, the men of BHC\u2019s brotherhood say their organization is thriving.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful comradery,\u201d said Ira Kolman, a past-president of the brotherhood. The group has seen numbers drop in the past few decades, but has still stayed strong in comparison to other brotherhoods, he said.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t help but to become embedded,\u201d past brotherhood president Joe Boccuzzi said of the effect of becoming involved in the organization. \u201cIn the end, you have a tie to the Jewish community.\u201d\n\nhnorris@jewishtimes.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://jewishtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/091214_cardin-sm.jpg"}, "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Baltimore Jewish Times", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://jewishtimes.com/28059/cardin-opens-brotherhood-calendar/news/local-news/", "article_author_name": "Michael Jankovitz", "image": "http://jewishtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/091214_cardin-sm.jpg", "site_id": "1ecfd5bf5145368b2e27a3c31c39063d", "article_published_time": "2014-09-11T14:51:04+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T15:42:18+00:00", "keywords": "local news", "wp_version": "7.6.1.9"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou can\u2019t help but to become embedded,\u201d past brotherhood president Joe Boccuzzi said of the effect of becoming involved in the organization.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand,\u201d Cardin told the brotherhood and their guests.\nCardin, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, opened his talk by discussing the recent conflict in Gaza.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the U.N. is just horrible to Israel,\u201d said Cardin.\nThe United Nations is \u201canything but objective when it comes to these accusations,\u201d he added, referring to the international organization\u2019s criticism of Israel."}
