That sentiment has manifested itself on the campaign trail in a populist conviction reflected in the major candidates\u2019 positions on topics including trade agreements and Wall Street regulation.\n\n\u201cThey may not come out and criticize Obama, but they\u2019ll all be saying, \u2018This hasn\u2019t been a good recovery for most people,\u2019 \u201d said Dean Baker, an economist and a co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nMrs. Clinton reflects the party\u2019s tack to the left on domestic issues.\n\nLast week, she said she could not support Mr. Obama\u2019s signature trade pact, the Trans Pacific Partnership, which she had championed as secretary of state and which Mr. Sanders had come out forcefully against. She has also proposed doing away with the so-called Cadillac tax on certain health care plans, aligning herself with labor unions on dismantling a key part of Mr. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Mr. Sanders has also taken aim at the law, saying it does not go far enough to make health insurance affordable for many Americans.\n\nPhoto\n\nAfter much criticism from party liberals that the Obama administration did not do enough to punish the Wall Street executives responsible for the financial crisis, Mrs. Clinton on Thursday included in her proposal to regulate Wall Street this clear message: \u201cWhen people commit crimes on Wall Street, they will be prosecuted and imprisoned.\u201d\n\nThat stood out as a break with the White House, which \u201cbasically took a pass when it came to prosecuting anyone from the financial crises,\u201d Mr. Baker said.\n\nWhile the emphasis on economic populism can be attributed partly to the nature of a Democratic primary contest, during which candidates try to woo labor unions and the liberal activist base, polls show that there is a broader frustration among voters about income inequality. Sixty-one percent of Americans said they believed only a few people at the top had a chance to get ahead in today\u2019s economy, and 66 percent said income and wealth in the United States should be more evenly distributed, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll from June.\n\n\u201cThe American public is anxious and angry and ready for very deep reform across kitchen table issues,\u201d said Felicia Wong, the president and chief executive of the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on in the electorate right now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLast week, Mr. Obama hosted a White House summit meeting on how to lift middle-class wages, and at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Saturday, he said one of the problems that had not been fully solved during his administration was \u201cthe fact that wages and incomes for ordinary Americans are still flat.\u201d\n\nBut aides point to his plan on college affordability and his efforts to raise the minimum wage, expand overtime pay, and make child care more affordable and accessible.\n\n\u201cIn terms of helping middle-class families meet their biggest budgetary stresses, I think Obama has been there,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t gone as far in that space as what the candidates are proposing,\u201d Mr. Bernstein added, \u201cbut he\u2019s gone part of the way.\u201d\n\nJosh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said in a briefing last week that Mr. Obama \u201cunderstands that it is the responsibility of individual candidates to distinguish themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat means distinguishing themselves from their competitors,\u201d Mr. Earnest continued. \u201cAnd in some cases, that means distinguishing themselves from the current occupant of the office.\u201d\n\nBut if the substance of Mr. Obama\u2019s policies will be indirectly debated on Tuesday, so will his style and the criticism that he has not tried hard enough to work with his political opponents.\n\nWithout mentioning the president, Mrs. Clinton often promotes her ability to work with congressional Republicans, a theme she is likely to lean on heavily in the Tuesday debate. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a pretty dysfunctional mess in Washington,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said at a recent rally in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nFirst Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday.\n\n\u201cBut I worked across the aisle as a senator for eight years,\u201d she added. \u201cI worked with Republicans as secretary of state. I know there is no substitute for working hard every single day to find common ground.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWilliam A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to Bill Clinton, said the candidates would face added pressure to explain precisely how they would move past the bipartisan dysfunction that defined the current administration.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had two presidents over a period of nearly 16 years who have failed on what was arguably the central promise of both their campaigns,\u201d Mr. Galston said, referring to Mr. Obama and George W. Bush. \u201cTo bring a divided country back together.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Obama is more broadly popular than Mr. Bush was in the fall of 2007, when the country began to take the measure of those who would succeed him.\n\nThat makes too pointed a repudiation of Mr. Obama\u2019s leadership risky for the Democratic candidates. The president, whose approval rating nationally is roughly 47 percent, enjoys loyal support from key constituencies: African-Americans, who make up a central bloc in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s support, and college-educated white liberals, an important group for Mr. Sanders.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Obama defended his legacy in an interview with CBS News\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d saying he was \u201cvery proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished, and it makes me think I\u2019d love to do some more.\u201d When asked whether he would be elected for a third term if allowed to run, Mr. Obama answered with an unequivocal \u201cyes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20151011204601, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, the major candidates for
