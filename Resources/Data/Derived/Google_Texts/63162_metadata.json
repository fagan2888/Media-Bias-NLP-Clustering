Just 16 students a year are admitted. Under a budget restructuring process initiated in February by Berkeley\u2019s Chancellor Nicholas Dirks, the School of Public Health must cut expenses by roughly three percent \u2014 or about $900,000.\n\nOne of the items on the list to meet that target is closure of the JMP. Losing 16 new doctors a year may not sound dramatic, but this particular population is unusual in medicine. While most medical students head into lucrative specialties, the majority of JMP graduates go into primary care.\n\nJohn Balmes, acting director of the program, says California needs these doctors. \u201c(California) is 43rd in the nation in terms of primary care physicians,\u201d he said, \u201cand with the Affordable Care Act increasing the number of insured Californians, we need more primary care physicians, not less.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, just 12 percent of medical students nationally went into primary care residencies. The JMP was above 50 percent 1997-2014. It\u2019s unclear exactly why so many students go into primary care. One clue lies in the program\u2019s unusual approach to curriculum.\n\nThe program, established in 1971, prides itself on avoiding lecture halls and instead focusing on what it calls \u201cproblem-based learning,\u201d where students review cases as a group. In addition, the medical program is one of few nationally, says second-year student Josh Pepper, that is housed within a school of public health, and that gives a broader focus to patients\u2019 lives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly having to question how things like socio-economic status, insurance, housing and culture and addiction play a role in patients\u2019 health outcomes,\u201d Pepper said.\n\nIt gives a more holistic perspective, he said. \u201cWe develop a whole skill set you don\u2019t normally get at a traditional medical school.\u201d Pepper has helped launch an online petition in support of the program.\n\nIt\u2019s called a joint medical program because students do three years at Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health, during which they complete an original research project and the first two years of medical school curriculum. They then head to UC San Francisco for two years of clinical rotation. They graduate with a master\u2019s in science from Cal and an M.D. from UCSF.\n\nA report earlier this year commissioned by the California Primary Care Association detailed the shortfall in primary care providers in California. The state\u2019s ratio of primary care physicians in its Medicaid program, called Medi-Cal, is roughly half the federal recommendation, it said. By 2030, the analysis predicted a shortage of more than 8,000 primary care doctors.\n\nCarmela Castellano-Garcia is the association\u2019s president and bemoaned the possible closure of Cal\u2019s medical program.\n\n\u201cCertainly with the shortage we are facing, we should not eliminate any existing programs that we know have successful track records into funneling people into primary care,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot afford that at this time.\u201d\n\nAll of Cal\u2019s professional schools, including the School of Public Health, must trim expenses by the same rate, said Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university, and it\u2019s up to the schools themselves to determine how to meet the target.\n\nLinda Anderberg, director of communications for the School of Public Health, said it is considering several options to achieve the budget cuts. \u201cThe school does not want to lose the (medical) program,\u201d she said.\n\nShe stressed that no decisions have been made and that the process would be completed during the summer. Most of the cuts would not go into effect until 2018, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, staff and students are speaking out to try to save the program.\n\n\u201cIf I had to go to medical school all over again, I\u2019d want to do it in the Joint Medical Program,\u201d said acting director Balmes. He said there\u2019s an advantage to being in a small, supportive environment.\n\n\u201cI think that translates into very fine doctors, because they\u2019re good human beings as well as good doctors,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlike most medical schools, the majority of Cal's students go into primary care, much needed in California.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Budget Cuts Threaten UC Berkeley's Medical Program\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/04\\/22\\/budget-cuts-threaten-uc-berkeleys-medical-program\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-22 00:04:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-04-26 14:11:09\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":175454,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Primary Care\",\"Primary Care Shortage\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/04\\/RS8759_ucberkeley20140213-e1461304868569.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Unlike most medical schools, the majority of Cal's students go into primary care, much needed in California.", "title": "Budget Cuts Threaten UC Berkeley\u2019s Medical Program", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/04/22/budget-cuts-threaten-uc-berkeleys-medical-program/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/04/RS8759_ucberkeley20140213-1440x959.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,primary care,primary care shortage", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Budget woes at UC Berkeley could force the shut down of a program many people are unaware of \u2014 its medical program.\nA report earlier this year commissioned by the California Primary Care Association detailed the shortfall in primary care providers in California.\n\u201cIf I had to go to medical school all over again, I\u2019d want to do it in the Joint Medical Program,\u201d said acting director Balmes.\nThe Joint Medical Program (JMP), part of Berkeley\u2019s School of Public Health, is small.\nCarmela Castellano-Garcia is the association\u2019s president and bemoaned the possible closure of Cal\u2019s medical program."}
