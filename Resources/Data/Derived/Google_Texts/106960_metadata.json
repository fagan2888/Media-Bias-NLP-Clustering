The last question shows that Mosley outpolled Chaney, 383 to 340, in response to the question: \u201cIf the election for Mississippi Insurance Commissioner were held today, who would you most likely be supporting?\u201d\n\nPerry said that Chaney is \u201cno shrinking violet,\u201d and could strike back.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act of 2010, otherwise known as Obamacare, the federal government gave states the option to set up their own health-insurance exchanges whereby poverty level residents and others would be able to buy coverage at a discount.\n\nOnly 17 states opted to do that, the others defaulting to the federal government or forming \u201cpartnerships\u201d with it.\n\nChaney said in a telephone interview on Friday he had \u201cpushed\u201d for a state-based health insurance exchange instead of a federal exchange, \u201cwhich we now have in the state. I refused to do a partnership with the feds simply because we end up handling all their problems for them.\n\n\u201cI still answer the questions. And we get a host of questions. You can\u2019t tell people: that\u2019s not our business, call Wasshington, D.C.\u201d\n\nGov. Phil Bryant had \u201cbeen on board, saying we needed a state-based exchange,\u201d then changed his mind.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Phil, I\u2019m so far down the road with what we\u2019re doing I don\u2019t think I can say that I won\u2019t do anything, but what I can say . . . is that I don\u2019t think we can do anything till after the elections [in November 2012].\u2019\u201d\n\nAccused at a Tupelo gathering of being for Obamacare, he said he was not and said he told his accuser and the rest of the 200 or so in attendance that \u201cif you don\u2019t want Obamacare you need to vote for my man Romney.\u201d\n\nA YouTube posting on Aug. 1, 2013 by the Mississippi Republican Party showed Chaney saying:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of Obamacare . . . I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good law, but it is my job as commissioner to enforce the law and do the right thing for the people of Mississippi. The act may fall apart, but you better be prepared with a plan in case it doesn\u2019t fall apart.\u201d\n\nChaney also set up an exchange for small businesses to buy health insurance for their employees. The exchange is still in operation. Chaney spokesman Joseph Ammerman had incorrectly said in an earlier article that exchange was defunct.\n\nMosley has been critical of Chaney for taking campaign contributions from \u201cbig\u201d insurance companies. Chaney was quoted as saying in a Mississippi Business Journal article in the March 19 edition that he did not accept donations from big insurers.\n\nHe said that quote was not in proper context.\n\nOn Monday, he said: \u201cIf it\u2019s legal to take money I\u2019ll take it.\u201d The Travelers Insurance group donated $5,000 to Chaney\u2019s campaign this year. Chaney said he does not have regulatory authority over those insurers.\n\nIn the March 19 article, Chaney that \u201cif I see where I have to regulate somebody who has given me money, I\u2019ll refuse it.\u201d\n\nMosley seized on that statement and on Monday sent The Journal a copy of a letter from Chaney to an insurance agent asking for a \u201cminimum of $200.00\u201d as a contribution to his campaign to help modernize the department. \u201cI do realize times are tight, and if you cannot write a check for $200.00, I\u2019d ask you to consider a smaller contribution.\u201d\n\nPamela Weaver, spokesman for the Secretary of State\u2019s office, said that \u201cthere is no law that speaks to that.\u201d Also, Tom Hood, director of the Mississippi Ethics Commission, said that \u201cit\u2019s certainly not an ethics violation.\u201d\n\nChaney\u2019s campaign consultant, Beth Hamilton, confirmed on Wednesday that the letters did indeed come from his camp.\n\nChaney said in a interview on Monday that \u201cwhen I say \u2018regulate,\u2019 you have to understand the terms of what I\u2019m talking about. If that\u2019s someone we\u2019re investigating . . . we will not take money from them. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nChaney, a former member of the Mississippi House and Senate, had a huge lead in money-raising as of the May 8 filing deadline. His cash on hand was $338,089.43, compared with Mosley\u2019s $20,674.60.\n\nMosley, who owns Clinton Body Shop, is one of the litigants in a multijurisdictional case in the U.S. District Court for Middle Florida, in which hundreds of body shops in a number of states are are suing insurers over alleged \u201csteering\u201d of customers to certain body shops that are pressured to replace damaged vehicles with aftermarket parts of inferior quality.\n\nMosley said that if elected he will ask the Legislature to ban contributions from insurers to an insurance commissioner candidate and also toughen rules about replacement of auto parts.\n\nThe winner of the primary will be the next insurance commissioner, as there is no Democratic candidate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Mississippi Business Journal", "description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0\r\n\r\nA poll commissioned by John Mosley puts him, a challenger to two-term ...", "title": "Poll puts insurance challenger in good light, but expert says it\u2019s flawed", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://msbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Government-feature_rgb-620x330.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-22T07:11:31-05:00", "url": "http://msbusiness.com/2015/05/poll-puts-insurance-challenger-in-good-light-but-expert-says-its-flawed/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mbjournal", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "Tupelo", "published_time": "2015-05-21T10:21:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T07:11:31-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "By JACK WEATHERLY\u00a0 A poll commissioned by John Mosley puts him, a challenger to two-term Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney, in a good light.
