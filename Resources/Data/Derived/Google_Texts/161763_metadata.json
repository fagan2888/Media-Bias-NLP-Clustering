Ted Cruz sat for a 17 minute interview with MSNBC host Christ Matthews during the Wednesday edition of\n\n\u201cHardball\u201d to promote his new memoir.\n\nWhen Matthews pushed Cruz on his radical idea to amend the Constitution to require Supreme Court justices to face judicial retention elections, the topic quickly turned to Cruz\u2019s work on George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 Florida recount effort:\n\nMATTHEWS: As you would say, it\u2019s in the book. I really think it\u2019s important to read it. Now you\u2019re for retention elections. You\u2019ve had to raise a ton of money to run for president, and you\u2019re definitely in the running. You\u2019ll be in the debates and everything. Should judges have to go out and raise $37 billion to run for reelection? How can you put judges out there and make them politicians? CRUZ: Listen\u2026 MATTHEWS: They won\u2019t be an independent judiciary. CRUZ: I am reluctant to call for retention elections. It makes me sad. MATTHEWS: But you\u2019ve done it! CRUZ: But I have done it because I believe that a majority of the justices are not honoring their judicial oaths. And\u2026 MATTHEWS: Is that the solution, elections? CRUZ: Look, if unelected judges are going to seize every major policy issue of this country \u2014 you know, there was a time\u2026 MATTHEWS: They seized the presidency in 2000 and you did not complain! The Supreme Court said no to the state of Florida. You can\u2019t recount! Even though it\u2019s a close election, you are not allowed to recount. We\u2019re giving this to our guy, 5 to 4 Republican vote in the Supreme Court. If there was ever a case of partisanship or ideology getting out of hand, it was 2000, and you loved it!", "article_metadata": {"description": "The presidential contender couldn't weasel his way out of this one -- but he tried  VIDEO", "title": "Watch Chris Matthews\u2019s epic smackdown of Ted Cruz in all its glory", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The presidential contender couldn't weasel his way out of this one -- but he tried  VIDEO", "title": "Watch Chris Matthews\u2019s epic smackdown of Ted Cruz in all its glory", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/09/watch_chris_matthewss_epic_smackdown_of_ted_cruz_in_all_its_glory/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/ted_cruz15.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The presidential contender couldn't weasel his way out of this one -- but he tried  VIDEO", "title": "Watch Chris Matthews\u2019s epic smackdown of Ted Cruz in all its glory", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/ted_cruz15.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2000 Election, Al Gore, Chris Matthews, George W.
