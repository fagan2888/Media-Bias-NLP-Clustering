Larry Bucshon (R-Ind.) and Daniel Lipinski (D-Ill.) secured the support of major industry groups and dozens of their House colleagues. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously passed their bill Thursday, just a week after it was introduced. It\u2019s slated for a House vote Wednesday, just 13 days after introduction. That success aside, what they most wanted was for FMCSA to go on record in favor of a rule making \u2014 and that\u2019s just what they got.\n\n( WATCH: Obamacare: Kentucky roll-out begins)\n\n\u201cA lot of times in Washington, D.C., if you get both political parties to agree on something that\u2019s very practical, you can move things more quickly,\u201d Bucshon said in an interview.\n\n\u201cThe speed surprised me a little bit. But I think it shows that things can happen quickly, can get done here,\u201d Lipinski told POLITICO. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten so used to everything getting bogged down. Even sometimes when there is bipartisan agreement, things still get bogged down, but it also shows that the Transportation Committee is working well now.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s momentum doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing \u2014 Bucshon said House leadership has told him the measure will come to the floor under suspension of the rules, a procedure used to fast track largely noncontroversial legislation.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: President Obama: Wife stopped my smoking)\n\nThough the lawmakers took only modest credit for their bill having prompted FMCSA\u2019s announcement, their colleagues were more effusive in their praise. Even during Thursday\u2019s markup, which was dominated by a major water resources bill, several committee members took the time to praise the duo and say the bill inspired FMCSA\u2019s action.\n\n\u201cI think the action of the committee has already produced the result we intended,\u201d said D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the top Democrat on the highways panel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to believe some of it is,\u201d Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) told POLITICO when asked if the bill prompted FMCSA to change course. \u201cBeing bipartisan can be a powerful force.\u201d\n\nAfter the bill was introduced, FMCSA initially committed to act \u201cthrough a public notice and comment process.\u201d That addressed one of the concerns from lawmakers \u2014 that industry groups wouldn\u2019t be able to weigh in.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: President Obama, Bill Clinton kick off health care rollout)\n\nBut the night before the markup, an FMCSA official contacted POLITICO with a more definitive statement, saying the agency will act \u201cthrough the formal rule-making process after collecting and analyzing the necessary data and research.\u201d\n\nBucshon and Lipinski both said they were pleased with FMCSA\u2019s commitment to rule making but still plan to press ahead with their legislation.\n\nThey had plenty of help from their fellow lawmakers, but Bucshon and Lipinski also had the trucking industry, a hefty force, behind them. The American Trucking Associations and other groups had recently written to lawmakers in support of the bill.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to thank Reps. Bucshon and Lipinski, as well as all our supporters in the House, for moving this important bill forward,\u201d ATA President and CEO Bill Graves said in a statement after committee passage. \u201cWhile FMCSA has said they are receptive to a rule-making process in lieu of sleep apnea guidance, we urge the House and Senate to follow through with swift approval\u201d of the bill. The American Bus Association also put out a statement in support.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nThe sleep apnea bill is child\u2019s play compared with the heavy legislative lifts the committee faces next year with writing a new surface transportation bill just as the Highway Trust Fund is going broke and needs tens of billions of extra dollars to maintain current spending levels.\n\nShuster, however, isn\u2019t worried about that just yet.\n\n\u201cWe have some tougher issues that are going to come up, but I think this sets a precedent for working together,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Legislation requiring professional drivers to be tested for the disorder unites the parties.", "title": "Sleep apnea bill awakens Congress", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/sleep-apnea-bill-bipartisanship-congress-97235.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/09/23/132313_sleep_sleeping_rts_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Daniel Lipinski (6),Larry Bucshon (8),Bipartisanship (199),House Transportation And Infrastructure Committee (27),Congress (2784)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Legislation requiring professional drivers to be tested for the disorder unites the parties.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c21\"", "article_summary": "| REUTERS Sleep apnea bill awakens CongressThe tale of a sleep apnea bill shows what just might be the most efficient Congress has been in years.\nThe sleep apnea bill\u2019s momentum doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing on Capitol Hill.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to believe some of it is,\u201d Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) told POLITICO when asked if the bill prompted FMCSA to change course.\nThe House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously passed their bill Thursday, just a week after it was introduced.\n\u201cWhile FMCSA has said they are receptive to a rule-making process in lieu of sleep apnea guidance, we urge the House and Senate to follow through with swift approval\u201d of the bill."}
