Among the Republicans involved in the effort, the aide said, are Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Mike Lee of Utah, Ted Cruz of Texas and David Vitter of Louisiana.\n\nSessions and Sasse both expressed opposition to the House-passed bill before senators left for their two-week recess, citing the fact that it\u2019s not fully paid for. The measure would replace the oft-criticized formula Medicare uses to pay physicians known as the sustainable growth rate, or SGR, which would otherwise dictate reimbursement cuts of 21 percent this month.\n\nThe Senate is expected to turn to the measure quickly next week, having punted on addressing it after a marathon series of votes on the chamber's fiscal 2016 budget resolution (S Con Res 11). The House passed the bill to replace the SGR on March 26 in an overwhelming 392-37 vote.\n\nDan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action for America, said he thinks striking the exemption from pay-as-you-go rules seems to be the \u201cmost viable path\u201d given the compressed timeframe for action. His group opposes the House-passed bill because it\u2019s not fully offset, but he said it\u2019s very unlikely Congress will come together quickly and settle on changes to entitlement programs to cover the rest of the cost.\n\nThe temporary payment patch (PL 113-93) averting cuts to Medicare doctors dictated by the formula formally expired March 31, but the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is holding claims so doctors don't feel the cuts until April 15. With senators returning the afternoon of April 13, that leaves the Senate with only a couple of days to get the bill done.\n\nStripping out the pay-as-you-go exemption in the House bill would result in sequester cuts next year unless the additional spending was offset later this year.\n\nHoller also said conservatives are trying to refute the idea that the legislation saves money. In a March 25 blog post, Speaker John A. Boehner\u2019s office said the Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the measure \u201cwill save taxpayers money and put the nation\u2019s budget on a more sustainable path,\u201d because it costs $900 million less than freezing physician payment rates. The CBO also projected that the measure would add $141 billion to the deficit through fiscal 2025.\n\nOther Options\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said striking the pay-as-you-go exemption is one way to improve the bill. Alternatively, he said, senators could also add offsets to cover the price tag or strengthen the bill over the long term by making some temporary cuts in the bill permanent, in order to reap additional savings.There\u2019s also the option of scrapping the House deal and passing another short-term \"doc fix\" deal to avert the scheduled fee cuts.\n\nGoldwein noted that he thinks many senators are concerned about the cost even though they want to dispense with the \u201cdoc fix\u201d and the threat of physicians dropping out of Medicare.\n\n\u201cI think if there was more time it would be easier,\u201d he said.\n\nBut eliminating the pay-as-you-go provision could offer a workable solution to potential threats by conservatives to oppose the bill. It would give Congress until the end of the year to come up with more offsets, allowing the SGR bill to pass as is after the exemption is deleted.\n\nThat means the Ways and Means and Finance committees could explore ways to offset the spending through the regular committee process in coming months.\n\nUnder the 2010 PAYGO law (PL 111-139), across-the-board sequester cuts are required to eliminate any increase in the deficit caused by legislation that raises the cost of mandatory spending programs or tax cuts that are not paid for. The cuts would reduce Medicare spending by up to 4 percent and other mandatory spending that is not exempt from sequester.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that the senators who are formulating a strategy on the SGR could attempt to use as leverage a threat not to vote for a conferenced version of the fiscal 2016 budget resolution. The Senate adopted its budget with 52 Republican yes votes before the recess. Two Republicans voted no \u2014 Cruz and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The budget needs a simple majority to be adopted in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate budget resolution contemplates trillions of dollars in reductions in spending growth with the goal of eliminating the deficit within 10 years.\n\nHouse and Senate leaders are expected to appoint budget conferees next week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "", "title": "Conservatives Push for Fully Paid 'Doc Fix' Deal", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/conservatives_push_for_fully_paid_doc_fix_deal-241116-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-04-08T19:30:06Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-08T19:30:06Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T19:30:06Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/conservatives_push_for_fully_paid_doc_fix_deal-241116-1.html", "description": "", "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "Conservatives Push for Fully Paid 'Doc Fix' Deal"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b66\"", "article_summary": "The Senate budget resolution contemplates trillions of dollars in reductions in spending growth with the goal of eliminating the deficit within 10 years.\nSessions and Sasse both expressed opposition to the House-passed bill before senators left for their two-week recess, citing the fact that it\u2019s not fully paid for.\nA Senate conservative aide said senators are considering offering an amendment to require the bill (HR 2) to be fully offset.\nBut eliminating the pay-as-you-go provision could offer a workable solution to potential threats by conservatives to oppose the bill.\nStripping out the pay-as-you-go exemption in the House bill would result in sequester cuts next year unless the additional spending was offset later this year."}
