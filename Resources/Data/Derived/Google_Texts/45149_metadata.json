The Avalanche combined those things with resiliency Saturday night in a 3-2 triumph against the Nashville Predators.\n\nRookie forward Andreas Martinsen used a midair backhand shot to break a third-period tie as Colorado held on behind goalie Semyon Varlamov (34 saves) at Bridgestone Arena.\n\nMartinsen, one of two Norwegian-born players in the NHL, called his second career big-league goal \u201cugly,\u201d but there was definitely some skill involved.\n\n\u201cI saw it midair and thought, \u2018Might as well give it a try.\u2019 I hit it, and it went in,\u201d Martinsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good feeling when you score goals like that.\u201d\n\nDefensemen Francois Beauchemin (power play) and Nick Holden had Colorado\u2019s first two goals.\n\nThe Avs \u2014 now 5-2 against Central Division foes \u2014 were 5-of-5 on the penalty kill and scored on one of their five power plays. It was a great start to a three-game, all-Central Division road trip that continues Sunday at St. Louis for a late-afternoon clash against the Blues. The trip concludes Tuesday at Chicago against the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks.\n\n\u201cVarly was outstanding and the guys in the PK did a (good) job tonight,\u201d said Avs winger Matt Duchene, who had a game-high seven shots and provided the screen on Beauchemin\u2019s goal that made it 1-0. \u201cSpecial teams have lost us some games this year, but tonight they won us this game.\u201d\n\nThe Predators, who were 9-1-1 in their previous 11 home games against the Avalanche, tied it 2-2 in the first minute of the third period. But the Preds never led and were continually frustrated by Varlamov.\n\n\u201cHe was really good,\u201d Avs coach Patrick Roy said of Varlamov. \u201cHe made some really key saves, especially in the PK. But I\u2019d like to say our guys played well in front of him. Our D\u2019s were sharp. Our breakout was good.\u201d\n\nBeauchemin opened the scoring 8:37 into the game. On the power play, the defenseman\u2019s slap shot from the left point beat goalie Pekka Rinne inside the near post.\n\nColorado (13-16-1) doubled the lead at 14:38, when Holden capped a terrific tic-tac-toe play with forwards John Mitchell and Alex Tanguay. Holden buried Tanguay\u2019s no-look back pass from the back door.\n\nThe Avs\u2019 near-flawless first period was partly ruined when Nashville got a fortunate bounce off the skate of Miikka Salomaki, who was providing traffic in front of Varlamov. The goal came just 7.7 seconds before the end of the period.\n\nColorado committed four of the six penalties in the second period, but the consecutive infractions by Duchene (boarding), Jarome Iginla (hooking) and Cody McLeod (high-sticking) weren\u2019t costly.\n\n\u201cOur PK was really good. Guys blocked shots and were very disciplined in our structure,\u201d Roy said.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or Twitter: @MikeChambers\n\nCOLORADO AT ST.
