The goal now is to raise $50,000.\n\n\u201cWe think $50,000 might do a nice memorial,\u201d said Aurora City Councilwoman Barb Cleland, a member of the Reflection Memorial Garden committee. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if that\u2019s enough. We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe plan for the memorial garden would be to extend the current xeriscape garden at the Aurora Municipal Center, adding benches, artwork, sculptures and pathways. The idea is to provide a serene place for survivors, family members and the community to reflect and remember the victims.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how those plans will change given the lower projected budget, officials said.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, outreach to potential individual donors has been lacking. But as the three-year anniversary of the July 20, 2012, massacre \u2014 in which 12 were killed and 70 wounded \u2014 nears, fundraising efforts are ramping up.\n\nMegan Sullivan, whose brother, Alex, died in the shooting, said maybe the tragedy isn\u2019t in the forefront of people\u2019s minds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not getting the response we would have hoped for \u2014 that\u2019s both through outreach and with business donations,\u201d said Sullivan, who is also on the memorial garden committee.\n\nCity spokeswoman Kim Stuart, also a member of the committee, said commercials began airing on Comcast network-TV stations and Aurora TV in May. Social media has also been used to bring attention to the 7/20 Memorial Foundation fund.\n\nThe effort is expanding to include letters and phone calls and meetings with individuals and organizations, Stuart said.\n\nIt took more than eight years for a permanent memorial for the Columbine High School shooting, which happened in 1999. The memorial was dedicated in 2007.\n\nAurora Mayor Steve Hogan said he had hoped fundraising would have started a little sooner. But he said it was important to give the families of those killed or wounded enough time to grieve.\n\nHe will reach out Sunday to churchgoers of the Highpoint Church in Aurora. Its pastor, he said, feels it is important to bring the fundraising message to parishioners there.\n\n\u201cI think what we were trying to do was balance the needs and desires of the families of the victims and move forward at a pace they were comfortable with,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cEvery time I was asked about it, the word that came back was that the families weren\u2019t ready yet.\n\n\u201cEven though I wanted to do something sooner, they weren\u2019t ready yet \u2014 and if they\u2019re not ready yet, why force something upon them?\u201d\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or twitter.com/cillescasdp\n\nTo donate to the reflection memorial garden:\n\nLog onto https://npo.justgive.org/720memorial", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Memorial for Aurora Theater shooting victims scaled back financially", "title": "Memorial for Aurora Theater shooting victims scaled back financially", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/27/memorial-for-aurora-theater-shooting-victims-scaled-back-financially/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141211__century-16-theatre-aurora-filep1.jpg", "height": 429}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141211__century-16-theatre-aurora-filep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-27T19:34:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T01:30:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aurora Theater Shooting, Aurora Theater Shooting trial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0836\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe think $50,000 might do a nice memorial,\u201d said Aurora City Councilwoman Barb Cleland, a member of the Reflection Memorial Garden committee.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not getting the response we would have hoped for \u2014 that\u2019s both through outreach and with business donations,\u201d said Sullivan, who is also on the memorial garden committee.\nWe just don\u2019t know.\u201dThe plan for the memorial garden would be to extend the current xeriscape garden at the Aurora Municipal Center, adding benches, artwork, sculptures and pathways.\nAURORA \u2014 The fundraising effort for a permanent memorial to the victims and families of the Aurora theater shooting is going much slower than organizers envisioned, leading them to significantly lower the financial objective from the original $400,000 goal.\nIt took more than eight years for a permanent memorial for the Columbine High School shooting, which happened in 1999."}
