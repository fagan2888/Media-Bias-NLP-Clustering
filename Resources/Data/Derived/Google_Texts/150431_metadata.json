The first three ended in pain \u2014 one, literally. His freshman season, Iowa State lost in the second round. Last season, the Cyclones fell in the first round. When he was a sophomore, Georges couldn\u2019t play when the Cyclones reached the round of 16 because of a broken foot sustained in the tournament opener. \u201cI could only watch then, and the guys kidded me about not earning the right to be there. This year I\u2019ve definitely earned the right,\u201d he said after scoring 55 points, with 12 rebounds, in two games at The Can.\n\nLittle Rock coach Chris Beard said of Niang: \u201cHe\u2019s as good as advertised. He\u2019s going to play on TNT next year (in the NBA). He\u2019s a super player.\u201d\n\nNiang dominated in Denver. Years ago in the tournament in the same building, we witnessed phenomenal rebounding performances by a collegian named Kenneth Faried. We know where he ended up. I told Allison the 6-foot-8 Niang could be drafted, too, by the Nuggets.\n\n\u201cIs that why you asked me if I enjoyed being in Denver this week?\u201d Allison laughed. While in college, she met and married Sidy Niang, an emigrant from Senegal, but they separated when Georges was 5 and after father joined the U.S. Merchant Marine.\n\nNiang could have turned turn pro following his junior year, but mom and son agreed he would return to finish what he had started. \u201cActually, when I came back, it wasn\u2019t much of a decision. What Iowa State has given me, I could never walk away from a place like that,\u201d Niang said.\n\nEspecially with that new, improved body.\n\nBefore the foot injury, Georges had been a power forward. Think Charles Barkley. \u201cHe got up in the 260s,\u201d Allison said. During the summer when he went home to suburban Boston, Georges became a fitness freak. While he was dropping body fat and 40 pounds, his mother got into the act. She lost 20 pounds working out alongside him. Now, both are in excellent shape. \u201cIt was a collective effort,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cMy mom had sacrificed her happiness to go along with me. I can\u2019t thank her enough. She\u2019s my rock, my backbone.\u201d\n\nLed by Niang, the Cyclones cruised past Iona by 13 and Little Rock by 17. In a tournament that has seen more weird-and-wacky endings than \u201cCloverfield\u201d and \u201c10 Cloverfield Lane,\u201d Iowa State was eating pork tenderloin. \u201cWe weren\u2019t favored in either game,\u201d said coach Steve Prohm, in his first year at Iowa State.\n\nWell, Coach, you were a No. 4 seed. But top seeds have been spit out all over the floor during March Preposterous.\n\nNiang was having none of that, though. \u201cGeorges is a special person,\u201d his coach said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a huge part of the resurgence, the renaissance of Iowa State basketball. He\u2019s the winningest person in school history. He just represents the game the right way. The last two games, he\u2019s been unbelievable.\u201d\n\nGeorges obviously received a standing ovation when introduced at his last home game. But, get this: In his final appearance at Kansas, Georges also was given a standing O after the game.\n\n\u201cI was there, and those Kansas fans were terrific to him,\u201d Allison said. \u201cHe was embarrassed because he didn\u2019t want to take away from the Kansas seniors\u2019 night.\u201d\n\nGeorges was the class president in high school, the classy presence at Iowa State.\n\nOn the floor in his college career, he transformed from power forward to powerful guard. In the first half against Little Rock, he would dribble outside the arc and touch his right elbow. He was calling his own play. In five trips, he got nine points \u2014 and ended up making 11-of-18 shots, 3-of-3 beyond that arc.\n\nThis year Georges Niang has been a candidate for the Naismith award.\n\nFigures, given how he played the past two games down the street from where the good doctor who invented basketball once lived.\n\nWoody Paige: woody@woodypaige.com or @woodypaige", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Paige: Georges Niang might have made James Naismith proud", "title": "Paige: Georges Niang might have made James Naismith proud", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/paige-georges-niang-might-have-made-james-naismith-proud/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T22:08:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T01:45:36+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Woody Paige"}, "article_summary": "This year Georges Niang has been a candidate for the Naismith award.\nDr. James Naismith \u2014 who originated basketball, became the physical education director 110 years ago at the Denver YMCA and earned his medical title in Colorado \u2014 certainly would have appreciated how Georges Niang has advanced the game.\nLittle Rock coach Chris Beard said of Niang: \u201cHe\u2019s as good as advertised.\nShe\u2019s my rock, my backbone.\u201dLed by Niang, the Cyclones cruised past Iona by 13 and Little Rock by 17.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t favored in either game,\u201d said coach Steve Prohm, in his first year at Iowa State."}
