[Under the agreement,] the VA has reimbursed the IHS and tribal health programs to date about $12.5 million for health care provided to [American Indian Alaska Native] vets,\u201d she says. The reimbursement program supports providing care to American Indian veterans and serves as an access point to additional resources and benefits.\n\n\u201cYou may be a tribal health center beginning to have conversations about how can we become a facility that is more vet-centered. What training may be available from the VA for behavioral health providers so we can be more informed about different issues that are affecting our veterans? What kind of resources exist within VA that might be made available in Indian country?\u201d\n\nThe VA also brings other programs to Indian country. \u201cThrough the veterans benefits administration the Native American Direct Home Loan program makes mortgages available to veterans living [on tribal lands]. Vets can get loans to purchase a home, make improvements or construct new property,\u201d says Birdwell. The VA is actually the bank for the loan, so \u201cwe have a wide latitude and a lot of discretion to be creative and work with the veteran in the event that they need additional help in staying in their home. The VA loans have the lowest default rate of any mortgage product in the country. We are very committed to make sure veterans stay in their homes.\u201d\n\nThe office is also working to raise awareness among tribal leaders that veterans have earned the resources and benefits they can get through the VA. The agency keeps track, by county, of how much veterans bring to the community in terms of outside resources so that local governments and tribal leaders can see the direct economic impact of veterans on local economies and understand \u201chow important it is that we really advocate for veterans to be communicating with service officers to know who\u2019s who within the VA and have those conversations about how can we ensure that we are maximizing that resource for our veterans and for our tribal economies,\u201d Birdwell says.\n\nVeterans in the community, says Birdwell, contribute to economic stability in Indian country. \u201cWe want to make sure that veterans living in a tribal community know about and have access to the array of services and benefits that they\u2019re entitled to. We believe that veterans who are connected to the services and benefits they\u2019ve earned are better off financially and veterans and their families who are better off financially frequently serve on tribal councils and in tribal leadership roles. That also translates to more economic stability for the community as a whole.\u201d\n\nBirdwell says tribal leaders and individuals who want to find out more about what the VA offers should get in touch, either with the Washington office or with their local VA . The website for the Office of Tribal Government Relations is www.va.gov/tribalgovernment; local contacts are available there. Birdwell\u2019s phone number is (202) 461-4851 and her e-mail is StephanieElaine.Birdwell@va.gov.\n\nThe office invites all tribal leaders to participate in a conference call with the VA\u2019s new director, Bob McDonald, on October 23 from 3:30-4:30 p.m. EST. \u201cThis is an opportunity for tribal leaders to engage directly with the new secretary and have their voices be heard. The secretary is committed to ensuring that we reach all of our veterans.\u201d The address to register for the call is tribalgovernmentconsultation@va.gov. Registration is not mandatory. The call-in number 1-800-767-1750; the participation code is 64281.\n\nMcDonald will also be addressing the NCAI during the plenary session on October 27 in Atlanta. Finally, a tribal consultation is scheduled for November on the proposed realignment of services at the VA Hot Springs, South Dakota, facility.\n\nThis is the second in a series of articles introducing federal officials with portfolios in Indian country.\n\nRELATED: Just Ask Joe: Sarcinella Lead Contact for Defense Department\n\nRELATED: Meet DOE Tribal Energy Expert David Conrad\n\nRELATED: Going Into Business?
