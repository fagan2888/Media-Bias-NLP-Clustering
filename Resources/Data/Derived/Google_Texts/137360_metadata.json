(WIVB) \u2014 More than 60 million Americans who depend on Social Security as a form of income will not be seeing a cost-of-living increase for only the third time since 1975.\n\nTwo of those are Arlene Putnam and Bob Ball, of Blasdell.\n\nBall has spent the past several days filling out job applications, because it seems with this latest blow to his monthly check, he\u2019ll have to return to work at age 69.\n\nBall has been out of the workforce for two years after spending five decades as a salesman.\n\nAnd like millions of Americans in his situation, he paid into Social Security during his working years with the expectation of a promise the money would be there when he needed it.\n\nAfter surgeries on his heart and brain, and medications he takes to stay alive, he needs it now more than ever.\n\nInstead of spending his time in retirement how he chooses, Ball spends his days filling out applications, and attending job interviews.\n\nHe says it\u2019s not that he can\u2019t work. It\u2019s just that, after 50 years in the workforce, Ball says he shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\n\u201cI helped everybody. I helped my fellow workers,\u201d Ball said. \u201cNow, when I need help from the government, it\u2019s a different story.\n\n\u201cBut 1.8 (percent increase last year) and then nothing?\u201d he continued. \u201cTo us, this isn\u2019t a joke. It\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s a sad day when you put money in and they tell you they can\u2019t pay you back.\u201d\n\nBall says he has a few bites from prospective employers. And he\u2019s willing to do what it takes to make ends meet and to help provide a life for he and Arlene, who have been together for 23 years. But he believes at age 69, age isn\u2019t working in his favor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Will have to work after government decides against increase in Social Security", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "Will have to work after government decides against increase in Social Security", "title": "Social Security\u2019s move forces local retiree back to work", "url": "http://wivb.com/2015/10/16/social-securitys-move-forces-local-retiree-back-to-work/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/socialsecurity.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will have to work after government decides against increase in Social Security", "creator": "@news4buffalo", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/socialsecurity.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Social Security\u2019s move forces local retiree back to work", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16", "application-name": "wivb.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2015-10-16T22:36:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-16T22:36:01+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s just that, after 50 years in the workforce, Ball says he shouldn\u2019t have to.\nBLASDELL, N.Y.
