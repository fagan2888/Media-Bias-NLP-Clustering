Matt Mead signed the Wyoming Right to Try Act on Monday. The bill passed in February with near-unanimous support in both of the state\u2019s legislative chambers.\n\nThe Wyoming law essentially permits terminally ill patients to override FDA rules and try experimental treatments or drugs. Physicians are protected from adverse legal action for suggesting such treatment.\n\n\u201cWe all know the pain of losing someone we love to a terminal illness,\u201d said Darcy Olsen, president of Goldwater Institute, the group leading the national, bipartisan push for \u201cright to try\u201d laws.\n\n\u201cIf you know there\u2019s a treatment that is helping people survive, who is anyone to say, \u2018No, you don\u2019t have the right to try to save your own life or to save your child\u2019s life?\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nColorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri and Arizona have right-to-try laws.\n\nSimilar bills in Arkansas, South Dakota and Virginia are awaiting a governor\u2019s signature, and bills have passed in at least one state legislative chamber this year, the Goldwater Institute said.\n\nThe FDA has a process to allow people to use medicines before they are fully tested, but fewer than 1,000 people a year receive help, the think tank said.\n\nObjections to these laws revolve around concerns that patients will be needlessly exposed to potentially harmful effects, and that premature use will undermine clinical research, according to Health Affairs Blog and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wyoming has become the sixth state to permit desperate patients to try promising lifesaving treatments that are still in the investigative stage.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wyoming has become the sixth state to permit desperate patients to try promising lifesaving treatments that are still in the investigative stage.", "title": "Wyoming passes \u2018right to try\u2019 law for desperate patients", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/11/wyoming-passes-right-to-try-law-for-desperate-pati/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/06/Mead_Session.JPEG-06782.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/06/Mead_Session.JPEG-06782.jpg", "description": "Wyoming has become the sixth state to permit desperate patients to try promising lifesaving treatments that are still in the investigative stage.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wyoming passes \u2018right to try\u2019 law for desperate patients"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, FDA"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaeab\"", "article_summary": "The Wyoming law essentially permits terminally ill patients to override FDA rules and try experimental treatments or drugs.\nWyoming has become the sixth state to permit desperate patients to try promising lifesaving treatments that are still in the investigative stage.\nMatt Mead signed the Wyoming Right to Try Act on Monday.\n\u201cWe all know the pain of losing someone we love to a terminal illness,\u201d said Darcy Olsen, president of Goldwater Institute, the group leading the national, bipartisan push for \u201cright to try\u201d laws.\nWyoming Gov."}
