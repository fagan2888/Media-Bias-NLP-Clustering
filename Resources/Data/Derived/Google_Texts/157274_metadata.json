But don\u2019t worry, he hasn\u2019t gone shy on us. The talkative \u2014 and often provocative \u2014 owner of the Dallas Mavericks and co-star of ABC\u2019s hit-series Shark Tank has a lot to say about Washington dysfunction and how to improve the economy.\n\nCuban, who rose to riches by building Broadcast.com and selling it to Yahoo during the dot-com bubble, remains a serial entrepreneur \u2014 he\u2019s taking on Snapchat by launching an app called Cyber Dust for private texting and backing MotionLoft, which makes sensors that track pedestrian and vehicle traffic. And Cuban remains a champion of startups and small businesses, The Fiscal Times spoke with him about the environment for entrepreneurship today.\n\nReilly Dowd (RD): If you were just starting out today, what would you look to do? Would you still start your own business?\n\nMark Cuban (MC): \u202aI would definitely start a business. It would probably be what I'm doing right now. Creating businesses and apps like Cyber Dust and MotionLoft where I think there are opportunities.\n\nRelated: Startups Promise Self-Destructing Emails\n\n\u202aRD: If you could send President Obama one message via Cyber Dust today, what would it be?\n\nMC: \u202aPut a $10,000 annual limit on the amount of federal guarantees available to any individual [for student loans].\n\nRD: Some research shows that dynamism is slowing down, the formation of new firms has been on a persistent decline, and there\u2019s a drop-off in U.S. entrepreneurship. Your thoughts on why? What might this mean for the future of entrepreneurship in America?\n\nMC: \u202aThat research is faulty. There is a reason Shark Tank is so popular. People are still inspired. The American dream is still alive and well.\n\nRD: What could or should Washington do to encourage entrepreneurship and support fast-growing companies? Is gridlock in Washington hurting the start-up world?\n\n\u202aMC: Extend Obamacare to include any and all startups that are 3 years old or younger. Allow all employees to sign up at HealthCare.gov.\n\nThat solves several problems for entrepreneurs. First, it allows them to quit a job they are keeping only to get health insurance. Second, it allows them to hire people who want to work for your startup but won\u2019t unless you have full health care. Third, one of the biggest productivity and profitability time sucks for an entrepreneur is that we have to spend time trying to figure out all the different health care options and what we can and can\u2019t offer to employees. Every second spent on trying to figure out health care is time taken away from the core competencies of our companies.\n\nRelated: The One Risk Businesses Worry About Most\n\nThe bottom line is that the value we can add by taking health care out of the startup equation and allowing entrepreneurs to focus that time on increasing the values of our companies [adds] more aggregate value to the economy and the country than the inefficiencies and waste that the government introduces by managing our health care.\n\nRD: What else could Washington do?\n\nMC: One-touch business licenses. There is too much bureaucracy, which creates artificial barriers and costs that complicates the process for startups and diverts needed time and cash. Every license should resolve all licenses for the local and state.\u202a\n\nRD: Would you prefer the GOP win both the Senate and the House?\n\nMC: I don\u2019t have a preference. I\u2019m independent. I believe both parties are equally inefficient. \u202a\u202a\n\nRelated: Senate Dems Make New Unemployment Insurance Push\n\nRD: Futurist and economic theorist Jeremy Rifkin has an interesting take: He says the shift to a \u201csharing economy\u201d could dramatically narrow the income divide and democratize the global economy. What do you think about that?\n\nMC: \u202aI agree, at least as it applies to the United States and Canada. When people can sell their time rather than a skill, it allows a broader spectrum of untrained people to earn a living. \u202aI actually have met with administration officials and have had discussions about the importance of the sharing economy. The president definitely gets it.\n\n\u202aGlobally, it\u2019s a different issue because of the smartphone and connectivity that is required.\n\n\u202aRD: As an NBA owner, are you surprised by how much the Los Angeles Clippers sold for?\n\n\u202aMC: No.\u202a\n\nRD: What\u2019s your prediction for the NBA finals winner? And in how many games?\n\nMC: \u202aI don't make predictions for the NBA. It's a no win situation :)\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Mark Cuban won\u2019t make a prediction about the NBA finals, doesn\u2019t want to talk about th", "title": "Mark Cuban on How Obamacare Could Help Startups", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/15/Mark-Cuban-How-Obamacare-Could-Help-Startups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_Mark_Cuban.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/15/Mark-Cuban-How-Obamacare-Could-Help-Startups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_Mark_Cuban.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Mark Cuban won\u2019t make a prediction about the NBA finals, doesn\u2019t want to talk about th", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Every second spent on trying to figure out health care is time taken away from the core competencies of our companies.\nAnd Cuban remains a champion of startups and small businesses, The Fiscal Times spoke with him about the environment for entrepreneurship today.\nSecond, it allows them to hire people who want to work for your startup but won\u2019t unless you have full health care.\n\u202aMC: Extend Obamacare to include any and all startups that are 3 years old or younger.\nRelated: Startups Promise Self-Destructing Emails\u202aRD: If you could send President Obama one message via Cyber Dust today, what would it be?"}
