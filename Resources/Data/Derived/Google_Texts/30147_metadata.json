It\u2019s like the way you and I grew up. It\u2019s a very sort of direct language ... .\"\n\nBaio, who considers himself a \"Conservative independent,\" also expressed why he doesn't associate with the Republican party.\n\n\"I think most importantly for me, and I\u2019m not discounting Ted Cruz or John Kasich and I like them both, but Donald Trump is the only guy I think that has the will and the nerve to attack and to fight back because we have this mentality,\" he said. \"The Republican party \u2014 which I try not to associate myself with anymore because I think they are very untrustworthy on almost every issue \u2014 they seem to have this mentality that they don\u2019t want to get down in the dirt. They want to be above the fray because they want to be perceived as nice, and they get killed.\"\n\nBaio had more words about the Republican party adding, \"They lose elections because they don\u2019t want to fight. When you fight, you fight to win and they don\u2019t ever want to fight and I can\u2019t understand it.\"\n\nWhen it came to discussing President Barack Obama, Baio was more concerned about the actions of the Republican party than the current president.\n\n\"I don\u2019t blame Obama,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t agree with anything the guy does, but the Republicans had every opportunity to stop him and just laid down.\"\n\nWatch the full interview below.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Arlene Washington", "description": "\"I like his proposals on reforming the tax code, building the wall, immigration, repealing Obamacare,\" the actor said Sunday morning on Fox News.", "og": {"site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "description": "\"I like his proposals on reforming the tax code, building the wall, immigration, repealing Obamacare,\" the actor said Sunday morning on Fox News.", "title": "Scott Baio Expresses Why He Supports Trump", "url": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/scott-baio-expresses-why-he-880187", "image": {"width": 1296, "identifier": "//cdn3.thr.com/sites/default/files/2016/03/baio.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 730}, "type": "website"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-03 16:14:43", "sailthru.title": "Scott Baio Expresses Why He Supports Trump", "fb": {"admins": 3111204}, "sailthru.vertical": "Television", "sailthru.tags": "Television,Donald Trump", "sailthru.description": "\"I like his proposals on reforming the tax code, building the wall, immigration, repealing Obamacare,\" the actor said Sunday morning on Fox News.", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "After recently publicly endorsing Donald Trump, actor Scott Baio returned to Fox News on Sunday morning to express why he supports the GOP frontrunner, but not necessarily the views of the Republican party.\nBaio, who considers himself a \"Conservative independent,\" also expressed why he doesn't associate with the Republican party.\nWhen it came to discussing President Barack Obama, Baio was more concerned about the actions of the Republican party than the current president.\nBaio had more words about the Republican party adding, \"They lose elections because they don\u2019t want to fight.\nWhen you fight, you fight to win and they don\u2019t ever want to fight and I can\u2019t understand it.\""}
