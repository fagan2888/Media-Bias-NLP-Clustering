The \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d food truck, for instance, sponsored by Netflix, serves \u201cCrazy Pyes\u201d named for prisoner \u201cCrazy Eyes,\u201d and \u201cchocolate-and-vanilla-swirl ice cream,\u201d named for her desire to have an interracial relationship with Piper.\n\n\u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d from its sort-of-dated title on through the scenes of characters shooting the breeze, is full of jokes. But Crazy Eyes has been a character with a unique sort of pathos that this food truck flattens like a squirrel caught under its tires: Her name, which rhymes with \u201cpies,\u201d is also a cruel appellation other prisoners gave an actually mentally ill person. That her relationship with Piper would be a \u201cswirl\u201d is precisely the point \u2014 we learn early this season that her obsession with Piper is bound up in her never really getting the approval of her white adoptive family.\n\nNetflix is quick to promote its show using the image of one of the most recognizable characters; anyone can relate. But making a complex and thought-provoking series, one that seeks to humanize those most marginalized by society, has its drawbacks, and one is that you\u2019re vulnerable to charges of poor taste when you turn characters\u2019 most central characteristics into wacky joke fodder. Or when you extrapolate from the fact that the prisoners have to scramble to get nourishment to tweet out joke recipes and then put out a cookbook. (Sure, sure, there was a \u201cSopranos\u201d cookbook too, but it wasn\u2019t a central plot point of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d that kitchen employees had barely anything to prepare and could withhold food from you whenever they wanted.) And asked to make \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d\u2018s makeup artists available to explain how you could extrapolate fun beauty hacks for your real life from prisoners\u2019 routines, Netflix\u2019s press shop might have made a different choice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The promotional team behind \"OITNB\" forgets its characters' humanity and tragic situation", "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The promotional team behind \"OITNB\" forgets its characters' humanity and tragic situation", "title": "From food trucks to makeup tips, Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d tie-ins are tastelessly missing the point", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/17/from_food_trucks_to_makeup_tips_netflixs_orange_is_the_new_black_tie_ins_are_tastelessly_missing_the_point/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/tv-q-and-a-taylor-schilling.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The promotional team behind \"OITNB\" forgets its characters' humanity and tragic situation", "creator": "@dpd_", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/tv-q-and-a-taylor-schilling.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "From food trucks to makeup tips, Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d tie-ins are tastelessly missing the point", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "From food trucks to makeup tips, Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d tie-ins are tastelessly missing the point", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, crazy eyes, food trucks, orange is the new black", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01c4\"", "article_summary": "The \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d food truck, for instance, sponsored by Netflix, serves \u201cCrazy Pyes\u201d named for prisoner \u201cCrazy Eyes,\u201d and \u201cchocolate-and-vanilla-swirl ice cream,\u201d named for her desire to have an interracial relationship with Piper.\n\u201cOrange is the New Black,\u201d from its sort-of-dated title on through the scenes of characters shooting the breeze, is full of jokes.\nBut if \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d the show takes pains to treat its prisoners\u2019 plights with respect and human empathy, \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d the marketing phenomenon takes prison as a big joke.\nTopics: crazy eyes, food trucks, orange is the new black, Entertainment NewsNot since \u201cDownton Abbey\u201d has there been a show as simultaneously popular and evidently marketable as Netflix\u2019s \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d \u2014 and no coincidence, since both series present easily relatable human situations in new and somewhat exotic settings.\nNetflix is quick to promote its show using the image of one of the most recognizable characters; anyone can relate."}
