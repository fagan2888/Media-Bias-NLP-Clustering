First one chamber of Congress, then the other, then the president\u2019s signature, or a veto override. Every so often, the U.S. Supreme Court will repeal a law by ruling it unconstitutional. Government shutdowns don\u2019t enter into the picture.\n\nBut in 2013, Congressional Republicans knew that all of their efforts to amend or repeal the Affordable Care Act by Constitutional means had failed, and it had been upheld by the Supreme Court. The linchpin of the act, the \u201caffordability credits\u201d that have helped more than 10 million Americans obtain coverage, were about to go into effect.\n\nThrown into a fury, the GOP shut down the federal government. Health and safety inspections halted. Federal loans and import/export licenses were put on hold. Tax refunds totaling $4 billion were postponed. The National Institutes of Health stopped accepting patients. More than 800,000 federal workers were sent home.\n\nIt was embarrassing, costly and pointless. Standard & Poor\u2019s estimated that the 16-day federal shutdown in 2013 cost us $24 billion, and reduced fourth quarter 2013 GDP growth by about 0.6%. This from the self-proclaimed \u201cfiscally responsible\u201d party. It was also political self-mutilation by the GOP; its support in the polls dropped by 10%.\n\nNow, two years later, we again face the threat of another shutdown\u2014this time because a small faction of the GOP wants to choke off federal funding for Planned Parenthood, despite the critical medical services that the organization provides to poor women across the country.\n\nPlanned Parenthood received roughly half a billion dollars in federal grants each year. The federal government spends approximately $3 trillion a year. So the GOP is threatening to shut down federal spending, over a concern regarding about one-sixtieth of 1% of federal spending.\n\nThis is a time for action, not words. This is a time to stop the Republicans from denying Americans much-needed services, hurting our credit rating and our international standing, and wounding our still-recovering economy.\n\nIn April, I proposed a simple solution. My bill, the Shut Down the Shutdowns Act, eliminates this danger entirely by applying existing budget levels to all federal agencies until a law is passed creating new ones. My bill, H.R. 1776, is our declaration of independence from the tyranny of government shutdowns, both actual and threatened.\n\nExisting law prohibits shutdowns regarding Social Security and Medicare benefits. Shouldn\u2019t we be consistent? Why should the default for federal spending be no budget, instead of just the same budget? And why should we ever allow a fraction of a faction in the body politic to threaten the whole and hold all of us hostage?\n\nI have served in Congress for almost five years. I am genuinely puzzled as to why we keep finding ourselves peering over a fiscal cliff every Sept. 30, wondering whether to jump. Just because we have done something every year for centuries doesn\u2019t mean that we have to keep doing it\u2014just ask the swallows who used to come to San Juan Capistrano. Let\u2019s end this dangerous and self-destructive political ritual; let\u2019s shut down the shutdowns. It\u2019s common sense, and it\u2019s what the American people deserve.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're embarrassing, costly and pointless", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "They're embarrassing, costly and pointless", "title": "Let's Shut Down Government Shutdowns for Good", "url": "http://time.com/4046141/lets-shut-down-government-shutdowns-for-good/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/alan-grayson.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/alan-grayson.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "They're embarrassing, costly and pointless", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Let's Shut Down Government Shutdowns for Good"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "shutdown, government shutdown, gop, planned parenthood, health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96f9\"", "article_summary": "Let\u2019s end this dangerous and self-destructive political ritual; let\u2019s shut down the shutdowns.\nSo the GOP is threatening to shut down federal spending, over a concern regarding about one-sixtieth of 1% of federal spending.\nThrown into a fury, the GOP shut down the federal government.\nMy bill, the Shut Down the Shutdowns Act, eliminates this danger entirely by applying existing budget levels to all federal agencies until a law is passed creating new ones.\nWhy should the default for federal spending be no budget, instead of just the same budget?"}
