LOS ANGELES (AP) — Joan Leslie, whose expressive almond eyes and innocent beauty made her one of the most popular film ingénues of the 1930s and 40s, has died at the age of 90.

She died in Los Angeles on Monday, her family announced in an obituary.

After signing with Warner Bros. at the age of 15, her first major role was in "High Sierra" as the disabled Velma opposite Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino.

In her 20-year career, the Detroit native performed in over 30 films. She romanced Gary Cooper in "Sergeant York," danced with Fred Astaire in "The Sky's the Limit," and sang with James Cagney in "Yankee Doodle Dandy."

After marrying physician William Caldwell in 1950, she put her career on hold to raise her twin daughters and do charity.
