The Colorado Board of Health’s recent action on its medical-marijuana caregiver rules was confusing and regrettable, creating more questions than solutions.

First, the board unfortunately rejected a proposal that would have capped the number of patients for caregivers at 10.

Creating a reasonable cap would have provided greater oversight of the caregiver system, which law enforcement officials say has been a source of illegal diversion of pot to the black market.

Large caregiver growing operations can pose health and safety risks, too, especially in residential areas.

State law defines a caregiver as someone who has “significant responsibility for managing the well-being of a patient.” How can that be possible for any caregiver with more than 10 patients?

A more troubling revelation from last week’s health board meeting was that many parents are apparently breaking the law by using a Boulder-based caregiver to obtain special marijuana oil for their children. Health officials told about two dozen parents that only they can be caregivers for their children who are medical-marijuana patients.

Further, health officials said it was against the law for one caregiver to delegate authority — such as growing marijuana — to another caregiver.

The department, though, doesn’t have the authority to do anything about this apparent breach of the law.

We are sympathetic to parents seeking help for their sick children. However, the structure is set up in a way that could subject them to exploitation by someone with purely financial motives.

The laws should be rewritten to allow caregivers, especially parents of minor children, to delegate their authority.

Forcing parents to grow their own marijuana to create the special oil for their sick children is not in the best interest of anyone.
