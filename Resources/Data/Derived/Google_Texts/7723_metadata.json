It\u2019s a perfect book, and much of Johnson\u2019s later work \u2014 particularly \u201cAlready Dead,\u201d the \u201cCalifornia gothic\u201d that followed it six years later \u2014 has suffered by comparison. Wistful references to \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d crop up in reviews of Johnson\u2019s work as reliably as Alfred Hitchcock cameos in Hitchcock films. You\u2019re always looking for them.\n\nMost of Johnson\u2019s fiction since \u201cAlready Dead\u201d has leaned toward the maximalist, the intricate and the paranoid; you could call \u201cTree of Smoke\u201d a \u201cVietnam gothic.\u201d Even though that novel won the National Book Award in 2007, there remained a lingering wistfulness to much of the praise it earned. Johnson has further confounded expectations by writing shorter books about a grieving, but solidly bourgeoise widower (\u201cThe Name of the World\u201d); a hard-boiled crime novel set in Bakersfield (\u201cNobody Move\u201d) and a historical novella about a backwoods hermit in Idaho (\u201cTrain Dreams\u201d). He seems unlikely to revisit the style and subject matter of \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d any time soon.\n\nBesides, perfection \u2014 always easier to achieve within strictly limited parameters \u2014 is overrated. The truth is, Johnson\u2019s later work, while less exquisite and heart-rending than \u201cJesus\u2019 Son,\u201d is in many respects more interesting than his earlier high-MFA-style short stories. It\u2019s certainly more fun. Some novelists, like Thomas Pynchon, produce complex fictions packed with ideas and themes and incidents that often don\u2019t seem to add up to anything human. Others, like David Mitchell, craft elaborate and inventive narrative contraptions to convey what amount to rather trite sentiments. Johnson can execute all of that tricky stuff \u2014 the plotting of \u201cAlready Dead\u201d is a marvel \u2014 without getting lost in a book\u2019s conceits and devices. His fiction always has a pulse, the kind with real blood in it.\n\nJohnson\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Laughing Monsters,\u201d is a case in point. Ostensibly, it\u2019s a gritty thriller set in Sierre Leone, Uganda and Congo. Underneath that, it\u2019s about the inability of men of a certain type to lead honorable lives. Africa is infested with such men, decommissioned or semi-commissioned soldiers and spooks sniffing around for dirty jobs and promising scams. The narrator of \u201cThe Laughing Monsters\u201d \u2014 half Danish, half American and employed by NATO intelligence \u2014 is sent by his bosses to Sierre Leone to reconnect with an old buddy, Michael Adriko, a Congolese orphan and child of war turned international special-forces soldier. The two of them made a bundle during the civil war on a shady operation involving diamonds.\n\nThe narrator\u2019s name is Roland Nair, and some allusion to Browning\u2019s Childe Roland seems likely, since Nair has been directed by liars to journey across a poisoned landscape and ends up under a tree inhabited by a mad god. In the meantime, though, Nair will revisit his infatuation with Michael \u2014 even if he can\u2019t quite admit to himself, at least not at first, that an infatuation is what it is. Michael is magnetic and unpredictable, capable of great violence, cunning and irrepressible hope. \u201cAlways laughing, never finished talking,\u201d full of plans and mysteries. He wants Roland to join him in his latest scheme. \u201cYou\u2019ll live like a king,\u201d he promises. \u201cA compound by the beach. Fifty men with AKs to guard you. The villagers come to you for everything\u201d \u2013The \u201ceverything\u201d includes handing over their virginal daughters \u2014 \u201cNair, no AIDS from these girls.\u201d This, Michael insists, is what they both want, \u201cand you know it\u2019s here. There\u2019s no place else on earth where we can have it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics pine for the perfect short stories of the author's early years, but his gothic, crime and spy novels rule", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Critics pine for the perfect short stories of the author's early years, but his gothic, crime and spy novels rule", "title": "It\u2019s time to embrace Denis Johnson\u2019s beautiful corruption", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/02/its_time_to_embrace_denis_johnsons_beautiful_corruption/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/denis_johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Critics pine for the perfect short stories of the author's early years, but his gothic, crime and spy novels rule", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/denis_johnson.jpg", "title": "It\u2019s time to embrace Denis Johnson\u2019s beautiful corruption", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "It\u2019s time to embrace Denis Johnson\u2019s beautiful corruption", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Africa, Books, Denis Johnson, Editor's Picks, Fiction, The Laughing Monsters, Thrillers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Wistful references to \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d crop up in reviews of Johnson\u2019s work as reliably as Alfred Hitchcock cameos in Hitchcock films.\nHe seems unlikely to revisit the style and subject matter of \u201cJesus\u2019 Son\u201d any time soon.\nThe truth is, Johnson\u2019s later work, while less exquisite and heart-rending than \u201cJesus\u2019 Son,\u201d is in many respects more interesting than his earlier high-MFA-style short stories.\nJohnson\u2019s latest, \u201cThe Laughing Monsters,\u201d is a case in point.\nIt\u2019s a perfect book, and much of Johnson\u2019s later work \u2014 particularly \u201cAlready Dead,\u201d the \u201cCalifornia gothic\u201d that followed it six years later \u2014 has suffered by comparison."}
