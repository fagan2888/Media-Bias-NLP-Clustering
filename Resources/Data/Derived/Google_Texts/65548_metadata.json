Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over his proposals on healthcare and college affordability.According to The Hill , some Democrats are interpreting the young Clinton's recent attack as a sign of trouble for her mother Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.\"The thing that tells you as much as anything about [the Clinton campaign's] current state of mind is Chelsea going on the attack. It tells you everything you need to know,\" said one Democratic strategist, according to The Hill.\"That this [challenge from Sanders] is real and they've got to be freaking out.\"While Chelsea Clinton has previously been seen as highlighting Hillary's role as a mother and grandmother, Chelsea turned heads and made headlines as she argued that Sanders wants to \"dismantle\" Obamacare and Medicare.\"As much as I admire Chelsea, she didn't read the plan,\" said Sanders, whose poll numbers are leading in both Iowa and New Hampshire. \"I think she is wrong,\" he added in an interview on MSNBC Wednesday.\"I really regret that the Clinton campaign sent Chelsea out to make the attack that she made,\" former Obama adviser David Axelrod said on CNN on Tuesday night. \"I don't think it was the right attack....

She has such an asset in her family if only they can use them the right way.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chelsea Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Dismantle, Obamacare, Medicare", "pubdate": "2016-01-14T12:17:25", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Chelsea Clinton officially entered the 2016 presidential battlefield on Tuesday night when she blasted Sen.
