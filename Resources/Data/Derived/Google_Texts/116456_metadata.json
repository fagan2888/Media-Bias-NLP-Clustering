Why King might run for president\n\nWOLFEBORO, N.H. \u2014 Presidential hopefuls don\u2019t typically open their sales pitch by promoting policies that voters overwhelmingly oppose or by knocking their own party almost as much as the other one.\n\nPeter King is not your typical presidential hopeful.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe brash Republican congressman from Long Island has been making the rounds in New Hampshire, pressing for military action in Syria \u2014 which about one in three Americans support \u2014 and warning against growing isolationist sentiment at home, symbolized by the rise of libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). At stops around the state last weekend, King charged that President Barack Obama\u2019s approach \u201cis weakening the office of the president of the United States\u201d and that America\u2019s foes \u201csense weakness; they sense appeasement; they sense accommodation.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Republicans, 2016 contenders)\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s me or anyone else in the Republican Party who runs, I hope we run on having strong national defense and also carrying the banner high,\u201d he said on the stump. \u201cWaving the banner of the United States of America and realizing that whatever other countries may do or whatever complaints they may have, no one has done more for freedom than the United States. But most of all, Americans need to have faith in their leader that he\u2019s not going to back down when things get tough.\u201d\n\nBut King was unsparing about his own party, too, saying he\u2019s gravely concerned that Republicans are starting to project the same image of timidity in international affairs that has plagued Democrats over the years.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a knee-jerk isolationist,\u201d King said of Paul in a separate interview. \u201cJust the level of his arguments \u2014 \u2018build bridges in the U.S. rather than Afghanistan\u2019 \u2014 has superficial appeal. But what does that mean? Does he consider, analyze \u2014 what happens when we withdraw?\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 2016: Who\u2019s next?)\n\nNo one is about to put King in the top tier of GOP 2016 hopefuls. As a single House member from liberal New York, he\u2019d be handicapped in the race for money and exposure against the Chris Christies or Pauls of the GOP. His vocal support for stricter gun control laws would be tough to explain to conservative primary voters, as would his criticism of tea party lawmakers who \u201cequate Obamacare with military action,\u201d as he put it, because they both involve government spending.\n\nAnd his keen focus on national security when poll after poll indicates the country has turned inward after a dozen years of war isn\u2019t the kind of message likely to fire up the Republican faithful.\n\nBut for King, that message is the point. His main motivation is unmistakable: pushing back against what he sees as a \u201cdangerous\u201d strain of isolationism that\u2019s gaining strength in the GOP. Trips to early states like New Hampshire make him not just a \u201cRepublican congressman\u201d in the media but also a \u201cpotential 2016 candidate\u201d \u2014 giving him a bigger megaphone to drive his message.\n\nIn nearly a one-hour conversation with POLITICO in New Hampshire ahead of two campaign stops, King went so far as to say that the rise of anti-war voices in the GOP threatens to make Democrats the better option for voters who want a strong national defense.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: King: Obama acting like a community organizer)\n\n\u201cI want to make sure our alternative is better than theirs,\u201d King, 69, said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cseriously\u201d looking at a run but hasn\u2019t decided yet. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be criticizing the Obama policies, and then we end up nominating someone whose policies I think are more dangerous than [Obama\u2019s], we\u2019ve failed as Republicans.\u201d\n\nThat was a direct swipe at Paul, who is leading the GOP opposition to bombing Syria and drew enormous attention earlier this year with his filibuster against the use of drones on American soil. King added that he didn\u2019t mean \u201cdangerous in an evil way\u201d but \u201cdangerous if we let down our defenses.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have more of an immediate responsibility because Rand Paul is in my party,\u201d King said. \u201cPresident Obama was elected; he\u2019s entitled to run his foreign policy as commander in chief. What would be reassuring to me is knowing we have a real alternative for that coming up in 2016. But the thought that we have [something] worse than the Obama policy coming up.\u201d\n\nPaul has described himself as a \u201crealist, not a neoconservative or an isolationist.\u201d His office didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the tax-and-spend liberal wing of the Republican Party,\u201d Paul said in late July, responding on CNN to King charging that he was on the \u201cfringe.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all for blowing up stuff; they\u2019re all for getting involved in wars; but they\u2019re not too concerned with fiscal responsibility and balanced budgets.\u201d\n\nOn the stump in this first-in-the-nation primary state, King kept the emphasis on the president, but the basic foreign policy focus was the same. In Wolfeboro, King addressed a lobster bake sponsored by the Carroll County Republican Committee. He unpacked his position on Syria in front of dozens of polo- and sweater-sporting Republicans \u2014 many with white hair \u2014 as they nibbled on seafood, corn and coleslaw.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Long Island lawmaker and 2016 GOP prospect is running a campaign against isolationism.", "title": "Why King might run for president", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/peter-king-2016-message-rand-paul-barack-obama-dangerous-96742.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/03/17/peter_king_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Peter King (196),Barack Obama (11250),Rand Paul (618),2016 Elections (335),Elections (1394)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Long Island lawmaker and 2016 GOP prospect is running a campaign against isolationism.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd336d\"", "article_summary": "King says both President Obama and Rand Paul are too timid in national affairs.\n\u201cPresident Obama was elected; he\u2019s entitled to run his foreign policy as commander in chief.\n( Also on POLITICO: King: Obama acting like a community organizer)\u201cI want to make sure our alternative is better than theirs,\u201d King, 69, said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cseriously\u201d looking at a run but hasn\u2019t decided yet.\nNo one is about to put King in the top tier of GOP 2016 hopefuls.\nKing added that he didn\u2019t mean \u201cdangerous in an evil way\u201d but \u201cdangerous if we let down our defenses.\u201d\u201cI have more of an immediate responsibility because Rand Paul is in my party,\u201d King said."}
