But you really should like it, according to Ezekiel Emanuel, former senior health adviser to President Obama and one of the measure\u2019s architects. He describes the program, often referred to as Obamacare, as \u201ca world historical achievement, even more important for the United States than Social Security and Medicare have been.\u201d\n\nInfused with diagrams, charts, and tables, this book is informative, thought-provoking, and immensely important. Given his role in the program, and as is reflected in the subtitle of the book, Emanuel clearly wants to persuade, but he also wants to explain. And because he was an insider \u2014 and proves himself a gifted writer \u2014 he makes an able guide to the complexities of the landmark legislation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first third of the book outlines in vivid and unsparing detail just how necessary it was to fix the broken American health care system. Prior to the enactment of the law in 2010, the nation\u2019s health care was not only the most expensive in the world but also provided most Americans with decidedly mediocre care and left almost one-sixth of the population without reliable access to services.\n\nThe next third describes the many attempts over the last century \u2014 from both sides of the political divide \u2014 to reform health care in the nation. Emanuel shows how many of these ideas were subsequently incorporated into the final plan: Romneycare in Massachusetts is only one example of this.\n\nThe final portion is titled \u201cThe Future of American Health Care.\u2019\u2019 Although clearly a proponent of the program, Emanuel begins by excoriating the flawed rollout of healthcare.gov in October of last year and then moves on to detail what he believes the long-term benefits of Obamacare will be in the years to come \u2014 assuming, of course, that it can recover sufficiently from that fiasco and attract enough relatively healthy enrollees to survive.\n\nReinventing American Health Care: How the Affordable Care Act Will Improve our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System Author: Ezekiel Emanuel Publisher: PublicAffairs Publication year: 2014 Number of pages: 380 pp., illustrated Book price: $26.99\n\nThis section is perhaps the most fascinating, as it reveals just how boldly ambitious the act is. As Emanuel makes clear, the ultimate purpose is to broaden access to health care in this country, improve its quality, and decrease its overall cost by radically changing the system.\n\nHowever, it is still far from clear that these goals will be met. In the meanwhile, health care providers and organizations struggle to keep up with its requirements, some which can seem almost Orwellian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany physicians, for example, feel that by being forced through the multiple steps of documentation necessary to demonstrate \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of the electronic medical record with each patient encounter \u2014 one of the quality measures of the law \u2014 they actually have less time to spend with their patients.\n\nShorter visits and poorer communication between doctors and patients, in turn, can lead to more expensive care and worse outcomes. This and other ground-level problems with Obamacare receive less attention in the book than they would seem to merit, though Emanuel clearly recognizes that the program is far from perfect, and doesn\u2019t hesitate to point this out.\n\nClearly, if Obamacare is to fulfill its promise there will need to be significant changes and that will require collaboration among citizens, health care professionals, scholars, and lawmakers from across the political spectrum. And the only way this can happen is if people understand what exactly is at stake. \u201cReinventing American Health Care\u2019\u2019 spells this out clearly, and by doing so, lays the foundation for this kind of collaboration to occur.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.2706917700", "eomportal-id": 2057046, "description": "Infused with diagrams, charts, and tables, \u201cReinventing American Health Care: How the Affordable Care Act will Improve our Terribly Complex, Blatantly Unjust, Outrageously Expensive, Grossly Inefficient, Error Prone System\u2019\u2019 is informative, thought-provoking, and immensely important.
