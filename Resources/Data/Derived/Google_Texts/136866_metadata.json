In just 59 seconds, a genuine smile can make you instantly feel happy.\n\nMost of us at one point or another have been hit with a bad case of the blues. Despite attempts made by friends, family, and even ourselves, the road to happiness can often be a long and dwindling one. Magician-turned-psychology expert, Richard Wiseman, gives us a myth-busting response with his tip to improve our life, specifically our happiness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like you to force your face into a smile. Don\u2019t just sit there \u2014 actually give it a go. Force your face into a smile, now hold that expression,\u201d said Wiseman in \u201cThe Smile Test\u201d video on his In59Seconds YouTube channel. The quick exercise of forcing your face to make a smile to feel happier is supported by a 2012 study. The study found even in the most stressful situations, forcing a smile helped alleviate the symptoms of stress and, as a result, increased happiness.\n\nMaking an emotional face or suppressing one influences our feelings. Forcing a smile or adding emotion can influence how we carry ourselves doing everyday activities such as talking, and even walking. \u201cIf you put energy into your voice and a spring in your step, you will suddenly feel much better,\" Wiseman said.\n\nThirty-seven seconds into the video, Wiseman advises us to \u201cstop smiling,\u201d and asks us to evaluate how we feel, and if this method worked for us. YouTube users have agreed and disagreed with Wiseman\u2019s method. User Plechette Dey-Foy wrote, \u201cIt really works,\u201d while another user, Darth Kass, said, \u201cI felt happier from seeing the smilie face than I did from holding a smile. I'm still not happy though.\u201d\n\nWiseman suggests the next time we want a quick dose of happiness, just spend 30 seconds or so acting like a happy person. The secret to happiness may indeed be easier to achieve \u2014 just under 60 seconds. Give it a go, and find out if it really does work.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "the art of happiness, how to be happy, happiness, happier, smile, smiling", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The secret to achieving happiness may be easier and quicker than previously thought.
