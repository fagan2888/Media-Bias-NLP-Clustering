Such services are catching on as access to birth control is expanding in the U.S. in general: New legislation in a few states \u2014 Oregon as of this month, and California in March \u2014 allows women to get a prescription from a pharmacist without going through a doctor. And under the Affordable Care Act, private insurers are increasingly covering the cost of birth control without co-pays or deductibles.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor some women, it can be challenging to get away from work or family in order to see your doctor for a prescription or even go to a pharmacist for a refill,\u201d Dr. Jennifer Conti, a clinical instructor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cIn general, services like these have the potential to remove an additional barrier to obtaining birth control. In that way, I think they\u2019re a great addition.\u201d\n\nNurx / Via app.nurx.co ID: 7741687\n\nLast month, for example, Nurx launched a website that asks people to choose a medication brand and fill out a series of yes-or-no and multiple-choice questions about their blood pressure, allergies, and other conditions. An independent doctor remotely reviews their answers and places an order, which a network of pharmacies then fills and mails to the customer, according to Nurx. If the patient has insurance \u2014 from carriers including Aetna, Blue Shield, Cigna, and United Healthcare \u2014 Nurx bills the insurer and pays for the delivery, and the consumer doesn\u2019t pay, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. If the patient lacks insurance, medications start at about $15. Most requests are approved within 40 minutes and pills arrive the next day, although the goal is to deliver within two to four hours, according to Nurx. The company is currently shipping pills throughout California only.\n\nBased in San Francisco, Nurx was founded in 2014 by Hans Gangeskar, a former attorney and executive at the microbiome-sequencing startup uBiome, and Edvard Engesaeth, a physician. The two said they were excited about the growing field of telemedicine, and realized that birth control was a consistent medical need for many people. As Gangeskar put it, \u201cWe started thinking, how can we pare this service down into something that\u2019s as fast as possible, but still give a good and responsible service to users?\u201d Nurx aims to make money by charging pharmacies and insurers to partner with the company in exchange for generating extra business. (It also plans to soon let patients get prescriptions for Truvada, the daily HIV prevention pill.)\n\nMaven / Via itunes.apple.com ID: 7741704\n\nOn Maven\u2019s app, which lets patients video-conference and message with nurse practitioners, birth control pills are, perhaps unsurprisingly, the most requested prescription, CEO Kate Ryder told BuzzFeed News. Providers recommend a medication on the spot and order it to be sent to a pharmacy near the patient. Unlike Nurx, Maven charges for the consultation ($18 for 10 minutes). Both services let patients follow up with the provider with questions.\n\nStill other health apps offer variations on the theme: Planned Parenthood (which requires a video consultation and mails it to you); Lemonaid (which charges $15 for a prescription for a three-month supply); Glow (which refills existing prescriptions), and PillPack (which lets you order pills online, but requires you to get a prescription elsewhere).\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see why birth-control prescribing is starting to rely less on an in-person doctor visit. Public health agencies clearly lay out the kind of medical information that providers need about patients in order to safely prescribe them birth control. And though some people have conditions, like high blood pressure, that can lead to complications when mixed with birth control, experts say studies show that people can be trusted to accurately self-report their risk factors.\n\nIn a 2008 study led by the nonprofit Ibis Reproductive Health, more than 1,200 women in Texas were asked to complete a medical checklist of risk factors; a nurse practitioner then interviewed them, took their blood pressure, and compared their answers. \u201cWomen who are likely to seek contraception \u2014 especially younger women \u2014 are able to identify conditions that might make oral contraceptive use dangerous,\u201d the researchers concluded.\n\nIn a separate experiment, about 400 female patients from Seattle clinics filled out medical eligibility questionnaires for oral contraception; their answers lined up with their providers\u2019 evaluations more than 90 percent of the time.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why apps like Nurx have drawn little opposition so far.\n\nIn fact, one of the few objections raised by clinicians is that birth control should be even easier to get \u2014 that is, patients should ultimately be able to get birth control over the counter, without needing to see a medical professional at all.\n\nAs Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at UC San Francisco, and an unpaid advisor to Nurx, told BuzzFeed News by e-mail, \u201cThat will be the best way to improve access for all women in every state across the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4121526, "userid": 2671964}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Getting a prescription doesn't require visiting a doctor in person anymore...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
