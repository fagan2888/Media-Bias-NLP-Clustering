Greg Abbott has requested \u2014 and President Obama has granted \u2014 federal help.\n\nOPINION\n\nI don\u2019t begrudge Texas billions of dollars in disaster relief. After all, we\u2019re all part of America. When some of us are in need, we all have a duty to respond.\n\nBut the flow of federal money poses a bit of awkwardness for the Lone Star State.\n\nAfter all, just over a month ago hundreds of Texans decided that a pending Navy Seal/Green Beret joint training exercise was really an excuse to take over the state and impose martial law. And they claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency was erecting prison camps, readying Wal-Mart stores as processing centers for political prisoners.\n\nThere are nut cases everywhere, but Texas\u2019 governor, Greg Abbott, added to that particular outpouring of paranoia by ordering the Texas State Guard to monitor the military exercise. \u201cIt is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed upon,\u201d he said. In other words, he\u2019d protect Texans from this federal plot.\n\nNow, Abbott wants federal money. And the Federal Emergency Management Agency is gearing up for a major role in the cleanup \u2014 including places like Bastrop, Texas, where the Bastrop State Park dam failed \u2014 and where, just five weeks ago, a U.S. Army colonel trying to explain the pending military exercise was shouted down by hundreds of self-described patriots shouting \u201cliar!\u201d\n\nTexans dislike the federal government even more than most other Americans do. According to a February poll conducted by the University of Texas and the Texas Tribune, only 23 percent of Texans view the federal government favorably, while 57 percent view it unfavorably, including more than a third who hold a \u201cvery unfavorable\u201d view.\n\nTexas dislikes the federal government so much that eight of its congressional representatives, along with Sen. Ted Cruz, opposed disaster relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy \u2014 adding to the awkwardness of their lobbying for the federal relief now heading Texas\u2019 way.\n\nYet even before the current floods, Texas had received more disaster relief than any other state, according to a study by the Center for American Progress. That\u2019s not simply because the state is so large. It\u2019s also because Texas is particularly vulnerable to extreme weather \u2014 tornadoes on the plains, hurricanes in the Gulf, flooding across its middle and south.\n\nGiven this, you might also think Texas would take climate change especially seriously. But here again, there\u2019s cognitive dissonance between what the state needs and how its officials act.\n\nAmong Texas\u2019 infamous climate-change deniers is Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, who dismissed last year\u2019s report by the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change as \u201cmore political than scientific,\u201d and the White House report on the urgency of addressing climate change as designed \u201cto frighten Americans.\u201d\n\nSmith is still at it. His committee just slashed by more than 20 percent NASA\u2019s spending on Earth science, which includes climate change.\n\nIt\u2019s of course possible that Texas\u2019 current record rainfalls \u2014 the National Weather Service reports that the downpour in May alone was enough to put the entire state under eight inches of water \u2014 has nothing to do with the kind of extreme weather we\u2019re witnessing elsewhere in the nation, such as the West\u2019s current drought, the North\u2019s record winter snowfall, and flooding elsewhere.\n\nBut you\u2019d have to be nuts not to be at least curious about such a connection, and its relationship to the carbon dioxide humans have been spewing into the atmosphere.\n\nConsider also the consequences for the public\u2019s health. Several deaths in Texas have been linked to the extreme weather. Many Texans have been injured by it, directly or indirectly. Poor residents are in particular peril because they live in areas prone to flooding or in flimsy houses and trailers that can be washed or blown away.\n\nWhat\u2019s Texas\u2019 response? Texas officials continue to turn down federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, thereby denying insurance to more than 1 million people and preventing the state from receiving an estimated $100 billion in federal cash over the next decade.\n\nI don\u2019t want to pick on Texas. Its officials are not alone in hating the federal government, denying climate change, and refusing to insure its poor.\n\nAnd I certainly don\u2019t want to suggest all Texans are implicated. Obviously, many thoughtful and reasonable people reside there.\n\nYet Texans have elected people who seem not to have a clue. Indeed, Texas has done more in recent years to institutionalize irrationality than almost anywhere else in America \u2014 thereby imposing a huge burden on its citizens.\n\nHow many natural disasters will it take for the Lone Star State to wake up to the disaster of its elected officials?", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>As extreme weather marked by tornadoes and flooding continues to sweep across Texas, Gov.
