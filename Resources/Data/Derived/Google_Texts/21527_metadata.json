Others have encountered similar fates, stripping them of needed income.\n\nLegislation served up for the 2015 General Assembly would turn the tables.\n\nHouse Bill 1290, sponsored by Del. Rob Bell, a Republican from Charlottesville, would end home-kitchen inspections on items produced for direct sale. The goods would bear a label stating that the products are not for resale and were processed without state inspection.\n\n\u201cIf someone wants to buy food from someone, what business is that of the state?\u201d asks Matthew French, a farmer in Bland, Va. \u201cThe state basically comes at you with a gun, and says you can only buy from state-approved supplier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe push for fresh, locally made food is gaining ground,\u201d French said. \u201cBuyers want to know the person who\u2019s preparing their food. People want it \u2014 and the state is getting in the way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Virginia Food Freedom Act is a follow-up to a Bell-sponsored bill that failed during the 2014 session.\n\nBell\u2019s original legislation was pilloried by cattlemen, pork growers, the Virginia Farm Bureau and a phalanx of government regulators. Critics claimed that farmers would be hanging cows on front-loaders on the side of the road, French recalls.\n\n\u201cIt was ludicrous,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginians who try to sell homemade food from their kitchens are feeling the heat from state and local inspectors.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Virginians who try to sell homemade food from their kitchens are feeling the heat from state and local inspectors.", "title": "State Initiative Aims to Get Inspectors Out of Home Kitchens", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150102_HealthInspector.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-01T22:12:05+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1I0sGvO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Virginians who try to sell homemade food from their kitchens are feeling the heat from state and local inspectors.", "title": "State Initiative Aims to Get Inspectors Out of Home Kitchens", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150102_HealthInspector.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2015-01-02T03:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-01T22:12:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Virginia, food, recipes, home cooking, home kitchens, individual freedom, big government"}, "article_summary": "BLAND, Va. \u2014 Virginians who try to sell homemade food from their kitchens are feeling the heat from state and local inspectors.\nThe Virginia Food Freedom Act is a follow-up to a Bell-sponsored bill that failed during the 2014 session.\nIn Arlington, government inspectors shut down a home-based soup maker, even though no customer complaints had been registered.\nThe goods would bear a label stating that the products are not for resale and were processed without state inspection.\nPeople want it \u2014 and the state is getting in the way,\u201d he said."}
