I told him I still remembered his awarding-winning shark ad the first time he ran for secretary of state.\n\nThe Denver Democrat died Sunday of an apparent heart attack. He was only 63 and his death stunned his family and friends. Republicans were effusive in their praise, as were his fellow Democrats. They called him a statesman and recalled his passion for the underdog.\n\nI\u2019ve got a zillion memories of Ken, whom I first met in 2000 when I was assigned to cover the Colorado General Assembly. Here are just a few of them:\n\nP-DOG: In one of the most ingenious pranks ever pulled at the Capitol, someone kidnapped Gordon\u2019s fiberglass prairie dog that stands 2 feet tall, wears a Superman costume and used to reside in his Senate office. Soon he was getting postcards from all over the world, showing his prairie dog in London, in Antarctica, even at opening day of the Colorado Rockies.\n\nWALK ON BY: To support the ballot initiative Referendum C, Gordon led a 350-mile march that started early September 2005 on U.S. 287 at the Wyoming border and ended early October at the New Mexico border, south of Trinidad. It narrowly passed that November.\n\nWHAT THE \u2026 Gordon infuriated his fellow Democrats in 2004 for suggesting that Republicans be allowed to serve as vice chairs of Senate committees. Democrats that year won control of the House and the Senate, a feat it had last achieved in 1960.\n\nMARCH MADNESS: House Democrats beat Republicans 15-13 in a sometimes friendly game of basketball in March 2000. Lawmakers joking suggested team names for including the \u201cBleeding Hearts\u201d and the \u201cReckless Right.\u201d Gordon, the minority leader, entered the game after halftime, shot an air ball and injured his Achilles\u2019 tendon. He required surgery and then hobbled around on crutches for weeks.\n\nSocial media was filled with tributes for Gordon after the Denver Post tonight reported his death:\n\nKen Gordon was a great man who did great things for Colorado. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. #coleg \u2014 Mark Ferrandino (@MarkFerrandino) December 23, 2013\n\nKen Gordon was an honest man without fear or favor. Very sorry to learn of his passing. #copolitics #coleg \u2014 Alan Franklin (@alanfranklin) December 23, 2013\n\nKen Gordon was one of my favorite Democrats, despite our frequent disagreements. Gone at 63: http://t.co/I4fAN99Mhh \u2014 Ari Armstrong (@ariarmstrong) December 23, 2013\n\nAnd on Facebook, from former Rep. Matt Knoedler, R-Lakewood:\n\n\u201cKen Gordon gave the best speech at our new legislator orientation in 2004. He explained how the legislature brings people from such different political and personal backgrounds into close quarters, and you come to appreciate your colleagues and their views in ways that are hard to describe back home in our districts. It was true and special, and so was Ken Gordon. May he rest in peace.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Alan Franklin,Ari Armstrong,Ken Gordon,Mark Ferrandino,Matt Knoedler,Referendum C", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Tributes poured in Sunday for Ken Gordon, a 63-year-old former lawmaker who unexpectedly died Sunday.", "title": "Denver Democrat Ken Gordon, a man to remember", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2013/12/22/ken-gordon-denver-lawmaker/103772/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2013/12/KenGordonMug-495x743.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Tributes poured in Sunday for Ken Gordon, a 63-year-old former lawmaker who unexpectedly died Sunday.", "title": "Denver Democrat Ken Gordon, the underdog\u2019s champion", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2013/12/22/ken-gordon-denver-lawmaker/103772/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2013/12/KenGordonMug-495x743.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Tributes poured in Sunday for Ken Gordon, a 63-year-old former lawmaker who unexpectedly died Sunday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca269\"", "article_summary": "It was true and special, and so was Ken Gordon.\nSocial media was filled with tributes for Gordon after the Denver Post tonight reported his death:Ken Gordon was a great man who did great things for Colorado.\n#coleg \u2014 Mark Ferrandino (@MarkFerrandino) December 23, 2013Ken Gordon was an honest man without fear or favor.\n#copolitics #coleg \u2014 Alan Franklin (@alanfranklin) December 23, 2013Ken Gordon was one of my favorite Democrats, despite our frequent disagreements.\nI told him I still remembered his awarding-winning shark ad the first time he ran for secretary of state."}
