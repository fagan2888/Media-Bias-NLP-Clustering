The link was to an AP story reporting that two weeks ago, House Republicans stealthily voted for a measure that changed an aspect of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat? I know. In other words, Congress amends bill it passed a few years ago. In a normal moral universe, this would scarcely qualify as news. But when we speak of the House of Representatives, we are in the modern Republican Party\u2019s moral universe, and there, the rules are different.\n\nYou see, by agreeing to amend Obamacare, Republicans are acknowledging the law\u2019s existence and legitimacy. The only things they\u2019re supposed to be doing with Obamacare are burning copies of it on the Capitol steps and voting to repeal it. But here they\u2019ve done the exact opposite. And what made it even worse was the way they did it. The change was very quietly tucked into a larger bill, the Medicare \u201cdoc fix,\u201d which helps payments to doctors who serve Medicare patients keep pace with inflation. Only House majority leadership\u2014the Republicans\u2014can do that. And then, to make matters still worse, the yellow-bellied quislings passed the thing by voice vote, so no one had to be on the record.\n\nThe change, by the way, removes deductible caps from certain plans small businesses can offer their employees. This allows the employers, according to the AP, to offer cheaper plans to individuals who also have health savings accounts, which conservatives have been pushing for 15 or 20 years. Only around 30 percent of American businesses offer HSAs, and large employers are more likely to include them than small ones. Hence, the target of opportunity for HSA partisans. So the change accomplished a GOP policy goal. But funny thing: apparently not a single Republican member of the House trumpeted the change or even said a word about it when the vote took place March 27.\n\nIt hardly matters what the change was. It could have been that the purchase of armor-piercing bullets was now covered under Obamacare and it wouldn\u2019t help: The fact that Republicans used the ACA as the vehicle with which to make this change was the crime. Oh, did I have a jolly afternoon reading through the comment thread at Free Republic:\n\n\u201cThe uniparty at work!\u201d\n\n\u201cAppeasement Weasels.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoice vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll say it right now: The Republican Party does not want Obamacare to be repealed and will not support candidates who do. I\u2019d love to have someone come back around November 1, 2016 and show me that this prediction was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe G.O.P. (GAVE OBAMA POWER) is the party that created RomneyCARE/ObamaCARE\n\nand imposed it FOR ALL, FOR ROMNEY, FOREVER.\u201d\n\n\u201cBastards!\u201d\n\nYou get the picture. So do we take away from this?\n\nI think we take away from it that some of these \u201cFreepers,\u201d as they\u2019re called on that site, are on to something. Republicans don\u2019t really want to repeal Obamacare. Or no: they almost certainly want to, but they know they probably can\u2019t. So even while they froth away for the cameras and town-hall meetings, there\u2019s another, smaller, darker part of them that knows the truth, or the likely truth, which is that Hillary Clinton appears likely to be the next president, the Democrats will recapture the Senate in 2016 or vastly increase their majority if they didn\u2019t lose it in 2014, and by the end of the next President Clinton\u2019s first term, Obamacare will be nailed to the floor.\n\nRemember, this happened on March 27: four days before the ACA\u2019s enrollment deadline arrived, and therefore well before anyone knew the number would hit the target of seven million. So they were out there, on Fox and on all those acidic radio shows they do, talking about what a world-historical failure Obamacare was going to prove to be in just a matter of days, while meanwhile, with no one recording the roll call, they were buying shares of it.\n\nThis brings to mind some things I\u2019ve read about civil rights and the Dixiecrats. The liberal Northern senators used to chat among themselves in the early and mid-1960s, wondering which of their Southern colleagues really and truly believed the racist pollution that poured out of their mouths. The consensus at the time was that Strom Thurmond really did. Richard Russell. Most of them, however, sorta-kinda believed it but just said it, because they knew that as long as they were 110 percenters on what they called \u201cthe n\u2014\u2014-r question,\u201d they could get reelected \u2018til the end of time provided they weren\u2019t caught with the proverbial live boy or dead girl.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Eastland was as hard-shell as they came. But somehow, he and Hart became friends anyway. And so one day on the Senate floor, after delivering himself of a hideous racial tirade, as he walked back toward his desk, Eastland caught his friend Hart\u2019s eye and winked.\n\nWho knows how much of that kind of winking is taking place on the House floor now? \u201cHey, Steny, I don\u2019t really mean everything I say \u2019bout y\u2019all, but old so-and-so from the next district over just gave one helluva stemwinder about health care the other day, and I can\u2019t let myself be out-Obamacared, know\u2019ut I mean?\u201d Oh, of course some Republicans are fire-breathers and diehards. But others seem to understand that if you\u2019re going to try to have actual policy impact in the real world, you have to play ball in the real world.
