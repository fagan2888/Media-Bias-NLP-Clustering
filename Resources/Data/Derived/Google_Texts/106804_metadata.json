Al Sharpton, who introduced the doctor by noting the two \u201cprobably don\u2019t even agree that today is Wednesday.\u201d Over the last few years, the retired neurosurgeon has become an outspoken critic of President Obama and a popular figure in the conservative movement, after decades as a more aspirational figure, as a pioneering, world-class surgeon who is also black.\n\nThat legacy has splintered somewhat following Carson\u2019s more outlandish comments in recent years (comparing homosexuality with bestiality and pedophilia, for instance). The tension was not a secret on Wednesday \u2014 Carson began his speech by thanking \u201cmy good brother Sharpton for having the courage to invite me to come.\u201d\n\nHis message to the largely black crowd was the one he often delivers: self-reliance and independence with a mix of social conservatism. \u201cI don\u2019t hate gay people; I just happen to believe that marriage is between a man and a woman,\u201d told the audience to some applause. The audience also welcomed his insistence that \u201cthere is nothing that even slightly compares to slavery\u201d in American history, though few, if any, went along as Carson pivoted to defending his previous statements that the Affordable Care Act is the worst thing \u201csince slavery\u201d with the emphasis on the word \u201csince.\u201d\n\nThose past comments loom large in the media landscape as Carson prepares for the likely White House bid. In the interview with BuzzFeed News, Carson \u2014 who is soft-spoken and formal (his adviser requested his interviewer remove his hat before speaking) \u2014 delivered a more tempered tone on LGBT issues.\n\nShould transgender people be legally protected from discrimination? \u201cI think federal law should protect all American citizens from discrimination,\u201d he replied.\n\nHow would Carson react if one of his sons were gay? \u201cI would still love him, just like I love all gay people,\u201d he said. Would attend his wedding, though, should he choose to marry another man? He was less sure (\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d). But, Carson had a question in response \u2014 is there a place for same-sex marriage opponents?\n\n\u201cWhat I would ask \u2014 I think, maybe BuzzFeed can get an answer to this question: What position can a person who believes in traditional marriage, between one man and one woman, have, who has absolutely no animosity or opposition to gay people \u2013 what position can they take that would be satisfactory to the gay community?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause if they can give me an answer to that, I\u2019m quite willing to seriously consider it. But so far I haven\u2019t been able to find anybody who can give me an answer \u2014 it\u2019s sort of like, \u2018Nope! It has to be my way or the highway.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, hopefully there\u2019s a level of tolerance in that community where they can actually come up with an answer,\u201d he continued.\n\nCarson\u2019s popularity within the social conservative base originates with these kinds of beliefs \u2014 he\u2019s a deeply Christian social conservative, a true believer. But as he runs for president, he won\u2019t be the only person in this space. Sen. Ted Cruz last month announced his own bid at Liberty University, the Christian college, while former Gov. Rick Perry and current Gov. Bobby Jindal have also made a point of courting socially conservative, tea party-minded Republicans.\n\nOn Wednesday, Carson was reluctant to criticize other candidates. Asked how a Carson administration would differ from a Cruz administration, Carson offered only, \u201cWe\u2019re different people.\u201d He elaborated with a stock answer that described his own beliefs in the broadest possible terms (\u201cthe people are supposed to be the pinnacle of power in the system that we have established\u201d) and sounded a lot like\u2026 Ted Cruz.\n\nWhere Carson has more to say is health care and the intersection between that issue and broader social issues. Carson once served on a committee on bioethics under President George W. Bush\u2019s tenure, a time when one of the core issues at the crossing between social conservatism and science \u2014 embryonic stem-cell research \u2014 dominated the conversation. For his part, Carson said he wouldn\u2019t stop research already in progress on embryonic stem cells, but noted that \u201ca lot of the research in recent years has demonstrated that the very best stem cells are mature stem cells that are de-differentiated back to the potential stage. Those are much easier to control, where the embryonic stem cells have a tendency to go off in wild directions and frequently create tumors. A lot of the research now doesn\u2019t involve embryonic stem cells for that reason.\u201d\n\nThe level of consideration isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 the neurosurgeon proposed dramatic changes to the U.S. health care system as early as 20 years ago in Harvard publications, a plan that involved socializing catastrophic care and decoupling health care from employment. He has since disavowed the plan. \u201cI\u2019ve subsequently decided that it\u2019s better just to scrap the whole system, and come up with something that makes a lot more sense,\u201d he said Wednesday of the plan.\n\nToday, he proposes health savings accounts for everyone, \u201cfrom the day they were born until the day that they die, which they can pass on at the time that they die.\u201d He would strip the laws that bar people from buying care across state lines. For the poor, the amount of money spent on Medicaid \u2014 roughly $5,000 per person, by his calculations \u2014 was enough that it could potentially be re-routed to any number of options, including purchasing \u201cboutique\u201d plans for the poor. (\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting that that\u2019s what you do, but I\u2019m saying that those are the kind of resources that are already allocated,\u201d Carson was quick to point out.)\n\nAnd on that front, Carson, who frequently rails against the welfare state as part of his message about self-reliance, argued that giving all Americans health savings accounts would incentivize them to make cost-saving decisions about their own care, in a way that current law does not \u2014 using food stamps as an example.\n\n\u201cSome people say: \u2018Mehhh \u2013 people are not responsible enough to be able to do things like that,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what they said about food stamps, they said: \u2018You can\u2019t give people food stamps; they won\u2019t know how to use \u2018em. They\u2019ll go out and buy porterhouse steak the first five days, and then they\u2019ll starve the rest of the month, and they\u2019ll be out in the street begging.\u2019\n\n\u201cDid that happen? No! People learn to buy rice, and hamburger helper, and a little bit of corn, and beans, and they learn how to \u2013 and people are smarter than we think they are, and we have to start, at some point, depending on people to be able to manage their own lives,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 3748813, "userid": 2111783}, "description": "\"What position can a person who believes in traditional marriage... what position can they take that would be satisfactory to the gay...", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
