7,000 pounds of crawfish. That's how much was on hand Saturday evening at the Frank Cochran Center.

Many digging in during the Meridian Symphony League's annual crawfish boil. This is the 33rd year of the boil, which is put on every year as a way to raise money for the orchestra. Meridian Symphony League President Ashley Massey says it's important to take pride in having a local orchestra.

"Everything that we make off this goes straight to them. It's a local orchestra in town and it's our little treasure," Massey says.

Massey says the turnout wasn't as big as in years past but it was a big turnout.
