Canipe reached into his truck bed for his cane, and Knox fired several shots at Canipe, hitting him once in the lung. Canipe survived the shooting, and Knox was put on paid leave. This week, dashcam video of the incident was released. Watch below:\n\nPrior to the shooting Knox does not sound like he said anything specific to Canpie, except a \u201chey, sir, sir\u201d that gets louder and turns into an \u201cohhh\u201d that indicates Knox believed Canipe had reached for a gun. This appears to contradict what police said at a press conference after the shooting, that Canipe exited his vehicle despite being told not to. An order not to exit the vehicle is not heard in the dashcam video.\n\nKnox is heard telling Canipe to drop the gun only after firing several shots at him. He realizes his mistake after Canipe\u2019s response (inaudible to me) to the order to drop the gun. Knox is heard sobbing as he tried to help Canipe, promising \u201cto God it looked like a shotgun.\u201d His response is noteworthy for how rarely it seems to happen. Nevertheless, the county\u2019s sheriff, Bruce Bryant, continues to defend the shooting, insisting Knox had no way to tell the old man wasn\u2019t reaching for a shotgun. Bryant also said at a press conference this week that in Knox\u2019s position he would have done the same thing, a troubling statement in view of Knox\u2019s apparent regret in the moments after the shooting.\n\nThe state\u2019s Law Enforcement Division is investigating the incident.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "South Carolina deputy thought the cane was a shotgun, is heard on the video sobbing after realizing his error", "title": "Dashcam Video Released in Police Shooting of 70-Year-Old Man Reaching For His Cane", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/03/14/dashcam-video-released-in-police-shootin", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13948179214991.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last month, Terrence Knox, a sheriff\u2019s deputy in York County,\nSouth Carolina,&nbsp;shot\n70-year-old Bobby Canipe during a traffic stop over expired\nplates.
