If those efforts failed, however, the measure would automatically raise funding levels to those proposed by Obama in his fiscal 2016 budget.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress and the White House remain miles apart on how to fund agencies past Sept. 30, when the current appropriation bills are set to expire. Obama has promised to veto any bill that does not raise spending beyond the amount required by sequestration.\n\nDemocratic Reps. Chris Van Hollen, Md., Nita Lowey, N.Y., Rosa DeLauro, Conn., and Barbara Lee, Calif., introduced the 2015 Prevent a Shutdown Act on Thursday, though it is unlikely to accomplish its stated goal. Republicans have consistently derided Obama\u2019s budget for its spending increases and are unlikely to go along with any plan that could automatically implement them.\n\nThe less-than-stellar odds did not stop the efforts of the lawmakers, who are desperate to avoid an appropriations lapse.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, Republicans forced a shameful and damaging government shutdown,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cToday, we face another self-inflicted wound to our economy because the GOP refuses to come to the table and negotiate.\u201d\n\nThe bill would boost funding for both Defense and non-Defense discretionary accounts.\n\nAlso on Thursday, conservative House members vowed to vote against spending bills -- including a stopgap continuing resolution -- regardless of the overall spending levels. Instead, House Freedom Caucus members said they would vote against any appropriations measure that continued federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nObama has also threatened to veto any bill that defunds the women\u2019s health organization. Freedom Caucus leader Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, remains undeterred. He said in an interview on C-SPAN Thursday that if he and his colleagues make their case in a \u201ccompelling, repetitive way,\u201d the American people would be understanding of his tactics.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Katz", "description": "Others vow to press forward with shutdown strategy.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Others vow to press forward with shutdown strategy.", "title": "Lawmakers: Give Obama What He Wants to Avoid Shutdown", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/09/lawmakers-give-obama-what-he-wants-avoid-shutdown/120845/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/11/20894929512_1dcd2cf50e_o.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Others vow to press forward with shutdown strategy.", "creator": "@EricM_Katz", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/11/20894929512_1dcd2cf50e_o/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Lawmakers: Give Obama What He Wants to Avoid Shutdown", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-11T20:33:04Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/11/20894929512_1dcd2cf50e_o.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Lawmakers: Give Obama What He Wants to Avoid Shutdown", "keywords": "shutdown, chris van hollen, government shutdown, planned parenthood", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/09/11/20894929512_1dcd2cf50e_o/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "shutdown,chris-van-hollen,government-shutdown,channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-short,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Others vow to press forward with shutdown strategy."}, "article_summary": "Several Democrats have an idea to stave off the looming government shutdown: give President Obama exactly what he wants.\nIf those efforts failed, however, the measure would automatically raise funding levels to those proposed by Obama in his fiscal 2016 budget.\n\u201cTwo years ago, Republicans forced a shameful and damaging government shutdown,\u201d Van Hollen said.\nObama has promised to veto any bill that does not raise spending beyond the amount required by sequestration.\nThe less-than-stellar odds did not stop the efforts of the lawmakers, who are desperate to avoid an appropriations lapse."}
