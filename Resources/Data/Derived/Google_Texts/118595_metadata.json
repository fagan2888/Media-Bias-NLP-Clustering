(Republican Eagle photo by Kyle Stevens)\n\nNORTHFIELD \u2013 Emi Trost has run the gamut of emotions in her five state cross-country meets. As an eighth-grader, there was the excitement of simply being there, followed by that feeling of getting better when she finished 10th as a freshman.\n\nTwo years ago, Trost finished second to Blake\u2019s Clare Flanagan, a moment, for better or worse, that the Cannon Falls senior would relive again in 2012.\n\nThat feeling off a loss would not happen Saturday as Trost claimed the Class A girls championship, capping a stellar career with the best of emotions.\n\n\u201c(It feels) amazing,\u201d Trost said moments after she crossed the finish line in 14 minutes, 40.3 seconds. \u201cI prayed for it, but, yet again, I was like, \u2018God, whatever is part of your plan, I\u2019ll accept that.\u2019 So, obviously, it was part of His plan.\u201d\n\nNo girl in Class A had been ranked No. 1 this season other than Trost, making her the easy pick to claim the gold medal at Saturday\u2019s state cross-country meet at St. Olaf College. But Trost was among several competitors when the group came back through the starting area. But that would be the last time Trost would have to deal with any other runner as she pulled away through the woods.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s usually when people who try to stay with you tend to get a little more tired,\u201d Trost said. \u201cI knew that, so I don\u2019t even know if I consciously pulled away, or if I just kept going.\u201d\n\nBut even Trost was feeling the effects of her speed.\n\n\u201cI felt tired, but strong. It\u2019s a weird combination,\u201d Trost said.\n\nIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter how tired Trost may have been. She had pulled clear of the field by about 10 seconds, leaving a few hundred yards between her and a state title.\n\n\u201cI knew I had about a 400 left and a steep hill, but right about there, I could hear people cheer for their runner \u2026 and being a senior, I\u2019ve kind of learned how to judge how far back they are,\u201d Trost said.\n\nAs Trost came to the top of the hill that opens into the final stretch, it was just the Bomber and a tunnel of fans cheering her on.\n\nA few seconds later, Trost crossed under the banner that said \u201cFinish,\u201d raising her arms before collapsing. Some event personnel carried Trost to the medical tent where she exited after a minute, cup of water in hand, state title under her belt and a wide smile on her face as she exchanged hugs with a dozen fans.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good runners out here, and they all worked hard pushed their best,\u201d Trost said. \u201cMy time wasn\u2019t exactly what I wanted. But, hey, that doesn\u2019t matter in the limelight of a state championship.\u201d\n\nLake City also had an individual in Northfield in Carl Kozlowski. The freshman Tiger placed 50th in the boys\u2019 race with a time of 17:17.5. The Lake City girls team also competed, placing ninth with a total of 232 points. Annandale won the Class A girls team title with 85 points.\n\nSidney Renelt (16:04.8) and Liv Kozlowski (16:07.5) led the Tigers with 29th and 30th places, respectively. Morgan Dammann (16:29.2), Hannah Alitz (16:35.1) and Lydia Taylor (16:36.3) closed the scoring for Lake City.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "sports,high school,cross-country,cannon falls bombers,Lake City Tigers", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kyle Stevens", "og": {"site_name": "Republican Eagle", "description": "NORTHFIELD \u2013 Emi Trost has run the gamut of emotions in her five state cross-country meets.
