But there's a shortage of care providers in cities, as well.\n\n\"Even in Grand Rapids we saw significant access problems,\" Udow-Phillips says. \"Saginaw, Flint, Detroit -- it's not just rural areas.\"\n\nUdow-Phillips says providers need to look for creative solutions. One option may be telemedicine.\n\n\"It could be physicians calling psychiatrists or primary-care physicians who are not trained in mental issues,\" Udow-Phillips says. \"They can help in medication. They can consult with them on how to treat a particular patient who might be in their office at that moment.\n\n\"We also need more social workers, more technology to help expand the adequacy of psychiatrists we have in the state.\"\n\nInpatient facilities are also lacking, according to CHRT.\n\n\"Michigan has very few inpatient beds. We rank 42nd out of 50 states in terms of the number of psychiatric beds per population,\" Udow-Phillips says. \"If you talk to psychiatrists, they will tell you that they have patients sitting in their emergency rooms for 24, 36 hours or longer, looking for a bed where this patient can be admitted.\n\nExpanded services will, of course, require more funding. Udow-Phillips says Gov. Rick Snyder is expected to propose a $50 million supplemental budget increase next week to fund more mental health services.\n\nThe governor's proposal includes bringing substance use treatment into the community mental health system, Udow-Phillips says. \"Physicians are telling us they have extreme difficulty in finding access to those services. We see individuals being sent out of state to get residential substance abuse treatment.\"\n\nCHRT's report finds that survey respondents with depression and/or anxiety reported an average of five days per month in which poor health limited their activities of daily living, including work.\n\nThe report says it's estimated that nationwide, depression results in a direct loss of $31 billion in productivity annually.\n\nFor more information, see the report \"Access to mental health Care in Michigan.\"", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Michigan's mental health care providers are already stretched far beyond capacity, according to an Ann Arbor research agency.
