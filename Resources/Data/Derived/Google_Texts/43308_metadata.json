Obama and his deputies stoked the subsequent controversy in the run-up to the 2014 election, in the hope of boosting African-American turnout. The mobilization effort failed, partly because local law-enforcement officials released a video showing Brown\u2019s strong-arm robbery of a store shortly before the fatal shooting.\n\nNow Obama is trying to expand progressive control by attaching more conditions to federal funding of state and local law-enforcement efforts. \u201cWe can expand the [federally-funded] COPS program\u2026 to see if we can get more incentives for local communities to apply some of the best practices and lessons that are embodied in this report,\u201d he said.\n\nThose best practices likely will eventually include rules that restrict police investigations of groups that are part of the Democratic coalition, and rules that try to lower convictions and penalties among favored sub-groups of the United States, regardless of the actual rates of illegal activity among those groups.\n\n\u201cI think communities [with police forces] across the board are going to need to consider\u2026 recommendations around prohibiting racial profiling [and] that\u2019s a step that we\u2019ve already taken at the federal level,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe report also calls for government to collect more data about state and local policing. That data will help federal officials impose new rules. \u201cWe need more information to find out how to take to scale best practices when it comes to training so that police officers are able to work in a way that reduces the possibilities of bias,\u201c Obama said.\n\nState and local policing may need to be subordinated to federal social policy, Obama suggested. \u201cOur approach to our drug laws, for example, and criminalization of nonviolent offenses rather than taking more of a public health approach \u2014 that may be something that has an impact in eroding trust between law enforcement and communities.\u201d\n\nThose political goals are echoed in the tasks force\u2019s interim report.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement agencies should acknowledge the role of policing in past and present injustice and discrimination and how it is a hurdle to the promotion of community trust,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe Federal Government, as well as state and local agencies, should encourage and incentivize higher education for law enforcement officers.\u201d\n\nOther recommendations include \u201cLaw enforcement agencies should engage community members in the training process\u2026. [government] should ensure that basic recruit and in-service officer training include curriculum on the disease of addiction\u2026 Law enforcement agencies should implement training for officers that covers policies for interactions with the LGBTQ population, including issues such as determining gender identity for arrest placement, the Muslim, Arab, and South Asian communities, and immigrant or non-English speaking groups, as well as reinforcing policies for the prevention of sexual misconduct and harassment..\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s strategy matches the progressive playbook, which continuously expands progressives\u2019 power by gradually adding more conditions to federal aid. That same strategy is implemented in education via the \u201cCommon Core\u201d education plan, in the health-sector via Obamacare, in the banking industry via the mortgage rules that caused the damaging property bubble and in housing via Obama\u2019s \u201cregionalism\u201d plan.\n\nThat\u2019s strategically different from prior Democratic administrations, which cited poverty as a justification for expanding federal aid. The unemployment rate for African-Americans in Ferguson is roughly 16 percent.\n\nIn his Monday statement, Obama did not mention unemployment.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "You can keep your local police if you want, promise!", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "President Barack Obama has introduced his plan for a progressive takeover of state and local policing.    \u201cWe have a great opportunity\u2026 to really transform how we think about community law enforce", "title": "Obama Unveils National ObamaLaw Plan", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/02/obama-unveils-national-obamalaw-plan/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamaholder.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "You can keep your local police if you want, promise!", "title": "Obama Unveils National ObamaLaw Plan Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/02/obama-unveils-national-obamalaw-plan/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamaholder.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-02 16:28:31", "sailthru.title": "Obama Unveils National ObamaLaw Plan", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,ferguson,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,ferguson", "sailthru.description": "President Barack Obama has introduced his plan for a progressive takeover of state and local policing.    \u201cWe have a great opportunity\u2026 to really transform how we think about community law enforce", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/obamaholder.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb65\"", "article_summary": "4487160President Barack Obama has introduced his plan for a progressive takeover of state and local policing.\nObama also instructed his media allies to help federalize policing, and to sideline the critics of centralized policing rules.\n\u201cWe have a great opportunity\u2026 to really transform how we think about community law enforcement relations,\u201d he said March 2.\nState and local policing may need to be subordinated to federal social policy, Obama suggested.\nNow Obama is trying to expand progressive control by attaching more conditions to federal funding of state and local law-enforcement efforts."}
