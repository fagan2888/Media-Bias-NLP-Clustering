That focus will drive improved reimbursement, coverage and outcomes, and we are excited to both support HCN's vision and jointly define innovative approaches to value-based insurance for the entire industry.\"\n\nInnovating Quality Measures and Insurance Design Models\n\nWithin the building of a national data platform focused on population health management, Wellcentive will submit and track varying data types, including Health Effectiveness Data and Information Set measures for HCN providers, and anticipates building new Uniform Data System measures reporting as part of the federal government's Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) grants to health centers treating underserved communities.\n\nHRSA-funded health centers are evaluated on performance measures around quality, outcomes and disparities, financial viability and costs.\n\n\"We are constantly being presented with new opportunities and challenges by evolving payment models, and we are motivated to explore the best ways to keep what are often our country's most vulnerable patients engaged,\" added Romillo.\n\nTo meet that goal, HCN and Wellcentive are partnering to analyze the costs, care plan adherence and outcomes of VBID programs.\n\n\"Constructed as part of the Affordable Care Act's goals to lower healthcare costs and improve clinical quality among Medicare patients requiring chronic care, value-based insurance is seen as an alternative to high-deductible plans by shifting costs from short-term patient expenses to long-term savings for the healthcare system,\" said Zajac, \"and we want to help HCN contribute to developing these models.\"\n\nThe models waive or lower copays to motivate patients to seek recommended care. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is planning a five-year, seven-state demonstration project to test effectiveness beginning in January of 2017.\n\nAbout Health Choice Network\n\nHealth Choice Network, Inc. is a successful nationwide and collaborative management services organization serving health centers, health center-controlled networks and partners.
