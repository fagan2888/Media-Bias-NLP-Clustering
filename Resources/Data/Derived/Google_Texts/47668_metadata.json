The versatile 6-foot-1 senior forward from Portland\u2019s Jesuit High School has been an influential role player for the 2015-16 Ducks, who are 7-0 entering this afternoon\u2019s game against Portland.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to jinx us,\u201d Brenner said when asked if this group reminded her of any of the championship-caliber teams she has played on at Oregon.\n\n\u201cBut the year we went to the national championship for volleyball, we were undefeated through preseason also.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a great way to start.\u201d\n\nBrenner is coming off the bench for second-year coach Kelly Graves, averaging 5.7 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in a deeper rotation. Her leadership in the locker room is invaluable for a transitioning program seeking its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2005.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s on a level of her own,\u201d standout Ducks forward Jillian Alleyne said of Brenner\u2019s impact at Oregon. \u201cShe\u2019s competed at the highest level in every sport. She\u2019s confident, she knows what she can do and what she can\u2019t do, and she never goes outside of herself.\n\n\u201cAs a team we want to get where she\u2019s been in those sports.\u201d\n\nAlleyne, on the watch lists for the Naismith Trophy and Wooden Award, is averaging 17.7 points and 14 rebounds. The senior has more help in the paint this season playing alongside 6-5 forward Jacinta Vandenburg (7.1 ppg, 5.3 rpg).\n\nBrenner and true freshman Oti Gildon have also been giving the team quality minutes. The improved depth in the post frees Lexi Bando (13.7 ppg), Lexi Petersen (12.7 ppg) and the other guards up for open perimeter shots.\n\n\u201cHow many sports has she played here? Liz is such a beast,\u201d Bando said after scoring a career-high 35 points on 12-for-17 shooting during a recent win over San Jose State. \u201cShe\u2019s not afraid to go up with it, she\u2019s an amazing passer and it\u2019s so fun to play with her. She plays with so much poise and confidence. Our posts are all different, so it\u2019s super cool what they all bring.\u201d\n\nTrue freshman point guard Maite Cazorla has 46 assists and only 14 turnovers through seven games. Graves compared Brenner\u2019s outlet passes to how Kevin Love throws them in the NBA.\n\n\u201cEvery day I\u2019m more and more impressed with Liz,\u201d Graves said after Thursday\u2019s practice. \u201cShe has a high basketball IQ; she just understands sports.\u201d\n\nBrenner played for previous Ducks coach Paul Westhead but left the program in January 2014 and did not rejoin the team until this past June when Graves offered her a chance to exhaust her eligibility on the hardwood.\n\n\u201cI definitely knew over the summer when I was training with the basketball team for the first time that this was different than it had been before,\u201d Brenner said. \u201cDifferent in a good way. So that was exciting to see and be a part of.\u201d\n\nOregon has four nonconference games remaining, all at home, before beginning Pac-12 play on Jan. 2 at UCLA.\n\nEven if the Ducks get to 11-0, and perhaps into the national rankings this month, Brenner understands there is still a lot of work to do for the program to reach its postseason goals.\n\nSo far, the march to March is off to a promising start.\n\n\u201cI think we are working really well together,\u201d Brenner said. \u201cThe coaches know exactly what we need to do, when we need to do it, and everyone is just playing so well together. I think it\u2019s going to be a really fun year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EUGENE \u2014 Liz Brenner has played for a national championship in volleyball, participated in the Women\u2019s College World Series with the Ducks\u2019 softball team and celebrated Oregon\u2019s first NCAA women\u2019s track and field title in three decades.
