But it's somehow supposed to be \"more comfortable\" for young learners, in the estimation of standards peddlers.\n\nHow parents must long for the good old days of rote memorization! (Incidentally, a recent Stanford University study found that rote memorization is important for developing brains.)\n\nThe videos also illustrate why adapting to Core-aligned curriculum is a difficult\u2014and expensive\u2014process for schools.
