Brookings, SD

The emergency manager of Brookings County says he picked up some lessons while observing the aftermath of a tornado in the community of Delmont.



The tornado struck the area May 10, damaging or destroying 84 structures in and around Delmont and injuring nine people. Bob Hill tells The Brookings Register that he has had a strictly observational role in the cleanup, but learned from seeing the emergency response firsthand.



Hill says he found out that officials waited about five days after the tornado to begin cleanup so residents could sort through debris and have closure. He says this also gave residents time to grieve.



A new credentialing system caught Hill's attention, with different colors assigned to homeowners, volunteers and officials. He says the system seemed to work well.
