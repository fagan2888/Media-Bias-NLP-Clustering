And with New England in the grip of a snowstorm, a four-hour wait at the airport in Tampa, he may have had second thoughts.\n\nBut with his candidate, Hillary Clinton, in a dogfight against Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he said he wouldn\u2019t be anywhere else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just here as a volunteer, just doing what I can to help energize some of the walkers that are going out,\u201d he said after giving a pep talk to a handful of local residents in Pembroke, New Hampshire, about to go door-to-door for Clinton.\n\n\u201cI want her to win,\u201d Buckhorn said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me. It\u2019s important for the country. It\u2019s important for young girls all over America who will now have a role model and know that there are no barriers, so I\u2019m just up here doing my part.\u201d\n\nThat included knocking on doors himself. As he told the people who had gathered at the home of Sylvia Percovich, he believes he won his officer in 2011 by knocking on more than 20,000 doors.\n\n\u201cJust know that you are absolutely making a difference,\u201d he told the group. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the polls say, just go out there and work hard.\u201d\n\nThe polls say that while Sanders lead has eroded about 1.3 points in the Granite State since Monday, he still maintains a 16.7-point advantage.\n\nBuckhorn said he gets the Sanders phenomenon, and that he loves seeing so many young people involved in the political process this year. He doesn\u2019t think some of Sander\u2019s major proposals are realistic, though, and said Clinton is as prepared as anyone he\u2019s ever followed to govern \u201cin a more pragmatic and practical fashion.\u201d\n\nBuckhorn said flatly that he doesn\u2019t believe Sanders\u2019 signature issues such as a single-payer health care system will ever happen. He noted how difficult it was for Barack Obama to get the Affordable Care Act passed.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Buckhorn has been a major supporter of the Clintons, and is part of the Democratic establishment flocking to New Hampshire this weekend to make the race competitive.\n\nOn Sunday, Buckhorn will appear at another get-out-the-vote effort in Derry, before flying back to Tampa to his day job Monday morning.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn didn\u2019t have to be in New Hampshire this weekend.
