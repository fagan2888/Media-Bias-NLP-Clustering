Steven Horsford, Nevada Democrat, said at a hearing held by House Oversight\u2019s subcommittee on health.\n\nMedicare pays for one-fifth of health care services nationwide but is on track for financial depletion by 2026, so cracking down on fraud and abuse is paramount, according to subcommittee Chairman Rep. James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican.\n\nBut there is a massive backlog of about 460,000 appeals that must be reviewed by administrative law judges once recovery auditors flag potentially improper payments, he said.\n\nSEE ALSO: Twenty states throw support behind lawsuit aimed at overturning Obamacare\n\n\u201cNot many businesses can survive having their money held for 28 months while they wait [for the process] to decide if they\u2019re actually going to get reimbursed,\u201d Mr. Lankford said.\n\nShantanu Agrawal, deputy administrator for program integrity at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the agency is trying to find a balance between protecting the program\u2019s integrity and trying to lower the burden on providers.\n\nHe said the agency is taking steps to make sure the appeals process is fair and not cumbersome, although lawmakers frequently sparred with Mr. Agrawal over how long it is taking for the government to reform the process.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office issued a report Tuesday that said the government should try to stop improper payments before they go out the door.\n\nIt also said that while the percentage of Medicare claims requiring post-payment review remains quite small, the overall number of reviews is increasing and contributing the backlog of appeals.\n\nBrian P. Ritchie, an official at the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office, said Medicare should clarify its rules so providers understand their obligations.\n\n\u201cAll fraud is certainly improper payments, but all improper payments are not fraud. And most of these providers are not committing fraud, they just don\u2019t understand a complex system,\u201d he told the House panel.\n\nGovernment officials and contractors have made progress in recouping fraudulent payments overall \u2014 reeling in nearly $6 billion through audits and investigations and saving more than $19 billion as a result of legislative and regulatory actions in fiscal 2013, he said.\n\nYet there is ample room for improvement. Improper payments costs taxpayers and beneficiaries about $50 billion each year, he said, and inappropriate prescribing and billing for unnecessary drugs is a persistent problem.\n\nHe also said a third of home health-services claims did not satisfy an Obamacare provision requiring practitioners to document face-to-face encounters with the Medicare patients they certify.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration's efforts to crack down on bogus Medicare payments have ended up sweeping in too many \"good actors\" who get ensnared in a costly and tedious appeals process, House lawmakers said Tuesday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on bogus Medicare payments have ended up sweeping in too many \u201cgood actors\u201d who get ensnared in a costly and tedious appeals process, House lawmakers said Tuesday.", "title": "Lawmakers worry that Medicare fraud crackdown has gone astray", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/20/lawmakers-worry-medicare-fraud-crackdown-has-gone-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/20/e2ff5509d4ab7902490f6a706700213c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/20/e2ff5509d4ab7902490f6a706700213c.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration's efforts to crack down on bogus Medicare payments have ended up sweeping in too many \"good actors\" who get ensnared in a costly and tedious appeals process, House lawmakers s", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers worry that Medicare fraud crackdown has gone astray"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Medicare, James Lankford"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAll fraud is certainly improper payments, but all improper payments are not fraud.\nLawmakers said some health providers have become reluctant to take seniors on Medicare.\nThe Government Accountability Office issued a report Tuesday that said the government should try to stop improper payments before they go out the door.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s efforts to crack down on bogus Medicare payments have ended up sweeping in too many \u201cgood actors\u201d who get ensnared in a costly and tedious appeals process, House lawmakers said Tuesday.\nBut there is a massive backlog of about 460,000 appeals that must be reviewed by administrative law judges once recovery auditors flag potentially improper payments, he said."}
