We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS which is a danger to us as well as the region, and we finally have a U.N. Security Council resolution bringing the world together to go after a political transition.\u201d\n\nSecond, Mrs. Clinton asserted during the debate that Donald Trump is becoming \u201cISIS\u2019s best recruiter.\u201d She went on to charge that \u201cthey are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.\u201d\n\nThird, Mrs. Clinton described the growing cost of health care and skyrocketing premiums as a \u201cglitch\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nFirst, the idea that \u201cwe are where we need to be\u201d with ISIS will strike most Americans as delusional in the Obama tradition. Most Americans believe that ISIS is winning. Virtually every week there are new attacks in new countries. People are just beginning to understand how big the problem of Islamic supremacism is.\n\nTo have Mrs. Clinton assert that we are just where we need to be will strike most Americans as an extraordinarily dangerous statement coming from a potential commander-in-chief.\n\nFurthermore, the logic built into her statement is a reminder of how deeply committed she is to the left\u2019s intellectual worldview.\n\nThe left believes that the United Nations is a big deal. To them, a U.N. resolution is a major victory. As Hillary put it, we are \u201cbringing the world together to go after a political transition.\u201d That is the language of the legalistic left dating back to President Woodrow Wilson, who thought he was fighting the war to end all wars. Instead, it turned out that World War I was the precursor to World War II which was followed by the Cold War and which has now been followed by the war with Islamic supremacists. Wilson ended, but war didn\u2019t.\n\nSo, after six years of failure in the Middle East, the failure of the \u201cRussian reset,\u201d the continued aggression of the Iranians (who have now launched two ballistic missile tests in clear violation of a U.N. resolution), Hillary continues to believe in a legalistic, diplomatic dance as the solution to a violent military problem.\n\nWhat \u201cpolitical transition\u201d in Syria is Hillary talking about? Who would impose such a transition? And if we are, in Hillary\u2019s mind, where we need to be, Americans should hope we never end up in a bad place because this one seems bad enough.\n\nHillary\u2019s second gift, her attack on Donald Trump, undermines her in two ways.\n\nFirst, every fact checker said there was no evidence to back up her claim that ISIS is using Mr. Trump in its recruitment videos. This further deepens the sense that Hillary lies and says anything she needs to without regard to facts.\n\nSecond, somewhat ironically it turned out that while ISIS does not currently use Mr. Trump in their videos, there is an American politician they do use. Unfortunately for Hillary, the famous American in the ISIS video is her husband, former President Bill Clinton. If Hillary had not attacked Trump about the ISIS video, it is possible no one would have noticed Bill was in the videos.\n\nHillary\u2019s third gift, her description of the exploding cost of health care as a \u201cglitch\u201d of Obamacare, may end up hurting her most of all. Mrs. Clinton implicitly acknowledges that Obamacare\u2019s failure has caused deductibles to go up by an average of 67 percent and health insurance costs to increase by 27 percent. Obamacare, of course, was supposed to deliver lower costs and more \u201caffordable\u201d care.\n\nHaving acknowledged that the government planning model she favors caused the spike in costs, how will Hillary explain that the solution is more government planning?\n\nIt isn\u2019t often that a candidate gives the opposition party three gifts for Christmas.\n\nRepublicans should be grateful to Hillary for this remarkable, if unintended, performance. The debate the Democrats hoped no one would notice has become a debate that will last for months \u2014 possibly all the way to Election Day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the Democratic presidential debate on Saturday night -- which was, by design, almost unwatched, even by President Obama himself -- Hillary Clinton gave republicans three unexpected but delightful Christmas gifts.", "Author": "Newt Gingrich", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In the Democratic presidential debate on Saturday night \u2014 which was, by design, almost unwatched, even by President Obama himself \u2014 Hillary Clinton gave republicans three unexpected but delightful Christmas gifts.", "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: Hillary\u2019s Christmas gifts for Republicans", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/22/newt-gingrich-hillarys-christmas-gift-republicans/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/22/dem_2016_clinton_students.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/22/dem_2016_clinton_students.jpeg", "title": "NEWT GINGRICH: Hillary\u2019s Christmas gifts for Republicans", "description": "In the Democratic presidential debate on Saturday night -- which was, by design, almost unwatched, even by President Obama himself -- Hillary Clinton gave republicans three unexpected but delightful C", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Hillary Clinton, Christmas"}, "article_summary": "Instead, it turned out that World War I was the precursor to World War II which was followed by the Cold War and which has now been followed by the war with Islamic supremacists.\nIn the Democratic presidential debate on Saturday night \u2014 which was, by design, almost unwatched, even by President Obama himself \u2014 Hillary Clinton gave Republicans three unexpected but delightful Christmas gifts.\nThe first gift was what Mrs. Clinton had to say about ISIS: \u201cWe now finally are where we need to be.\nMrs. Clinton implicitly acknowledges that Obamacare\u2019s failure has caused deductibles to go up by an average of 67 percent and health insurance costs to increase by 27 percent.\nIt isn\u2019t often that a candidate gives the opposition party three gifts for Christmas."}
