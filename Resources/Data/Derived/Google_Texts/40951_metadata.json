Indeed, reading tale after tale of writers and young Americans who became politically active or went out and pursued degrees because of what Stewart has done is nothing short of incredible.\n\n\n\nAs of this writing, there are numerous thinkpieces about Stewart\u2019s legacy and countless slideshows of recommended replacements. (For our money, since Stewart boldly changed the face of the show after taking it over, we think it\u2019s appropriate that they hand it over to a very strong voice who will similarly change it as well; no one is looking for Stewart Mark II as that\u2019s a formula destined for failure.) Amidst the listicles of his \u201cgreatest takedowns\u201d and \u201cmemorable\u201d moments, we wanted to dig a bit further and instead focus on three of the boldest yet strangely underappreciated segments of recent memory. While there are incredible moments from the correspondents, the awkward comedy the cast tried to engage in post-9/11 that did everything except reference the tragedy, and Stewart\u2019s justifiably-smug dismissal of CNN\u2019s Crossfire upon hearing its demise, we dug up three Stewart-centric moments that highlighted his humanity, his intelligence, and, of course, his humor.\n\n\u201cA Single Factual Error\u201d (8 December 2014)\n\nFollowing a piece that ran at the top of December 2014 detailing the national outcry over the death of Eric Garner, Stewart appropriately took to task the media\u2014and especially Fox News\u2014for missing the point over what the outrage was about. In listing similar cases involving unarmed black men being killed at the hands of police officers, Stewart and his staffers misidentified one such case and were promptly corrected by the San Bernardino County District Attorney. In this masterful segment, Stewart doesn\u2019t blame his staff for a second, instead accepting the entirety of the blame for himself, even as Fox News had a field day with it. \u201cThe Daily Show has to be right 100% of the time,\u201d Stewart opines, \u201cFox has to be right once.\u201d Watching Stewart deftly own up to his error before taking Fox & Friends anchor Brian Kilmeade to task for overstepping his bounds in his response only furthered the idea that even while running a \u201ccomedy show,\u201d Stewart never once compromised his integrity, endearing himself to his fans all the more.\n\n\u201c9/11 First Responders React to the Senate Filibuster\u201d (16 December 2010)\n\nLongtime fans of the show know that one of Stewart\u2019s most passionate causes was for supporting 9/11 first responders and veterans from all over. He made a huge deal out of the delays in Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA) coverage long before the 2014 scandal in the institution changed everything, but he was rarely as livid as he was in late 2010 when the House passed a bill that would ensure medical coverage for 9/11 first responders by closing up a tax loophole, but not before the Republicans in the senate filibustered it. He started the episode by taking on the \u201cbig three\u201d TV networks for covering the Beatles\u2019 catalog being available on iTunes instead of the bill, then moving on to rail on Fox News for constantly standing up for the first responders but underreporting this story to an absurd degree, failing to identify who the party was that even initiated the filibuster. Stewart\u2019s takedown alone would be an underappreciated moment, but what was even more powerful was how he brought four first responders right there on air with him to talk in great detail over the suffering they are currently going through, abated due their lack of access to proper health care even after going above and beyond in a time of crisis. Stewart used his platform to put a human face to the story, letting the men talk without much interruption. It made for one of the more solemn segments on Daily Show history, but it remains one of the most powerful they\u2019ve ever run. Six days after the segment aired, the GOP backed down and passed the bill in the senate.\n\nBetsy McCaughey Interview (20 August 2009)\n\nFew people love an honest-to-goodness debate quite like Stewart. He loved it when ideologues from the other side of the party sat down and sparred with him in an interview, especially when he knocked them off their talking points with his rather resolute and pointed knowledge about the subject at hand. (For a good example of this, see his 2010 interview with Dick Armey; for a bad example, watch him get owned by Christian historian David Barton in 2011). Yet even moreso than his iconic ripping of Mad Money\u2018s Jim Cramer, his 2009 interview with Betsy McCaughey, the former Lt. Gov. of New York who made the term \u201cdeath panel\u201d a buzz-phrase during the debate over the Affordable Care Act, was a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Admittedly, McCaughey gave Stewart a lot of ammunition, ranging from her bringing the actual physical bill out for reference to constantly pandering to the audience\u2014which, incidentally, made them turn on her instantaneously. Not only did he immediately refute McCaughey\u2019s claims, but he also followed up some of her more outrageous points by simply asking her to show him where her facts came from. He waited and hummed the Jeopardy! theme as she thumbed through the massive tome, weakening her argument with each frantic page turn. She may have given Stewart everything he needed from the onset, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t enjoy the process any less.", "article_metadata": {"description": "These three segments may not be Jon Stewarts most popular ones, but they do represent him at his most intelligent, heartfelt, and, of course, downright funny.", "title": "The Three Most Underappreciated Daily Show Moments", "og": {"site_name": "PopMatters", "description": "These three segments may not be Jon Stewart's most popular ones, but they do represent him at his most intelligent, heartfelt, and, of course, downright funny.", "title": "The Three Most Underappreciated 'Daily Show' Moments", "url": "http://www.popmatters.com/post/190560-the-three-most-underappreciated-daily-show-moments/", "image": "http://images.popmatters.com/news_art/s/stewart_channelsurfing_splash650.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117106511637048}, "keywords": "911, affordable care act, comedy central, eric garner, fox news, jon stewart, the daily show, Articles, PopMatters", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7f7\"", "article_summary": "Amidst the listicles of his \u201cgreatest takedowns\u201d and \u201cmemorable\u201d moments, we wanted to dig a bit further and instead focus on three of the boldest yet strangely underappreciated segments of recent memory.\nBetsy McCaughey Interview (20 August 2009)Few people love an honest-to-goodness debate quite like Stewart.\nIt made for one of the more solemn segments on Daily Show history, but it remains one of the most powerful they\u2019ve ever run.\nAs of this writing, there are numerous thinkpieces about Stewart\u2019s legacy and countless slideshows of recommended replacements.\nYet even moreso than his iconic ripping of Mad Money\u2018s Jim Cramer, his 2009 interview with Betsy McCaughey, the former Lt.
