(Photo: STAFF PHOTO/DAN RADEL )Buy Photo\n\nThe historic Glimmer Glass Bridge may be running out of time after a large truck weighing well in excess of the bridge\u2019s three-ton weight limit fractured the bridge\u2019s timber deck at three locations, Monmouth County officials said.\n\nThe county, which owns the bridge, may now have to completely replace it. In doing so, it may lose its place on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\u201cThe nature of the damage combined with the age of the bridge eliminates the option of a quick fix,\u201d said Freeholder Thomas A. Arnone, liaison to the County\u2019s Department of Public Works and Engineering. \u201cThe ultimate plan is we\u2019re going to submit for a brand new bridge.\u201d\n\nIt could wind up costing between $20 to $30 million in state and federal Department of Transportation funds, Arnone said.\n\nApproval could take three to five years because of all the hurdles at both the state and federal levels, in part because of the historic distinction. In the meantime the county is seeking $2 million from the state DOT to reinforce the bridge to open it in time for Memorial Day 2015.\n\nThe borough council has already taken a hard stance and passed a resolution in support of bridge replacement. They would like to see the bridge widened and able to handle 45 tons. At present fire trucks are not permitted to cross the bridge.\n\n\u201cMy primary concern is for the safety of the people crossing the bridge and for the people who live on the other side of it,\u201d Council President Michael Mangan said.\n\nThe borough approved a $902,000 bond ordinance on Tuesday to elevate Brielle Road on the Manasquan side of the bridge. The council said this is to allow residents who ordinarily use the bridge to leave the area when the streets flood to be able to travel in the opposite direction to reach one of two other bridges.\n\nThe bridge was damaged on Aug. 7. It has been closed to vehicular traffic since and opened only recently to allow for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. The bridge continues to open for boater traffic.\n\nArnone said local police have jurisdiction to enforce the three-ton limit on the bridge, which spans the Glimmer Glass tidal inlet connecting the borough\u2019s of Manasquan and Brielle. Neither he or Manasquan Police Chief Elliot Correia have an identification on the truck that caused the damage.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know. It\u2019s our understanding that it was a box truck,\u201d said Arnone.\n\nThe county had outsourced the bridge tenders and Manasquan resident Fran Drew believes that led to misuse of the bridge. \u201cI think all of you know overweight trucks were going over that bridge weekly,\u201d she told the borough council on Tuesday.\n\nDrew was part of a group of residents who pushed to have the bridge placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.\n\nAccording to the county, the original bridge crossing the Glimmer Glass was built in 1898 as a fixed-span bridge. On August 13, 1939, the current cable-lift bascule span bridge opened and began accommodating both marine and vehicle traffic.\n\nThe bridge was refurbished in the 1950s and 1970s when the original components were replaced. The Glimmer Glass Bridge uses a rolling counterweight design to open.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only bridge that operates with a bascule in the country,\u201d said Arnone.\n\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1rSB0vo", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The county, which owns the bridge, may now have to completely replace it.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "The county, which owns the bridge, may now have to completely replace it.", "title": "Historic Glimmer Glass bridge could be gone soon", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/neptune-wall/manasquan/2014/09/07/glimmer-glass-bridge-manasquan/15253539/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The county, which owns the bridge, may now have to completely replace it.", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/09/07/glimmerbridge.jpg", "title": "Historic Glimmer Glass bridge could be replaced", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Signs block vehicular traffic over Glimmer Glass Bridge after the bridge was structurally damaged in August.\nThe Glimmer Glass Bridge uses a rolling counterweight design to open.\nAccording to the county, the original bridge crossing the Glimmer Glass was built in 1898 as a fixed-span bridge.\nArnone said local police have jurisdiction to enforce the three-ton limit on the bridge, which spans the Glimmer Glass tidal inlet connecting the borough\u2019s of Manasquan and Brielle.\n(Photo: STAFF PHOTO/DAN RADEL )Buy PhotoThe historic Glimmer Glass Bridge may be running out of time after a large truck weighing well in excess of the bridge\u2019s three-ton weight limit fractured the bridge\u2019s timber deck at three locations, Monmouth County officials said."}
