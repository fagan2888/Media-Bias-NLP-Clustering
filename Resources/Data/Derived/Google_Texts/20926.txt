For just the 2nd time since the race began in 1999, there will be no Tiburon mile in 2014, according to an announcement on the race’s official website.

The Tiburon mile is a huge open water event held off the coast of the northern California town of Tiburon, California in the Raccoon Strait in a one-mile dash for cash.

In the statement, meet founder and host Bob Placak says that because of the Affordable Care Act that goes into effect in 2014, he will be spending the year focusing on his employee benefits business Robert C. Placak & Associates as they navigate through new territory in the insurance world.

Placak promises that the event, which sometimes is accompanied by the headlining Tiburon Sprint Classic, will return for 2015.

The only other time since its inception that this meet has been skipped was in 2005, when Placak and his wife had a baby.

The 2013 event was won by Poland’s Mateusz Sawrymowicz, followed by Olympic gold medalist Ous Mellouli and New Zealand’s Kane Radford. The women’s race went to American Ashley Twichell, and along with it Sawrymowicz and Twichell each took home a $10,000 prize.
