Kent left to become senior health and regulatory analyst for the California Optometric Association in January 1999, before being elevated to director in December 2000.\n\nWhile director, she picked up a Master\u2019s degree in public administration in 2002 from the University of Southern California\u2019s Sol Price School of Public Policy.\n\nIn August 2004, Kent left the private sector for government work, signing on as DHCS deputy director. She moved to the department\u2019s parent in March 2007, as associate secretary of legislative affairs for the state Health and Human Services Agency.\n\nRepublican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger tapped Kent in April 2008 to be deputy legislative secretary in the office of the governor. Kent was the legislative lead on issues of health, human services, managed care, revenue and taxation, health-related boards, veteran affairs and alcohol regulation.\n\nHe also put her on the California Children and Families Commission, better known as First 5 California, and appointed her chair in 2010. She served two years.\n\nKent departed the governor\u2019s office when Brown took over in January 2011. She soft-landed at DHCS as associate director, where she was responsible for implementing state and national health reform initiatives for Medi-Cal. She stayed just four months.\n\nKent left government work in May 2011 to become a principal at Health Management Associates (HMA), an independent, national research, management and consulting firm with 15 offices nationwide. The company specializes in health care reform and publicly financed health care programs.\n\nShe was there for more than two years before being hired on as executive director of Local Health Plans of California (LHPC) in September 2013. LHPC represents 14 local, publicly governed or not-for-profit health plans throughout the state that provide \u201cculturally appropriate, accessible health care.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the job she held when Governor Brown, a Democrat, invited her back to her old department, this time as director.\n\nKent is registered without party preference, but media reports in the past (here and here) referred to her as a Republican. The position requires Senate confirmation.\n\n\u2013Ken Broder\n\nTo Learn More:\n\nJerry Brown Appoints New Health Care Services Head (by David Siders, Sacramento Bee)\n\nDouglas Resigns as DHCS Director (by George Lauer, California Healthline)\n\nJennifer Kent (LinkedIn)\n\nGovernor Brown Announces Appointments (Office of the Governor)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s new head of the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) replaces Toby Douglas, who announced his resignation last September after three tumultuous years of change generated by the Affordable Care Act and the state\u2019s expansion of its version of the federal Medicaid program.
