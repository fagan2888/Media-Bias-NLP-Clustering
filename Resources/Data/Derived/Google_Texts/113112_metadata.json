She and many other transgender people face difficulties with health insurance providers who will not cover certain medical procedures or medications.\n\nAn estimated 700,000 transgender people live in the U.S. As public awareness of this population grows, spurred by such high-profile stories as that of Bruce Jenner\u2019s transition to Caitlyn, it\u2019s become clear that health insurance coverage for transgender-related procedures and wellness is a complicated maze of terminology and technicalities, experts say.\n\nSome insurance providers cover procedures such as gender reassignment surgery but do not cover procedures like feminization of the face for transwomen (someone who was born male, but identifies as female) or mastectomies for transmen (an individual born female who identifies as male).\n\nOther providers do not cover surgeries related to gender reassignment but will cover certain hormonal treatments and mental health therapy.\n\n\u201cWhen health care really stresses biology, it leaves a large portion of us out,\u201d said Nell Gaither, president of the Trans Pride Initiative, a Dallas advocacy group. \u201cOur lives depend on medical intervention. One way or another, we\u2019ll figure out how to get the treatment we need. (But) when insurance doesn\u2019t work, a lot of people turn to the Internet to get what they need, and that\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\nInsurance company representatives say their plans abide by industry standards, including meeting Affordable Care Act regulations, which include a clause that insurance providers cannot discriminate on the basis of gender identity or stereotypes.\n\nAnd some insurance providers, such as Aetna and Cigna, have broadened their policies to include more access for transgender-related coverage.\n\nBut many transgender patients who don\u2019t have ACA plans say they have had components of their coverage denied or have been denied insurance altogether because the provider considers gender dysphoria a pre-existing condition, which they do not cover.\n\nJody Herman, scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, said insurance policies vary by state. For example, California law requires that insurers cover gender reassignment and hormone therapy, but Texas doesn\u2019t. Some Texas legislators have tried unsuccessfully to end insurance discrimination.\n\nAfter McMurray lost a six-figure salary, her financial situation shifted dramatically, making it difficult for her to afford insurance. The complicated life she suddenly found herself living brought her to the brink of suicide.\n\nA 2014 study found that 46 percent of transmen and 42 percent of transwomen attempt suicide in their lifetimes, according to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, a report published by the Williams Institute and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was life or death,\u201d she said. She couldn\u2019t go on living in a body she felt she didn\u2019t belong in and she didn\u2019t see any other way out.\n\nACA plans include deductibles of up to thousands of dollars and high monthly payments \u2014 and gender reassignment surgery may not even be covered. So McMurray saw no sense in trying to get insurance.\n\nIn 2014, nearly 35 percent of transgender people living below the poverty level were uninsured, according to the Center for American Progress.\n\nShe began tapping into her retirement fund to pay for her procedures, which turned out to be more expensive than the cost of her surgeries because she had to pay taxes and penalties. She\u2019s continued to take from her retirement in order to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cThe way health care is set up, I\u2019m one of those people who slips through the cracks,\u201d McMurray said.\n\nFederal employees can now undergo gender reassignment surgery through Aetna insurance plans, because of a policy change that began in January. Aetna will be adding gender reassignment surgery to many other commercial plans over the next few years.\n\nBut breast augmentation, hair removal and forms of facial reconstruction are considered cosmetic and therefore will not be covered. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health considers both necessary for the transgender patient.\n\nThese surgical interventions are often of greater practical significance in the patient\u2019s daily life than reconstruction of the genitals, said Jamison Green, president of the association.\n\nOne day in January, Katie Sprinkle, a Dallas attorney and a transwoman, got a call from one of her clients, a transman.\n\nHe was legally recognized as male, which required a gender marker change, a legal process similar to having a name changed. He had recently undergone a procedure to remove his breasts, but now he was terrified because he had just been diagnosed with a form of breast cancer that only women can get.\n\nSprinkle considered going to a judge to reverse her client\u2019s gender marker back to female so that insurance would cover the cost of his treatment. In the end, her client chose not to.\n\nShe warns her clients who are transmen that, if they develop any transition-related illnesses, they could have a problem with insurance companies. She tells them to talk to every woman in their family to find out what kind of diseases they may have inherited.\n\nA large percentage of transgender people report being mistreated by medical care providers.\n\nThe National Transgender Discrimination Survey reports that 60 percent of the transgender population who have attempted suicide have had a doctor or other provider refuse to treat them.\n\nPart of McMurray\u2019s mission is to educate those in the medical profession. So on a recent day, she took questions from a class of 30 to 40 medical students at the University of Texas Southwestern.\n\nThe doctor moderating her visit to the classroom asked her to clarify the difference between gender dysphoria \u2014 identifying with a gender contrary to the one assigned at birth \u2014 and homosexuality.\n\n\u201cThe best way I can put it is gender identity is who I go to bed as,\u201d she said. \u201cSexuality is who I go to bed with.\u201d\n\nWhen McMurray found herself without a home in June of 2013, Sprinkle gladly welcomed her into her two-bedroom apartment.\n\nThe two had met in person only a few times but had been in touch through phone calls and emails. A few months later, Sprinkle realized the two were in a relationship.\n\nAlthough McMurray has encountered dark times, she knows the future is much brighter. She has the love and support of her daughters, one of whom has taught her children to call her \u201cGrandma Leslie.\u201d\n\nMcMurray\u2019s only regret is that her mother, who passed away 23 years ago, never got to meet Leslie.\n\n\u201cI know she would have loved Leslie,\u201d said McMurray, who believes her mother must have always known deep down she was transgender. \u201cShe would have been so supportive and happy to see me the way I was meant to be.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DALLAS \u2014 After nearly 50 years living as a man, Leslie McMurray was reborn \u2014 but then lost nearly everything: her home, her marriage of 33 years and her job as a radio program director in Dallas.
