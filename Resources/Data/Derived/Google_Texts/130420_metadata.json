She will have to qualify for re-election and start campaigning all over again the moment the final gavel falls March 24.\n\nAlready the mother of two has missed her 8-year-old\u2019s birthday. She relies heavily on her husband, Jason, to keep the household running while she\u2019s away in Atlanta.\n\nIt was when her youngest entered school that she had time to take away from the small physical-therapy clinic she and her husband run. She got involved with the local chamber of commerce, which included her only trip to the Capitol before she became a legislator.\n\n\u201cI probably would not have thought to run for office if it were not for the Affor\u00addable Care Act,\u201d she said.\n\nHer company\u2019s insurance was canceled three times, and the premiums grew with each new policy. The frustration led her to monitor Congress closely, but it was the trip to the Statehouse that led her to think about state government.\n\nPolitics was never really foreign to her. Lott\u2019s grandfather was a legislator in Maine, an uncle was also a legislator, and her father was president of her hometown city council.\n\n\u201cI grew up with my dad spending every weekend at city meetings,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, she had a realistic idea of how much work was involved. She just wasn\u2019t ready for the volume of information with more than 1,000 bills pending in the House.\n\n\u201cWhen you get here, you think you can control it all,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite arriving at the office at 6 a.m. except on days when she drives from Evans, she\u2019s discovered that no one can read and master every bill, policy paper and e-mail. Lott is quickly learning to rely on her colleagues for help. Their expertise often comes from their professional backgrounds, so one trick to deciding how to vote on a bill is to find a colleague who works in that field, Lott said.\n\nThat\u2019s why she is pleased to have been assigned to the House Committee on Health and Human Services so she can draw from her career knowledge and be a resource for other lawmakers as a nurse running Evans Rehabil\u00aditation.\n\nOn Feb. 8, she passed her first bill in the House. The leadership assigned her a noncontroversial \u201chousekeeping\u201d bill to clarify wording in existing law about medical labs that had become an issue in a lawsuit. It passed unanimously, but not before she was initiated with some nonsense questions from the veterans while she was standing alone in the House well for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legendary, the fact of having her first bill on the floor of the House in less than a month being in the chamber,\u201d said Rep. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem. \u201cI think she\u2019s going to do a good job for Columbia County.\u201d\n\nHe says a host of assets contribute to her success.\n\n\u201cJodi\u2019s made a very positive impact on the members of the House, in my opinion,\u201d he said \u201cShe\u2019s intelligent. She\u2019s always cheerful. She\u2019s catching on very fast to the process.\u201d\n\nRep. Brian Prince, D-Augusta, who won a special election a month before the 2014 session, says Lott has a key attribute for working with the diverse personalities and policy positions in the House.\n\n\u201cShe listens to both sides,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s definitely an asset, not only to Richmond-Columbia County, but she\u2019s going to be somebody useful to the whole state.\u201d\n\nLott considers herself \u201cjust an ordinary working person\u201d determined to represent her district faithfully. By that, she means she hasn\u2019t given up her role as finance manager for the family business, squeezing in attention to that job between legislative meetings that begin at breakfast and continue until sundown or later.\n\nAs far as ambition, she says her goal was pushing herself to a new challenge \u2013 not necessarily triumphing over the three other candidates.\n\n\u201cI would have been OK with not winning, but not OK with not running,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Metro, Walter C.
