Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) who is facing off with State Rep. John Bel Edwards (D-Amite) in the Louisiana gubernatorial run-off election has already raised $1 million since Saturday’s primary election.

The Vitter campaign exclusively told the Hayride that Vitter is quickly picking up support from Jay Dardenne and Scott Angelle’s voter-base.

“In just one day our team has grown significantly with Jay and Scott’s supporters,” Vitter’s campaign said in a statement. “They realize we need solid, conservative Louisiana leadership to get us out of the ditch we’re in. In contrast, John Bel Edwards isn’t just a casual Obama supporter; he’s a true believer.”

Vitter has made it a point to tie Edwards to President Obama, reiterating that the Amite Democrat traveled to personally nominate Obama back in 2012.
