He completed 7-of-10 passes for 156 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nRoberts found tight end Garret Griffin wide open on a 3-yard strike with 2:12 left in the second quarter as the Falcons went up 10-0. He came back to Griffin again with 8:11 left in the game on a 23-yard pass that pushed Air Force\u2019s lead to 20-3. Roberts\u2019 third pass completion of the game, a 59-yard play down the east sideline to Garret Brown, set up Griffin\u2019s first touchdown.\n\n\u201cBoth of us were just running up and down the field and getting nowhere,\u201d Roberts said of the course of the game.\n\nArmy\u2019s only points came on a third quarter 42-yard field by Daniel Grochowski that spoiled a chance for a shutout for an Air Force defensive unit that otherwise had control of the game. Defensive end Alex Hansen and safety Weston Steelhammer each had five unassisted tackles.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Air Force becomes bowl eligible with home win over Army", "title": "Air Force becomes bowl eligible with home win over Army", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/07/air-force-becomes-bowl-eligible-with-home-win-over-army/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151107_050121_army-air-force-football.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151107_050121_army-air-force-football.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-07T16:48:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T02:58:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Air Force Academy"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a tough, tough game,\u201d Calhoun said in his postgame appraisal.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re going back to work Monday morning.\u201dArmy coach Jeff Monken credited Air Force with outplaying his team.\nAIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014There was a good old fashioned game of rock \u2019em, sock \u2019em football Saturday at Falcon Stadium \u2014 or was it rugby.\nAnd Air Force quarterback Karson Roberts added just enough passing to thwart Army\u2019s defense.\n\u201cArmy made it tough on us and that\u2019s a credit to Army.\u201dIt was the fifth consecutive loss for Army at Falcon Stadium."}
