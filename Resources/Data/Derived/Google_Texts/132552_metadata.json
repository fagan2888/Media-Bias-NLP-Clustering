He came really close to catching that ball well into the seats. Anytime a guy goes into the stands, you worry about him.\u201d\n\nThe ball fell just beyond the reach of Arenado\u2019s outstretched glove. Arenado suffered a chest contusion when he hit himself on either a seat or an arm rest, and he left the game in the eighth inning. X-rays after the game were negative, and Arenado said he expects to be in the lineup for Tuesday\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cIt was hurting and, as the game went on, it got tight a little bit every time I threw,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cIt kind of hurt. and my last at-bat (in the seventh inning) it was feeling a little sore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be OK. \u2026 I thought if I dived, I would land on some people, but there was nobody sitting there. I saw the ball. It almost hit my glove, so it was right there. I just didn\u2019t jump far enough. It was worth it. We won, and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\nArenado said it was one of those instances in which a player just goes after the ball and doesn\u2019t have time to think about the consequences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just instinct,\u201d Arenado said. \u201cI don\u2019t have an explanation for it. If I feel like I have a chance to make a play, then I\u2019m going to go for it. That\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do. I\u2019m not thinking about myself. I\u2019m just thinking about making that play and hopefully get the out.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nolan Arenado takes his chances after diving into stands", "title": "Nolan Arenado takes his chances after diving into stands", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/07/nolan-arenado-takes-his-chances-after-diving-into-stands/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907__BN20150908_Z00_BNSP08BBNROXSIDEp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150907__BN20150908_Z00_BNSP08BBNROXSIDEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-07T20:34:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T18:29:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt was hurting and, as the game went on, it got tight a little bit every time I threw,\u201d Arenado said.\n\u201cHe went into the seats and almost made another incredible play,\u201d Weiss said.\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Walt Weiss has seen third baseman Nolan Arenado make some amazing plays going into the stands, but it makes the Rockies manager nervous nonetheless.\nX-rays after the game were negative, and Arenado said he expects to be in the lineup for Tuesday\u2019s game.\nAnytime a guy goes into the stands, you worry about him.\u201dThe ball fell just beyond the reach of Arenado\u2019s outstretched glove."}
