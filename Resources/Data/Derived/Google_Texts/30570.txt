Do You Approve Or Disapprove of President Obama's Job Performance? Vote Now in Urgent Poll

Fox News host Bill O'Reilly has waged a bet with liberal commentator James Carville that Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana will lose her seat in November, the New Orleans Times Picayune reportsO’Reilly said on his show that the Democrats would relinquish their Senate majority in the midterm elections, and he cited Landrieu as one of the incumbents who would be trounced by Republicans."She better be looking for another job," the outspoken conservative critic said of the three-term senator. “She's out."Carville, a Democratic strategist from New Orleans and senior political adviser to former President Bill Clinton, was a guest on "The O’Reilly Factor" after recently joining Fox News as a contributor, and he said Landrieu will be voted back in.His prediction led to O’Reilly's betting him a sumptuous dinner at the famed Commander’s Palace restaurant in New Orleans that Landrieu would be beaten, with the losing bettor picking up the check.Landrieu’s likely GOP opponent, Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Baton Rouge doctor, has since sent an email urging his supporters to help O’Reilly win the bet, the newspaper reported.Landrieu’s approval ratings have plunged after her initial support of the Affordable Care Act, although she’s tried to distance herself from Obamacare in recent weeks.She even attacked President Barack Obama in a campaign ad for failing to live up to his promise that people could keep their current insurance plans and their doctors under the healthcare reform law.Landrieu received only 52 percent of the vote in her state in both of the last two elections, and she’s seen by the GOP as one of the most vulnerable Democratic candidates in the midterms.
