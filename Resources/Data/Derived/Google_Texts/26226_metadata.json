At the mid-point of the 2015 season, baseball is financially strong, but what does the future hold for America's pastime?\n\nLast year, Major League Baseball took in $9 billion in revenue. According to Forbes, that's an all-time high; meanwhile, the average value of the 30 MLB teams is $1.2 billion.\n\nBut in an interview with CNBC's \"On The Money,\" Washington Post Senior Editor Marc Fisher pointed out that the \"grand old game\" may have a demographic problem.\n\nFisher says the average baseball fan and TV viewer is over 55 years old. \"That's a problem baseball needs to address or it won't have that much of a future,\" Fisher warned.\n\nIn short, baseball watchers are older than their counterparts. The median age of a baseball viewer is 53 years old, according to ESPN, compared to 47 in the National Football League. Separtately, the National Basketball Association's median fan age is just 37. Even more troubling, says Fisher, is that baseball is failing to connect with younger fans and bring in a new generation.\n\nSince the game is often considered to have less action than other sports, it is \"out of step with today's society,\" he said.\n\nFisher adds: \"There is a problem with kids thinking that baseball is a sport where nothing happens, where they stand in the outfield waiting for a long time.\"\n\nThat's if they are playing the game: Baseball participation is the lowest among the four major team sports, recent figures suggest.\n\nRead MoreHoly Cow!
