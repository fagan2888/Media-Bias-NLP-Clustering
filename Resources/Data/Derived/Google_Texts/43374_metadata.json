It\u2019s the standard of care.\n\nBut if he goes on the Internet and looks around, he may get very different advice. He may find a YouTube video starring a Sarasota urologist who says biopsies are old-fashioned. Barbaric, even.\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dr. Ronald Wheeler, author of the book \u2018Men at Risk: The Dirty Little Secret - Prostate Biopsies Really Do Spread Prostate Cancer Cells,\u2019\u201d says the man hawking a 600-page book on the video channel for $39.95.\n\nThe book, \u201cMen at Risk,\u201d lays out Wheeler's philosophy: that biopsies of the prostate gland are dangerous and unnecessary. Instead, he uses imaging \u2013 MRI-spectroscopy, which produces a \u201croadmap\u201d of the inside of the prostate.\n\nHealth News Florida radio story on Dr. Ronald Wheeler, which aired May 15, 2014 on WUSF 89.7 FM.\n\nAnother outmoded medical practice that harms patients, in Wheeler\u2019s view, is the standard treatment for prostate cancer: radiation or surgical removal of the entire gland, which can damage the nerves that control urination and erections.\n\nA number of less-invasive procedures have been tried for partial-gland tumors, including radiation pellets (brachytherapy) and freezing (cryotherapy). But for whatever reason, they haven't pushed aside the so-called \"gold standard,\" full-gland prostatectomy.\n\nWheeler rejects that. He prefers a procedure called High Intensity Focused Ultrasound, or HIFU. Wheeler does HIFU in Mexico because it hasn\u2019t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. It\u2019s well-accepted in Europe, Japan, Canada and many other countries, but here it cannot be used outside clinical trials.\n\nA patient who decides on Wheeler and HIFU must come up with $32,000 cash up front. Insurance doesn\u2019t cover it.\n\nHealth Department Files Complaints\n\nAll of this has brought Wheeler under the scrutiny of the Florida Department of Health, which over the past two years has been investigating him. He faces three administrative complaints for practicing outside the standard of care. Also mentioned in two of them is financial exploitation of patients.\n\nThe Florida Board of Medicine is to consider all three cases in early June. (The administrative complaints can be found online on this site by clicking \"Link to Complaint.\")\n\nThe cases involve men from Alabama, Tennessee and Michigan who found Wheeler on the Internet or heard about him from friends. The Alabama and Tennessee patients scheduled HIFU with Wheeler, but changed their minds after talking to their home-town urologists.\n\nThe Michigan patient, identified as GP, went ahead with the procedure in Cancun. According to the complaint, that patient suffered scarring that made it hard for him to urinate and required follow-up surgery.\n\nIn all the complaints, Wheeler is accused of failing to provide appropriate care - a biopsy - before he concluded that they had prostate cancer and needed HIFU. Reflecting the language of the Florida statutes, the complaints say: \"A reasonably prudent physician practicing within the prevailing professional standard of care...would have obtained a biopsy of the patient's prostate before diagnosing and recommending treatment for prostate cancer.\"\n\nWheeler\u2019s state online profile says he attended medical school in Guadalajara, Mexico, and did residencies at Akron City Hospital and Louisiana State University Medical Center in New Orleans.\n\nHe has not obtained certification in a specialty recognized by the Florida Board of Medicine.\n\nWheeler, through an employee, declined a request from Health News Florida for an interview. So did his attorney, Paula Willis, in Tallahassee. She said negotiations are under way to settle the case. If they reach agreement, the settlement will be presented to the board, which can accept it, suggest revisions or reject it. If it is rejected or substantially changed, Wheeler may decide to skip the settlement and file for a formal hearing by an administrative law judge.\n\nThe state takes the position that Wheeler is violating the law by practicing outside the standard of care, and that doctors who do that place patients at risk. According to his videos, Wheeler's position is that he\u2019s just ahead of his time \u2013 or that others have fallen behind.\n\n\u201cI urge you to buy at least two books; one for yourself, obviously, the other also for the most arrogant urologist you know,\u201d Wheeler says on YouTube. \u201cDoctors don\u2019t intentionally want to be arrogant, but they\u2019re stuck in a rut and they are unwilling to learn.\"\n\n\n\nBiopsies Carry Risks\n\nA prostate biopsy, usually ordered after a blood test that shows a high level of prostate specific antigen (PSA), captures tissue samples that can be analyzed to see 1) whether there is cancer, and if so, 2) how aggressive the tumor is. If it's a slow-growing cancer and the patient is old, it may be appropriate to just watch it.\n\nA prostate biopsy is no walk in the park, judging from comments on men\u2019s health message boards. It involves needle jabs through the rectum into the prostate gland, emerging with tissue samples. WebMD describes the process as \u201ca brief, sharp pain\u201d each time the biopsy needle is inserted, and that\u2019s usually six to 12 times -- more for an enlarged prostate.\n\nProstate biopsies can have side effects, beyond bleeding. Infection can set in even though antibiotics are usually given ahead of time, said Dr. Julio Pow-Sang, chairman of genitourinary oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center. Pow-Sang says studies have found infections in 1 to 6 percent of post-biopsy patients. Occasionally a man will die of sepsis., he said.\n\nThen there is the possibility of missing the cancer cells altogether, having jabbed the wrong spot.\n\nBut according to Wheeler, there is a greater danger: \u201cneedle-tracking.\u201d As needles are pulled out of the prostate, they bear tissue samples. The samples can pull cells from a cancerous tumor out into clean areas of the gland, or into the rectal wall, the lymphatic system or the bloodstream, he says.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t be treating patients or men specifically as if they\u2019re pin cushions and we\u2019re putting all these needles in,\u201d Wheeler says in a video on his website.\n\nHe suggests that MRI-spectroscopy is as good at finding cancer in the prostate as a biopsy, and can be accomplished without needles.\n\nDr. Rafael Carrion, associate professor of urology at the Morsani College of Medicine at University of South Florida, called MRI instead of biopsy \u201ca hot topic\u201d in urology.\n\nMoffitt's Pow Sang said that while biopsies are still being used at Moffitt to find and evaluate primary prostate tumors, MRIs will be substituted for biopsies on cancer survivors when they come in for recurrence checks.\n\nBut will private urologists try it? Wheeler doubts it. \u201cIn this community I believe the physicians are not going to give up their biopsies easily,\u201d he said. Urologists cling to old-fashioned methods that hurt patients but make doctors a lot of money, he said. He maintains that his only interest is patient safety.\n\n\"It's not about making money,\" he says on a video. \"It's about changing medicine.\"\n\n'Knee-jerk' Approach to Medicine?\n\nMost of Wheeler\u2019s patients aren't local.\n\n\u201cWe see patients from all over the world here in this clinic,\u201d he said in his video, \u201cand 70% of our practice actually comes from outside the state of Florida.\u201d\n\nWheeler said that removal of the prostate is \u201cthe knee-jerk\u201d approach to the disease. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re taught to do as urologists: If you see cancer, cut it out.\u201d\n\nThe HIFU that Wheeler employs in Mexico is described as an experimental sound-wave treatment to kill the cancer cells with heat. It\u2019s a lot more intense than the diagnostic ultrasound that's become familiar.\n\nAccording to Wheeler's websites, his HIFU procedure is done at a clinic in a deluxe resort. The surgeon inserts a probe in the rectum. It has an ultrasound scanning feature for positioning the device correctly, and a focused, intense sound-wave generator to heat the targeted tissues \u2013 to \u201ccook\u201d them, as Wheeler puts it.\n\nTwo manufacturers make these treatment systems, one in France and the other in the U.S. (See a 3-D animation of the HIFU procedure by Ablatherm.) Wheeler says he has used both with spectacular results.\n\n\u201cNo patients are incontinent that I\u2019ve taken care of over the last 2 years, and all of our patients are potent,\u201d he said in the video.\n\nIn a press release a year ago, Wheeler claimed a 95 percent cure rate from HIFU, with no side effects. Academic urologists say it's highly unlikely that Wheeler's results are that good.\n\n\u201cI myself have seen two patients with severe erectile dysfunction \u2013 or problems with erection -- and leaking urine from HIFU,\u201d said USF\u2019s Carrion, who makes the point that all prostate cancer treatments have complications. \u201cThere is no magic treatment that\u2019s foolproof without risks.\u201d\n\nOnline, Wheeler posted a testimonial from a patient named Jim Davis, who said he and his wife flew to Puerto Vallarta in August, 2007. Davis said he had HIFU at 11 in the morning and went back to the hotel at 4.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing thing to think about being able to walk out and actually go out and have dinner and see the sunset after this was all done,\u201d Davis said in the testimonial.\n\nFDA officials declined to discuss the status of HIFU. But the agency appears ready to hear from an advisory panel in coming months.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "When a man gets a worrisome PSA result, his doctor is likely to schedule him for a prostate biopsy.
