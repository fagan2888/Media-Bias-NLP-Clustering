It’s plainly liberating for President Obama to simply deny reality and declare everything just peachy, as he did again Monday at the G7 summit in Germany. Sadly, reality’s not cooperating.

One of his fictions du jour: All’s well with Obama­Care. No joke.

“The thing is working,” the president insisted. “We haven’t had a lot of conversation about the horrors of ObamaCare, because none of them have come to pass.”

Somebody’s having those conversations. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows 54 percent oppose ObamaCare, with only 39 percent — the lowest ever — in favor.

He also insisted that a big suit against ObamaCare, Burwell v. King, is so clearly based on a “twisted interpretation” that “it probably shouldn’t even have been taken up.”

Huh? Wouldn’t that be the first time the Supreme Court had to settle a crystal-clear law?

In fact, that “twisted interpretion” is the clear language of the law. The hastily rammed-through legislation had so many “glitches” that it’s been amended dozens of times — some unilaterally by Obama; some by new laws; some by the Supreme Court in past cases.

Obama’s other big fib was touting “significant progress” against ISIS. He’s not willing to admit that the Islamic State controls more territory in Iraq and in Syria than it did nine months ago, when he vowed to “degrade” and “destroy” it “through a comprehensive and sustained counter-terrorism strategy.”

Yet the biggest news is that Obama actually told the truth at one point Monday: “We don’t yet have a complete strategy” for training Iraqi forces to fight against ISIS.

Nine months and there’s still no strategy even just to train Iraqis?

By the time Team Obama comes up with one, there may no Iraqis left to train — given ISIS’s success in carving up Iraq and slaughtering anyone in its path.

It’s depressingly easy to see why Obama prefers fiction to reality.
