Here\u2019s Colbert suggesting Reagan didn\u2019t care about the human suffering that occurred when then-Iraq leader Saddam Hussein unleashed chemical weapons during the 1980s.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThat\u2019s why we know, we conservatives know that the Gipper would never stand for the use of chemical weapons\u2026 today. Of course in the 1980\u2019s his administration ignored chemical attacks by Saddam Hussein that killed thousands of Iranian troops and looked the other way when Saddam gassed his own Kurdish citizens.\n\nAs Newsbusters notes, Reagan didn\u2019t go to war with Iraq over those actions, but he denounced them in the harshest terms possible in 1988.\n\nMr. Secretary-General, distinguished delegates, the terror of it. The horror of it. We condemn it. The use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war \u2014 beyond its tragic human toll \u2014 jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I. Let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons.\n\nBetter to distort history than hold the current occupier of the White House to task for his amateurish handling of foreign affairs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stephen Colbert Falsely Claims Reagan Ignored Iraq's Chemical Weapons Use", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Stephen Colbert Falsely Claims Reagan Ignored Iraq's Chemical Weapons Use", "title": "Stephen Colbert Falsely Claims Reagan Ignored Iraq's Chemical Weapons Use - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/09/11/colbert/Colbert.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2013/09/11/colbert-mangles-reagan-iraq/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stephen Colbert Falsely Claims Reagan Ignored Iraq's Chemical Weapons Use", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Hollywood/2013/09/11/colbert/Colbert.jpg", "title": "Stephen Colbert Falsely Claims Reagan Ignored Iraq's Chemical Weapons Use - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Iraq, Ronald Reagan, Stephen Colbert,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Stephen Colbert", "published_time": "2013-09-11T11:58:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd4f00\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s Colbert suggesting Reagan didn\u2019t care about the human suffering that occurred when then-Iraq leader Saddam Hussein unleashed chemical weapons during the 1980s.\nLet this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the Geneva protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThat\u2019s why we know, we conservatives know that the Gipper would never stand for the use of chemical weapons\u2026 today.\nAs Newsbusters notes, Reagan didn\u2019t go to war with Iraq over those actions, but he denounced them in the harshest terms possible in 1988.\nThe use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war \u2014 beyond its tragic human toll \u2014 jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I."}
