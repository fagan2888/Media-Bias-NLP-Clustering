(Cassidy Swanson/Union Leader correspondent)\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW BOSTON - It's been 26 years to the day since Carrie Moss was last seen alive.It was July 1989, and Carrie was 14. With a black, one-piece bathing suit on underneath her stonewashed jeans, white T-shirt and white boots, Carrie hopped on her bike to meet friends in Goffstown to go swimming. It was the last time her family saw her alive...Nearly two years later, her skeletal remains were found in a clearing just a few miles from her home.\"Carrie would've been 40,\" said Annette Brendle, one of Carrie's three older sisters, in an interview at her New Boston home. \"She would've been married with kids. Her life was taken from her.\"..Her death was ruled a homicide, but remains a cold case. Now the Moss family has re-upped its efforts to find out what happened to their beloved daughter and sister.Troubling timesAnnette, who was 10 years older than Carrie, describes her little sister as \"a young girl who grew up fast.\"..\"She just . seemed to get in with the wrong group of people,\" she said. \"She had her friends and liked to party . \"\"You'd send her to school, (and) she'd leave school with friends,\" said Sally Moss, Carrie's mother. \"Stuff like that.\"..At the time she went missing, Carrie was dating an 18-year-old man from Goffstown. She had been arrested for possession of marijuana, landing her under house arrest.But after run-ins with the law, she seemed to be straightening out, her family said. She loved horseback riding and enjoyed working as a counselor at a local camp...On the day she disappeared, Sally had cautioned her daughter not to go, as she had a court date the next day. But she went anyway.In the weeks following Carrie's disappearance, people began to speculate about what had happened...\"We got a call from one kid - we don't know who it was - who said she was dead beside the road,\" Sally said. The caller, who never identified himself, hung up and never contacted the family again.Other rumors were circulating. Annette said she'd heard that some men driving a pickup truck were spotted chasing her on her bicycle; others claimed they'd seen Carrie on the highway, trying to hitchhike to Lowell, Mass.; Carrie's boyfriend called and said she was working as a prostitute in New York City and didn't want to be found...The family never lost hope that Carrie was alive, following all leads and searching throughout New England. When police told the family in July 1991 that remains of a young girl had been found by a 10-year-old boy and they were likely Carrie's, her mother didn't believe it, convinced she had seen Carrie on a search through Lowell...It wasn't until dental records and a broken leg bone confirmed it was Carrie that the family had to face the truth. The family later searched the area and found clothes that belonged to Carrie less than 50 yards from where her skeleton was found...Media attention\"It was impossible to get away from (the media),\" Sally said. News vans and reporters also came up from Boston. Sally and her late husband, Warren, left town for a time, and would eventually cremate and bury Carrie's remains in a family plot in New Boston...\"I remember being upset because we couldn't get any (media) interested when she was missing,\" said Mike Brendle, Annette's husband. \"Then all of a sudden, everyone wanted to know about it.\"Renewed interest..In recent months, the family began working with the cold case unit of the New Hampshire Attorney General's office to find answers. Senior Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Agati said Carrie's case is unique in that all of the possible witnesses were very young, between the ages of 12 and 22...\"It's always interesting and challenging to interview anybody within that age group,\" Agati said. \"Sometimes, you get answers where it seems like the witness just wasn't really focused .??. You have a group of witnesses (and) some were throwing out anything they could think of, and other ones, we think, were definitely holding back on information that they had.\"..Agati said he is certain there are people still in the area who hold information about what happened.\"We don't see that in every one of our cases,\" he said. \". That can be the crack that could lead this case to break wide open.\"..\"What we see is that, in some cases, people just say, 'Well, I was never asked,'?\" said Joelle Wiggin, a cold case victim's advocate for the attorney general.\"Some people are just trying to shut it out and say, 'That was a part of my life when I was a different person,'?\" Agati added. \"They try not to remember that time.\"..Efforts continueThe Moss family has also started a blog, \"Justice for Carrie Moss,\" to get out their story and, hopefully, find clues. The site was designed with the help of Ronda Maxwell Randal, an elementary school classmate of Annette's who also has a blog dedicated to the case of the remains of a woman and three girls who are believed to have been her children, found in Allenstown between 1985 and 2000...\"The thing that really sticks out is how few of Carrie's friends contacted the Moss family,\" Maxwell Randal said. She scanned and posted a handwritten list to the blog of more than 60 acquaintances of Carrie's who the family believes could have information...\"I think there probably are a number of people who know what happened to her,\" she said. \"There hasn't really been a forum for that. My hope is that the blog becomes a place where people see Carrie as more than one description, like 'troubled runaway' . but they really see her and her family and her life, and get a better sense of who she was, and maybe will reach out to the family.\"..A family's pleaThe family has its suspicions about who may have been involved in Carrie's disappearance - all men.Annette says she will still approach people in public who she thinks were involved with Carrie's death...\"You want closure, but you also want someone to pay the price for taking your little sister's life,\" she said.The family says it's difficult knowing there are people who likely know what happened to Carrie - but at this point, they just want answers...\"Someone out there knows something,\" said Leonard Moss, Carrie's only brother. \"It's funny how her friends all scattered at the same time.\"\"Any bit of information . even if they don't think that it's important, they should come forward with (what they know),\" said Wendy Plourde, another of Carrie's older sisters. \"It's never too late.\"..Anyone with information about the disappearance and/or death of Carrie Moss should contact the New Hampshire State Police at 271-3575; the New Hampshire Attorney General, 271-3658; the New Boston Police Department, 487-2433; or the Manchester or Concord regional Crimeline, 624-4040 or 226-3100. Tips can also be given directly to Annette Brendle by calling 486-4753, emailing carriemossnh@gmail.com or mailing her at 59 Whipplewill Road, New Boston 03070...", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was July 1989, and Carrie was 14.
