The group also is looking to expand the trail to other historic St. Petersburg neighborhoods such as Methodist Town. A planning committee for the October event is hosting public meetings in the next two months at the Dr. Carter G. Woodson African American History Museum at 2240 9th Ave S. The next meeting is at 6 p.m. Aug. 19.

What they might not know is that Elder Jordan, a former slave who helped build this business district, was said to have loaned money during the Great Depression to a city that forced people of his race to live outside the prosperous downtown, said Gwendolyn Reese, president of the local African American Heritage Association.\n\nThese are the kinds of stories told in words and pictures on the new African American Heritage Trail, a series of 20 historic markers along 22nd Street and Ninth Avenue South recently installed by the City of St. Petersburg.\n\nNeighborhood leaders and city officials, including former Mayor Bill Foster, gathered Saturday at the crossroads of the two critical thoroughfares to unveil the only interpretive trail of its kind in the region focused on the history of the local black community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for our people, for African Americans, to know their history, but it\u2019s also important for others because then there\u2019s a level of respect when you understand how people persevered,\u201d said Reese, 65, a lifelong city resident who led a two-year effort to develop the heritage trail.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know how difficult it was to be black in those times of Jim Crow and racism, but we survived and we flourished.\u201d\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nThe trail was funded by a $50,000 National Park Service grant issued through the Florida Department of State, but the inspiration for documenting the neighborhood\u2019s past came from the city\u2019s previous mayor.\n\n\u201cHe [Foster] talked about going to wakes and funerals of many of the leaders in the black community and hearing these incredible stories, but that\u2019s the only place you\u2019d hear them and how could we preserve these stories for the future?\u201d Reese said.\n\nFoster on Saturday said the trail tells a part of the city\u2019s history that\u2019s rich, but not all \u201csunshine\u201d for a community that was segregated for decades. \u201cWe have a side, a story that a lot of people don\u2019t like to tell, but it has to be told, because if you don\u2019t learn history, it repeats,\u201d Foster said.\n\nThe former mayor\u2019s idea led to Reese and local historian Jon Wilson to form the African American Heritage Association, whose members began collecting stories from still-living elders of the neighborhood and their families.\n\nTheir oral histories and archival photographs tell the story of how the first black residents transformed palmettos and pine trees into a thriving business district during a 100-year period stretching from the end of the Civil War to the Civil Rights era.\n\nAlong 22nd Street, the interpretive markers tell of grocery stores, doctor\u2019s offices, beer gardens and nightclubs, while Ninth Avenue includes important churches, schools and neighborhoods.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nBy 1960, this area south of downtown was packed with more than 100 businesses.\n\nThe decades after racial integration saw it fall into decline and many of its cultural institutions disappear into history.\n\nReese and others identify the construction of Interstate 275, which bisected 22nd Street, as a turning point, followed by the displacement of the nearby Gas Plant neighborhood to make way for Tropicana Field.\n\nIntegration also meant people once forced to live and do business in a confined area could move freely elsewhere in the city, Reese said.\n\nWith entrepreneurs now returning to 22nd Street, residents are hopeful this neglected part of the city may regain some of its former glory.\n\nThe trail could help bring more residents and visitors south of the I-275 overpass and hasten that economic recovery, said current Mayor Rick Kriseman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our hope that we bring visitors and locals alike from all over to explore the neighborhood, to spend money in this Main Street community and to help revitalize the district and, most importantly, to learn about the history that makes this city so special,\u201d Kriseman said.\n\nFor residents like Betty Harden, whose great-grandfather opened the well-known Harden\u2019s Grocery at the corner of 22nd Street and Ninth Avenue, the trail means the people that built this community won\u2019t be forgotten.\n\n\u201cThe younger generation now has an opportunity to learn about their relatives who came here and built a community we can all be proud of,\u201d Harden said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 09 Aug 2014 19:47:21 -0400", "Description": "ST.
