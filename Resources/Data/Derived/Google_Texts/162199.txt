ATLANTA, Nov. 17, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American CareSource Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:GNOW), owner and operator of urgent and primary care centers and a leading national network of ancillary healthcare providers, yesterday reported net revenue of $6.5 million for the third quarter of 2015, as compared with $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2014.

The net loss for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015, was $2.2 million, as compared with a net loss of $1.5 million for the third quarter of 2014. The increase in the net loss is primarily attributable to costs incurred in the support and operation of our growing urgent and primary care business.

Urgent and Primary Care Center Highlights

We owned and operated ten urgent and primary care centers operating during the entire third quarter of 2015. Our centers are located in Georgia (3), Alabama (3), Florida (2) and Virginia (2).



The ten centers reported approximately 21,000 patient encounters for the third quarter. This represents an increase (on a pro-forma basis including encounters reported by prior owners of the centers) of approximately 500 encounters in the third quarter of 2015 over the same quarter of 2014. The increase is largely attributable to the addition of our new center located in Springville, Alabama, which we opened in the fourth quarter of 2014.



Our urgent and primary care center revenues were $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2015, which represents a 100% increase over the same quarter in 2014. This new business segment incurred an operating loss of $455,000 for the quarter, before recording depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $122,000.



We increased our existing $6.0 million line of credit by $1.0 million in the third quarter of 2015. This additional debt capital provides us with funding to support our growth and working capital needs. The interest rate on the $7.0 million credit facility is LIBOR plus 1.75% per annum, which as of the date of this release is 1.95%. We currently have $1.0 million available on the line of credit.



We adopted a new brand name for our urgent and primary care center business, GoNow Doctors. We believe the brand will be central to our improved marketing and advertising efforts, which will better enable us to capitalize on the retail nature of our business. In connection with this change, we changed our Nasdaq ticker symbol from "ANCI" to "GNOW" in the third quarter of 2015.



On July 31, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain assets used in the operation of Medac Health Services, P.A., a four-center urgent care operation located in Wilmington, North Carolina. The agreement, as amended, provides that the transaction will close, if at all, by November 20, 2015. The total consideration for the transaction is $5.6 million, subject to certain adjustments. We currently do not have funds sufficient to consummate the purchase and there is no assurance that we will obtain sufficient funds by that date or that the closing date can be extended beyond November 20, 2015.

Ancillary Network Highlights

Revenue from our ancillary network business in the third quarter of 2015 was $4.3 million, as compared to $5.7 million for the same quarter in 2014. We do not anticipate increases in revenue from our ancillary network business in the current or future quarters.



Effective October 1, 2014, we entered into a management services agreement with HealthSmart, under which HealthSmart manages the operation of our ancillary network business subject to the supervision of an oversight committee a majority of the members of which are appointed by us. HealthSmart hired substantially all of our ancillary network employees. We compensate HealthSmart with a fee equal the sum of 120% of all expenses incurred in managing the business and 35% of the profits. We are currently negotiating the sale of the business to HealthSmart, and, if successful, we anticipate entering into a definitive agreement to sell the business in the fourth quarter of 2015.



The ancillary network business experienced an operating loss for the third quarter of 2015 of $192,000 compared to operating income of $406,000 for the comparable quarter of 2014, before recording depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately $152,000 and $154,000, respectively.



Shared Services

With our entry into the urgent and primary care center business, we created a Shared Services accounting category to track and record the costs of managing both our urgent and primary care center segment and the ancillary network segment. These costs include finance and accounting, human resources, legal, marketing and information technology.



Shared services incurred total operating expenses of $1.6 million for the third quarter of 2015 compared to $1.8 million for the comparable quarter of 2014. The decrease in costs relates, among other things, to payroll reductions resulting from the elimination of certain corporate support positions.

Financial Liquidity

Total cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2015 amounted to $0.2 million, as compared to $1.0 million as of December 31, 2014. The decrease is attributable to operating losses. We have used $11.0 million of our bank lines of credit through September 30, 2015, and have an additional $1.0 million available as of November 16, 2015.



We have initiated efforts to raise additional equity capital during 2015. On February 6, 2015 we filed a Form S-1 registration statement to sell additional shares of our common stock. To date, however, we have not been successful in raising capital pursuant to such registration statement on terms satisfactory to us.
