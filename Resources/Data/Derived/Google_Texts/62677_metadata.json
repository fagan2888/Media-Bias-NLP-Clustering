That\u2019s got to be right up there with President Clinton declaring, \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman.\u201d\n\nA new Congressional Budget Office report has blown the lid off the Obama whopper fib. The Congressional Budget Office reports that through the first four months of fiscal 2015, federal spending is rising at an 8.2 percent clip. Most components of spending are relatively flat and national defense outlays \u2014 the most important function of government \u2014 are falling. Still, one area accounts for almost the entire budget blowout: Obamacare.\n\nMedicaid spending is up a stratospheric 23 percent so far this year thanks to massive new enrollments. In addition, the $7 billion in Obamacare \u201cexchange subsidies\u201d so far this year brings the rise in costs of the \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act to nearly 30 percent. In one year. And in an era of almost no inflation. Obamacare has turned out to be, just as feared, the largest expansion of government since the Great Society.\n\nThis stampede of rising health costs was so predictable that most budget experts acknowledged \u2014 even liberals, privately \u2014 costs would spike when the new health law insurance subsidies kicked in. It had to happen. How could we possibly put tens of millions more Americans on Medicaid and other taxpayer assistance and also save money at the same time? It was a laughable claim that Team Obama somehow reiterated time and again \u2014 and they even managed to keep a straight face.\n\nAnd this is a president who lectures Republicans in Congress about \u201csimple math.\u201d\n\nBut now that Obamacare is the law of the land, the White House openly boasts about how many people are relying on taxpayers for health coverage. Listen to what the administration gleefully reported late last year:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Medicaid enrollment report shows even more great news: Approximately 8.7 million additional Americans now have coverage through Medicaid and [the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program], many for the very first time. Medicaid enrollment grew to more than 67.9 million in August 2014, which shows nearly a 15 percent increase over the average monthly enrollment for July through September 2013.\u201d\n\nWait. This is \u201cgreat news?\u201d How is putting more people on Medicaid a triumph? Medicaid is a welfare program. If this were a well-functioning economy with good jobs, Medicaid rolls would be shrinking and Americans would be coming self sufficient.\n\nMr. Clinton used to boast \u2014 justifiably so \u2014 after signing welfare reform about the millions of people that were taken off welfare during his watch. This president perversely boasts about how many people he puts on welfare.\n\nA major reason more people are on Medicaid is that a near-record number of Americans of working age don\u2019t have a job. They can\u2019t get health care through their non-existent employer. At the same time, employers are also dropping their health coverage and dumping employees and their families on Medicaid and the Obamacare exchanges. How is this a victory?\n\nMeanwhile, families are reporting hikes in premiums and fees. Premiums for Obamacare plans are on average between 7 percent and 15 percent last year for the broad coverage plans. Firms are just starting to respond to the spike in costs by dumping more workers into the government exchanges, which means even higher taxpayer costs.\n\nSo, no, Obamacare has not saved families $2,500 a year. No, it hasn\u2019t \u201cbent the cost curve for health care down.\u201d It has made the budget deficit much worse. Americans are losing the health coverage they have. This begs the question: Is there a single promise that Mr. Obama made about Obamacare that has proven truthful?\n\n\u2022 Stephen Moore is chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and a Fox News contributor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If there were a contest for the biggest lie in Washington over the past 30 years, it would be hard to compete with President Obama's boast that he would put 30 million more Americans on Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies, and this would reduce the budget deficit.
