(Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nTypically the Loveland Lake to Lake Triathlon is conquered by professionals reaching the finish line before anybody else, but amateurs took the day in the event's 14th year.\n\nWell, at least amateurs in name and spirit, however, hardcore triathlon competitors nonetheless.\n\nFront Range newcomer Erik Nau left the perfect climate and beautiful beaches of San Diego just seven months ago for a work opportunity, which landed him in Fort Collins.\n\nNau settled right in winning the male Olympic Loveland Lake to Lake Triathlon on Saturday in a comfortable time of 2:16.10, 4 minutes quicker than second-place finisher Scott Kimbell. Nau doesn't make a living off of racing triathlons, yet lives to compete in them, doing two to three a month from May to October.\n\n\"I'm an amateur; I guess you could say amateur elite. If there's an elite division, I enter it, but I'm not getting paid,\" Nau said. \"This is my first time ever doing (the Lake to Lake), and I'll definitely be back next year. It's a beautiful course.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old makes a habit of spending time on his bike on the very same roads the event uses in its biking section, saying he's ridden the track nearly every day since arriving from California.\n\nAs a result, the up and down terrain came as no surprise to Nau, who felt the middle section was key to picking up the victory. Not even a bit of cramping during the final leg, the 10-kilometer run, was enough to slow him down.\n\nBut that wasn't his only advantage. Most athletes are less trained in swimming than the other two portions of the triathlon, making it the toughest of the three. Growing up on the beach and surfing his whole life paid off.\n\n\"Swimming is not my weakness, probably running is my weakness,\" Nau said. \"But it's the leg I enjoy training for the most. (My strength) was the bike. I feel like I rode some of my better bike splits in this race.\"\n\nComing in first is nice, but Nau finds incentive in another reason.\n\n\"I feel good. I'm ready for a beer, you know?\" he said with a grin. \"That's sometimes my motivation to get the run over as quickly as possible to enjoy a cold beer afterwards.\"\n\nBy day Hayley Benson is a physical therapist and mother to a toddler. But in between the 32-year-old native of England is all about triathlons, having already won one in Boulder.\n\n\"I mean I'm pretty serious about it, but I'm not professional,\" she said. \"So, mom, physical therapist, triathlete and I try to be a good wife as well.\"\n\nBenson ran in the Lake to Lake for the second straight year, improving upon a third-place finish last year to take the female Olympic length crown in 2:32.37.\n\nHayley Benson of Littleton completes the running portion of the Loveland Lake to Lake Triathlon to win the women's division of the annual race Saturday. (Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nDespite winning by 3 minutes, she wasn't sure until the official results were posted that the honor of top female finisher was hers.\n\n\"I had no idea actually. You can't really tell where you're coming,\" Benson said. \"I knew there were some fast people behind me, so I thought 'just keep going.' It's a good confidence booster.\"\n\nBenson had no weak spots in her race, posting solid times in each leg starting with a 23:40 in the swim, a 1:27.06 30-mile bike ride and 39:41 on the run.\n\nEric Florio of won the shorter Lake to Lake Sprint Triathlon in 1:13.50 on the men's side, while Julianna Batizy-Morley from Centennial took the women's in 1:25.54. Loveland High School's Ashlyn Brent finished eighth and won her age group with a 1:34.02.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Sports Writer Cris Tiller at 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller\n\nLoveland Lake to Lake Triathlon\n\nAt North Lake Park\n\nMen\n\nTop 10 individuals \u2014 1.
