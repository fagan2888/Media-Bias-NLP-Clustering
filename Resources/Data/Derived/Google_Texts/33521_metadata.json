The book features scenes from the tea party Senator\u2019s career like his 21 hour filibuster against Obamacare, as well as images of his future, like him walking into the White House in 2016.\n\nThe coloring book is called Ted Cruz Saves America and it\u2019s produced by Really Big Coloring Books. For those fans who have already bought and colored in last year\u2019s, Cruz to the Future coloring book, be warned, CBS News reports that Ted Cruz Saves America is actually the same book, just re-released with an additional section. The addition is about eight pages of coloring fun.\n\nOne of the additional pages shows Ted riding on an eagle, rifle in hand, fighting against a three-headed serpent made to represent Obamacare, illegal immigration, and taxation. If that page isn\u2019t thrilling enough, there\u2019s another page with Senator Cruz and his family arriving in the White House.\n\nSo, why was a second Ted Cruz coloring book necessary?\n\nAccording to the publisher, the demand was obvious, and the new book is already paying off.\n\nThe original Ted Cruz Saves America was the number one children\u2019s coloring book on Amazon for 20 weeks according to USA Today, and the newest book looks equally promising. As the Huffington Post reports, Ted Cruz Saves America\u2019s first run of 10,000 copies were sold out within 24 hours. A second batch went out about as quickly, and now, six days after its original edition, it\u2019s on the third printing.\n\nEven though it\u2019s a re-cut of a book that\u2019s only one-year-old, Ted Cruz Saves America is a huge hit as explained by publisher Wayne Bell.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I would almost call it a phenomenon. It\u2019s beyond us. We\u2019re just trying to catch up with the printing\u2026 This book was so wildly crazy popular, some parents consider this man a real superhero.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t be confused, this coloring book depicting the senator as some kind of superhero is not meant to be an endorsement.\n\n\u201cWe make books for the entire slice of America. I\u2019ve never talked to Mr. Cruz. I don\u2019t know him\u2026But there are fanatic admirers of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Really Big Coloring Books also made a coloring book starring President Barack Obama after his 2008 inauguration. But unlike the Ted Cruz coloring book, the sequel to the Obama book flopped in 2012.\n\n[Image Credit: Youtube.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz is the star of his own coloring book, and it is selling as fast as they can print them.
