The more people who speak up encourages other people to stand up and say something.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more common than people think.\n\n\u201cBut I also know actresses who will not come forward because they are worried it will affect their careers.\u201d\n\nBuchanan, 46, said many actors learned to turn a blind eye to sexual harassment.\n\nSimone Buchanan and her son Remy, 4. Picture: Alex Coppel.\n\nShe said speaking out against her TV dad, Robert Hughes, cost her own career heavily.\n\nThe actor and mother of two said she had been passed over for many jobs since she backed co-star Sarah Monahan\u2019s account of being abused by Hughes while she was a child star on Hey Dad!\n\nBuchanan said the show, which she mostly remembers as a happy experience, had forever been tarnished in the public\u2019s eyes. And with it, the entire cast.\n\nThere were many other sex-abuse victims \u2014 some high profile \u2014 within Australia\u2019s entertainment industry, who have remained silent for fear of suffering the same fate, Buchanan said.\n\n\u201cI know that I have missed out on jobs because of the case,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to be associated with it. But that\u2019s OK. I know I did the right thing. How could anyone not stand behind their friend in a \u00adsituation like this and support them?\n\n\u201cMy cousin was abused as a child and later killed himself. When I stood up for Sarah I was standing up for the many people in my life who have been abused.\u201d\n\nRobert Hughes and wife Robin Gardiner leave Downing Centre Courts. Picture: Bradley Hunter\n\nBuchanan said it was \u00adparticularly difficult to hear Cate Blanchett thank Hughes\u2019 wife, Robyn Gardiner, during her Oscars acceptance speech this year.\n\nBlanchett\u2019s praise for Gardiner, her longtime agent, came as Hughes was being tried for his crimes against Monahan and other young girls over a 20-year period.\n\nGardiner has maintained support for her husband, who will spend 10 years behind bars.\n\nBuchanan said she had no regrets about supporting Monahan. It wasn\u2019t the first time Buchanan made a decisions that, with hindsight, probably prevented her from hitting the big time.\n\nShe said she was proud to have always put her sons, Tane, 16, and Remy, four, ahead of stardom.\n\nShe said she has used what celebrity she has to raise awareness about sex abuse and funds for the Jodie O\u2019Shea orphanage in Indonesia \u2014 a cause she discovered during her honeymoon to Bali.\n\nSince becoming a mother, Buchanan had turned down jobs that would have taken her away from home for extended periods because she did not want to leave her children in the care of nannies.\n\nShe had instead limited \u00adherself to projects based in Melbourne.\n\nShe said she would never encourage her children to follow in her footsteps \u2014 not because she feared on-set predators like Hughes, but because she believed the entertainment industry had become a lot more cutthroat than when she began.\n\nSimone Buchanan in 1988.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d see the same five girls at every audition. I\u2019d get the job one week and someone else would the next,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like it is now. These days people just want to be \u00adfamous.\n\n\u201cThese young people are thrown into Home & Away and set up to believe they\u2019re stars.\n\n\u201cThen they leave and discover that\u2019s not how the industry works.\u201d\n\nBuchanan teaches drama at Film and Television Studio International where she has taught many ex-Big Brother contestants eager to turn their 15 minutes of celebrity into something more.\n\nBut fame was never something she chased.\n\nShe was also quick to dismiss suggestion she and actor siblings Miles and Beth were the product of pushy stage parents. Buchanan was eight and Miles, 10, when they were enrolled at a drama and dance school as a distraction from their parents\u2019 divorce.\n\nWhat was meant to be a school holiday program soon became full-time work for the two youngsters who landed roles in the feature film A Good Thing Going, and then a slew of projects including The Flying Doctors and Sons and Daughters.\n\nEventually, Buchanan was cast in Hey Dad! \u2014 the role which would make her a household name.\n\nWhile working on the sitcom, Buchanan said she was offered a \u201cvery big\u201d role in a Hollywood film.\n\nShe was keen to accept but the Hey Dad! crew would not or could not spare her for six weeks to film it.\n\nActors Sarah Monahan and Simone Buchanan during an A Current Affair interview.\n\nDespite all that had \u00adhappened, Buchanan said she had \u201cthe time of her life\u201d on Hey Dad! and still counted many of the cast among her close friends.\n\nWhen Monahan came to Buchanan years after Hey Dad! was axed to say she wanted to pursue her case with police Buchanan didn\u2019t hesitate to offer her support \u2014 as did Monahan\u2019s other co-stars, Ben Oxenbould, Julie McGregor and Christopher Trusswell.\n\nBuchanan and Monahan have since become ambassadors for Bravehearts, the charity that supports victims of child-sex abuse.\n\nBuchanan said her work with Bravehearts and the media attention the Hughes case attracted encouraged many victims to contact her to share their stories. She has also received online abuse from strangers who felt she had done the wrong thing by \u00adMonahan in not coming forward sooner.\n\nBut Buchanan was little more than a teenager when Monahan first told her that Hughes had been fondling her.\n\nIt did not come as a surprise as Hughes, who Buchanan described as being \u201cvery cold with beady eyes\u201d, was \u201cstrange\u201d and had a reputation for flashing to the wardrobe and make-up girls.\n\nHughes also groped Buchanan once, but she had been old enough to fend him off.\n\nAt the time, Monahan was sketchy about the details and Hughes\u2019 actions would have been difficult to prove, so Buchanan advised her young co-star to stay away from him.\n\nBut Hughes\u2019 behaviour escalated and, among other things, he exposed himself to Monahan \u2014 and there was no mistaking his intentions. Buchanan complained to her producer and was told it would be handled. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nBuchanan left the show soon after, unable to cope with the \u201ctoxic environment\u201d on set.\n\nAlthough she would never again have the same level of prime time TV success post-Hey Dad! Buchanan has continued to work on TV shows in between caring for her boys.\n\nShe played a small but integral role of an abusive mother in the cult film, Patrick.\n\nThough she admitted filming the violent and confronting role was \u201cchallenging\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d she was proud and excited to have been given the opportunity to show she was capable of being more than the funny blonde.\n\nBuchanan also received critical acclaim for her portrayal of a woman with bipolar disorder on Neighbours .\n\nHer brother, Miles, a Logie-winning actor has battled with mental illness since his teens.\n\nBuchanan said drugs and alcohol were always readily available to young people on set. She was regularly offered them as a youngster.\n\nThough she admitted going through a wild party-girl stage, Buchanan said her family, albeit an unconventional one, had always been the most important thing in her life.\n\nsiobhan.duck@news.com.au", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "THE Rolf Harris, Robert Hughes and Jimmy Saville sex scandals are just the first act in what will be a long-running saga for the entertainment industry, according to Hey Dad star Simone Buchanan.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/dirty-secret-hey-dad-star-says-robert-hughes-case-is-the-tip-of-the-iceberg/news-story/26cb5cd353aa306ba4edc9d4d9b01898", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9e2ae79c239338d7f41164549f71b7fd", "type": "article", "description": "THE Rolf Harris, Robert Hughes and Jimmy Saville sex scandals are just the first act in what will be a long-running saga for the entertainment industry, according to Hey Dad! star Simone Buchanan.", "title": "Aussie TV\u2019s dirty little secret"}, "twitter": {"site": "@theheraldsun", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9e2ae79c239338d7f41164549f71b7fd", "description": "THE Rolf Harris, Robert Hughes and Jimmy Saville sex scandals are just the first act in what will be a long-running saga for the entertainment industry, according to Hey Dad! star Simone Buchanan.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Aussie TV\u2019s dirty little secret"}, "robots": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/26cb5cd353aa306ba4edc9d4d9b01898?domain=heraldsun.com.au"}, "articleid": "26cb5cd353aa306ba4edc9d4d9b01898", "keywords": "entertainment industry, young people, sex abuse, contestants eager, pushy stage parents, longtime agent, heightened awareness, dance school, sexual harassment, high-profile charges, acceptance speech, confronting role, sex scandals, abusive mother, young co-star, actor siblings, industry works, success post-Hey, close friends, mental illness, long-running saga, blind eye, integral role, on-set predators, toxic environment, right thing, happy experience, household name, feature film, funny blonde, beady eyes, young girls, family drama, cult film, domino effect, make-up girls, online abuse, maintained support, sex-abuse victims, party-girl stage, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, Indonesia, Hollywood, California, United States of America, Aussie TV, The Iceberg, Woody Allen, Rolf Harris, Cate Blanchett, Tane, Robyn Gardiner, Simone Buchanan, Sarah Monahan, Remy, Julie McGregor, Ben Oxenbould, Lord Hughes of Woodside, Steven Collins, Jimmy Saville", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-25T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-10-25T08:42:39.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "PREVIOUSLY: Hey Dad!\nDespite all that had \u00adhappened, Buchanan said she had \u201cthe time of her life\u201d on Hey Dad!\nShe was keen to accept but the Hey Dad!\nTHE Rolf Harris, Robert Hughes and Jimmy Saville sex scandals are just the first act in what will be a long-running saga for the entertainment industry, according to Hey Dad!\nShe said speaking out against her TV dad, Robert Hughes, cost her own career heavily."}
