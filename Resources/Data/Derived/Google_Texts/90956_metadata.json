Among many topics addressed in this hearing was the recently passed FAST Act provision to reinstate the use of private debt collectors within the IRS.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early December 2015 President Obama signed into law the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act). This Act included a provision requiring the IRS to use private debt collection companies. At that time, insideARM posted an overview of the Act\u2019s provisions, and the history of past IRS private debt collection initiatives.\n\nMany in Congress, the National Treasury Employee\u2019s Union, and others, oppose this initiative but nonetheless, the Act requires that the IRS begins entering into contracts within three months of the date of the Act\u2019s enactment, or March 4, 2016 (although there is no specific timeframe required for the placement of accounts, except \u201csoon thereafter\u201d). During Commissioner Koskinen\u2019s testimony yesterday, he noted that his Agency would miss that deadline.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything we can to get the program up and running as quickly as we can. We [are planning] a bidders conference this month. Within the 90 days we are committed to providing a timeline as to when the program would actually be up and running and implemented. The bidders conference is to get us started. Our goal \u2013 if we can pull it off \u2013 is to learn from mistakes and give it the best chance to succeed. As it stands now in the normal procurement process plus developing the program we expect to have contracts with those acceptable collectors before the end of this fiscal year.\u201d He also reminded the Committee that \u201cthis is yet another unfunded mandate, but we\u2019re going to do it anyway.\u201d\n\nChuck Grassley (R-Iowa) \u2013 who has been a long-time supporter of the Private Debt Collection initiative - countered, \u201cIt seems to me you\u2019ve already got people there you can contract with who are already in that business.\u201d Koskinen countered with a litany of objections, at which point Grassley appeared frustrated and agreed to move on to another topic.\n\nIndeed, the delay will not be surprising to anyone who reads Koskinen\u2019s prepared testimony (which, by the way, is quite an interesting read from the perspective of a taxpayer). While the Agency had a budget of $11.2 billion in FY2016, there has been a steady decline in its workforce \u2013 an estimated total decrease of 17,000 since 2010, including a reduction of over 5,000 enforcement personnel. These dwindling human resources are being spread over an increasing number of critical initiatives, including implementation of the Affordable Care Act, combating identity theft and tax fraud, and endless efforts to modernize the IT infrastructure.\n\ninsideARM Perspective\n\nWhile reading and listening to the testimony, I can\u2019t help but draw a parallel between the challenges of the IRS and the challenges of the debt collection industry. Just to start\u2026\n\nBy definition, nobody views a debt collection interaction as a positive thing. Likewise, it\u2019s hard to have a warm and fuzzy feeling about the IRS. In both cases, the best you can hope for is a pleasantly efficient and/or helpful experience. Yet both institutions are essential to a properly functioning U.S. economy.\n\nBoth the IRS and the debt collection industry struggle to modernize communications with consumers within the confines of privacy requirements and outdated laws.\n\nWhat an interesting public-private partnership this could be if the two groups could work together to discuss and find solutions for these shared challenges.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "insideARM", "description": "Yesterday Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen testified before the Senate Committee on Finance.
