Jon Tester\u2019s (D-Mont.) attendance. Tribal Health Director of Operations, Planning and Policy, Anna Whiting-Sorrel, told the summit participants that the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has created the opportunity to vastly improve health care in Indian Country. Health and Human Services Regional Director Kim Gillan discussed HHS\u2019s tribal outreach and collaboration efforts. (B.L.

It contains health care options that the IHS, due to historical underfunding, has not been able to offer its beneficiaries because it is not a health insurance program like the ACA with its mandate for private insurance coverage. Tester said the CSKT THD health care delivery system should serve as the model that other Tribal Nations should emulate to improve the health of their citizens. \u201cThis is an incredible opportunity to improve health care in Indian Country from the federal level to the local level,\u201d Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said in his opening remarks. Tester chairs the U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the IHS and the state of health care in Indian Country has been a focus of his. He also sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee and understands remedies must be creative due the limitations and pulls on the federal purse. \u201cThis effort will not be successful if you only look to the federal government. Top down solutions don\u2019t work. It\u2019s got to come from the ground up.\u201d Tribal Health Director Kevin Howlett, in an overview of the present incarnation of Tribal Health, said the journey from the past to present has been filled with a lot of peaks and valleys.

The CSKT came up with the difference. That period caused a shift in thinking on how to best meet the health care needs of the beneficiaries. Tribal Health moved from a payer of health care delivery bills to third party providers, to a health care provider that bills third parties such as private insurance, Medicare, Medicaid and Health Montana Kids, among other such entities for services it provides at its five clinics on the Flathead Reservation. \u201cOne of the reasons we\u2019ve been successful in doing this is we have really worked hard to bring our own (medical professional) people home,\u201d Howlett said. \u201cThere was a time when tribes feared educated Indians and a lot of Native students didn\u2019t want to come home because of the politics and stress. But this meeting isn\u2019t about complaining; it\u2019s about the opportunities we have to better health care in Indian Country. What we have done here on the Flathead other tribes may want to follow.\u201d Patricia Iron Cloud of Fort Peck talks about personal health care issues she has experienced as an American Indian. (B.L.

It will focus on what is doable and do it the best it can. \u201cWe have to be receptive and responsive to the people we serve. We have made the commitment to do things differently.\u201d That commitment has resulted in a Tribal Health Department employee growth from three to 160 people that serve beneficiaries at five THD clinics. The new clinics and clinic upgrades have all been paid for with third-party revenue that by law has to be spent on health care provision. \u201cEverybody has an opportunity to do this,\u201d Howlett said.

Azure photo) The main driver in the new opportunity is the Affordable Care Act. By law American Indians must participate in it. The ACA offers health care options that heretofore were unavailable through the Indian Health Service. Many of the federal, regional, state, local and tribal officials as well as insurance companies in attendance acknowledged that the ACA would result in better health care delivery for Americans but said the Indian and non-Indian public have been slow to buy into it because of the politics and confusion about the law. They all have a stake in the success of the ACA but figuring out how to capitalize on it successfully, especially in Indian Country where IHS has been the only health care system American Indians are familiar with, will take a concerted effort of all affected parties. The first step in that effort was taken last week on the Flathead Indian Reservation.
