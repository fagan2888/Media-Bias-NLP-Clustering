The Metropolitan Museum of Art intends to float $250 million in taxable bonds to fund a variety of capital projects, such as upgrades to skylights over its European galleries, according to a preliminary prospectus issued this week.

The bonds could be offered for sale as early as Monday, according to Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, which assigned the museum a top-notch AAA rating.

It is fairly common for large cultural institutions to issue debt as a way to pay for capital projects, said Carolyn McLean, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor’s. The Met has other outstanding long-term debt, stemming from bonds issued in 2006 and 1993 on the museum’s behalf.

“We don’t expect them to issue any more debt in the foreseeable future,” Ms. McLean said. “The Met has the $3 billion endowment, so they should be able to pay it back.”

A spokeswoman for the museum said Thursday: “Given the Museum’s strong financial position, world-renowned collection, and global reputation, we expect our transaction to be well-received by capital markets.”
