The Lamar Savages boy's basketball team hosted the Dolores Huerta Scorpions in a Tri-Peaks District pig-tail game on Saturday, Feb. 21 at the Lamar Community Building.

The winner moved on in the district bracket and the season was over for the loser.

Unfortunately, the Lamar Savages saw their season come to an end in a 62-55 loss to the Scorpions.

The Savages held a 20-12 lead with 6:36 showing in the second quarter before Dolores Huerta cut the deficit to 28-25 at halftime.

In the second half, the Savages were unable to overcome poor officiating that didn't help their cause.

Lamar ended the season with an 8-12 record under new head coach Austin Wertz.

It was the best season for the Savages in a number of years.

The eight wins marked the most for a Lamar team since the 2009 season when the Savages posted a 12-8 record that year.

Lamar won seven games straight games in a stretch from Jan. 27 through Feb. 13 but the Savages lost three in a row.
