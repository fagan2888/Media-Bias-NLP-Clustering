The benefits in the benchmark plan simply serve as a blueprint outlining what must be included, as a minimum, in all individual and small-group plans offered in Colorado in 2017 and beyond.\n\nHealth insurance carriers can still develop their own plan designs, which may include additional benefits.\n\nThe plan selection doesn\u2019t determine how costs for health services are shared between individuals and the insurance company, DOI officials said. Carriers still have the flexibility to develop how costs are shouldered through deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance amounts. In addition, each carrier will still use its own provider network.\n\nTo be eligible for selection as a state benchmark, a health plan had to provide coverage in almost all 10 essential health-benefits categories identified in the Affordable Care Act: outpatient, emergency room, inpatient, prenatal and newborn, mental health, prescriptions, lab tests, rehabilitation therapies, comprehensive pediatric services (medical, dental, vision), vaccines and preventive care, including contraception.\n\nThe Kaiser State Employee Plan does not provide coverage of pediatric dental benefits, so the state is supplementing the selected plan with pediatric dental benefits contained in the state\u2019s Child Health Plan Plus Dental Program.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado officials select state\u2019s required health insurance benefits", "title": "Colorado officials select state\u2019s required health insurance benefits", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/01/colorado-officials-select-states-required-health-insurance-benefits/", "image": {"width": 340, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150701__p_43410d26-0114-4d71-996a-b5a1f3c8cae4lsoriginalph-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150701__p_43410d26-0114-4d71-996a-b5a1f3c8cae4lsoriginalph-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-01T15:02:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T09:28:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Kaiser State Employee Plan does not provide coverage of pediatric dental benefits, so the state is supplementing the selected plan with pediatric dental benefits contained in the state\u2019s Child Health Plan Plus Dental Program.\nThe state of Colorado has notified the federal government it has selected the Kaiser State Employee Plan as its 2017 benchmark plan representing essential health benefits, officials said Tuesday.\nThe plan selection doesn\u2019t determine how costs for health services are shared between individuals and the insurance company, DOI officials said.\nThe selection doesn\u2019t mean that everyone will have to become Kaiser customers, Division of Insurance officials said.\nHealth insurance carriers can still develop their own plan designs, which may include additional benefits."}
