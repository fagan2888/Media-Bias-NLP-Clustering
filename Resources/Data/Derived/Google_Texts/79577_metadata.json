That was the subject of the Health Care Real Estate Investment Opportunities Summit at the Park Lane hotel in Manhattan Thursday that was sponsored by iGlobal Forum.\n\nThe consensus was largely: yes. Major changes in the health care industry in the wake of the Affordable Care Act are creating less demand for space in traditional hospitals and more demand for space in a wide range of other health care properties.\n\nThat\u2019s driving up prices and sparking development, panelists said.\n\nValues also are expected to stay high thanks to the low interest rate environment and money flowing into the sector from private equity firms, foreign investors, real estate investment trusts and others, according to participants at the conference.\n\nHere are some of the highlights from the sessions:\n\n\u2013 Prices have been going up particularly for medical office buildings. In 2008, investors buying such properties were getting initial yields from the buildings\u2019 net income in the 8% to 9% range, panelists said. But today, because prices have risen, those returns have dropped to below 6%.\n\n\u2013 Because prices for medical office buildings have risen, investors are increasingly looking at other types of health care properties that are considered more risky, like skilled nursing facilities. \u201cInvestors are going up the risk curve,\u201d said Michael Bennett, a managing director at HFF.\n\n\u2013 Hospitals and health care systems have been reluctant to sell the massive amounts of properties they own on their campuses. That\u2019s one of the reasons prices are high for medical office buildings. \u201cThe hospitals are not releasing their portfolios of properties,\u201d said John Marshall, a vice president with Duke Realty.\n\n\u2013 But as prices rise, hospitals might begin to change their mind about selling. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see more on-campus property coming onto the market,\u201d predicted Jay Miele, managing director with Hammond Hanlon Camp LLC.\n\n\u2013 New types of health care properties are being created as traditional hospitals face increasing pressure to discharge patients earlier. Last year, for example, Mainstreet, a Carmel, Ind. real estate company, developed about 20 properties for patients who are discharged from hospitals but still need medical care, according to Scott White, executive vice president. Mainstreet expects to develop about 50 such facilities in 2015, he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Last year was a good year for owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, medical office buildings and other properties in the health care sector.", "title": "Experts Predict Another Good Year for Health Care Real Estate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2015/01/09/experts-predict-another-good-year-for-health-care-real-estate/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "wsjrealestate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Real Estate", "article.headline": "Experts Predict Another Good Year for Health Care Real Estate", "description": "Last year was a good year for owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, medical office buildings and other properties in the health care sector.", "article_section": "Real Estate", "author": "Peter Grant", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Developments Blog", "page.subsection": "Developments", "article.summary": "Last year was a good year for owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, medical office buildings and other properties in the health care sector.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-01-09T17:27:22-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2015/01/09/experts-predict-another-good-year-for-health-care-real-estate/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DVB-22616", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Real Estate", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Last year was a good year for owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, medical office buildings and other properties in the health care sector.", "title": "Experts Predict Another Good Year for Health Care Real Estate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2015/01/09/experts-predict-another-good-year-for-health-care-real-estate/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Developments", "article.id": "BL-DVB-22616", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-09T17:27:22-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde512\"", "article_summary": "That was the subject of the Health Care Real Estate Investment Opportunities Summit at the Park Lane hotel in Manhattan Thursday that was sponsored by iGlobal Forum.\nMajor changes in the health care industry in the wake of the Affordable Care Act are creating less demand for space in traditional hospitals and more demand for space in a wide range of other health care properties.\nLast year was a good year for owners of nursing homes, assisted living facilities, medical office buildings and other properties in the health care sector.\n\u2013 New types of health care properties are being created as traditional hospitals face increasing pressure to discharge patients earlier.\n\u2013 Hospitals and health care systems have been reluctant to sell the massive amounts of properties they own on their campuses."}
