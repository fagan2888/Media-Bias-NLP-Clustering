FORT COLLINS — Colorado State coach Jim McElwain said his team will not be scared or intimidated Saturday when the Rams play at top-ranked Alabama.

The usual crowd of 102,000-plus is expected at Bryant-Denny Stadium. It’s the home opener for the Crimson Tide (2-0, 1-0 SEC).

“I told our guys, ‘It’s not about (Alabama’s) mystique or tradition, it’s about measuring yourself against the best,” McElwain said Monday during his weekly news conference.

“I don’t think our guys will be intimidated. If anybody is scared, and I’ll see that in their eyes this week, I’ll leave them home.”

McElwain served as Alabama’s offensive coordinator for four years prior to being named CSU coach in December, 2011. Colorado State (1-2) is coming off its first victory, a 34-17 home win over FCS-level Cal Poly.

McElwain said he will take a team to Tuscaloosa, Ala., that’s prepared to play.

“The only reason to be scared is if you’re not sure,” McElwain said. “And there’s no reason to not be sure about what you’re doing.

“So it comes down to your preparation. It comes down to, ‘What will we do today? What do we do in this (practice) period? And how do we prepare ourselves to put ourselves in a position to play hard and measure our abilities, and who we are and what we’re all about against the best?’

“Our approach is, ‘Guys, who gets an opportunity to match yourself against the best? You can’t do that every week'”

McElwain said his team is not going to Alabama “and throw a bunch of tricks” at the Crimson Tide. The Rams, he explained, will be who they are.

“We’re going to find out a ‘baseline’ to see where we’re at,” McElwain said. “Our guys will see it’s a special place. But let’s go play. We’ll measure ourselves against the best and then correct some things and then move on to the next (game).”
