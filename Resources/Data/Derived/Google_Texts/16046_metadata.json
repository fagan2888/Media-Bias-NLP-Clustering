That gap includes non-payments, underpayments and downright fraud.\n\nRelated: Why the Cash-Strapped IRS Isn\u2019t Ready for Obamacare\n\nThough IRS administrator John Koskinen says his agency is ready for Obamacare, he repeated his calls for more IRS funding in order to efficiently carry out the law.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge to us is funding,\u201d Koskinen said in a speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday. \u201cWe have fewer employees and resources, even as our responsibilities expand.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, Congress passed the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. One of the goals of that act was to achieve 80 percent electronic filing for both individual and business tax returns. That goal was achieved in 2012, which likely prompted additional budget cuts.\n\nThe report stated, \u201cElectronic filing also substantially reduces IRS submission processing costs, resulting in productivity savings that are typically reinvested into other IRS programs that provide additional services to taxpayers.\u201d\n\nUnder the new health law, the IRS is responsible for enforcing 45 new provisions including issuing penalties to Americans who are without health coverage after the open enrollment deadline, which ended on March 31. In addition, the agency is charged with verifying whether people who were approved for subsidies actually qualify and then helping to distribute those billions of subsidy dollars to people who purchased coverage on the state and federal exchanges, among other things.\n\nAdministering the subsidies will be a heavy lift for an agency that claims to already be overburdened and under-budgeted. \u201cSince we are mandated to implement ACA, that means our budget level for other major projects like updating our IT systems has been shelved,\u201d Koskinen said.\n\nRelated: Scandal-Scarred IRS Blew $50 Million on Meetings\n\nThe IRS chief\u2019s request for more funding comes on the heels of a report from the agency\u2019s inspector general, which shows the IRS is already experiencing challenges enforcing the law.\n\n\u201cThe ACA contains an extensive array of tax law challenges that will present continuing source of challenges for the IRS in the coming years,\u201d the auditor said. The auditor also made clear that the IRS has more work to do before it can effectively enforce the new provisions, including developing a more effective plan to determine whether tax-exempt hospitals are in compliance with the ACA.\n\n\u201cThe IRS has made progress establishing controls to assess tax exempt hospital organization compliance, however additional work will be required once legal guidance is published,\u201d the auditor said. \u201cUntil guidance is published the public cannot be assured that the IRS has implemented controls to ensure compliance with ACA provisions designed to protect those served by tax-exempt hospitals.\u201d\n\nKoskinen blamed the \u201clack of funding\u201d for \u201csignificantly straining their ability\u201d to enforce provisions under the new law. \u201cThe IRS is basically the only major agency running on post-sequester level funding.\u201d\n\nThe agency\u2019s budget was cut for the fourth year in a row in the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed by President Obama. The agency was allocated $11.2 billion \u2013down from $12 billion for the 2013 fiscal year--a significant decline from the IRS\u2019s request Koskinen said the agency needs in order to collect tax revenue, prevent fraud and implement Obamacare.\n\nHe added that the number one complaint he hears from IRS workers across the country, is the concern that they don\u2019t have enough employees to help provide services to taxpayers.\n\nStill, some lawmakers are skeptical that the agency should get more funding. They point out that the IRS, which frequently says it is underfunded, held expensive employee retreats and doled out employee bonuses while the agency was the center of a scandal for allegedly targeting certain GOP tax-exempt groups.\n\n\u201cWhat I find unacceptable is that in this $11.3 billion appropriation that the IRS received this year, that you can't find the money to answer more than half the phone calls and yet you can find the money to pay $63 million in bonuses,\" said Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.) said at a committee hearing last month. \"It seems to be that might be a slap in the face to the taxpayers.\"\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Now that the open enrollment period has come to a close, the next challenge for Obamac", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Next Challenge: IRS Verification", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/03/Obamacare-s-Next-Challenge-IRS-Verification", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03272013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/04/03/Obamacare-s-Next-Challenge-IRS-Verification", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03272013_IRS_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Now that the open enrollment period has come to a close, the next challenge for Obamac", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeade\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe biggest challenge to us is funding,\u201d Koskinen said in a speech at the National Press Club on Wednesday.\nRelated: Why the Cash-Strapped IRS Isn\u2019t Ready for ObamacareThough IRS administrator John Koskinen says his agency is ready for Obamacare, he repeated his calls for more IRS funding in order to efficiently carry out the law.\n\u201cWe have fewer employees and resources, even as our responsibilities expand.\u201dIn 1998, Congress passed the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act.\nRelated: Scandal-Scarred IRS Blew $50 Million on MeetingsThe IRS chief\u2019s request for more funding comes on the heels of a report from the agency\u2019s inspector general, which shows the IRS is already experiencing challenges enforcing the law.\n\u201cThe IRS has made progress establishing controls to assess tax exempt hospital organization compliance, however additional work will be required once legal guidance is published,\u201d the auditor said."}
