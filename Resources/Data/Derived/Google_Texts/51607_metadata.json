The team was educated on risks as well as prevention techniques and even communication strategies to promote prevention, the release said.\n\n\u201cWhen we began the quality improvement project, our rate of pressure ulcers was almost 17 percent,\u201d said McDonald. \u201cAfter a year, the rate was down to 5.3 percent, and currently we are just under 5 percent.\u201d\n\nAt the Inn at City Hall, staff undertook a fall prevention program. Each resident is assessed for their risk of falls. Activities and education is provided to help build strength and knowledge of safer living, and individual progress is tracked, the release said.\n\nInn at City Hall administrator Lynda Pratt said, \u201cWe take a proactive approach to fall prevention and that has made for happier and safer living conditions. In addition, we\u2019ve increased participation in our facility social activities overall.

Twenty organizations exceeded core criteria, receiving Advanced recognition; 25 others received Most Improved and 25 Most Wired Small and Rural.\n\nThe press release said that hospitals use information technology to better connect care providers as the nation\u2019s health care system transitions to more integrated and patient-centered care. For instance, 67 percent of most wired hospitals share critical patient information electronically with specialists and other care providers, according to the release. Most Wired hospitals, those that meet a set of rigorous criteria across four operational categories, have made tremendous gains by using IT to reduce the likelihood of medical errors. Among those hospitals, 81 percent of medications are matched to the patient, nurse and order via bar code technology at the bedside.\n\nMaineGeneral Medical Center receives gift from the Waterville Rotary Club\n\nMaineGeneral Medical Center officials were today presented with a check for $18,000 from the Waterville Rotary Club to support the capital campaign for the Alfond Center for Health.

We have heard about the challenges of treating some newborns with special needs. MaineGeneral\u2019s new level II NICU provides a level of care that keeps families together right here in the Kennebec Valley. These are essential services to maintain in our region.\u201d\n\nThe level II NICU has special equipment that had not been available in the Kennebec Valley until the opening of the new hospital. The new equipment and services available for certain babies helps keep more families in the area instead of traveling outside the region for such specialized services, according to the release.\n\nCompiled from contributed releases", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brostek named CAHC executive director; Servpro recognized with Director's Silver Award.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "Brostek named CAHC executive director; Servpro recognized with Director's Silver Award.", "title": "Central Maine business briefs - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/315561_264626_khealth_enroll_2.jpg", "height": 684}, "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/08/02/central-maine-business-briefs-8/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/315561_264626_khealth_enroll_2.jpg", "description": "Brostek named CAHC executive director; Servpro recognized with Director's Silver Award.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Central Maine business briefs - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-08-02T16:41:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7e3\"", "article_summary": "Brostek named consumers health care group directorEmily Brostek, the associate director of the Consumers for Affordable Health Care has been named executive director of the Augusta office.\nThe public interest reporting group has produced more than 150 investigative stories about Maine state and local government, according to a press release.\nIn particular, the club was inspired by the work of the hospital\u2019s maternity and pediatrics center, according to a press release.\nBrostek was recently named executive director of Consumers for Affordable Health Care offices in Augusta.\nThe award is from the National Quality Award program, presented by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living."}
