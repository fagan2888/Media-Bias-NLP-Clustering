That represented roughly one-tenth of one percent of the individual exchange market. In several counties, fewer than a dozen people chose the plan and in several others no one chose their plan.\n\nAsked if the lack of a rate proposal meant the company is withdrawing from the exchange, Anderson responded, \u201cThat is my understanding, correct.\u201d\n\nThe 15 other companies that offered plans this year have all filed rate proposals for next year, and two additional insurance companies, the Freelancers Union and WellCare, have said they will offer plans on the exchange.\n\nAnderson noted that the filing to D.F.S. is for prior approval of rates for 2015 for those companies already on the exchange, and more companies could join in the coming year.\n\n\u201cI would note again that this is for the prior approval process. It\u2019s certainly possible that there will be new entrants onto the exchange as well,\u201d he said.\n\nA representative from American Progressive could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nNext year's open enrollment begins November 15.\n\n--additional reporting by Dan Goldberg", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2014/07/8549356/first-company-withdraws-state-health-exchange", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20TodaysOptions_0.png", "type": "article", "title": "First company withdraws from state health exchange"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "One of the insurance companies offering plans on the New York State  Health Exchange is withdrawing from the network, according to the  Department of Financial Services."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9148\"", "article_summary": "Today's Options of New York operated in 37 counties across New York State, but only 384 people signed up for its plans, according to a report from the state health department.\nOne of the insurance companies on the New York State Health Exchange did not file the necessary paperwork to offer plans next year, according to the Department of Financial Services.\n\u201cThey did not file to sell this year on the exchange,\u201d said New York Department of Financial Services spokesperson Matt Anderson.\nAmerican Progressive Life & Health Insurance Company of New York, also known as Today\u2019s Options of New York, failed to file a 2015 rate proposal, which would make the company the first to withdraw from the state's exchange.\nThe state's exchange was created by the Affordable Care Act, and sold private insurance plans to about 370,000 New Yorkers in its first individual market offering."}
