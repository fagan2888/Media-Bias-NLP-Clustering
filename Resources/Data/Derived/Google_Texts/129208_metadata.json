His wife, Susan Schneider, has revealed that he was struggling with a recent diagnosis of early Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cRobin\u2019s sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression, anxiety as well as early stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease, which he was not yet ready to share publicly,\u201d she said in a public statement.\n\nNearly 25 years ago, Williams costarred, with Robert De Niro, in a widely acclaimed movie about a drug used to treat Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n>> Robin Williams\u2019 10 Unforgettable Roles\n\nIn the 1990 film Awakenings, based on neurologist Oliver Sacks\u2019 1973 memoir of the same title, Williams plays Dr. Malcolm Sayer (a character based on Sacks), who uses a drug called L-dopa on patients with Parkinsonian symptoms so severe that they seemed to be frozen. Sacks first saw success with the drug \u2013 widely considered \u201cthe gold standard for treating Parkinson\u2019s disease\u201d \u2013 on these encephalitis lethargica cases.\n\nDe Niro plays a patient, Leonard Lowe, who is \u201cawakened\u201d after Williams (Sacks) uses L-dopa on him and gains the inspiration to live a full life.\n\nSoon after Awakenings was released, Robert Ebert, the late movie critic, posed some questions that Williams might have been trying to answer himself in his final days: \u201cWho are we, anyway? How much of the self we treasure so much is simply a matter of good luck, of being spared in a minefield of neurological chance? If one has no hope, which is better: To remain hopeless, or to be given hope and then lose it again?\u201d\n\nMichael J. Fox, who after being diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s in 1991 founded the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson\u2019s Research, tweeted his surprise in hearing of Williams\u2019 diagnosis: \u201cStunned to learn Robin had PD. Pretty sure his support for our Fdn predated his diagnosis. A true friend; I wish him peace.\u201d\n\nThe foundation\u2019s Fox Feed blog posted yesterday about the link between Parkinson\u2019s and depression.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\n\u201cDepression is a symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease, separate from the emotional response that comes with a diagnosis,\u201d the blog said. \u201cAs many as 50 percent of people with Parkinson\u2019s show clinically significant symptoms of depression at some point in their disease course.\u201d\n\nWilliams, it turns out, was a devoted supporter of the Michael J. Fox Foundation. He regularly performed at the foundation\u2019s annual benefit, A Funny Thing Happened on The Way to Cure Parkinson\u2019s Gala, which raises nearly $5 million each year for Parkinson\u2019s research.\n\nPhoto: Reed Saxon/AP Photo\n\n>>Next: 10 Drugs That May Cause Memory Loss\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "As details of Robin Williams\u2019 death continue to emerge, we learn more about the actor\u2019s life.
