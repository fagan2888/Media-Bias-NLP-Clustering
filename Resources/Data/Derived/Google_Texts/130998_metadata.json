Gen. John Rosa suspended the cadets involved. A school investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe incident impacted the athletics department last week when basketball signee Mohammed Kabir asked to be released from his letter of intent with The Citadel. The native of Nigeria cited that incident as his reason.\n\nIn an interview Saturday, Senter discussed the potential impact of the incident on his department. He said no other recruits in any sports have asked to be released, and that the school is reviewing Kabir\u2019s request.\n\nQ: How concerned are you about the impact this might be having on Citadel athletics?\n\nA: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about it. I think it gives us a chance to have a dialogue about issues that are dear to us, like honor, duty and respect. When something like this picture shows up, does it concern people? Absolutely. But we are going to address and take it head on.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that it\u2019s is easy to take anything out of context. Certainly it looks bad, but it\u2019s not what we stand for.\u201d\n\nQ: What is your message to parents who are concerned about this incident and sending their children to The Citadel?\n\nA: \u201cI think that\u2019s a fair question. I think I would try to help them understand that it was one tiny incident out of 365 days, by a handful of young people out of a large group of people.\n\n\u201cCertainly if you just take the image and the picture, it\u2019s concerning. That is why the college took immediate action with those cadets. But that\u2019s not who we are as a college, and it\u2019s not what we stand for.\u201d\n\nQ: This happened right in the middle the buildup to signing day for football. How do you think it\u2019s impacted recruiting?\n\nA: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to keep young men from looking at our program. Right now, our football program is hot when you look at the trajectory of our program.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, (coach) Mike Houston went out recruiting and had to tell people, \u2018You can win at The Citadel, you\u2019ve got to trust me, because I did it at another school.\u2019 Now, he can go out and say, \u2018We win here, we win championships, we\u2019re going to compete for and win championships at The Citadel.\u2019 That\u2019s an attraction to young people.\n\n\u201cI think the type of young people we recruit, the type of character and values they have, they won\u2019t be scared off. They\u2019ll see this place for what it is.\n\n\u201cBut it does give you one more thing you have to talk about, one more thing you have to overcome.\u201d\n\nQ: Would it help the athletic department to have the school\u2019s report out as soon as possible?\n\nA: \u201cIt would, but I know the college is trying to expedite this as quickly as possible. It\u2019s obviously one of the bigger things that\u2019s happened here lately, and it does carry some negative connotation. But until the college comes out and says, \u2018Here\u2019s what we found out,\u2019 we won\u2019t have it in its proper context.\u201d\n\nInterview edited for brevity.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Citadel AD on \u2018white hoods\u2019 photo: \u2018We\u2019ll address it head on\u2019, Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Jim Senter,The Citadel", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Citadel athletic director Jim Senter spoke to a group of football recruits and their parents who were visiting the military school\u2019s campus on Saturday morning.", "title": "Citadel AD on \u2018white hoods\u2019 photo: \u2018We\u2019ll address it head on\u2019", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160116/160119379/citadel-ad-on-x2018-white-hoods-x2019-photo-x2018-we-x2019-ll-address-it-head-on-x2019", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160116/PC20/160119379/AR/0/AR-160119379.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160116/PC20/160119379/AR/0/AR-160119379.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Citadel athletic director Jim Senter spoke to a group of football recruits and their parents who were visiting the military school\u2019s campus on Saturday morning.", "title": "Citadel AD on \u2018white hoods\u2019 photo: \u2018We\u2019ll address it head on\u2019", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160116/PC20/160119379/AR/0/AR-160119379.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160119379}}, "keywords": "Citadel AD on \u2018white hoods\u2019 photo: \u2018We\u2019ll address it head on\u2019 , Sports, \r\nSportsCollege, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Jim Senter,The Citadel", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T18:37:21Z", "modified_time": "2016-01-16T18:37:00Z", "author": "Jeff Hartsell"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Citadel athletic director Jim Senter spoke to a group of football recruits and their parents who were visiting the military school\u2019s campus on Saturday morning."}, "article_summary": "A: \u201cI think that\u2019s a fair question.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201dThose photos \u2014 pictures of Citadel cadets wearing pillowcases over their heads while singing Christmas carols \u2014 garnered national publicity when they emerged on social media last month.\nCitadel athletic director Jim Senter spoke to a group of football recruits and their parents who were visiting the military school\u2019s campus on Saturday morning.\nMany believed the cadets resembled members of the Ku Klux Klan, and school president Lt.
