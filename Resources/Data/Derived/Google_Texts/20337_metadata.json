The government time and again failing utterly in just about everything it tries to do \u2013 economic recovery, job creation, health care, defense of our borders and our nation, budget stewardship,\u2026. Meanwhile, the Administration and its Democrat Party keep usurping and pushing to usurp as much of the private sector as possible \u2013 to add it all to the government\u2019s (ir)responsibility portfolio.\n\nWhich is a whiplash-inducing denial of Reality \u2013 and a recipe for continued, accelerated ruin. The private sector is where problems are solved. Government is where they are exponentially expanded \u2013 and whole new ones are created.\n\nSo as new problems arise \u2013 as they always will \u2013 let us please allow the private sector to work them out. Do NOT allow the government to \u201chelp\u201d \u2013 as the late, extraordinarily great Ronald Reagan duly noted:\n\nThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are \u201cI\u2019m from the government \u2013 and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\n\nThere is possibly a potential problem with a new cell phone/Wi-Fi technology \u2013 known as LTE-U. Without getting too thoroughly buried in the weeds, we cite Wikipedia:\n\nLTE-U would allow cellphone carriers to boost coverage in their cellular networks, by using the unlicensed 5 GHz band already populated by Wi-Fi devices. T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless have indicated early interest in deploying such a system as soon as 2016.\n\nWhile cell providers ordinarily rely on the radio spectrum to which they have exclusive licenses, LTE-U would share space with Wi-Fi equipment already inhabiting that band \u2013 smartphones, laptops and tablets connecting to home broadband networks, free hotspots provided by businesses, and so on.\n\nLTE-U is intended to let cell networks boost data speeds over short distances, without requiring the user to login to a separate Wi-Fi network as they normally would.\n\nAs indicated, some major private sector entities are working to make LTE-U a reality. Some other major private sector entities are expressing some concern.\n\nGoogle sent the Federal Communications Commission of the United States a 25-page protest\u2026.\n\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance and National Cable & Telecommunications Association (NCTA) also voiced opposition to LTE-U approval before more testing can be done, citing concerns that it would severely degrade performance of other Wi-Fi devices.\n\nThese major players can work out any issues that exist \u2013 together, without any government involvement whatsoever. And they absolutely should \u2013 because Sauron\u2019s Eye is beginning to fix upon them.\n\nICYMI: HOUSE PANEL CONVENES SECOND LTE-U MEETING \u2014 The House Energy and Commerce Committee hosted Wi-Fi advocates and wireless and cable industry representatives for a second time Thursday in an invite-only meeting to hash out their differences over LTE-U technology, which would allow wireless carriers to offload data onto unlicensed airwaves.\n\nLawmakers have generally stayed out of the fight, which pits wireless carriers looking to expand network capacity against cable and tech companies that want to keep carriers from swamping Wi-Fi networks. The groups have agreed to test technical standards to ensure wireless and Wi-Fi networks can coexist peacefully, but there\u2019s tension about who should do the testing and what it should try to prove.\n\n\u201cLawmakers have generally stayed out of the fight\u201d \u2013 music to our ears. As well they should. And as long as Congress\u2019 majority is Republican \u2013 said song stylings will hopefully continue. But Congress is by no means the biggest potential problem.\n\nBehold the Obama Administration\u2019s Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Which has zero problem unilaterally grabbing power \u2013 bereft of any Congressional authorization whatsoever \u2013 to \u201csolve\u201d all sorts of private sector \u201cproblems\u201d that don\u2019t actually exist. As but one of many, many examples, see: Network Neutrality.\n\nThe FCC does in fact have a job to do in this area. The federal government holds roughly 60% of useable wireless spectrum \u2013 much of it really high-value stuff. Only the government has little idea where it is all located.\n\nThe FCC was years ago charged with mapping it \u2013 so we could then begin selling most of it to the private sector. Shocker \u2013 the FCC hasn\u2019t yet done it. Because they have been too busy doing so many things they have no business doing. Were the FCC (and government everywhere) to do their actual jobs \u2013 many less private sector problems would arise.\n\nEvery one of these private sector entities know that they don\u2019t want the FCC \u2013 or any other part of government \u2013 declaring for themselves a role in this LTE-U evolutionary process.\n\nEvery one of the entities knows the way to preempt that \u2013 is to solve any problem that exists. As quickly and cleanly as possible. Together \u2013 and all by themselves.\n\nGovernment \u201chelp\u201d- is the absolute last thing they need.\n\n[Originally published at Red State]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/11/the-private-sector-solves-problems-government-exacerbates-and-creates-them/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ronald-Reagan-Quote-620x399.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "The Private Sector Solves Problems \u2013 Government Exacerbates and Creates Them"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Which has zero problem unilaterally grabbing power \u2013 bereft of any Congressional authorization whatsoever \u2013 to \u201csolve\u201d all sorts of private sector \u201cproblems\u201d that don\u2019t actually exist.\nSo as new problems arise \u2013 as they always will \u2013 let us please allow the private sector to work them out.\nWere the FCC (and government everywhere) to do their actual jobs \u2013 many less private sector problems would arise.\nSome other major private sector entities are expressing some concern.\nThe private sector is where problems are solved."}
