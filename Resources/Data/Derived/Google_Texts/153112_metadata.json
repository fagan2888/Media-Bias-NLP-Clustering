According to the Southern Stone County Fire Protection District, the man was injured in a fall from \"The Swing\" at the Aunts Creek campground.\n\nFirst responders and EMS used a fishing boat to reach the scene and perform CPR. A short time later, the Missouri Highway Patrol arrived by boat and the man was transported to a boat launch where an ambulance and additional emergency medical personnel were standing by. The district says efforts to revive the man were unsuccessful.\n\nThe man has been identified as former Wichita Police Officer Shane Little. Little worked out of the Patrol North bureau and was a member of the SWAT team, but in 2011, he contracted bacterial meningitis and lost most of his vision.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife Amanda, who is also a Wichita Police officern and four young children. A Facebook page dedicated to supporting Shane in his recovery says funeral services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday, May 28 at Central Christian Church in Wichita.
