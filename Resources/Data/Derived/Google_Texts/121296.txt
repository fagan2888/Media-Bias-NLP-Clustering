Starting March 1, Parkland Health and Hospital System will launch its financial assistance program, offering reduced deductibles and co-pays for insured patients who earn less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

So what does that mean: Individuals earning less than $23,540 a year or a family of four earning $48,500 a year will qualify for cheaper deductibles based on a new tiered system that separates patients by what percentage of the federal poverty guidelines their income makes up.

These patients qualify for private insurance but would like to receive certain services through the public system without drawing down on their—typically high—deductible. The Parkland Financial Assistance Program requires only a small payment at the time of service, said Bob Reed, Parkland’s Vice President of Patient Access.

“The more you make, the more your pre-payment is asked to be, and pre-payments aren’t that bad,” he said.

Payments for a standard office visit will range from free to $20. This is a supplement to private insurance plans selected through the marketplace. Patients with out-of-network plans will not qualify. Below are the services included in the financial assistance program:

Primary and preventive services

Inpatient and outpatient services provided at Parkland or at a facility contracted with Parkland

Physician services at any Parkland facility

Family planning

Laboratory and X-ray services provided at a Parkland facility or contracted facility

Pharmacy services at Parkland that are included on its formulary

Next week, D Healthcare Daily will interview Parkland CFO John Moore—look for more information about what this program means for the hospital and for the patients. In the meantime, anyone with questions about the program is welcome to attend any of the below town hall meetings:
