The provision was passed in response to concerns that medical practice may be unduly influenced by industry.\n\nThe law requires most drug and device makers to report to CMS detailed information about payments and gifts provided to U.S. doctors and teaching hospitals. The disclosures are being made in stages, but September marks the debut when payments will appear publicly.\n\nSupporters of the Sunshine Act say the transparency will provide useful information to patients about the relationships their doctors may have with drug or device makers, and serve as a deterrent to the more extreme examples of industry money unduly influencing medical care.\n\nBut some doctors and companies fear payment data will be misinterpreted by the public, or painted with a broad brush. They say there are legitimate interactions that serve to advance medicine, and that doctors should be compensated for services such as consulting for a company about the development of a new product.\n\nSome medical societies teamed up with industry groups to form Partners for Healthy Dialogues, to defend such interactions between industry and doctors, and some of its members signed the letter sent to CMS.\n\nThe medical societies and industry trade group lament what they write in the letter is a dearth of context that accompanied CMS\u2019s milestone release of Medicare Part B payments to physicians earlier this year.\n\nSome medical groups say the data did not include context to show which doctors may be abusing the system and which were receiving big payments because of high overhead costs.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe this is an effective way to share data with the public and, in fact, can lead to confusion and misinterpretation,\u201d the groups wrote, adding that \u201cwe have heard nothing\u201d about how CMS will present the data. And they want CMS to preview with doctors the proposed contextual information that will accompany the data.\n\nDrug and device makers are required to report to CMS the payments made to individual physicians broken down by different categories including fees for speaking and consulting, food, research and gifts. But the letter says CMS has not explained how data will be publicly presented in order to distinguish between payments.\n\nFor instance, Robert Harbaugh, president of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, one of the groups that signed the letter, notes that he is the recipient of a grant from a foundation affiliated with Integra Life Sciences, a device maker.\n\nThe company is funding a resident-physician exchange program between his institution, the Pennsylvania State University Milton S. Hersey Medical Center, and another in China. He fears the CMS data release will make it appear that he personally received the entire grant amount, which he estimated at about $250,000 for a five-year period.\n\n\u201cIt would be nice to be able to put some context around the dollar figures,\u201d he says, although he acknowledges that he has not viewed his own data.\n\nWe asked CMS for comment and will update you accordingly.\n\nThe medical and trade groups also asked CMS to promote awareness among physicians that the payment data will be released soon, saying many doctors remain unaware.\n\nCMS recently began letting doctors register online so they can view their payment data before it is made public, and dispute any amounts in hopes of resolving discrepancies with drug and device makers.\n\nThe groups complain the process, which runs through August 27, is cumbersome and creates the risk that doctors will not complete their registrations. After the deadline, physicians will lose the ability to easily challenge payment data, according to John Murphy, an assistant general counsel at the PhRMA trade group.\n\n[UPDATE: A CMS spokesman wrote us late in the day to say the agency does plan to make available the nature of payment for each payment or transfer of value made to a physician or teaching hospital and will also include context on the website. CMS, he adds, also has an \"extensive ongoing outreach campaign\" underway to educate and inform physicians. As an example, the agency had mobile applications designed to help physicians track payments on a free download].", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A group of medical societies and pharmaceutical industry trade groups is pushing the government to flesh out data that will be published next month showing how much drug makers pay doctors.", "title": "Docs Complain to CMS About \u2018Sunshine\u2019 Data Disclosures", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/07/28/docs-complain-to-cms-about-sunshine-data-disclosures/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-UI084_health_G_20120827115945.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "article.headline": "Docs Complain to CMS About \u2018Sunshine\u2019 Data Disclosures", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "author": "Peter Loftus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Pharmalot Blog", "page.subsection": "Pharmalot", "article.summary": "A group of medical societies and pharmaceutical industry trade groups is pushing the government to flesh out data that will be published next month showing how much drug makers pay doctors.", "description": "A group of medical societies and pharmaceutical industry trade groups is pushing the government to flesh out data that will be published next month showing how much drug makers pay doctors.", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-28T16:41:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/07/28/docs-complain-to-cms-about-sunshine-data-disclosures/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-270B-365", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A group of medical societies and pharmaceutical industry trade groups is pushing the government to flesh out data that will be published next month showing how much drug makers pay doctors.", "title": "Docs Complain to CMS About \u2018Sunshine\u2019 Data Disclosures", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/07/28/docs-complain-to-cms-about-sunshine-data-disclosures/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-UI084_health_G_20120827115945.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Pharmalot", "article.id": "BL-270B-365", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-28T21:45:58-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebe3\"", "article_summary": "The missive was sent as CMS plans to post the payment data in an online, searchable database as required in the Sunshine Act provision of the Affordable Care Act.\nHe fears the CMS data release will make it appear that he personally received the entire grant amount, which he estimated at about $250,000 for a five-year period.\nBut some doctors and companies fear payment data will be misinterpreted by the public, or painted with a broad brush.\nBut the letter says CMS has not explained how data will be publicly presented in order to distinguish between payments.\nThe medical and trade groups also asked CMS to promote awareness among physicians that the payment data will be released soon, saying many doctors remain unaware."}
