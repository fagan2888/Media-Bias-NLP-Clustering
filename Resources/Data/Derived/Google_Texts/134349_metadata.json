So what messages are being sent by US Defense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s ongoing visit to the Philippines?\n\nThe clearest is the US military intends to strengthen its presence in the South China Sea, which poses more threats to regional peace and stability.\n\nAs part of its \u201cpivot to Asia\u201d strategy, the United States has been shifting its military back to the region. Carter\u2019s trip reveals the US has put that process back on a fast track, with the expectation it will establish more bases in the Philippines.\n\nWashington and Manila are also considering joint \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d operations, as the US Navy calls them, sailing through the 12-nautical-mile territorial waters around Chinese islands without gaining permission.\n\nAnd emboldened by US military backing and funding, Manila is more aggressively provoking China.\n\nIt was no coincidence that a few days before Carter\u2019s visit, the Philippines resumed construction work to upgrade a military airport on one of the islands it seized from China in the 1970s.\n\nThese messages from Carter\u2019s visit have reinforced the belief in China that an encirclement of alliances is taking shape in a bid to contain China.\n\nAs well as putting pressure on China to the south, with enhanced military cooperation with the Philippines, the US has done the same to the east.\n\nIt has reassured Japan of its support in the event of any conflict over disputed islands in the East China Sea.\n\nIf the US continues to focus on military dominance in its rebalancing strategy, it is risking the peace and the security of the region for its own interests.\n\nOnline: http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/\n\n____\n\nApril 19\n\nThe New York Times on statements Republicans have made about health care:\n\n\u201cDisaster.\u201d \u201dIncredible economic burden.\u201d \u201dThe biggest job-killer in this country.\u201d\n\nCentral to the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz has been the claim that the Affordable Care Act has been a complete failure, and that the only way to save the country from this scourge is to replace it with something they design.\n\nIt\u2019s worth examining the big myths they are peddling about the Affordable Care Act and also their ill-conceived plans of what might replace it.\n\nMillions of people have lost their insurance: In January, Mr. Cruz claimed that \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d had lost their health insurance because of the health reform law. He even claimed to be one of them, saying \u201cour health care got canceled\u201d because Blue Cross Blue Shield left the individual market in Texas.\n\nInsurers did stop offering some plans after the law took effect, including those that didn\u2019t provide required benefits like maternity care or that charged higher premiums to older or sicker people. But people with those plans had the opportunity to sign up for others. And over all, the law has drastically reduced the number of Americans who lack health insurance. According to the Census Bureau, the number of uninsured Americans dropped by 10 million between 2010, when the law passed, and 2014. While critics said employers might stop offering health insurance because of the law, three million people actually gained coverage through their employers between 2010 and 2014.\n\nIncidentally, Mr. Cruz never lost his health insurance. Blue Cross Blue Shield did cancel his particular plan, but it automatically moved him and his family to a new one. A Cruz spokeswoman said the senator had been misinformed by his insurance broker.\n\nMillions of people have lost their jobs: Mr. Cruz has called the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe biggest job-killer in this country\u201d and said \u201cmillions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work\u201d because of it. This is false. The unemployment rate has fallen since the law took effect, PolitiFact notes, as has the number of people working part time when they would rather work full time. A 2015 study using data from the Current Population Survey found that the law \u201chad virtually no adverse effect on labor force participation, employment or usual hours worked per week through 2014.\u201d\n\nReduce costs by weakening state regulations: Mr. Trump frequently talks about his plan to \u201cget rid of the lines around the states\u201d to foster competition among insurance companies. Customers in states where insurance is heavily regulated, the thinking goes, would be able to save money if they could purchase coverage from insurers based in states with fewer rules. Mr. Cruz, too, supports allowing people to buy insurance across state borders \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few proposals he\u2019s offered for replacing the health law if it is repealed.\n\nBut the biggest obstacle stopping insurers from setting up in more states is not regulation; it\u2019s the difficulty of establishing a network of providers in a new market. And such a structure would destroy the longstanding ability of states to regulate health insurance for their populations. Some states, for instance, require coverage for infertility treatment and others have chosen not to. Allowing cross-border plans would encourage insurers to base themselves in low-regulation states, and the result might be a proliferation of poor-quality plans.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Premiums for plans on the exchanges rose between 2015 and 2016 and are likely to rise again next year. A few insurers have left the exchange market, raising concerns in some quarters that more companies might follow.\n\nBut the law has helped millions of Americans, especially low-wage workers like cashiers, cooks and waiters who previously struggled to pay for coverage. In inventing problems that don\u2019t exist and proposing solutions that won\u2019t help, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz show that they don\u2019t care about helping Americans get health care, which has never been their interest. They want to trash the Affordable Care Act, and they\u2019re willing to mislead the public any way they can.\n\nOnline: http://www.nytimes.com/\n\n____\n\nApril 9\n\nThe Los Angeles Times on why some voters might be left out of California\u2019s presidential primaries:\n\nThis year, it seems, California\u2019s presidential primaries may finally matter. But many voters could lose their opportunity to participate if they don\u2019t act soon. That\u2019s because the June 7 primaries are not open races, in which voters may simply show up and choose among all the possible candidates. Rather, these are party nominating contests, and it is the parties themselves that set the rules about who can participate. Only registered Republicans may cast ballots for Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or John Kasich. The Democratic Party restricts its primary between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to registered Democrats and to voters listed as \u201cno party preference.\u201d\n\nWith so much interest in this year\u2019s primary, elections officials are concerned that many Californians won\u2019t be able to participate in the presidential primary of their choice because they don\u2019t know the rules, don\u2019t know their party status or have registered for the wrong party. A Times survey recently found, for instance, that three out of four people who had signed up as American Independents didn\u2019t realize they had registered for a real, right-wing political party. Many thought they were simply signing up as lower-case \u201ci\u201d independents (the unaffiliated voters California classifies as \u201cno party preference\u201d voters or, as they were formerly called, \u201cdecline to state\u201d voters).\n\nIntentional or not, American Independents will be given an AIP ballot on June 7 with a list of candidates most have never heard of, and they\u2019ll be barred from voting in the Democratic or Republican presidential primaries. And that at a time when California leaders have adopted laws designed to boost turnout and participation. Secretary of State Alex Padilla ought to revisit the voter registration form to eliminate that confusing element and any others that people encounter when they sign up to vote.\n\nCalifornia is one of many states where parties have chosen to hold so-called closed primaries. Such rules may be frustrating to unaffiliated voters and anti-establishment candidates. (Trump\u2019s children, for example, missed New York\u2019s deadline to change their party affiliation and won\u2019t be able to vote for their dad in the GOP primary.) But the primaries are held for the benefit of political parties and their members so they can choose the best possible nominee for general election. The parties set the rules. It\u2019s up to the candidates to follow them, voters to understand them and elections officials to implement them as efficiently as possible.\n\nCalifornia has made it fairly easy. (registertovote.ca.gov) There is still time for voters to check their registration and, if they want to, change it to participate in their primary of choice. The deadline is May 23 \u2014 two weeks before election day.\n\nOnline: http://www.latimes.com/\n\n____\n\nApril 19\n\nThe Washington Post on the Catholic Church and child sex abuse:\n\nIN THREE years at the helm of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis has been a source of inspiration for millions of faithful around the world. In one critical respect, however, he has fallen short of his own promise: to come fully to terms with decades of child sex abuse by clergymen and the institutional cover granted to them by bishops and cardinals.\n\nFrancis has pledged \u201cthe zealous vigilance of the Church to protect children and the promise of accountability for all.\u201d Yet there has been scant accountability, particularly for bishops. Too often, the church\u2019s stance has been defiance and obstruction.\n\nIn his trip to the United States in the fall, Francis told victims that \u201cwords cannot fully express my sorrow for the abuse you suffered.\u201d Yet his initiative to establish a Vatican tribunal to judge bishops who enabled or ignored pedophile priests has come to naught. Not a single bishop has been called to account by the tribunal, which itself remains more notional than real.\n\nMeanwhile, church officials have fought bills in state legislatures across the United States that would allow thousands of abuse victims to seek justice in court. The legislation would loosen deadlines limiting when survivors can bring lawsuits against abusers or their superiors who turned a blind eye. Many victims, emotionally damaged by the abuse they have suffered, do not speak until years after they were victimized; by then, in many states, it is too late for them to force priests and other abusers to account in court.\n\nEight states have lifted such deadlines, known as statutes of limitations, for victims who are sexually abused as minors. Seven states have gone further, enacting measures allowing past victims \u2014 not just current and future ones \u2014 to file lawsuits in a finite period of time, generally a two- or three-year window.\n\nIn many more states, however, the bishops and their staffs have successfully killed such bills, arguing that it would be unfair to subject the church to lawsuits in which memories and evidence are degraded by the passage of time. Quietly, they also say the church, which has suffered an estimated $3 billion hit in settlements and other costs related to clergy sex abuse scandals nationwide, can ill afford further financial exposure.\n\nA typical case is Maryland, where bills to extend the statute of limitations until the alleged victim turns 38 have failed even to come to a vote, owing to opposition from House of Delegates Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph F. Vallario Jr. (D-Prince George\u2019s) and the Catholic Church, among others.\n\nIn his trip to the United States, Pope Francis praised bishops for what he called their \u201cgenerous commitment to bring healing to victims\u201d and he expressed sympathy for \u201chow much the pain of recent years has weighed upon you.\u201d Yet by its actions, the church\u2019s \u201ccommitment to bring healing\u201d has seemed far from generous. And it seemed perverse to address the bishops\u2019 \u201cpain\u201d when the real suffering has been borne by children.\n\nOnline: https://www.washingtonpost.com/\n\n____\n\nApril 20\n\nThe Boston Herald on President Obama\u2019s actions on immigration reform:\n\nFrustrated by his inability to get an immigration reform bill through Congress, President Obama decided to rewrite the law himself.\n\nSo in November of 2014, just after the House killed a Senate-passed immigration bill, the president signed an executive order giving some 4.9 million illegal immigrants \u2014 many of them the parents of U.S. citizens or legal residents \u2014 what amounts to a grant of immunity. Or as the White House Solicitor General Donald Verrilli defined it to the U.S. Supreme Court in argument this week, they were given a grant of \u201clawful presence.\u201d\n\nThat allowed them not merely to avoid deportation but to work and to collect an array of benefits. And that\u2019s where Texas and eventually 25 other states said just wait a darned minute and sued the federal government for a vast overreach.\n\nThe issue here is less about a broken immigration system \u2014 which we agree desperately needs fixing and a path to legal residence for the estimated 11 million immigrants who are here illegally \u2014 than it is about an abuse of presidential power. And it was that issue that the court\u2019s more conservative members pursued during Monday\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is defining the limits of discretion,\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy said. \u201cAnd it seems to me that that is a legislative, not an executive act.\u201d\n\nChief Justice John Roberts asked if the president could grant \u201cdeferred removal to every unlawfully present alien in the U.S. right now.\u201d At least Verrilli cited statutory restraints on the president there. But then he\u2019s already defied some of those \u201crestraints.\u201d\n\nA 4-4 decision would allow a lower court ruling against the president to stand and halt this particular assault on the Constitution. But it surely shows how critical the next election, however loony it seems now, has become.\n\nOnline: http://www.bostonherald.com/\n\n____\n\nApril 19\n\nThe Miami Herald on the Cuban revolution:\n\nThe cadaverous image presented by Fidel Castro on the closing day of the Communist Party Congress in Havana mirrors the decrepit state of the Cuban government, as well as its increasingly bleak future. Like Marxist ideology, the 89-year-old Castro looked like an utterly spent force as he gazed forlornly into the audience of party members and offered what may prove to be his valedictory to the party.\n\nCastro, in a rare public appearance, was forced to acknowledge on Tuesday that his end is near. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll be like all the others,\u201d he conceded. \u201cThe time comes for us all.\u201d\n\nThe difference, regrettably, is that Castro knows that his days are numbered, but neither he nor the party\u2019s leadership seems to understand \u2014 or is willing to admit \u2014 that the revolution long ago lost its vitality. It is the relic of a bygone era that cannot be reinvigorated or revived.\n\nThe party congress came as a huge disappointment to Cubans who hoped it would offer a glimpse of a better political future. The meeting failed to resolve key issues and closed the door on generational change.\n\nWhile Fidel pleaded with party members to allow the revolution to survive even as he fades into oblivion, his 84-year-old brother, Ra\u00fal, gave himself one more five-year term as the Communist Party\u2019s first secretary, and allowed feared hardliner Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura, 85, to remain second in command.\n\nThe decision means Ra\u00fal Castro can hold onto the position of party chairman, the pinnacle of power in the communist system, well past the date of his announced retirement as Cuba\u2019s president in 2018.\n\nAll the while, he\u2019ll have by his side an even older henchman known as the enforcer of party discipline and as an implacable foe of economic reform. Even Ra\u00fal himself has criticized Machado Ventura for orthodox rigidity, but that apparently is no barrier to power.\n\nDon\u2019t look for fresh faces or younger people associated with free-market reforms \u2014 which Ra\u00fal Castro himself has blessed \u2014 among the five new members named to the powerful Politburo, either. There aren\u2019t any.\n\nAll of this amounts to a huge failure by Ra\u00fal Castro.\n\nHe initiated economic reforms a few years ago not because he\u2019s a reformer, but because he\u2019s a survivor. He did it because he had to, knowing Cuba was obliged to undertake changes or face increasing unrest from the Cuban people.\n\nThose reforms, gradual and incremental as they are, have been sufficient to keep the lid on, but Castro is fooling himself if he thinks that\u2019s enough for now.\n\nChange generates its own momentum, whether or not he likes it. Cuba\u2019s president had the choice of extending reforms into the political realm, despite resistance from Machado Ventura and those who think like him, or face demands for change from the Cuban people. In the end, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it.\n\nWhether it was a failure of nerve or a failure of vision matters little: The message from this party congress is that the octogenarians leading Cuba are determined to hold onto power for as long as they can, unyielding until the bitter end. They are foreclosing the possibility of gradual political change regardless of the consequences.\n\nOutside the halls of the party meeting, times are changing in Cuba. So are the expectations of its people. But the leadership seems blissfully in denial. Perhaps they should take a second look at the image of Fidel Castro.\n\nEven he acknowledged that he has one foot in the grave. So does the failed revolution he led for more than six decades.\n\nOnline: http://www.miamiherald.com/", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/themes/wtop/assets/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "WTOP", "description": "Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad: ____ April 15 China Daily on U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s visit to the Philippines: Overseas trips by politicians and military leaders are all about\u2026", "title": "Editorial Roundup: Excerpts from recent editorials", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WTOP-Twitter-Main-B-v2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-20T17:35:20+00:00", "url": "http://wtop.com/elections/2016/04/editorial-roundup-excerpts-from-recent-editorials-63/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "WTOP", "description": "Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad: ____ April 15 China Daily on U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter\u2019s visit to the Philippines: Overseas trips by politicians and military leaders are all about\u2026", "image": {"src": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WTOP-Twitter-Main-B-v2.jpg"}, "card": "summary", "title": "Editorial Roundup: Excerpts from recent editorials - WTOP"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "wp-admin-url": "http://wtop.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=8097956&action=edit", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "sailthru.canonical": "http://wtop.com/elections/2016/04/editorial-roundup-excerpts-from-recent-editorials-63/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/themes/wtop/assets/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "sailthru.image.full": "http://wtop.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "2016 Election News,2016 Presidential Election News,Congress News,Government News,Money News,News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-04-20T17:33:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T17:35:20+00:00"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-04-20 05:33:52", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd71d5\"", "article_summary": "He even claimed to be one of them, saying \u201cour health care got canceled\u201d because Blue Cross Blue Shield left the individual market in Texas.\nAnd such a structure would destroy the longstanding ability of states to regulate health insurance for their populations.\nAnd over all, the law has drastically reduced the number of Americans who lack health insurance.\nWhile critics said employers might stop offering health insurance because of the law, three million people actually gained coverage through their employers between 2010 and 2014.\nMillions of people have lost their insurance: In January, Mr. Cruz claimed that \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d had lost their health insurance because of the health reform law."}
