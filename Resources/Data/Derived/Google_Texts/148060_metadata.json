She claims damages for sexual harassment, discrimination and defamation and also details the story of her contributions to the company\u2019s founding.\n\nThe allegations she levels at her former coworkers tell a larger story, though, about how tech start-ups try to spin their stories of how an idea is generated and successfully brought to life.\n\nThe coveted founding story starts with a college (or high school) dropout who noodles on his computer and creates a world-changing innovation. (An engineer from M.I.T. or Harvard is a close second.)\n\nOnce the start-up is established, product control is prized to maximize flexibility; the preferred means of growth are \u201cboot-strapping\u201d (financing the company through personal means or the company\u2019s early revenue) or a successful Series A round of fund-raising from venture capitalists leading to an I.P.O. (Selling your start-up to a wealthy, powerful company like Google, Apple or Facebook may leave the idea intact and the founders flush, but autonomy will be lost, and the founders will be left riding the bus to work.)\n\nTinder didn\u2019t strictly follow this narrative: The app was born under the aegis of an incubator at IAC, an Internet company. After Ms. Wolfe filed her lawsuit, Nick Summers, who wrote a profile of Tinder for Bloomberg Businessweek in 2013, revisited the subject to reveal how the company had tried to hide certain aspects of its history.\n\nIn his initial reporting on Tinder, Mr. Summers found that Sean Rad, the chief executive, and Justin Mateen, the chief marketing officer, were reluctant to admit IAC\u2019s role. \u201cTinder would check all the boxes of the classic rocketing digital start-up success \u2014 college dropout founder, colorful offices, young users, and a geometric growth curve \u2014 if it weren\u2019t for one minor detail: It\u2019s not actually a start-up. Tinder will never have a splashy initial public offering or the thrill of announcing a billion-dollar acquisition by a large corporation, because it\u2019s already owned by a large corporation.\u201d\n\nMr. Rad and Mr. Mateen \u201cwere keen to hide this arrangement,\u201d Mr. Summers wrote, \u201cand pretend that they were living the dream of being wined and dined by Silicon Valley moneymen.\u201d\n\nMr. Summers\u2019s account of a manipulated founding story didn\u2019t strike readers as unusual \u2014 and may point to another underlying reason why Ms. Wolfe\u2019s early contributions have since been obscured.\n\nJust about every major LA tech co rewrites their origin story. It is a town of storytellers after all http://t.co/xSHpuPek39\n\n\u2014 Sean Percival (@Percival) 3 Jul 14\n\nCommenters discussing the Tinder lawsuit on Hacker News wrote, \u201cIf you don\u2019t create this false narrative (and let\u2019s be clear, 90% of the startup narratives you hear are altered to make the story more attractive\u2026), people won\u2019t pay attention.\u201d Someone else posted that a successful start-up born out of an incubator that is funded by a multibillion-dollar company \u201cis far less compelling for everyone than \u2018we had this idea for this app and it spread like wildfire and now the VCs are coming knocking at our door.\u2019\u201d\n\nMedia coverage of the tech industry often offers factors that are most likely to create a successful business. Last November, TechCrunch studied the top 39 \u201cunicorn companies,\u201d businesses that have made more than $1 billion. The article breaks down attributes of each company to identify indicators of success.\n\nOf the companies considered, 90 percent of factors were shared. These included \u201centerprise founder/CEOs with technical degrees; companies with 2+ co-founders who worked or went to school together; companies whose founders had prior tech startup experience; and whose founders were in their 30s or older.\u201d Mr. Mateen and Mr. Rad may have taken note that successful companies had three or fewer founders; none had greater than six.\n\nShanley Kane, a \u201ccultural critic\u201d of Silicon Valley, argues that these heroic stories conceal social realities and perpetuate the inequality of the industry. In an interview with Fast Company Labs, she argues that this narrative conceals the privilege of the dropout coder. Many of these dropouts, she argues, must have had money behind them and access to computers from a young age in order to become a successful entrepreneur. \u201cThe high school dropout story is always the story of a white guy. You never hear about women who drop out of high school and go on to found companies.\u201d\n\nMs. Kane points out that most individuals leading start-ups tend to be single, white men without the obligations of family weighing on them. \u201cThere are a lot of people who can\u2019t take advantage of those opportunities: People who don\u2019t have parents subsidizing their living, people who have school debt, people who have families, who need to be able to support other people whether those are parents or children or a partner. It\u2019s this fairly narrow class of person which has a certain level of economic stability that is able to take a risk like that.\u201d\n\nThe tech industry has been criticized for its embrace of \u201cculture fit.\u201d Companies hire based on a candidate\u2019s ability to mesh with the culture of the organization as it already exists, but given the overrepresentation of men in the industry, that often means women and people of color are disproportionately affected by \u201cculture fit.\u201d Ms. Wolfe\u2019s gender, in the prevailing narrative of start-up success, was another strike against her.\n\nMs. Kane says of culture fit: \u201cOn the surface level it tends to mean \u2018We just don\u2019t like you. You\u2019re different from us. We don\u2019t want to figure out how to work with you.\u2019\u201d When the standard of proof for hiring or firing someone only has to be \u201cculture fit,\u201d it\u2019s easy to see how discrimination can quickly become a problem and how start-up culture can become fairly homogenous. Ms. Wolfe claims that when Mr. Mateen was harassing her, she went to Mr. Rad for help. His response was that she was being \u201cannoying\u201d and \u201cdramatic,\u201d as documented in her lawsuit: \u201cMr. Rad also told her if she was unable to \u2018disengage\u2019 it would be her fault, not Mr. Mateen\u2019s.\u201d\n\nSexism in Silicon Valley \u2014 not to mention its diversity problem \u2014 is well documented. But how will people who have remained outliers in the industry be written into the narratives of success?\n\nI am 100% sure that in January, the Tinder CEO told me they had a female co-founder. http://t.co/02EDbLinr5 \u2014 Tess Rinearson (@_tessr) 3 Jul 14\n\nRevisiting his Tinder story, Mr. Summers concludes, \u201cStart-ups fail and succeed because of the real actions of their workers, not because of an agreed-upon myth created after the fact.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140709115211, "twitter": {"description": "Whitney Wolfe\u2019s lawsuit against Tinder tells a different story of how the company was founded.
