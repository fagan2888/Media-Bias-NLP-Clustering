But they are expected to become a model that winners and losers in the fight believe will be replicated elsewhere.\n\nThe credit \u2014 or blame \u2014 for the newfound urgency can be traced in part to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. A variety of workplace wellness programs and preventive health-care initiatives called for in the law could soon translate into rivers of billable hours for those with credentials to keep American waistlines in check.\n\nAnd that means the race is on to be eligible for those credentials, which could eventually lead to the ability to bill insurance companies for services, much like such professionals as dieticians and physical therapists. With billions of dollars potentially at stake, lawyers and lobbyists are engaged in a no-holds-barred fight to shape the nation\u2019s first-ever rules over who has the right to tell someone else how to exercise.\n\nThe problem for personal trainers is that no standards currently exist. Instead, dozens of competing descriptions have been written by gym owners, for-profit training companies and self-proclaimed fitness experts. There are even competing organizations that certify competing tests.\n\nCrossfit Inc. founder and CEO Greg Glassman, right, talks to employees before a presentation at the Half Street location in Washington. CrossFit is waging a war against new D.C. city rules to regulate personal trainers. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nGrappling with all of that, an obscure group of D.C. regulators \u2014 the Board of Physical Therapy \u2014 is preparing to release rules that could send a shock wave through the American fitness industry. Fearing the outcome, some of the loudest voices in the field have decided to go on the offensive. They are calling the process into question and urging city lawmakers to pull back or even halt the effort with threats of drawn-out legal battles.\n\nSome exercise specialists who work most closely with medical groups say the D.C. physical therapy board has an inherent conflict of interest and is trying to restrict professionals with whom their own industry is in direct competition. They point to draft language that could be construed as cutting out personal trainers from potentially billable future work.\n\nAnd it gets worse, says CrossFit, which offers a brand of high-intensity workouts and asserts that it is the nation\u2019s largest chain of fitness facilities. The District, according to the company, has allowed itself to become a pawn in a bitter industry fight over which personal trainer certification will have the muscle of the law behind it. That could enrich some for-profit organizations and cost others dearly. CrossFit, an industry rebel with millions of devotees as well as critics who say its program leads to injury, says it could be hurt the most.\n\nThe tab for revamping CrossFit\u2019s training courses could run into the tens of millions of dollars if the company is forced to do so nationwide, says its chief executive.\n\nFor consumers in the District \u2014 and eventually Massachusetts and other states where registration or licensure is under debate \u2014 regulations could cause some gyms to close while owners and trainers obtain suitable certifications. Such state registries or licenses could also pervade preventive health-care programs. If an employer can get more credit for offering a certified lunchtime pilates program than for a calisthenics routine run by a rogue instructor from CrossFit, it could shape offerings that may suit the fitness needs of some consumers more than others.\n\n\u201cThis will affect everyone because \u2018fitness\u2019 is a nebulous term. That\u2019s why we have so many pathways to achieve it . . . we all respond differently to exercise and we all have different factors in our lives that come into play in trying to attain it,\u201d said Phillip Godfrey, a medical exercise specialist in the District who has tracked the D.C. law for months and has become convinced the final product will be problematic for his livelihood.\n\n\u201cThe term \u2018personal fitness trainer\u2019 is not true for everyone in the industry,\u201d Godfrey continued. \u201cThat\u2019s a known title, but there are kinesiologists, corrective specialists . . . literally hundreds of titles and sub-specialties. Setting one pathway, one test, one methodology to train individuals \u2014 that can be problematic. It may work for some and not others.\u201d\n\nDistrict Crossfit owner and trainer Andrew Killion is seen in a personal training session with Dominique Evans at a gym on Half Street SW. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post)\n\nGodfrey and others said that if the District wants to regulate the personal fitness industry, it should set up a board of personal trainers and academic experts rather than assigning the task to physical therapists.\n\nNew rules coming next month\n\nSuch concerns do not appear to be dissuading D.C. regulators.\n\nUnder a bill passed unanimously last year by the D.C. Council and signed into law by the mayor, the District\u2019s Board of Physical Therapy was tasked with writing the new regulations. The board plans to release its rules next month, seek public comment and then publish them as law. And the heat is on: The District is behind in the process ordered in the legislation. By a strict reading of the law, no personal trainer is operating legally in the nation\u2019s capital because the deadline to register has passed.\n\nThe uncertainty over the coming rules is weighing heavily on many who make their living in the industry, especially through CrossFit, which has thrived in a heretofore unregulated space.\n\nWith a single weekend course, would-be CrossFit instructors can become certified by the company to open a gym, also known as a \u201cbox.\u201d\n\nUsing that model, CrossFit has more than 13,000 affiliate facilities, with, reportedly, one opening somewhere in the world every two hours.\n\nThe largest concentration of CrossFit facilities is in the Washington area, which the American College of Sports Medicine recently dubbed America\u2019s fittest city.\n\nAndrew Killion, a former collegiate boxer at Cornell and a rower at Gonzaga College High School, found an unexpected career with Crossfit \u2014 and is sweating out the District\u2019s impending regulations.\n\nKillion was a paralegal quickly growing disillusioned with a prospective career in law when he opened a CrossFit in the District in 2010. He has since moved twice into bigger spaces. He has nearly 400 members and a hall of fame of three clients who have lost more than 100 pounds each.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Killion paced the sprawling floor of his CrossFit gym near Nationals Park, correcting members\u2019 spinal posture during dead lifts. There\u2019s no difference between safety and performance, he said; the correct form will provide both.\n\n\u201cIf there is a board declaring what is good, what is bad, who is right and who is wrong, they are effectively assigning what you are liable for and what you\u2019re not liable for from an insurance standpoint . . . and my rates could go through the roof,\u201d Killion said. \u201cBut what is in the realm of good training and what is not is very much up for debate.\u201d\n\nOne early proposal that the D.C. board discussed but appears to have moved away from would have required personal trainers to have as much as a four-year degree. Killion said that if such a rule were adopted, he almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have abandoned a career in law.\n\n\u201cI would have never been able to start my business, and we wouldn\u2019t have people who have lost 100 pounds if that were the case,\u201d he said.\n\nCrossFit and its rivals\n\nLayered into the D.C. regulatory fight is a battle between CrossFit and a consortium of established sports medicine organizations that have banded together under the title of the Coalition for Registration of Exercise Professionals.\n\nThe coalition has created a national registry of personal trainers to list and verify credentials. It has attracted at least 150,000 trainers \u2014 more than half of all those thought to use the title nationwide.\n\nGraham Melstrand, president of the board, has been among the few voicing strong support for the District\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the purpose of the law is to enhance consumer protection for the residents of the District of Columbia,\u201d he said. Melstrand said industry estimates show 40 percent of all trainers have no gym affiliation, meaning they are accountable to no one even though they are often in positions of authority with clients.\n\nThat was part of the rationale that Senora Simpson, chairwoman of the D.C. board and a physical therapist, cited in pushing for her board to have the power to regulate personal trainers.\n\n\u201cWe all have heard anecdotal reports of injuries, sexual misconduct and misrepresentation of titles by persons claiming to be competent in that area,\u201d Simpson testified before a D.C. Council committee. She called the lack of any registration or licensure of personal trainers \u201ca nationwide failure.\u201d\n\nFor CrossFit and the coalition, a primary question is which credentialing the board will recognize. The two use different organizations to certify their trainee programs.\n\nGreg Glassman, CrossFit\u2019s chief executive, bristles at that measurement, saying his organization has been validated in other important ways. CrossFit programs have been adopted as in-house workout routines by several military Special Operations forces and police departments, he said.\n\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with public safety or public health,\u201d Glassman said of the District\u2019s proposed regulations during a recent trip to lobby city officials not to impede his company.\n\nCrossFit has homed in on statements by Simpson that the board began consulting with members of the coalition about proposed standards more than five years ago. He cast the legislation as a \u201cHail Mary pass\u201d by those organizations to prevent the loss of customers to CrossFit.\n\nAfter a meeting between Glassman and a deputy mayor for health, a spokesman for Mayor Muriel E. Bowser, Michael Czin, said in an e-mail statement that the administration is \u201ccommitted to developing thoughtful regulations that protect residents\u2019 safety and health while creating an environment where businesses thrive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with all stakeholders to develop the rules.\u201d\n\nMelstrand said the issue is bigger than concerns about CrossFit. It\u2019s about finding ways for the profession of personal trainers to mature into more respected health-care roles.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, all of the fitness organizations are looking for the respect of practitioners,\u201d he said. \u201cAs our space is maturing, there have to be greater expectations around the people who are practicing our craft.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "America\u2019s first attempt to regulate them is expected to ripple across the entire industry.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "America\u2019s first attempt to regulate them is expected to ripple across the entire industry.", "title": "In the nation\u2019s capital, a new business to regulate: D.C.\u2019s personal trainers", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/in-the-nations-capital-a-new-business-to-regulate-dcs-personal-trainers/2015/08/23/f86bb0b8-3a1b-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/08/02/Others/Images/2015-08-02/crossfit3251438522272.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@byaaroncdavis"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "crossfit, crep, personal trainers, personal trainer certification, american college of sports medicine, physical therapy vs personal trainer, greg glassman", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/byaaroncdavis"}, "eomportal-uuid": "f86bb0b8-3a1b-11e5-8e98-115a3cf7d7ae", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "crossfit, crep, personal trainers, personal trainer certification, american college of sports medicine, physical therapy vs personal trainer, greg glassman"}, "article_summary": "The new regulations, being written by and for the nation\u2019s capital city, will create a registry of all personal trainers in the District only.\nThey point to draft language that could be construed as cutting out personal trainers from potentially billable future work.\nIt\u2019s about finding ways for the profession of personal trainers to mature into more respected health-care roles.\nCrossFit is waging a war against new D.C. city rules to regulate personal trainers.\nThe problem for personal trainers is that no standards currently exist."}
