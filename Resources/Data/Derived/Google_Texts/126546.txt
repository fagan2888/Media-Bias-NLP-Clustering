A high speed chase Friday night near Highway 495 on Center Hill led to an arrest.

Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun says a Lauderdale County Sheriffâ€™s deputy attempted to pull over Dustin Spears for a traffic violation when Spears took off. The deputy spiked the tires of the vehicle after chasing spears for 25 minutes. Spears then ran from the vehicle into a wooded area where he was apprehended and charged with felony fleeing along with other misdemeanors.

"I would encourage individuals that when officers attempt to stop your vehicle, when they initiate that simply pull over to the side of the road. You don't want to compound any of the problems you currently have by making a new charge which is a felony charge when it could have simply been a misdemeanor traffic offenses," Calhoun says.

Spears' has 11 charges with a total bond of $13,628.
