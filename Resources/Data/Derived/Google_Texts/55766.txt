A football player at Minot State University took his aggression off the field, and now faces attempted murder charges.

According to The Associated Press, Jesse Ili is a 6-foot, 220-pound linebacker for the Minot State Beavers in North Dakota. Ili and four other Minot football players were approached by police officers on suspicion of smoking marijuana inside of a car. Ili then tried to flee the scene on foot, much to no avail.

When the officers caught up to the player, Ili became violent and a fight ensued. According to one of the police officers involved with the case, Ili managed to knock one of the officer’s unconscious and caused minor injuries to another before police apprehended him. Ili now faces an attempted murder charge.

“They got him but that is where the fight ensued,” Capt. John Klug told The Associated Press.

Both of the officers who were injured during the arrest are now doing fine and recovering at home, according to Klug. Klug also said that the attempted murder charge was selected after discussing the case with the state’s attorney.

The four other Minot State football players who were also present at the scene were all given misdemeanor drug charges for marijuana usage. Minot State has suspended all of the players involved in the incident, and have removed Ili from the team roster on their website.
