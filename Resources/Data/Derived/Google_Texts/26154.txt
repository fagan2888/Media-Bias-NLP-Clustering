Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffordsmet with people affected by gun violence to talk about their lives since joining the club that no one chooses.

The Denver roundtable that also included family members of Aurora theater shooting victims and Columbine High School victims was a campaign endorsement for Hillary Clinton’s presidential run.

Giffords, who was shot in the head during a Tucson event that left six dead and 13 injured, stumped for Hillary while her husband, Capt. Mark Kelly, reiterated the importance of enacting and strengthening gun laws.

“Gabby and I are both gun owners,” Kelly said. “We aren’t interested in anyone’s guns being taken away. We just want common-sense gun legislation.”

Gun violence survivors and those who have lost family members all embraced before the discussion, meeting once again to share tragic stories.

Dave Hoover lost his nephew A.J. Boikin the Aurora theater shooting.

“I wish I had never met any of these people,” Hoover said, pointing to others around the room who lost loved ones.

Hoover praised gun reforms already made in Colorado and said national strides on the issue were necessary.

“Not one person has lost their Second Amendment rights here, but think of all the tragedies we’ve prevented,” he said.

Kelly thought many people who oppose common-sense gun legislation are bogged down by myths and misconceptions.

“Education is important,” he said. “People should really understand what they’re fighting for.”

Megan Sullivan-Jenks, sister of Aurora theater shooting victim Alex Sullivan, held back tears as she spoke about how she felt like her life ended when her brother was killed.

“It’s something we can change,” she said. “It’s something we have to change. There can’t be more of me.”

Roundtable participants said they believe Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who would address gun violence in her presidency.
