Q. There has been a lot of publicity about the federal health insurance exchange not working but almost nothing said about the Massachusetts Health Connector. I have had a policy through the Connector since 2011. It worked great. Now I have received notice that I have to sign up again. My old login no longer works. Setting up a new one doesnâ€™t work properly. Going to the call center is torture. No one answers and the same message on hold plays over and over again, telling people to go on line while the online site tells people to call the help line. Worst of all, it looks like my policy is discontinued. Calling my insurer, Iâ€™m told it was a Health Connector decision and they can do nothing about it. Why is a process which worked so well before now completely broken?

A. Thereâ€™s no doubt the health insurance exchanges are messed up and the previously functional one in Massachusetts has tanked as it tries to adapt to new federal requirements. The folks at the Connector seem eager to please and are helping on your case, but acknowledge theyâ€™ve got some problems.

â€œThis is a very large and very complex system, and anytime you are creating something of this scope bugs are expected,â€� Connector spokesman Jason Lefferts said. â€œWe have had issues with the website and we are frustrated when those issues impact user experience. We are constantly monitoring the site and when specific issues are found we work on finding a solution and making a fix.â€�

The system is taken down a few times a week late at night â€“ so it will not be working at all when you try then. Itâ€™s pretty clear that federally mandated changes have complicated the situation. For example, the new federal law means you can get dental insurance through the Connector. But you wonâ€™t find the details online. Youâ€™ll have to call, Lefferts said.

Itâ€™s unfortunate that something as beneficial as ensuring that everyone can get health coverage has taken a big step back before being able to step forward. Lefferts said he expects things to improve. â€œWe anticipate new functionality will be added in the coming weeks and months,â€� he said.
