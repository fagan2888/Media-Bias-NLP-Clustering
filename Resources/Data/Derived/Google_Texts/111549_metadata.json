It found that women who have plastic surgery are perceived by others to have better social skills and are even more trustworthy.\n\nThe research compared people\u2019s perceptions of women who had face lifts, upper and lower eye lifts, brow lifts, neck lifts, and chin implants.\n\nFor Professor Reilly, the results are more than a little bit interesting.\n\n\u201cOur animal instinct tells us to avoid those who are ill-willed and we know from previous research that personality traits are drawn from an individual\u2019s neutral expressions.\u201d\n\nAnother study, which was not related to plastic surgery, found that people look at the eyes when judging attractiveness and trustworthiness, which could be why these procedures yielded the most positive results.\n\nReilly added, \u2018This may explain why the patients who had a lower eyelift were found to be significantly more attractive and feminine, and experienced improved trustworthiness scores.\u201d\n\nWhile there were no clear statistics to lead to a conclusion about the way people perceive faces, pre- and post-surgery, Reilly noted, \u201cSome might say that is negative, but others may want that look. The comprehensive evaluation and treatment of the facial rejuvenation patient requires an understanding of the changes in a person\u2019s perceived aura that are likely to occur with surgery beyond just the traditional measures of age and attractiveness.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Reilly suggested that plastic surgery patients should be made aware that going under the knife is about more than just aesthetics and beauty.\n\n[Image credit: bodycouturesx.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "While most women undergo the pains of plastic surgery in order to be more beautiful, a new study claims that going under the knife actually makes women more", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "While most women undergo the pains of plastic surgery in order to be more beautiful, a new study claims that going under the knife actually makes women more", "title": "Plastic Surgery Makes Women More Likeable As Well As Beautiful, Study Finds", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2001170/plastic-surgery-makes-women-more-likeable-as-well-as-beautiful-study-finds/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/plastic-e1428776965289.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T14:40:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T15:49:08+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/plastic-e1428776965289.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-04-11T14:40:11+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "bags under eyes,georgetown university school of medicine,plastic surgery,plastic surgery likeable,professor michael reilly,health studies", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/plastic-e1428776965289.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 669}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "While most women undergo the pains of plastic surgery in order to be more beautiful, a new study claims that going under the knife actually makes women more"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14ab\"", "article_summary": "While most women undergo the pains of plastic surgery in order to be more beautiful, a new study claims that going under the knife actually makes women more likeable, as well as younger looking, to other people.\nIt found that women who have plastic surgery are perceived by others to have better social skills and are even more trustworthy.\nThe research compared people\u2019s perceptions of women who had face lifts, upper and lower eye lifts, brow lifts, neck lifts, and chin implants.\nFor Professor Reilly, the results are more than a little bit interesting.\nThe study, the first of its kind was carried out by Professor Michael Reilly of Georgetown University School of Medicine."}
