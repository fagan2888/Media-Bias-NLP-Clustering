A new Kickstarter campaign hopes to blend the two worlds of video games and blood donation by hooking players up to a machine that draws their actual blood when their character gets shot. Welcome to Blood Sport.\n\nThe campaign was started by two Canadian video game designers, Taran Chadha and Jamie Umpherson, whose previous work delved into bringing real life into the virtual and, they say, set the stage for Blood Sport\u2019s inception. Their goal is to bring the experience on a cross-country tour, where they can set up multi-player blood donation gaming events.\n\nBlood Sport, Kickstarter .\n\nThe design itself is simple. The mechanism that makes the controller vibrate gets hooked into an existing blood collection device, called an Arduino Board, which both monitors how much blood is being drawn and shuts off when it hits a certain limit, \u201cso that Blood Sport powers down before you do,\u201d the creators explain on their campaign page. \u201cWe\u2019ve done this by allowing you to input your age, weight, and any preexisting medical conditions.\u201d\n\nThe team freely admits they\u2019re not reinventing the wheel \u2014 merely hacking an already available set of technologies and putting them together \u2014 though, they do hope their project can raise some awareness about blood donation. In the U.S. alone, the American Red Cross has struggled to keep up with the demand for blood. Each day, more than 41,000 donations are needed, yet donation rates only continue to fall.\n\nBlood Sport, Kickstarter .\n\nShedding blood on the battlefield of a video game may not save any lives in the virtual world, but it could have real-world benefits for people in need. Of course, the minds behind Blood Sport don\u2019t want you to wait until their prototype gets released: \u201cGrab your buddies, go down to your local donor clinic, and see who gets dizzy first.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "blood, sport, controller, draws, your, blood, every, time, your, video, game, character, gets", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Blood Sport uses the electrical signal from your vibrating video game controller to draw blood each time your character gets shot.", "title": "Every Time You're Shot In A Video Game, This Controller Draws Your Blood [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/blood-sport-controller-draws-your-blood-every-time-your-video-game-character-gets-312080", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/25/bloodsport.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Blood Sport uses the electrical signal from your vibrating video game controller to draw blood each time your character gets shot.", "title": "Every Time You're Shot In A Video Game, This Controller Draws Your Blood [PHOTOS]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/blood-sport-controller-draws-your-blood-every-time-your-video-game-character-gets-312080", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2014/11/25/bloodsport.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/25/bloodsport.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2014-11-25T10:48:58-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-25T10:48:57-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Blood Sport uses the electrical signal from your vibrating video game controller to draw blood each time your character gets shot."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaacc\"", "article_summary": "Blood Sport, Kickstarter .\nA new Kickstarter campaign hopes to blend the two worlds of video games and blood donation by hooking players up to a machine that draws their actual blood when their character gets shot.\nTheir goal is to bring the experience on a cross-country tour, where they can set up multi-player blood donation gaming events.\nWelcome to Blood Sport.\nOf course, the minds behind Blood Sport don\u2019t want you to wait until their prototype gets released: \u201cGrab your buddies, go down to your local donor clinic, and see who gets dizzy first.\u201d"}
