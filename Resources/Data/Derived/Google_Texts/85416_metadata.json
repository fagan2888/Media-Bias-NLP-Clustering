The researchers found private room construction had a 56.18 percent rate of return, considerably more than the rates healthcare organizations require before a project is considered feasible.\n\nThe investment makes even more sense when compared with the cost of treating HAIs as well as the associated financial penalties, Sadatsafavi said in a statement from Cornell. \"You have to spend additional money to treat the patients that acquired infection, as it would increase their hospital stay, and to contain the sickness--powerful cleaning supplies, support services,\" he said. \"Single-patient ICU rooms reduce the cross-transmission rate and avoid extra medical costs to contain infection, and our research showed that these savings offsets capital costs.\"\n\nSadatsafavi and his team used a research model that accounted for potential HAIs and ICU occupancy rates and compared them to the investment risk of new construction and operating expenses. Nor is this the first research suggesting hospital design can factor into clinical outcomes; a Montreal hospital similarly reduced HAIs through the use of single patient rooms, cutting them by more than half and slashing ICU lengths of stay 10 percent, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the study abstract\n\n- here's the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEvidence grows that hospital design can improve outcomes\n\nMany hospitals will face steep hospital-acquired infection penalties\n\nHospital-acquired infections rack up $9.8B a year\n\nCan facility design cut down on hospital-acquired infections?\n\nNeed better evidence-based design for hospitals?
