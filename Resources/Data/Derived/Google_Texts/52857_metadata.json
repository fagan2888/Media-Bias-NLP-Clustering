But the level of subsidy is likely to increase by only about 10 percent, meaning people with Highmark plans are going to pay a lot more each month if they let their enrollment automatically renew later this year.\n\n\u201cIt's very disheartening to see a proposed rate increase of nearly 40 percent,\u201d said Jason Snyder, executive director of the Consumer Health Coalition, a North Side nonprofit that helps people enroll in Affordable Care Act insurance coverage.\n\n\u201cBut the beauty of the marketplace is there is choice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would strongly urge anyone who has bought a Highmark plan or any other plan on the marketplace to do their homework.\u201d\n\nDon't auto renew\n\nExperts said too many people let their coverage automatically renew for 2015 instead of comparing their options. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which runs HealthCare.gov, last week said nearly half of people who had coverage in 2014 let their plans renew for 2015 without shopping. Open enrollment for 2016 begins Nov. 1.\n\n\u201cThere is enough movement in this market \u2014 and health insurance is such a big piece of people's pocketbook \u2014 that you have to shop,\u201d said Michael Stahl, senior vice president of marketing for HealthMarkets Inc., a Texas-based insurance agency that operates in all 50 states. \u201cYou want to recheck ... and not just blindly re-enroll.\u201d\n\nThe three other insurers selling individual policies in Western Pennsylvania are proposing smaller rate increases than Highmark: 3 percent and 7.9 percent for UnitedHealthCare; 5.6 percent for Aetna Inc.; and 9.6 percent and 9.9 percent for UPMC Health Plan.\n\nGoing with price\n\nThe disparity in prices is likely to lead to membership losses for Highmark, which dominated the marketplace business in the first two years that it operated with the least expensive plans in the region. Next year, if their proposed rates are approved, the state's largest health insurer will have some of the most-costly plans.\n\n\u201cThe average consumer is going to go with price. They're not going to be loyal to the insurance company,\u201d said Bob Nelson, owner of Robert Nelson Agency, an Ambridge insurance brokerage.\n\nHighmark has 164,500 marketplace members in Pennsylvania this year, up from 131,000 in 2014. UPMC health Plan jumped to 62,000 members this year after lowering its rates, up from 4,000 in 2014. And it expects to increase marketplace membership to more than 90,000 for 2016.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate that our networks and benefit designs as well as our pricing will continue to be very attractive in the market,\u201d spokeswoman Gina Pferdehirt said.\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger said the company had to ask for higher rates after losing money when it gained lots of individuals who used more medical services than the company predicted.\n\n\u201cHealth plans that secured large memberships are experiencing the same factors of high utilization,\u201d he said. \u201cWe recognize that consumers have a variety of choices. We hope they will value their coverage.\u201d\n\nStahl said many health insurers that were successful in the first year or two of attracting marketplace customers with low prices are experiencing \u201cthe winner's curse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy winning the auction, you have the worst margin,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you were the lowest price, you have the most pressure from a profit standpoint.\u201d\n\nTrade-offs\n\nLarry Levitt, a senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care research organization in California, said there are trade-offs that shoppers need to consider when switching plans \u2014 first and foremost they need to know what an insurer's network includes and if they'll be able to keep seeing their doctor.\n\nMany insurers offer limited networks of hospitals and doctors in their marketplace plans, he said. That's the case in Western Pennsylvania, where a reimbursement contract that expired between UPMC and Highmark prevents many Highmark members from having in-network access at many of UPMC's hospitals.\n\n\u201cThere will be better deals to be had, but it might mean switching plans and perhaps switching doctors,\u201d Levitt said.\n\nShopping will be especially important for people who receive government subsidies, which on average cover about 75 percent of premium costs, he said.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, about 470,000 people signed up for coverage through HealthCare.gov and 81 percent of them received a subsidy. On average nationwide, subsidies covered about three-quarters of the premium cost in 2015. Subsidies are available to people, on a sliding scale, if their incomes are within 100 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level \u2014 or between $11,770 and $47,080 for a single person.\n\nAs prices rise, the subsidy isn't likely to keep pace with premiums, Levitt said. The value of the subsidy is pegged to the second lowest-cost silver level plan in each market. In Western Pennsylvania, that is likely to be a UPMC product, with a premium that may rise by 10 percent. But Highmark premiums could increase by 20 percent to 40 percent.\n\n\u201cPeople have to be active shoppers to protect themselves from premium increases,\u201d he said.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
