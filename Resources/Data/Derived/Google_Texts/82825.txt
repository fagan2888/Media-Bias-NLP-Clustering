Every year, Memorial Day ceremonies are held in most every city and town in America.

In Panama City Monday morning, preparation for events started at daybreak for local Boy Scouts.

The scouts set up flags for the ceremony that was held at Kent Forest Lawn Cemetery.

They lined the streets with small flags and set up flagpoles through out the cemetery.

People from all around Northwest Florida attended the ceremony honoring those who lost their lives fighting for our country.
