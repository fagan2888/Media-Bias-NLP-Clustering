But he playfully suggested that Republicans, in order to save time, just \u201cnumber their one through 50 criticisms of Obamacare\u201d and yell out a number when they want to reference a specific complaint.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard things so many times, we would immediately laugh because basically they\u2019re jokes,\u201d Reid said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that the Republican leader and many of his colleagues want to keep fighting an old fight. Four years ago we passed the health reform bill, four years ago. The president signed it, the Supreme Court upheld it. It is the law of the land.\u201d\n\nAddressing the problems with the rocky roll out, Reid acknowledged: \u201cOf course, we want to make it better, and certainly with what\u2019s going on with the rollout of the web site, we need to do that. I wish our Republican colleagues would stop trying to scare people out of participating in this program.\u201d\n\nMitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said from the floor on Thursday: \u201cLet\u2019s work together to undo the harm of Obamacare and start over with real, bipartisan, cost-saving reforms\u2026reforms that will actually allow Americans to keep the health plans they like.\u201d\n\nThe Kentuckian said: \u201cIt\u2019s way past time for Democrats to end this blame game. Instead, they need to start acknowledging the consequences of their law, and actually do something about the mess they created.\u201d\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "He says Democrats are laughinga'Basically they're jokes'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday said Republican complaints about President Obama's unpopular health-care law are not valid criticisms, but rather \"jokes.\"    In a speech on the Senate fl", "title": "Reid says Republican criticisms of Obamacare are simply \u2018jokes\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/07/reid-says-republican-criticisms-of-obamacare-are-simply-jokes/", "image": {"width": 744, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Reid-Laughs-e1383847263902.jpg", "height": 319}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He says Democrats are laughinga'Basically they're jokes'", "title": "Reid says Republican criticisms of Obamacare are simply \u2018jokes\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/07/reid-says-republican-criticisms-of-obamacare-are-simply-jokes/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Reid-Laughs-e1383847263902.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-07 11:28:27", "sailthru.title": "Reid says Republican criticisms of Obamacare are simply 'jokes'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "harry-reid,mitch-mcconnell,obamacare,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "harry reid,mitch mcconnell,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday said Republican complaints about President Obama's unpopular health-care law are not valid criticisms, but rather \"jokes.\"    In a speech on the Senate fl", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Reid-Laughs-e1383847263902.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe155a\"", "article_summary": "He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that the Republican leader and many of his colleagues want to keep fighting an old fight.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard things so many times, we would immediately laugh because basically they\u2019re jokes,\u201d Reid said.\nBut he playfully suggested that Republicans, in order to save time, just \u201cnumber their one through 50 criticisms of Obamacare\u201d and yell out a number when they want to reference a specific complaint.\nInstead, they need to start acknowledging the consequences of their law, and actually do something about the mess they created.\u201dFollow Alex on Twitter\n3952360Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday said Republican complaints about President Obama\u2019s unpopular health-care law are not valid criticisms, but rather \u201cjokes.\u201dIn a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, the Nevada Democrat didn\u2019t address any of the GOP\u2019s specific complaints about the law."}
