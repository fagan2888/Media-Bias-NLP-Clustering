TRENTON — U.S. Rep. Scott Garrett (R-5th Dist.), New Jersey’s most conservative congressman and a six-term incumbent, hasn't had much of a campaign challenge over his House career. But Roy Cho, a 33-year-old Democrat who never ran for office until this year, is giving him tougher fight than expected.

A Monmouth University poll released last week found Garrett leading Cho by 11 percentage points.

Cho joined NJ Advance Media Statehouse reporters Matt Friedman and Brent Johnson this morning, on the eve of Election Day, for a live video chat. Watch a recap above.

Garrett declined our invitation, citing campaign commitments. But we'll forward him your questions and post the answers.

The 5th Congressional District includes all of Warren County except Phillipsburg and its suburbs, and parts of Sussex, Passaic and Bergen counties.

Some of the issues the candidates disagree on, include:

The Affordable Care Act: Garrett wants to repeal it; Cho wants to address its flaws and amend it.
