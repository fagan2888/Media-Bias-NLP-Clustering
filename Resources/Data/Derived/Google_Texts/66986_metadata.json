Ginsburg added that she had lunch with Obama last summer at the president\u2019s invitation but that she doesn\u2019t think he was \u201cfishing\u201d for her retirement plans.\n\nIf so, she probably would have given the same response she gave Katie Couric, who broadcast an interview with her on Yahoo! News, also on Thursday.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is that I am still here and likely to remain for a while,\u201d she said. In the past, Ginsburg has said she had a role model in Justice Louis Brandeis, who retired at 82. Now, she says, she\u2019ll take it year by year and stay \u201cas long as I can do it full steam.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t think that the cluster of interviews is a coincidence. Just as she did last summer \u2014 in conversations with The Washington Post, New York Times and others \u2014 Ginsburg had some points to make before departing for her annual late-summer binge of family and opera.\n\nWhile some of her colleagues would rather write a term\u2019s worth of tax law decisions than sit down with reporters, that has never been true for Ginsburg.\n\nShe uses the opportunities to stake out positions, express disappointment in the decisions of her colleagues and \u2014 most of all \u2014 make clear that she is enjoying her role as the leader of the court\u2019s liberals and is not ready to give it up.\n\n\u201cThank goodness I haven\u2019t slowed down,\u201d she told Reuters. Ginsburg battled cancer in 1999 and 2009 but told her interviewers she is cancer-free and continues to work out with her trainer.\n\nShe was cagey about what she and Obama talked about and why he might have invited her. \u201cMaybe to talk about the court. Maybe because he likes me. I like him,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\nShe has made that clear before. On one of the walls in her chambers is a photo of Obama hugging her before delivering a State of the Union address. Her son, who lives in Chicago, had brought Obama to her attention when he was still in Illinois politics, and Ginsburg requested to be seated next to him at a dinner after Obama was elected to the Senate.\n\nAsked what Obama would think about whether she should retire, Ginsburg said: \u201cI think he would agree with me that it\u2019s a question for my own good judgment.\u201d\n\nGinsburg has had other things on her mind as well in recent interviews. She told the AP that she felt that by June 2016 \u2014 if not sooner \u2014 the court will have supplied the answer as to whether state bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional, a question the court sidestepped in 2013.\n\nShe predicted the justices would not delay as they had in rulings on interracial marriage.\n\n\u201cI think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cIf a case is properly before the court, they will take it.\u201d\n\nAnd she said, in various ways, that her male colleagues displayed a \u201cblind spot\u201d in the court\u2019s recent Hobby Lobby decision. The court ruled 5 to 4 that some private companies do not have to cover in their employees\u2019 insurance plans all contraceptives for women, contrary to requirements of the Affordable Care Act, if doing so would violate the religious beliefs of the companies\u2019 owners.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that if the court had been composed of nine women the result would have been different in Hobby Lobby,\u201d Ginsburg said.\n\nThat said, she told Couric, \u201cjustices continue to think and can change. They have wives. They have daughters. By the way, I think daughters can change the perception of their fathers.\u201d\n\nShe might have been referring, as she had done before, to former Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. Ginsburg said she believes the single-mother experiences of Rehnquist\u2019s daughter changed the conservative justice\u2019s views over time.\n\nGinsburg\u2019s outspokenness is not always well-received. Some court commentators say it is inappropriate for justices to be so expansive off the bench, although her friend on the other side of the court\u2019s ideological divide, Justice Antonin Scalia, can be equally loquacious.\n\nEd Whelan, a conservative commentator at National Review Online, critiqued Couric\u2019s interview as being filled with softball questions. He said the media would have been outraged if President George W. Bush had invited Rehnquist over for lunch.\n\nAnd others have pointed out that several female lower-court judges voted just the way the Supreme Court\u2019s male conservatives did in the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nGinsburg seemed to agree that gender is hardly determinative in court decisions.\n\nAsked in the Reuters interview whether, when she finally does retire, she should be replaced by a woman, Ginsburg said not necessarily.\n\n\u201cThere are some women I definitely would not want to succeed me,\u201d Ginsburg said. But she added, \u201cA man like (former justice) David Souter, that would be great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As some call for her to hang up her robe, the liberal justice says she\u2019ll probably stick around for a while.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "As some call for her to hang up her robe, the liberal justice says she\u2019ll probably stick around for a while.", "title": "Amid calls to retire, Justice Ginsburg says she\u2019s catching her second wind", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/amid-calls-to-retire-justice-ginsburg-says-shes-catching-her-second-wind/2014/08/01/4399296a-199f-11e4-9349-84d4a85be981_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/01/National-Politics/Images/Supreme_Court_Ginsburg-0aefc-5045.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/amid-calls-to-retire-justice-ginsburg-says-shes-catching-her-second-wind/2014/08/01/4399296a-199f-11e4-9349-84d4a85be981_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts, Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, retirment, interviews, Hobby Lobby, successor, President Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "news_keywords": "courts, Supreme Court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, retirment, interviews, Hobby Lobby, successor, President Obama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "4399296a-199f-11e4-9349-84d4a85be981"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcecae\"", "article_summary": "In the past, Ginsburg has said she had a role model in Justice Louis Brandeis, who retired at 82.\nAsked in the Reuters interview whether, when she finally does retire, she should be replaced by a woman, Ginsburg said not necessarily.\n\u201cI think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,\u201d Ginsburg said.\nGinsburg battled cancer in 1999 and 2009 but told her interviewers she is cancer-free and continues to work out with her trainer.\nThe 81-year-old justice said almost exactly those words to Joan Biskupic of Reuters that same afternoon."}
