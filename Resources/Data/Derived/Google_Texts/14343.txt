The man leading the GOP primary polls made it clear on Thursday night that he still has a high opinion of health care systems that are to the left of Obamacare.

During the first GOP debate, moderator Bret Baier said to Donald Trump, "15 years ago, you called yourself a liberal on health care. You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system."

"As far as single payer, it works in Canada," Trump replied. "It works incredibly well in Scotland. It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here." Trump didn't explain what might have changed in the last 15 years that would prevent the United States from adopting Canadian-style health care.

So will Trump's praise of socialist health care hurt him in the GOP primary? It's not clear. Polls suggest that Trump supporters aren't all that conservative and what they really like about him is his brash demeanor:

Earlier in the debate, Megyn Kelly of Fox News recited a litany of vulgar statements Trump had made about women.

"You've called women you don't like 'fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals,'" Kelly said.

"Only Rosie O'Donnell," Trump replied. Kelly pointed out his comments went far beyond one person. "You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees," she said.

"I don't frankly have time for total political correctness," Trump replied. "And to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either."
