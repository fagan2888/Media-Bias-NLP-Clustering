The product was developed by NavisHealth, a Silicon Valley digital health information company, for Apple IOS phone users and Android devices.\n\nEngage allows patients to instantly see lab results and prescription information, and provides a telephone directory of physicians on staff and hospital services. There also are tools to help patients track their blood pressure and set up medication reminders. A built-in reference of recommended health practices and first aid information also is included.\n\nThe app compliments Salina Regional\u2019s \u201cMy Health Portal\u201d electronic health record access, which was launched last summer. Within the patient portal \u2013 available through the hospital\u2019s website at myhealthportal.srhc.com \u2013 patients can access their latest lab and x-ray test results, prescription lists, billing information, physician progress notes, discharge summaries and upcoming appointments.\n\n\u201cSalina Regional Engage and the My Health Portal access are user-friendly systems that empower patients to become more active managers of their own care,\u201d said Michael McEldowney, information services director at Salina Regional Health Center. \u201cPatients who are more informed are more likely to seek the best practices to maintain and achieve good health.\u201d\n\nSalina Regional\u2019s efforts to enhance patient access to health records are aimed at exceeding requirements of the Affordable Care Act, which will eventually begin penalizing hospitals and clinics that do not meet criteria for meaningful use of newly developed information systems.\n\n\u201cWe achieved all the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services measures for Stage 2 of meaningful use in 2014 and are now working towards Stage 3,\u201d said Larry Barnes, vice president and chief information officer at Salina Regional Health Center. \u201cOver the last several years we\u2019ve implemented a robust information system that plays a prominent role in patient documentation, clinical decision support and the implementation of evidence-based protocols. It has taken a lot of dedication from hospital employees and medical staff to achieve this level of integration that now affords our patients the latest access to their health information.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nInternet Resources:\n\nVisit myhealthportal.srhc.com to find links to download the Salina Regional Engage app, access My Health Portal or learn more information.\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-KS", "geo.position": "38.841347;-97.609101", "geo.placename": "131 N.
