Saturday's rain didn't stop the Gulf Coast Shell Club from hosting its annual Shell Show.

The club showcased shells at the Panama City Beach Senior Center.

It featured different shells found not only in Bay County, but from around the country.

People could also sell their own shells they have collected.

The Gulf Coast Shell Club is a non-profit organization that aims to educates the community about shells.

"Like I say, we have exhibits that are judged by people who are permanent in their field of writing about shells and so forth," G.C. Shell Club President Gwen Lawrence said. "So when you see an exhibit that has a ribbon on it, it means something. A little more special than the average."

For those who missed Saturday's show, you'll have another chance Sunday.

It will open again Sunday at the senior center at 10 a.m.
