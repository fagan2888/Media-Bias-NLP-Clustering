There were veteran union activists backing her, such as Pam DiFatta and Al Becco.\n\nEsgar, 34, is a former television news producer who became an activist for the Colorado Progressive Coalition for a time. She sought to be appointed to City Council in 2012. She\u2019s been active in supporting gay marriage and civil unions in Colorado.\n\nArguing that Pueblo is hurt by its high utility rates, Esgar said she wants to change how the three members of the Colorado Public Utility Commission are appointed.\n\n\u201cWe need legislation that enables real people to set these rates \u2014 instead of a Public Utility Commission that is filled with representatives from corporate energy,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Gov. John Hickenlooper recently said the state economy has revived, Esgar said that isn\u2019t true for Pueblo \u2014 which still struggles with high unemployment, she said.\n\nShe said Pueblo schools need a better share of state education funds and she would oppose efforts to shrink the size or role of Colorado State University-Pueblo, her alma mater.\n\n\u201cUntil we fight for real reform of how our schools are funded, we will never fix our education problems,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Legislature was a battleground over gun legislation last session.\n\nEsgar called herself a supporter of the Second Amendment of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think any of the gun legislation passed last year violates the (second) amendment,\u201d she said.\n\nEsgar and Garcia are contending for the House office because Leroy Garcia is challenging newly elected state Sen. George Rivera, R-Pueblo, for his 3rd District office.\n\nThus far, the two Democratic women are the only candidates to declare for the office.\n\nproper@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/politics/2214244-120/esgar-pueblo-colorado-office", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=1YCVVd8bnxCZM6Oh7Ns8jM$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuo5zJn8x12tqEbpqBKC3N3WCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article", "title": "Esgar aims for House District 46 seat"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9407\"", "article_summary": "Esgar and Garcia are contending for the House office because Leroy Garcia is challenging newly elected state Sen.
