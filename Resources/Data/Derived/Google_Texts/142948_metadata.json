Schumer offered a stirring defense of government as the only force that can stand up to the private sector\u2019s attack on the middle class, and argued that for Democrats to \u201croll to victory in 2016\u2026 First, we must convince Americans that government can be on their side and is not just a tool of special interests.\u201d\n\nSchumer is not just any Democrat. He led the successful election efforts for Democratic senators in 2006 and 2008, is number three in the Democratic Senate leadership, where he is responsible for policy and communications, and he sits on several of the most powerful Senate committees. His speech at the National Press Club on November 25 was billed as a major analysis of why Democrats did so badly in the midterms and how they should chart a path to victory in 2016.\n\nUnfortunately, Schumer embodies the contradictions that will tear the Democratic Party apart over the next two years. He understands the need to embrace a populist, progressive narrative and program, but his ties to Wall Street and big money lead him to blunt any real moves by Democrats to take a bold stand for working people against corporate power.\n\nThe budget proposal to allow more government bailouts of banks that gamble with their depositors\u2019 money was a huge lost opportunity for Democrats to paint Republicans as being on the side of the big banks that wrecked the economy. That opportunity was negated by President Obama\u2019s pushing for the budget and Senator Schumer\u2019s stealth maneuvers (widely known in Congress) to keep the Wall Street deal intact. As a result, the leaders of both parties demonstrated, as they\u2019ve done before, that government is in fact on the side of the rich and powerful.\n\nSchumer knows that this is a problem if Democrats hope to win at the polls. While his speech at the National Press Club got a lot of attention for his negative comments about the President\u2019s strategy on the Affordable Care Act, those remarks were only a small part of a long analysis that has a lot in common with progressive views of the economy and the role of government. Some highlights:\n\nThe most salient factor in our political economy is that for the first time in American history, middle-class incomes have been in decline for over a decade\u2026 The powerful have much more access and influence over government and specific and strong actions must be taken to curb that influence so government can really represent the average person\u2026 We must illustrate that government can provide solutions by delineating specific concrete programs that if enacted would actually improve lives and incomes\u2026 We must convince the middle class that the only way out of their morass is by a stronger and effective government, not by demeaning or running from it\u2026\n\nWhen large forces harness power and push you around, you need a large after force to stand up to \u2014 to stand up for you. The only force that can give you the tools to stand up to the large tectonic forces that can mitigate the effects that technology creates on your income is an active and committed government that is on your side.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A populist message won't be enough to save the party if its leaders continue to serve the interests of Wall Street", "title": "Democrats\u2019 middle-class hypocrisy: Why omnibus will haunt them", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A populist message won't be enough to save the party if its leaders continue to serve the interests of Wall Street", "title": "Democrats\u2019 middle-class hypocrisy: Why omnibus will haunt them", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/01/democrats_middle_class_hypocrisy_why_omnibus_will_haunt_them_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/chuck_schumer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A populist message won't be enough to save the party if its leaders continue to serve the interests of Wall Street", "title": "Democrats\u2019 middle-class hypocrisy: Why omnibus will haunt them", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/chuck_schumer.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Richard Kirsch", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, charles schumer, National Press, Next New Deal, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That opportunity was negated by President Obama\u2019s pushing for the budget and Senator Schumer\u2019s stealth maneuvers (widely known in Congress) to keep the Wall Street deal intact.\nSchumer knows that this is a problem if Democrats hope to win at the polls.\nHis speech at the National Press Club on November 25 was billed as a major analysis of why Democrats did so badly in the midterms and how they should chart a path to victory in 2016.\nUnfortunately, Schumer embodies the contradictions that will tear the Democratic Party apart over the next two years.\nTopics: charles schumer, National Press, Next New Deal, Wall Street, Business NewsThis originally appeared on Next New DealTwo weeks before New York Senator Charles Schumer once again delivered for Wall Street with the omnibus budget deal, he gave a major speech in which he sounded like a progressive champion."}
