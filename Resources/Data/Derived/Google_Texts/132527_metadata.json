I am pleased that the court recognized the plain meaning of the Constitution and upheld the role of Congress in appropriating taxpayer dollars,\u201d Brady said.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOn Nov. 21, 2014 then-Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) filed a lawsuit on behalf of House Republicans in response to the administration\u2019s improper use of taxpayer dollars to make payments \u2013 known as cost sharing reduction (CSR) payments \u2013 to insurance companies on the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nWhile current law authorizes the CSR program to make payments, the Constitution requires that Congress expressly appropriate funds to be used before the dministration can legally make any payments to insurers. As the Constitution requires, \u201cNo Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.\u201d\n\nToday a federal judge ruled in favor of House Republicans that the administration has no constitutional or statutory authority to spend taxpayer funds that Congress has not appropriated. Insurers are still required by law to offer lower co-payments, deductibles, and other cost-sharing reductions to eligible individuals.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.yourkingwoodnews.com", "description": "House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) released a statement May 12 after a federal judge ruled in favor of House Republicans in a lawsuit against the administration\u2019s improper use of taxpayer dollars under Obamacare.", "title": "Brady issues statement on federal ruling regarding Obamacare cost sharing reduction payments", "url": "http://www.yourhoustonnews.com/kingwood/opinion/brady-issues-statement-on-federal-ruling-regarding-obamacare-cost-sharing/article_04f9c3c9-4a04-517a-9e4b-059c437c51a2.html", "image": {"width": 337, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/yourhoustonnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/ce/cced80dc-d6bf-53f0-ba9d-33342d44c695/5734d5b919848.image.jpg?resize=337%2C400", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ScoopHouston", "card": "summary"}, "description": "House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) released a statement May 12 after a federal judge ruled in favor of House Republicans in a lawsuit against the administration\u2019s improper use of taxpayer dollars under Obamacare.", "msvalidate.01": "29516177700BA7C06DA5A4D58A12C04C", "fb": {"app_id": 191454774240451}, "keywords": "opinion", "google-site-verification": "lqzy3EyAvgVvWDlrVhCm69f7Q1GER22OmU5rYfmsBh8", "news_keywords": "opinion"}, "article_summary": "House Ways and Means Committee chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) released a statement May 12 after a federal judge ruled in favor of House Republicans in a lawsuit against the administration\u2019s improper use of taxpayer dollars under Obamacare.\nI am pleased that the court recognized the plain meaning of the Constitution and upheld the role of Congress in appropriating taxpayer dollars,\u201d Brady said.\nWhile current law authorizes the CSR program to make payments, the Constitution requires that Congress expressly appropriate funds to be used before the dministration can legally make any payments to insurers.\nBACKGROUNDOn Nov. 21, 2014 then-Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) filed a lawsuit on behalf of House Republicans in response to the administration\u2019s improper use of taxpayer dollars to make payments \u2013 known as cost sharing reduction (CSR) payments \u2013 to insurance companies on the Obamacare exchanges.\nInsurers are still required by law to offer lower co-payments, deductibles, and other cost-sharing reductions to eligible individuals."}
