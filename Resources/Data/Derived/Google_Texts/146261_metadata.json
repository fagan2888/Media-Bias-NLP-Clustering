There\u2019s something about Washington. They look at these beautiful buildings, these beautiful halls and all of a sudden they become impotent. Is that an appropriate word? I think so. It doesn\u2019t work. Put those two together,\u201d Trump said, and the crowd laughed and cheered. \u201cSomething happens to \u2019em and all of a sudden they\u2019re not fighters.\u201d\n\nAUDIO of Trump\u2019s remarks in Dubuque, 55:00\n\nSam Clovis, a former Sioux City radio talk show host and Morningside College economics professor who ran for the U.S Senate last year, has signed on as Trump\u2019s national co-chair and a senior policy advisor. Clovis introduced Trump to the Dubuque crowd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a time to choose an alternative to electing the same kind of people over and over again and getting the same results,\u201d Clovis said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to disrupt the status quo.\u201d\n\nClovis had been working for Rick Perry, but was among the Perry campaign operatives who were asked to continue working without pay. Clovis told reporters at a news conference before Tuesday night\u2019s rally that he holds Perry in high regard, but left the Perry campaign as it transitions to a new phase. Trump took questions from reporters for more than half an hour and engaged in a lengthy and sometimes terse exchange over immigration policy with a reporter from Univision. Early in the news conference, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos stood and tried to engage with Trump and Trump repeatedly told Ramos to \u201csit down\u201d because he had called upon another reporter to ask a question. A security guard escorted Ramos from the room, but Ramos returned later, then Ramos and Trump engaged in a testy, five-minute exchange on the subject.\n\nAUDIO of Trump\u2019s news conference, 32:00\n\n(Photo by Asya Akca)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Radio Iowa", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump told a huge crowd in Dubuque\u00a0tonight they are part of the \u201csilent majority\u201d that has catapulted him to the top of the polls \u2014 and he\u2026", "title": "Trump blasts \u2018impotent\u2019 DC politicians, says \u2018silent majority\u2019 backing his campaign (AUDIO)", "url": "http://www.radioiowa.com/2015/08/25/trump-blasts-impotent-dc-politicians-says-silent-majority-backing-his-campaign/", "image": {"width": 3545, "identifier": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_09421.jpg", "height": 3037}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-26T01:20:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T16:55:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.radioiowa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/DSC_09421.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know, it\u2019s one thing to have the \u2018summer of Trump\u2019,\u201d Trump said.\nClovis introduced Trump to the Dubuque crowd.\nA security guard escorted Ramos from the room, but Ramos returned later, then Ramos and Trump engaged in a testy, five-minute exchange on the subject.\nEarly in the news conference, Univision anchor Jorge Ramos stood and tried to engage with Trump and Trump repeatedly told Ramos to \u201csit down\u201d because he had called upon another reporter to ask a question.\nTrump called Republican members of congress \u201cweak people\u201d who have failed to follow through on their campaign promises, like \u201cknocking out\u201d ObamaCare."}
