On Monday, the Avs will look to improve to 9-2 this month with their sixth consecutive win, which would match the longest since coach Patrick Roy\u2019s rookie season in 2013-14. Colorado\u2019s eight wins this month was tops in the NHL entering Sunday\u2019s games.\n\nGame story from Saturday\u2019s 5-1 win over Edmonton looks at red-hot goalie Semyon Varlamov and the efficient offense in front of him.\n\nThe notebook from Saturday\u2019s game leads with Colorado draftee A.J. Greer\u2019s mid-season move from Boston University to the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League\u2019s top team, with Avs GM Joe Sakic talking.\n\nSince Saturday\u2019s game was an 8:10 p.m. start, many newspaper subscribers didn\u2019t get the game story. Instead, those folks got a quick look at what a handful of Avalanche players are doing for the Christmas break, which for them is a whopping four full days.\n\nBack to the A.J. Greer situation. The 39th pick in the 2015 draft struggled at Boston University and is now joining the Quebec league\u2019s top team, the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies (27-4-3-1), who have several Avalanche ties. Rouyn-Noranda\u2019s assistant GM is Mario Duhamel, who was Roy\u2019s video coach the past two seasons. And Huskies forwards Jean-Christophe Beaudin and Julian Nantel are Avalanche draft picks. Beaudin is a third-rounder from 2015 and Nantel a seventh-rounder in 2014.\n\nGreer, 19, is from Quebec and was an 11th-round pick by Rouyn-Noranda in the 2013 QMJHL draft.\n\nI get it. The carrot was dangled in front of him since he joined BU. His junior draft rights are owned by a team that is the favorite to win the league championship and play for the Memorial Cup. He probably came to college too early \u2014 he was 17 last season as a freshman, the youngest forward the NCAA \u2014 and his four goals in 55 games at BU probably made everyone around him panic, including the Avalanche.\n\nBut I hate to see a teenager leave a hockey team mid-season, especially if the move is driven by an NHL team he might never play for.\n\nOn Sunday I asked Patrick Roy to comment on Greer. Verbatim: \u201cI\u2019m not that aware of what really happened. At the same time, every player is trying to make the best decisions for their career. I assume he talked to his parents, his agent \u2014 I\u2019m sure he has great people around him helping him make his decision. For us as an organization, we just hope he develops. That\u2019s all we care about. Is is in the Quebec league? Is it in college? It\u2019s his decision, his choice.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the character value, or lack thereof, of bolting on BU, Roy politely declined to comment.\n\n\u201cI have enough to worry about with my own players and the (possible) call-ups,\u201d he said.\n\nPatrick Roy after Saturday\u2019s win over Edmonton:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Toronto on tap Monday, Avalanche hopes to continue December surge", "title": "Toronto on tap Monday, Avalanche hopes to continue December surge", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/12/20/toronto-on-tap-monday-avalanche-hopes-to-continue-december-surge/22850/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2013/10/patrick-roy-495x391.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Toronto on tap Monday, Avalanche hopes to continue December surge", "creator": "@mikechambers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2015/12/20/toronto-on-tap-monday-avalanche-hopes-to-continue-december-surge/22850/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2013/10/patrick-roy-495x391.jpg", "title": "Toronto on tap Monday, Avalanche hopes to continue December surge", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "A.J.
