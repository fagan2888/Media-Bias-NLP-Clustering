(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Ever since President Reagan invited Lenny Skutnick \u2014 the federal employee who was the hero of the of Air Florida Flight 90 crash in the Potomac River in 1982 \u2014 the first lady's box at the State of the Union Address has been an extension of the address itself.\n\nThe White House on Sunday announced the complete 2016 list of Lenny Skutniks, including veterans, volunteers, college students, small business people, immigrants, activists and the CEO of Microsoft.\n\nPresidents use those special guests to illustrate broader themes in their annual address to Congress.
