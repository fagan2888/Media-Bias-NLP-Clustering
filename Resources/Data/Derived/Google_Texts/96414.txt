The Tucson Police Department has identified the driver in a fatal one-car crash Saturday morning as Peter Farrell, 18.

The collision happened a little after 9 a.m. on Saturday on the westbound off ramp of East Tanque Verde Road, at North Pantano Road. The off ramp was closed for much of the day as police investigated.

Farrell and his car, a 1997 Honda Accord, were the only ones involved in the crash, which ended with the Honda wrapped around a light pole. Farrell was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a TPD media release.

Investigators determined that Farrell had crossed the 'gore' area to exit Tanque Verde when he lost control of the car, hitting the light pole sideways on the driver's side. They said he didn't seem to be wearing a seatbelt, and speed and impairment did not appear to be factors in the crash, according to the release.

Next of kin have been notified.
