(Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nChanges in health care laws mean many people have insurance for the first time. But they\u2019re far from the only ones left scratching their heads by the complexities of choosing and using insurance.\n\nDon\u2019t leave yourself scrambling when disaster strikes. Study up now to understand your policy, which will be critical to make a smart choice when insurance enrollment comes around.\n\nWhat are the key components to insurance?\n\nYou need to know what your deductible is. That tells you how much health care you have to pay for before insurance starts taking on a significant share.\n\nA high-deductible plan is less expensive but leaves patients on the hook for $5,000, $10,000 and more of their own health care costs in a year before insurance kicks in.\n\nYou may have a co-pay, which is typically a fixed amount you pay for a service, such as $25 for a doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nCo-insurance is a split payment. Once you meet your deductible, then co-insurance kicks in. You could have a 90-10 split, with the insurance company paying 90 percent of a charge and you paying 10 percent. More often the splits are 80-20 to 60-40, said John Doran of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Montana.\n\n\u201cThe higher the deductible, the lower the monthly premium; the higher the co\u2013pay, the lower the monthly premium; the higher the co\u2013insurance, the lower the monthly premium and the higher the maximum, the lower the monthly,\u201d Doran said.\n\nThe maximum level is the cap on what customers pay in a year.\n\nA health insurance account can help mute the blow of a doctor\u2019s bill, especially for those with a high-deductible plan. Check to see if the money rolls over year to year. You put a certain amount in the account every month, and that money is earmarked for health care costs.\n\n\u201cSome plans with a higher premium and co-pay are better for people, and other times a higher deductible and a health savings account is better,\u201d Doran said. \u201cThere are a lot of choices to find the right plan.\u201d\n\nAn Affordable Care Act health insurance marketplace navigator helps a consumer get information to re-enroll in a health insurance plan. Choosing a plan with the right deductible, copay, coinsurance and maximum level is critical to financial health.

Those health care providers \u2014 hospitals, doctors, etc. \u2014 are then \u201cin-network.\u201d That means it\u2019s cheaper, often significantly, to visit in-network providers.\n\nSome insurance plans also have a different maximum set on what patients have to pay for in-network versus out-of-network services. That could mean you\u2019d pay a maximum of, say, $5,000 for in-network care in a year yourself but, say, $20,000 for out-of-network care before you\u2019d have hit the cap on what you\u2019d be expected to pay.\n\n\u201cMake sure to pick a plan \u2014 if you get to pick a plan \u2014 that your preferred provider is in-network,\u201d Doran said. \u201cYou want to make sure you have a network that works for you. You might want one that includes your local doctor, or you might want one that if you travel around the state or world, you have in-network access you need in those places.\u201d\n\nOr, there could be no maximum level to cap your costs if you had out-of-network service, Doran said.\n\nLet\u2019s say Jane has a $50,000 charge, he outlined. BCBS has worked out an in-network rate of $40,000 with the doctor. Jane has an 80-20 coinsurance rate, so she would have to pay 20 percent of the negotiated rate, or $8,000. However, her maximum is set at $5,000 for the year, so that is as much as she pays.\n\nFor out-of-network service in this scenario, BCBS will still only pay $40,000. The doctor will make her pay the $10,000 difference. Insurance won\u2019t pay as high a percent, and she doesn\u2019t have a cap on her maximum payments for the year.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s up to owing $21,000 already,\u201d Doran said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s critically important to know your network.\u201d\n\nInsurance customers enroll in health plans. Heathcare.gov has open enrollment starting Oct. 1. (Photo: AP)\n\nHow do I tell who is in or out of insurance company\u2019s network?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s harder than you think,\u201d said John Goodnow, CEO at Benefis Health System. \u201cTheoretically you could ask your doctor, are you in-network for such and such plan. I bet most doctors would have no clue because they don\u2019t deal with that. You can\u2019t look in your plan document because they are always changing.\u201d\n\nWhat you can and should do is go online to your insurance company\u2019s provider or call the company. The difference can be thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cIt can be a ten-fold difference,\u201d Goodnow said.\n\n\u201cThe only reliable source you can go by 100 percent is your insurance plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the most fun thing to do, to call them. Online most of the plans would list who is in and out.\u201d\n\nBlueCrossBlue Shield has a mobile and online portal called \u201cprovider finder\u201d so you can type in a service such as knee replacement in Great Falls to find out if who is in network or type in your doctor and see if he or she is in-network.\n\nSo if I\u2019m having a heart attack at the lake or elsewhere on vacation, what do I do to stay in network?\n\nThe exception to in-network and out-of-network is emergencies.\n\nYou can again look at the insurance company\u2019s website to see who is in-network for what you need if you\u2019re on vacation and need to see a doctor.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not an emergency, look online. With BCBS, if you were in New York, you could type in what you need and it would provide you with the information to schedule an appointment,\u201d Doran said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take that step, you run the risk of going to an out-of-network provider and shouldering an excessive bill.\u201d\n\nAnything but a true emergency means checking ahead of time, Goodnow said.\n\n\u201cIf you, say, cut yourself and have to go to a doctor, you\u2019d be smart to check who is in-network,\u201d he said.\n\nGoodnow said one of the challenges in some places in Montana has been for-profit helicopter companies that aren\u2019t in-network for anyone. Air ambulances can be an insurance gray area in terms of constituting a emergency necessity. That could mean a huge air ambulance charge for a rescue.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies are saying, we\u2019ll pay the going rate but not their charges. That makes the rest your responsibility,\u201d he said.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield is trying to give customers more information before they make health care decisions instead of afterward. (Photo: AP)\n\nWhat do I do if the insurance my company offers isn\u2019t in Benefis\u2019 or my favorite doctor\u2019s network?\n\n\u201cThen you are up against a choice,\u201d Goodnow said. \u201cA lot of people will say I would never change my doctor. I\u2019ve seen national studies that say a $10 difference is usually all it takes to get someone to change doctors.\u201d\n\nPatients have to decide if they like a doctor well enough to pay the out-of-network price to visit her or him. The price difference can vary hugely. There\u2019s no real standard prices among hospitals and physicians in private practice.\n\n\u201cMost insurance plans are narrowing their networks and getting rid of higher cost providers,\u201d Goodnow said. \u201cThey want the doctor who is willing to take what they say they\u2019re willing to pay.\u201d\n\nIf you reject employer-offered insurance, you can buy your own policy but you don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy on the insurance exchange, Duran said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d want to talk to your employer about whether there was the opportunity to add your provider to the network,\u201d he said.\n\nDo I need some advanced degree to figure out insurance fine print?\n\nMost people never read their insurance policies because of their complexity. To better understand the policy, look at the glossary. Review the summary of benefits. Talk to your human resources department if you have employer-provided insurance. Call your insurance company.\n\n\u201cYou have to take the time, understand the lingo and be willing to go through the stuff,\u201d Goodnow said.\n\nThe contracts between insurance companies and health care providers are even more inscrutable, 30-100 pages long outlining what is paid at what rate, who has the right to decide who is right and other questions.\n\nDoran said most insurers provide tutorials to figure out coverage and to call insurance companies with questions. Have your group number and member ID from your insurance card ready. Usually the customer service number is on the back of the card.\n\nYou won\u2019t be the only one asking.\n\n\u201cMore and more, we\u2019re finding people take ownership of their healthcare plans and want to know how they can make the best possible choice for health and financial outcomes,\u201d Doran said.\n\nConsumers often are baffled by medical bills and insurance policies. Unwieldy insurance and hospital statements leave them uncertain as to how much money they owe, the deadline for payment and which organization should be paid. (Photo: AP)\n\nIf I have a deductible I never meet, does having insurance even matter at that point?\n\nHaving insurance can still knock money off a doctor visit or other treatment because of in-network pricing.\n\nI used to get charity care at the emergency room, and now I am paying every month for insurance and when I needed the emergency room, I got a huge bill. Why get insurance?\n\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance, you can always go to a nonprofit hospital\u2019s emergency room for care, regardless of your ability to pay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough way to get your health care, to rely on the ER,\u201d Goodnow said.\n\nOutside of an ER, it\u2019s really hard to get a lot of different services you need without insurance. You also are assuming you\u2019ll qualify for charity care, if you decide to rely on that instead of insurance. That safety net could disappear without you realizing.\n\nInsurance puts a cap on your responsibility. If you have an emergency visit and don\u2019t have insurance, you\u2019re going to spend more than your deductible, Goodnow said.\n\nIf you qualify for Medicaid, you\u2019re no doubt better off with that than high deductible plan. There\u2019s a limited number who qualify even under the expansion.\n\nDo I still need to negotiate on price when I have insurance?\n\nHealth care isn\u2019t like buying a car. Instead of the customer negotiating, insurance companies negotiate with healthcare providers.\n\nOne of the few things a patient can do to control costs is use in-network providers.\n\nHowever, you can call the billing office and have them review the bill if there are costs you disagree with.\n\nBenefis had a consultant review 68,000 different charges to make sure they met the common sense test.\n\n\u201cIf you went through every line item at most places, you\u2019d see something like $22 for aspirin that costs a penny,\u201d Goodnow said. \u201cAs an individual, you can\u2019t do a lot. The insurance company can be your buffer. They can say, no, we\u2019re not paying $100 for a bedpan. You get the rate they negotiate.\u201d\n\nYou can work the deductible, as well. If you need a new knee, for example, but already had met your deductible, it would be better to have the procedure in December instead of in January when the deductible level resets.\n\nIs there a way to find out what I will have to pay for something before I have it done?\n\n\u201cWith everything in our lives, we\u2019re consumers. You don\u2019t buy milk without looking at the price. But healthcare, it seems like it\u2019s treated like a whole different animal,\u201d Goodnow said. \u201cYou need to know that stuff, but with health care it\u2019s hard to price shop.\u201d\n\nIdeally, if one needed knee surgery or had a baby on the way, one could call different places and get price quotes.\n\n\u201cReally, they say it depends on complications, blah, blah, blah,\u201d Goodnow said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make it simpler to price shop, but that\u2019s not how American health care works.\u201d\n\nThe range is often large with many variables, but patients can call around. It helps to know when calling how close you are to meeting your deductible, if the healthcare provider is in or out of network and your co-pay.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to do some homework, and you could get that information from your insurance company,\u201d Goodnow said.\n\nBenefis is launching a new initiative to make prices clear up front with estimated payments to prevent unfortunate surprises.\n\nYour insurance company also may help with price comparison.\n\nBCBS\u2019s online/mobile service also compares expected costs from in-network providers based on your coverage.\n\n\u201cYou can access information to help you make the right decisions and analyze the costs at different locations,\u201d Doran said. \u201cThere\u2019s sometimes a wide discrepancy among locations, and then it\u2019s up to the member to make the decision based on quality and cost.\u201d\n\nI haven\u2019t filed an insurance claim in a decade. Wouldn\u2019t I be money ahead taking the tax penalty?\n\nPast history doesn\u2019t indicate future health care use, Goodnow said.\n\n\u201cMost people who have something major go wrong weren\u2019t expecting it, especially when you\u2019re young,\u201d he said.\n\nGoodnow was in a motorcycle wreck, had to have a helicopter rescue and went to the OR.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that piece of mind and protection,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could pay the tax penalty if you absolutely knew nothing was going to happen. That\u2019s a hard prediction to make.\n\n\u201cIf you got hit by a car, it could be millions of dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nSay you got hit by a bus in Havre, Goodnow said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d been healthy, but now you have to go the local hospital, get flown here (Great Falls), get flown to a rehab hospital in Denver and stay there for weeks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking medical bills in the millions. Bills can get really high, really fast.\u201d\n\nInsurance often includes incentives for preventative care, which is cheaper than treating conditions down the road. Goodnow said Benefis employees\u2019 insurance has done five years of biometric testing for employees. Some employees who thought they were healthy and felt fine had outlandishly high cholesterol levels and blood pressure \u2014 a ticking time bomb.\n\nBenefis has seen a person come in with a month-long infection that could have been treated by a doctor but instead became an in-patient visit costing tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 one case among many similar.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the insurance gap. When can I sign up for coverage?\n\nYou\u2019ve got a bit of a wait remaining, according to Gov. Steve Bullock\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThis administration is doing everything we can to ensure folks in the insurance gap can sign up for coverage as soon as possible,\u201d said Mike Wessler, deputy communications director for the governor. \u201cHowever, ultimately the timing on signing up for coverage depends on when the federal government approves Montana\u2019s waiver.\u201d\n\nThe Montana Legislature passed a new kind of program for implementing expansion of health care to people who make too much for Medicare and too little to qualify for subsidized insurance on the insurance exchange at healthcare.gov.\n\nThe state is submitting the request for a waiver to the federal government after the state\u2019s comment period ends in September and then the federal government will have their own 30-day public comment period.\n\nOpen enrollment for those who do qualify for the exchange begins Oct. 1.\n\nI\u2019m on Medicare. Is my health insurance going to change with the Medicaid expansion that the Legislature passed this year?\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wessler says.\n\nI have insurance, and I just got a bill a year later and found out I had to pay $5,000. I don\u2019t have it. What can I do?\n\nExasperating is Goodnow\u2019s word for that not-too-uncommon experience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve tried to get our billing cycle way faster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes to an insurance company, and they might reject the bill. We appeal. Months go by. We give people a discount for prompt payment once they get their bill, for payment within 30 days.\u201d\n\nAsk your health care provider to work with you on payment options instead of racking up credit card debt or other desperate measures.\n\nBenefis also will help people with their bills depending on income, up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. Patients also can spread out payments on a payment schedule.\n\nDoran said it\u2019s atypical to get a bill a year later but the back-and-forth between providers and insurers can delay customers getting bills. He recommended talking with an insurance company\u2019s customer advocates if there are problems.\n\nReach Tribune Staff Writer Kristen Inbody at kinbody@greatfallstribune.com.
