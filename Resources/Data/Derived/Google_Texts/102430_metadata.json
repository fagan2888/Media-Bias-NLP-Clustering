Mike Lee (R-UT). Unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats now make laws that are even too complex for Members of Congress, which has created a system of governance that benefits insiders and lawyers at the expense of everyday Americans.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWith his blockbuster new book, Our Lost Constitution: The Willful Subversion of America\u2019s Founding Document, Lee spotlights some of the most important provisions in the Constitution\u2013and the stories behind them\u2013that have been ignored and marginalized, hoping it will spur discussions and help the country reverse course and become less foreign to America\u2019s Founders.\n\nIn an extensive interview on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot channel 125, Lee told Breitbart News Executive Chairman and host Stephen K. Bannon that \u201cthere has been a conscious, deliberate effort over the course of decades to ignore the Constitution, to marginalize it, to make it a document about yesterday, about an agrarian society.\u201d\n\nLee, one of the Senate\u2019s intellectual heavyweights, said \u201cone of the left\u2019s favorite tricks\u201d is to give off the impression that since the authors of the Constitution tended to grow their own food and travel by horse and buggy, \u201cwhat they had to say about governing doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u201d Lee said he wrote the book because the opposite is true, and it has \u201cnever been more necessary than right now to have the Constitution and follow it.\u201d\n\nIn Our Lost Constitution, the thoughtful and principled Senator tells the stories that \u201cunderlie some of the most important provisions of the Constitution\u201d that he believes have been ignored over the years. Lee said once people understand those stories behind provisions like the Origination and the Legislative Powers Clauses, it will be impossible to ignore the document and text and \u201csay that we don\u2019t need it.\u201d He said his father, who was President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Solicitor General and the founding dean of BYU\u2019s law school, always said the Constitution had vertical (federalism) and horizontal (separation of powers) protections, which were the most important parts of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIf you follow those two, a lot of other things will fall into place,\u201d Lee said. \u201cAnd a lot of bad things are going to happen if you neglect those two.\u201d\n\nLee spoke passionately about the Legislative Powers Clause, which he said the Founders put at the very top of the Constitution because they wanted all legislative powers vested in Congress. But Lee said that unfortunately, \u201cwe\u2019re not legislating anymore\u201d when 80,000 pages of new regulations that cost Americans $2 trillion a year are written by unelected bureaucrats.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his office, Lee has two stacks of documents. The first is an 11-foot tall stack that consists of last year\u2019s Federal Register, which contains all of the federal rules and regulations. The other stack, which Lee said is a few inches tall and a few hundred pages, consists all of the laws that Congress passed last year.\n\nThe stacks of paper remind Lee that Congress is not defending its own ground and has actually created the laws that have given regulatory agencies massive rule-making power so that most of the laws, measured by volume and economic impact, \u201care not made by men and women of our own choosing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe worst thing about it is that you can\u2019t fire those people,\u201d Lee said of bureaucrats who are hard-working but not accountable to the electorate. \u201cThe voter can\u2019t fire them. The voters have a chance to fire Senators every six years and Congressman every two years if they make bad laws.\u201d\n\nLee said he is hopeful about restoring Constitutional principles with the REINS Act. The bill has passed the House in each of the last three years but has not come up for a vote in the Senate, which Lee hopes to rectify this year. He said the bill is a \u201crelatively simple start to a solution to this very big problem\u201d and neither a liberal nor conservative piece of legislation. Simply put, the REINS Act would ensure that any major rule that has the effect of a new law because it would have a major impact on the economy will not \u201ctake effect until Congress first enacts it into law.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s permanent political class, though, hates that idea, according to Lee, \u201cbecause they say there\u2019s no way Congress can possibly keep up with the amount of regulations that come out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat makes my head want to explode,\u201d Lee said.\n\nHe continued by pointing out that \u201cif what you\u2019re saying is that our laws are so complex that the people\u2019s Representatives can\u2019t keep up with them, then that\u2019s telling us something: Watch out\u2013you\u2019re on the high-road to tyranny.\u201d\n\nLee said that the \u201ctyranny of expertise\u201d or the \u201ctyranny of hyper-specialization\u201d only benefits the permanent political class because \u201ccomplexity is a subsidy that helps lobbyists and lawyers in D.C. get rich at the expense of everyone else.\u201d He pointed to Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, which he said contains \u201cscores if not hundreds of instances of de facto lawmaking authority to executive branch agencies.\u201d Lee said that just those two bills alone produced tens of thousands of pages of new regulations that serve as regressive backdoor taxes that end up hurting poorer Americans.\n\nThe Legislative Powers Clause is not the only part of the Constitution that has been neglected and marginalized.\n\nLee spoke about the importance of the Origination Clause, which he pointed out was central to the great Constitutional compromise thanks to Ben Franklin\u2019s genius. Though the Origination Clause states that Congress cannot raise taxes without having that proposal originating in the House of Representatives, Senate Democrats employed a bunch of legislative shenanigans to pass Obamacare by stripping the language out a bill that technically originated in the House and replacing it with the text of what would become the Obamacare bill.\n\nRegarding the Establishment Clause, Lee said the whole purpose of it was to\u201dmake sure we didn\u2019t end up with a national church.\u201d Lee said that even though the courts have distorted the Establishment Clause, there is not a single state in the union that would have an established religion today. He took offense at federal judges who are \u201cmicromanaging what public schools may allow in terms of speech regarding religion or the utterance of prayer in any public setting.\u201d According to Lee, the text and historic understanding of the Establishment Clause had \u201cnothing to do with restricting the states like this from the vantage point of the federal courts.\u201d\n\nLee also discussed the forgotten Fourth Amendment by telling the story of 18th century English parliamentarian John Wilkes, whose documents were seized after he criticized King George. Americans have the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable searches and seizures because of Wilkes\u2019s experiences, and Lee said that though \u201cprivacy is part of our security,\u201d the various national security surveillance laws were created to gather and monitor foreign intelligence and \u201cwere not intended to create this sweeping authority whereby [the federal government] could monitor the activity of law-abiding U.S. citizens on U.S. soil.\u201d Lee said the Fourth Amendment is threatened when the federal government can \u201ckeep track of everyone you\u2019ve called\u201d and hold \u201cgrandma\u2019s phone records for five years.\u201d\n\nRegarding the 10th Amendment, Lee said the Commerce Clause has been interpreted so broadly by the courts that \u201cthere is almost no limit to Congressional power\u2013and when there is no limit the meaning of the 10th Amendment is almost nil.\u201d He said there is this \u201cbig myth that if it\u2019s really important it needs to be done nationally when the opposite is true.\u201d\n\nLee also mentioned that Andrew Jackson, in the face of intense pressure, once vetoed a bill to fund a road because since the road in question \u201cstarts and ends entirely within the state,\u201d Congress did not have jurisdiction over it. He said the country needs more presidents like Jackson who are willing to veto bills they believe are unconstitutional.\n\nIn the end, Lee said the ideas and proposals in his book are \u201cneither conservative nor liberal,\u201d but \u201csimply American.\u201d He mentioned that the big-government bureaucracy has helped the permanent political class and their preferred army of experts but has \u201cnot helped the forgotten man and the little guy.\u201d He said the most compassionate way to help average, hardworking moms and dads in addition to the helping the poor get out of poverty and expanding the middle class is to govern as a constitutional conservative.\n\nAn excerpt from Lee\u2019s Our Lost Constitution: The Willful Subversion of America\u2019s Founding Document can be read here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mike Lee: Indispensable Constitutional Provisions Have Been Marginalized, Ignored for Too Long", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Mike Lee: Indispensable Constitutional Provisions Have Been Marginalized, Ignored for Too Long", "title": "Mike Lee: Indispensable Constitutional Provisions Have Been Marginalized, Ignored for Too Long - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Mike-Lee-AP-Constitution.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/13/mike-lee-indispensable-constitutional-provisions-have-been-marginalized-ignored-for-too-long/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mike Lee: Indispensable Constitutional Provisions Have Been Marginalized, Ignored for Too Long", "title": "Mike Lee: Indispensable Constitutional Provisions Have Been Marginalized, Ignored for Too Long - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/Mike-Lee-AP-Constitution.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-04-13T07:25:51-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04bd\"", "article_summary": "The Legislative Powers Clause is not the only part of the Constitution that has been neglected and marginalized.\nLee spoke about the importance of the Origination Clause, which he pointed out was central to the great Constitutional compromise thanks to Ben Franklin\u2019s genius.\n\u201cIf you follow those two, a lot of other things will fall into place,\u201d Lee said.\nThe other stack, which Lee said is a few inches tall and a few hundred pages, consists all of the laws that Congress passed last year.\nThe first is an 11-foot tall stack that consists of last year\u2019s Federal Register, which contains all of the federal rules and regulations."}
