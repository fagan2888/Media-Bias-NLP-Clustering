Being told what you can and can\u2019t eat or drink is one of the biggest gray areas, especially when new research is released every year revealing more advice or forewarning. Hopefully these five dismayed myths can help mommies-to-be with their diets throughout their pregnancy. Mental Floss did the research and came up with a list 10 pregnancy misconceptions and explained the truth with supported studies. Along with those, there are a few more you should keep in mind before you take your next sip or bite with that belly.\n\n6 Pregnancy Food & Drink Myths:\n\n1. Eating Sushi is Safe\n\nMost doctors actually recommend avoiding uncooked fish, and definitely uncooked meats, such as chicken. By eating them, your child runs the risk of developing a foodborne allergy. There are many sushi options featuring cooked foods or vegetables, which don\u2019t pose a threat to the mother or baby\u2019s health.\n\n2. Eating Fish is Okay\n\nMercury levels in shark, king mackerel, swordfish, tilefish, marlin, and certain types of tuna are dangerously high for pregnant women. However, salmon is low enough in mercury levels that it\u2019s safe to eat. Plus, it\u2019s full of healthy omega-3 fatty acid DHA and EPA, which have been shown to improve a baby\u2019s cognitive function.\n\n3. Coffee Can Cause Miscarriage or Preterm Birth\n\nUntil four years ago, your gynecologist or obstetrician would warn you of the health risks of drinking coffee while pregnant. Now, it\u2019s safe so long as it\u2019s within moderation. They found 200 milligrams of caffeine won\u2019t cause miscarriage or preterm birth, which is about one 12-ounce cup of coffee a day.\n\n4. Double Your Calories, You\u2019re Eating For Two\n\nA pregnant woman eats for two, but not two adults. The National Institute of Medicine recommends eating 340 extra calories in the second trimester and an additional 452 in the third trimester.\n\n5. You Can Drink Some Alcohol:\n\nNo, you can\u2019t. A handful of doctors will say it\u2019s okay to have a drink every once in a while. But there isn\u2019t enough research to definitively back that claim up, so why risk your baby\u2019s long-term health if it isn\u2019t proven safe? Most doctors recommend completely avoiding alcohol while there\u2019s still a developing baby inside of you. Because there are still so many unknowns, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Surgeon General, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Pediatrics advise pregnant women not to drink alcohol at all \u2014 not one sip.\n\n6. No More Cheese:\n\nUnpasteurized cheese products, such as Brie, feta, and goat cheese should be avoided because they can carry foodborne illnesses. But all you cheese lovera are in luck; you don\u2019t have to cut out all cheeses from your diet. There are some safe pasteurized options, such as cheddar and Swiss cheese. Just check the labels to make sure.\n\n7. Spicy Food Will Induce Labor:\n\nThree years ago researchers put this old wives' tale to rest through a study with over 200 pregnant women. They tried to induce their labor by eating spicy foods in their last trimester, but doctors concluded it did nothing to change the outcome of their due date.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "7, common, pregnancy, misconceptions, no, you, cant, induce, labor, spicy, food", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There are a lot of common misconceptions regarding pregnancy, and just as many practices that have become outdated.", "title": "7 Common Misconceptions About Pregnancy [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/7-common-pregnancy-misconceptions-no-you-cant-induce-labor-spicy-food-310940", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/16/pregnancy-food-and-drink-misconceptions-unlocked.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are a lot of common misconceptions regarding pregnancy, and just as many practices that have become outdated.", "title": "7 Common Misconceptions About Pregnancy [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/7-common-pregnancy-misconceptions-no-you-cant-induce-labor-spicy-food-310940", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/16/pregnancy-food-and-drink-misconceptions-unlocked.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/16/pregnancy-food-and-drink-misconceptions-unlocked.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-16T23:19:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T23:19:53-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There are a lot of common misconceptions regarding pregnancy, and just as many practices that have become outdated."}, "article_summary": "Spicy Food Will Induce Labor:Three years ago researchers put this old wives' tale to rest through a study with over 200 pregnant women.\nMental Floss did the research and came up with a list 10 pregnancy misconceptions and explained the truth with supported studies.\nThey tried to induce their labor by eating spicy foods in their last trimester, but doctors concluded it did nothing to change the outcome of their due date.\nEating Fish is OkayMercury levels in shark, king mackerel, swordfish, tilefish, marlin, and certain types of tuna are dangerously high for pregnant women.\nThere are a lot of common misconceptions regarding pregnancy, and just as many practices that have become outdated."}
