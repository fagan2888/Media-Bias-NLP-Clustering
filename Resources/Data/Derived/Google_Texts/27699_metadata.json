Resistance from different parts of the food industry means that its implementation kept getting pushed back. Now, the newest delay pushes the deadline into 2017, and the calorie counts would be implemented under the next president.\n\nThe FDA originally approved the requirements back in 2014, and it covers all sorts of food consumed outside of our homes, ranging from movie theater popcorn to pizzas. As long as the eatery has more than 20 outlets, it\u2019s required to post calorie counts. Only now, they don\u2019t have to do it until next year.\n\nOne way to weaken the bill (other than just hitting the regulatory snooze button on the requirement, which is what happened again here) was a bill that passed the House a few weeks ago, which would allow food companies to define \u201cserving\u201d for themselves when posting calorie counts.\n\nPizzas are a good example, since pizzerias have fought these laws the most: the original rule would require the calorie count for an entire pizza to be posted, since consumers buy an entire pizza and decide for ourselves how many servings to cut it into. (Admit it, you\u2019ve eaten an entire pizza by yourself before. At least a small one.)\n\nLetting companies decide on an arbitrary \u201cserving size\u201d sort of makes sense for a pizza, but makes less sense for other food items. Are you really going to share an extra-large soda between three people?\n\nPublic health advocates are annoyed that menus still haven\u2019t changed half a decade after the ACA passed. \u201cNot only is it simple and straightforward but so many states and localities have already done this,\u201d Margo Wootan of the Center for Science and the Public Interest told the Washington Post.\n\nIn some places, calorie counts are already a routine part of menus. In others, like California, they\u2019re officially law but the law hasn\u2019t been implemented while city or state governments wait for the federal version to be implemented.\n\nCalorie labels on menus delayed again \u2014 to next year [Washington Post]", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "application-name": "Consumerist", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Consumerist", "description": "A law requiring calorie counts to be posted for most food items that people eat outside of their homes was part of the Affordable Care Act, which passed in 2010.
