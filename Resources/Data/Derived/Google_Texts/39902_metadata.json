Greenfeld wrote, instead, that it was the the scientific community who had raised questions about McCarthy\u2019s claims:\n\nShe believes she did fix her boy. A psychological evaluation from UCLA\u2019s neuropsychiatric hospital, dated May 10, 2005, was \u201cconclusive for a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder,\u201d and yet here, running toward us on a warm California afternoon, is Evan, shouting out, \u201cAre you here to play with me? When are we going to play?\u201d McCarthy\u2019s boy is a vivacious, articulate and communicative child who seems to have beaten the condition. He is an inspiration, the fact of him as incontrovertible as any study done in any laboratory in the world. Or is this the truth? There are dark murmurings from scientists and doctors asking, Was her son ever really autistic? Evan\u2019s symptoms \u2014 heavy seizures, followed by marked improvement once the seizures were brought under control \u2014 are similar to those of Landau-Kleffner syndrome, a rare childhood neurological disorder that can also result in speech impairment and possible long-term neurological damage. Or, as other pediatricians have suggested, perhaps the miracle I have beheld is the quotidian miracle of childhood development: a delayed 2-year-old catching up by the time he is 7, a commonplace, routine occurrence, nothing more surprising than a short boy growing tall. It is enraging to the mother to hear that nothing was wrong with her boy \u2014 she held him during his seizures, saw his eyes roll up after he received his vaccines \u2014 and how can you say that she doesn\u2019t know what she knows?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The View\" co-host slams a new, \"exclusive\" report that mischaracterized a 2010 magazine story", "title": "Jenny McCarthy: Rumors that my son does not have autism are \u201cblatantly inaccurate and completely ridiculous\u201d", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/05/jenny_mccarthy_rumors_that_my_son_does_not_have_autism_are_blatantly_inaccurate_and_completely_ridiculous/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "\"The View\" co-host slams a new, \"exclusive\" report that mischaracterized a 2010 magazine story", "title": "Jenny McCarthy: Rumors that my son does not have autism are \u201cblatantly inaccurate and completely ridiculous\u201d"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The View\" co-host slams a new, \"exclusive\" report that mischaracterized a 2010 magazine story", "title": "Jenny McCarthy: Rumors that my son does not have autism are \u201cblatantly inaccurate and completely ridiculous\u201d", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@prachigu"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Autism, Gossip, Health, Jenny McCarthy, radaronline, The View, vaccines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc653\"", "article_summary": "When are we going to play?\u201d McCarthy\u2019s boy is a vivacious, articulate and communicative child who seems to have beaten the condition.\nTopics: Autism, Gossip, Health, Jenny McCarthy, radaronline, The View, vaccines, Entertainment News\u201cThe View\u201d co-host and anti-vaccine crusader Jenny McCarthy, who believes that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine gave her son autism, is squashing a new rumor that suggests her son Evan never even had the disorder.\nGreenfeld wrote, instead, that it was the the scientific community who had raised questions about McCarthy\u2019s claims:She believes she did fix her boy.\nHe is an inspiration, the fact of him as incontrovertible as any study done in any laboratory in the world.\nThe original TIME article by Karl Taro Greenfeld explored McCarthy\u2019s controversial stance on vaccines and her belief that home therapies cured her son of his autism, contrasted with reports from the medical community."}
