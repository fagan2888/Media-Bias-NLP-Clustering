He says while UnitedHealth isn't the biggest player on the exchanges, it is a large insurer \u2013 and it spent a lot of time and money backing ObamaCare.\n\n\"They are now probably the most prominent health insurer to, at the very least, say that they are considering leaving the ObamaCare exchanges,\" he explains. \"When you add that to all the other insurers that have left the exchanges \u2013 or in the case of the ObamaCare co-ops, have failed \u2013 what it shows is that basically a lot of the problems that ObamCare's critics said ... the exchanges were going to have, it's just more and more increasingly coming to fruition.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Hogberg thinks the implosion of ObamaCare is in slow motion.\n\n\"This is not something that's going to happen within a year, maybe even two years,\" he cautions. \"Even more alarmingly maybe on the horizon is the 30 Blue Cross Blue Shield non-profits that are on the various exchanges. Goldman Sachs did a report on them saying that they're losing money on the exchanges. You know, Blue Cross Blue Shield is a big player on the exchanges.\" (See related article)\n\nAccording to the Post's editorial board, it's time for Democrats to join Republicans in tossing around plans to replace ObamaCare. Otherwise, says the Post, they may \"get caught looking when the whole thing goes belly-up.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2015/11/24/analyst-obamacare-dying-a-slow-death", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935717/obamacare-ahead_800x500.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "An author and health policy analyst agrees with the opinion that ObamaCare is &quot;imploding.&quot;", "title": "Analyst: ObamaCare dying a slow death"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/media/5935717/obamacare-ahead_800x500.jpg", "description": "An author and health policy analyst agrees with the opinion that ObamaCare is &quot;imploding.&quot;", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analyst: ObamaCare dying a slow death"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "An author and health policy analyst agrees with the opinion that ObamaCare is \"imploding.\""}, "article_summary": "\"They are now probably the most prominent health insurer to, at the very least, say that they are considering leaving the ObamaCare exchanges,\" he explains.\n\"Even more alarmingly maybe on the horizon is the 30 Blue Cross Blue Shield non-profits that are on the various exchanges.\nYou know, Blue Cross Blue Shield is a big player on the exchanges.\"\n(See related article)According to the Post's editorial board, it's time for Democrats to join Republicans in tossing around plans to replace ObamaCare.\nMeanwhile, Hogberg thinks the implosion of ObamaCare is in slow motion."}
