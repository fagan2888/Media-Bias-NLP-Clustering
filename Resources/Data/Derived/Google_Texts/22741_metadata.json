(AP Photo)\n\nThe biggest victory for taxpayers in the Obamacare fight so far was the enactment in late 2014 of language prohibiting the Risk Corridor program from being transformed into an open-ended bailout for big insurance companies. Unfortunately that language is now being sidestepped by a scheme in which the Obama administration invited the big insurance companies to sue the government, which in turn is likely to take a dive on the lawsuit and then make the bailout payments anyway. It\u2019s outrageous and must be stopped.\n\nAt the time Congress debated the funding restriction, both the Congressional Budget Office and the White House Office of Management and Budget agreed that the provision neither spent nor saved any taxpayer money. That was because the administration maintained the program would, as Obamacare supporters had always claimed, be run in a budget-neutral fashion, paying out to insurance companies only what the program itself had already collected from other insurance companies.\n\nCongress thought it was important to cement this budget-neutrality promise into statute, just in case.\n\nShortly after they did it became clear that, contrary to the administration\u2019s claims, if Congress had not acted the program would have been transformed into a massive multi-billion dollar bailout.\n\nThe language enacted into law was crystal clear, prohibiting Risk Corridor payment from any of the sources of funds available to the Department of Health and Human Services other than program revenues. The accompanying committee report said:\n\n\u201cIn 2014, HHS issued a regulation stating that the risk corridor program will be budget neutral, meaning that the federal government will never pay out more than it collects from issuers over the three year period risk corridors are in effect. The agreement includes new bill language to prevent the CMS Program Management appropriation account from being used to support risk corridors payments.\u201d\n\nSo taxpayers won? Not quite.\n\nThe Obama administration issued a memorandum stating that \u2013 contrary to the clear intent of the duly-enacted funding restriction, the administration\u2019s repeated promises, and HHS\u2019s own regulation \u2013 they considered insurance companies to be legally owed bailout payments from the risk corridor program far in excess of program revenues.\n\n\u201cHHS recognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to Issuers,\u201d announced an unsigned memo from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency inside HHS that oversees Obamacare. The memo had to be approved by the interim administrator of CMS, a longtime UnitedHealth Group executive vice president, Andy Slavitt, who United paid millions on his way into government. Obama gave him an ethics waiver to oversee his previous employer \u2013 and shovel bailout bucks their way.\n\nTaking the hint, the insurance industry filed the $5 billion class action lawsuit Health Republic Insurance Company v. the United States that is now pending in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The government\u2019s response brief is due by June 24.\n\nAt stake is $5 billion that taxpayers could potentially be forced to pay wealthy insurance companies who are already minting a fortune from a law that forces most Americans to buy their product or pay a hefty penalty tax.\n\nAlso on the line is a fundamental principle of the Constitution: Congress\u2019s power of the purse.\n\nIf Congress can enact language to prevent payments from being made and an administration can scheme its way around it by inviting a lawsuit, then no funding restriction is worth the paper it\u2019s printed on. The power of the purse is a dead letter and Congress is written out of the Constitution.\n\nMembers of Congress must not allow that to happen. They need to pursue every possible action \u2013 from an aggressive media offensive to shame the administration and insurance companies, to a legal move to intervene in the lawsuit, to new, bulletproof appropriations language that prohibits any payment out of the Judgment Fund, the mechanism that would be used for a legal settlement. Their fundamental institutional power is at stake \u2013 along with a lot of taxpayer money.\n\nPhil Kerpen is head of American Commitment and a leading free-market policy analyst and advocate in Washington.
