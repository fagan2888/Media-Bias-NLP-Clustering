A ruling is expected by the end of June.\n\nCBO expects 12 million people to enroll in private coverage this year and 21 million in 2016, vs. an earlier forecast of 13 million and 24 million, respectively.\n\nCBO also expects private enrollment to fluctuate between 24 million and 25 million people each year beginning in 2017, fewer than the previous forecast that called for enrollment to stay steady at 25 million.\n\nEven with slower enrollment in private insurance, CBO said higher-than-expected enrollment in the Medicaid program for the poor would help Obamacare reduce the number of uninsured Americans by 19 million this year and by 24 million to 27 million people each year from 2016 onwards.\n\nMedicaid would cost the federal government $59 billion more than expected over the next 10 years as a result of higher enrollment under Obamacare, CBO said.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan;
