Right? Well, not if you are Rep. Jason Villalba (144-Dallas). It seems that Rep. Villalba, in an attempt to please \u201cthe good men and women in blue\u201d, has decided that the First and Second Amendments need to be tossed aside. This from Brett Sanders at BrettSanders.me:\n\nThe bill he is referring to is HB2918.\n\nIn typical Villalba fashion he is not backing down and is unapologetic for his attempt to suppress free speech and gun rights. I find it very interesting that he targets concealed carry permit owners, statistically one of the least criminal groups you can find. Villalba wants you to move 25 feet away from an officer to film but if you are legally carrying a concealed weapon, he wants you 100 feet away. Both are egregious violations of our rights, I\u2019m just curious why he doesn\u2019t like concealed permit owners.\n\nCheck his Twitter feed and Facebook account for his reactions. Here is one from Facebook:\n\nHow does MQS end up in this thing? This isn\u2019t something on his radar. I swear, the reason MQS has so much perceived power is because people like Villalba give it to them.\n\nOr this from Twitter:\n\nOkay, so he\u2019s a \u201cmacho man\u201d and ready to take on all comers. For what? To protect LEO\u2019s? No, to protect BAD LEO\u2019s. You know, the guys that beat people senseless, plant evidence, or kill unarmed citizens. The rest of the law enforcement community, you know, the 90% of LEO\u2019s that do the right thing, don\u2019t need to restrict freedom, liberty, speech, or the 2nd Amendment.\n\nClearly, Villalba want to be elected to a statewide office. Recall his visits around the state in the past two years. He even made a visit to my favorite club, the Downtown Houston Pachyderm Club. And I gave him a glowing review. I like people that speak their mind, even when I disagree with what they are trying to do.\n\nWould this be a deal killer for me if he were to run for statewide office? Not necessarily but it wouldn\u2019t help persuade me to vote for him.\n\nI have complete confidence that this bill is going nowhere. Villalba may be a supporter of Speaker Straus but there is no way that the Speaker is going to lend his support to this bill. Notice that he doesn\u2019t have a single co-author that he could muster up. So for all practical purposes, the bill was dead on arrival. Perhaps that was his intent \u2013 mollify the person or group that convinced him to file this all the while knowing it wouldn\u2019t be passed. He might even think that was a smart move.\n\nBut you know what? People have memories, especially when you are going out of your way to defend the indefensible. See you down the road, Rep. Villalba.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dallas area Rep.
