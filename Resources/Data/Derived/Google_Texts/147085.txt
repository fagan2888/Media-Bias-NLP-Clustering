LONGMONT, Colo. (AP) — A Colorado city has to come up with hundreds of thousands of dollars for a bill connected with two delayed business projects.

The Times-Call reports (http://bit.ly/22dAXsl) Longmont is financing $27.5 million in public improvements for a new shopping center that will house Whole Foods and Sam’s Club. Both businesses pushed store openings to 2016.

City staff had been counting on sales tax revenue from the two anchor stores as well as Regal Cinemas to make a June interest payment of more than $636,000 on certificates used to raise the $27.5 million.

The city council on Tuesday will hear an option to include property tax revenue among its sources to pay the bill.

Longmont’s finance director is confident the city will be able to make future payments after the stores open.
