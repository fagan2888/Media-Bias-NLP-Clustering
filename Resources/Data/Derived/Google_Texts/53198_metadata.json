The White House relaxes another ObamaCare rule\n\nThe Obama administration said late Thursday that millions of people whose health insurance is being canceled because it doesn't comply with the Affordable Care Act will be exempt from penalties if they go without coverage next year. They can also buy catastrophic coverage instead of policies meeting the law's minimum requirements. The move is the latest part of President Obama's effort to address complaints as the law takes effect.

New Mexico's top court says gay marriage is legal\n\nNew Mexico's Supreme Court ruled Thursday to allow same-sex marriage in the state. The unanimous decision makes New Mexico the 17th state to legalize gay marriage, and clears up confusion that allowed a patchwork system in which some New Mexico counties permitted gay and lesbian couples to marry, and others didn't. The court said barring gay marriage was unlawful discrimination based on sexual orientation.

Obama reduces punishment for crack cocaine offenders\n\nPresident Obama on Thursday commuted the sentences of eight people serving harsh prison terms for crack cocaine convictions. The prisoners were serving stiffer sentences under old federal guidelines that treated crack offenses more severely than those for powder cocaine. Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010 to make the penalties fairer, but this marks his most aggressive use of presidential authority to free inmates.

Boitano comes out as he joins U.S. Olympic delegation\n\nGold-medal-winning figure skater Brian Boitano announced Thursday that he is gay, two days after President Obama named him to the U.S. delegation to the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Boitano is the third gay delegation member, along with former tennis great Billie Jean King and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. The makeup of the group is seen as a message of tolerance to Russia, which approved a controversial anti-gay law this year.

NYC bans e-cigarettes in public spaces\n\nNew York's City Council voted Thursday to ban electronic cigarettes in indoor public areas where smokers are prohibited from lighting up regular cigarettes. The e-cigarette ban is similar to policies for bars and restaurants in Utah, North Dakota, and New Jersey.

Detroit's art collection could be worth $867 million\n\nDetroit may be broke, but Christie's auction house says the city's art collection is worth $454 million to $867 million. A single van Gogh among the works at the Detroit Institute of Arts was valued at $150 million. The appraisal was ordered after Detroit declared bankruptcy last summer. The city won't solve its financial troubles with an auction, though. It has a debt load of $18 billion.
