Rand Paul says that politicians and taxes are to blame for the police chokehold death of Eric Garner.\n\n\u201cObviously, the individual circumstances are important, but I think it\u2019s also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes, so they\u2019ve driven cigarettes underground by making them so expensive,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball with Chris Matthews.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe continued, \u201cBut then some politician also had to direct the police to say, \u2018Hey, we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette.\u2019\u201d\n\n( POLITICO Magazine: What I Did After Police Killed My Son)\n\nA New York City grand jury decided Wednesday not to return an indictment in the July death of Garner. The 43-year-old father of six died after being placed in a chokehold by a city police officer who was arresting him on suspicion of selling untaxed cigarettes. The grand jury\u2019s decision sparked protests in New York City and an announcement from Attorney General Eric Holder that the Justice Department is launching as separate federal investigation into Garner\u2019s death.\n\nPaul said police are put in \u201ca difficult situation,\u201d but added there is \u201cno excuse\u201d for Garner\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cFor someone to die over breaking that law, there really is no excuse for it,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I do blame the politicians.
