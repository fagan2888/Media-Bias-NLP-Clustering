Louise Green, founder of Body Exchange Lifestyles and fitness ambassador to the plus size community, knows it\u2019s possible for women and men to be an athlete at any size \u2014 so she\u2019ll bridge this gap herself.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back: Green founded Body Exchange in 2008 after she realized through her personal journey that the needs of the plus size community weren\u2019t being met by many service providers. This has to do with the idea people can\u2019t be both fit and obese. However, some studies would disagree.\n\nA study published in the European Heart Journal found overweight and obese people were at no greater risk for developing or dying from heart disease or cancer than normal weight people, as long was they were considered medically fit. Upworthy cited additional research that found walking an average of 30 minutes a day for five days a week qualifies a person as fit.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect Green\u2019s forthcoming Body Exchange Home Connection DVD series to be, well, a series of walking workouts. While this is an effective form of exercise, Green firmly believes fitness and adventure are the vehicle to a healthy, fulfilled lifestyle. And to make sure every person can benefit from the DVD, it starts off in a sitting position. Gradually, as the viewer feels more comfortable, they can progress to standing and increasing their range of motion.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a fitness video,\u201d Green said. \u201cThis is a fitness revolution.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "plus, size, women, can, be, fit, too, body, exhange, dvds, aim, revolutionize, plus, size, fitness", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Fitness DVDs exclude the plus size community despite the fact athletes come in every shape and size.
