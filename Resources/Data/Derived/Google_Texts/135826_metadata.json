He has experience on U.S. national teams going back to 2002, and he welcomed the chance to take a leadership role in his second Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special thing to be named captain of any team, but when it\u2019s a national team, an Olympic team, it\u2019s extra special,\u201d Parise said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of players who are great leaders. I\u2019m going to get a lot of help. I\u2019m going to need a lot of help. It\u2019s very humbling.\u201d\n\nU.S. coach Dan Bylsma said Parise\u2019s work ethic and no-nonsense playing style are exemplary of the attitude he wants for his team. The Americans aren\u2019t considered a gold-medal favorite, but a roster packed with NHL star power is expected to keep them in contention.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a team that\u2019s got a blue-collar mentality, and Zach embodies that,\u201d said Bylsma, also the coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins. \u201cEvery time we play against Zach Parise, there has been a work ethic, a never-quit, a determination, an abrasiveness about a hard-to-play-against type of player. And it\u2019s every time regardless of the score (or) the situation our respective teams might be in. That is exactly how we want our team to play.\u201d\n\nParise\u2019s alternate captains have extensive leadership experience as well. Brown and Suter were both alternate captains to Jamie Langenbrunner on the U.S. team at the Vancouver Olympics.\n\nBrown is the longtime captain of the Kings and an international veteran, while Suter and Parise are both alternate captains of the Wild. Suter\u2019s father, Bob, won a gold medal with the \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d team in 1980.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of guys that wear letters with their own teams, so I don\u2019t think our team is going to be lacking in leadership at all,\u201d Parise said. \u201cThere are plenty of guys that are capable of doing that.\u201d\n\nThe American team will hold its first practice in Sochi late on Feb. 10. Most players won\u2019t arrive until a few hours earlier, after the NHL begins its schedule break.\n\nParise acknowledged the unique challenges of the Sochi Olympics, including the players\u2019 adjustment to a hefty time change in just a few days before their first game against Slovakia on Feb. 13. He also recognized security concerns around the Olympics, calling it \u201cunfortunate\u201d that security \u201chas dominated a lot of the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to put your trust in the Russian police and the security we\u2019re sending over there as well,\u201d Parise said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be in good hands. We can just relax, focus and concentrate on playing hockey.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild will be the captain of the U.S. men's hockey team at the Sochi Olympics.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild will be the captain of the U.S. men\u2019s hockey team at the Sochi Olympics.", "title": "Sochi Olympics:  Minnesota\u2019s Zach Parise named captain of U.S. men\u2019s hockey team", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/feb/1/sochi-olympics-minnesotas-zach-parise-named-captai/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/31/us-captain-olympics-ice-hockeyjpeg-0cee4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/31/us-captain-olympics-ice-hockeyjpeg-0cee4.jpg", "description": "Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild will be the captain of the U.S. men's hockey team at the Sochi Olympics.", "card": "summary", "title": "Sochi Olympics:  Minnesota\u2019s Zach Parise named captain of U.S. m"}, "Author": "Greg Beacham", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Zach Parise, Olympic Games, Ryan Suter, Dustin Brown"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc73c\"", "article_summary": "Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild will be the captain of the U.S. men\u2019s hockey team at the Sochi Olympics.\nThe 29-year-old Parise was an alternate captain at the Vancouver Olympics four years ago, scoring the goal that sent the gold-medal game into overtime.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a special thing to be named captain of any team, but when it\u2019s a national team, an Olympic team, it\u2019s extra special,\u201d Parise said.\nHe has experience on U.S. national teams going back to 2002, and he welcomed the chance to take a leadership role in his second Olympics.\n\u201cEvery time we play against Zach Parise, there has been a work ethic, a never-quit, a determination, an abrasiveness about a hard-to-play-against type of player."}
