Frank Wolf, who is retiring at the end of this year after having served 17 terms in Congress.\n\nVirginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District covers the northern tip of Virginia ranging from the inner suburbs to the West Virginia line, and Democrats believe Mr. Wolf\u2019s retirement offers them one of their best chances to pick up a GOP-held seat.\n\nMrs. Comstock said she is \u201cproud\u201d of her investigative work in the controversy that became known as Travelgate, which resulted in a handful of employees in the White House travel office being fired. The former chief of the travel office was indicted on embezzlement charges but exonerated, and five of the fired employees were reinstated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of that work and it was work that I started doing with Congressman Wolf at his behest,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also pointed to work she did in the state General Assembly to boost the tech-heavy region\u2019s data centers and telecommuting as proof of her problem-solving acumen.\n\n\u201cI am the only one here who\u2019s actually passed legislation and gotten bipartisan results,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get people back to work, and I know how to do that because that\u2019s what I spent a career doing.\u201d\n\nThe hourlong debate touched on a range of issues, including jobs, education, taxes, energy and immigration \u2014 the last generating one of the debate\u2019s more memorable lines.\n\nMr. Foust said he supports a broad immigration bill passed by the U.S. Senate last year that would provide an eventual path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country. Mrs. Comstock said she favors a step-by-step approach with an emphasis on securing the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cFedEx can track packages coming in here all the time \u2014 we can track people who are coming into the country, and we can do it right,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Foust repeatedly criticized Mrs. Comstock\u2019s vote against a $3.5 billion transportation package passed by the legislature in 2013 that he described as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the traffic-clogged region.\n\nShe acknowledged the vote was a \u201ctough call,\u201d but said she opposed it because Northern Virginia was disproportionately affected by the taxes in the bill. She pledged to help fix the region\u2019s transportation problems going forward.\n\nOn the politically sensitive issue of Obamacare, Mr. Foust said he would not support a full repeal, arguing that while the law is not perfect, the issue of heath care cannot be returned to the insurance companies.\n\nMrs. Comstock said \u201cwe need to start over\u201d on the law, but said there is a way to preserve some of its benefits \u2014 like coverage of pre-existing conditions and allowing children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans \u2014 without a wholesale overhaul of the entire system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrat John Foust accused Republican Barbara Comstock of being too partisan to represent Northern Virginia as the two squared off in a debate Wednesday in one of the most expensive and closely watched House races this year.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Democrat John Foust accused Republican Barbara Comstock of being too partisan to represent Northern Virginia as the two squared off in a debate Wednesday in one of the most expensive and closely watched House races this year.", "title": "Virginia\u2019s John Foust, Barbara Comstock debate partisanship in House race", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/24/virginias-john-foust-barbara-comstock-debate-parti/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/21/wt200810453358750ar.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/11/21/wt200810453358750ar.jpg", "description": "Democrat John Foust accused Republican Barbara Comstock of being too partisan to represent Northern Virginia as the two squared off in a debate Wednesday in one of the most expensive and closely watch", "card": "summary", "title": "Virginia\u2019s John Foust, Barbara Comstock debate partisanship in H"}, "Author": "David Sherfinski", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Barbara Comstock, John Foust, Frank Rudolph Wolf"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Foust said Mrs. Comstock, a delegate in the Virginia House, established an \u201cextraordinary history of partisanship\u201d for her work on the U.S. House committee that investigated President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.\n\u201cThese are not the types of people that are going to go to Washington and solve our problems,\u201d Mr. Foust said.\nMrs. Comstock said she favors a step-by-step approach with an emphasis on securing the U.S.-Mexico border.\nDemocrat John Foust accused Republican Barbara Comstock of being too partisan to represent Northern Virginia, as the two squared off in a debate Wednesday in one of the most expensive and closely-watched House races of 2014.\nShe acknowledged the vote was a \u201ctough call,\u201d but said she opposed it because Northern Virginia was disproportionately affected by the taxes in the bill."}
