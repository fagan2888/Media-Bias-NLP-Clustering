Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, \u201chas attracted a surprisingly large field of opponents for an incumbent who has not been touched by scandal,\u201d said Charles Bullock, University of Georgia political science professor.\n\n\u201cI suspect that the challengers have come forward because of disappointment in Collins\u2019 voting record, which includes supporting John Boehner for (House) speaker in 2015 and some budget legislation.\u201d\n\nSuch votes have fueled attacks on Collins by his challengers, especially two who have strong Lanier Tea Party Patriots ties, Mike Scupin and Roger Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe 9th District, which covers Northeast Georgia, is a GOP bastion, and its conservative politics \u201ccould also explain why the tea party remains a factor, even as it fades elsewhere,\u201d Bullock said.\n\nCollins, who is in his second two-year term, also faces opposition from a retired military officer, Bernard Fontaine, who was defeated in the 2014 GOP primary for Collins\u2019 seat; and physician and former U.S. Rep. Paul Broun.\n\n\u201cWith four opponents ... a runoff is not out of the question,\u201d Bullock said.\n\nA runoff, if needed, would be July 26.\n\nBullock said Broun\u2019s name recognition should help his cause and that he \u201cprobably has friends who will help with his campaign, and this will increase his vote share.\u201d\n\nEd Asbridge, president of the South Hall Republican Club, said the large number of GOP candidates isn\u2019t unusual for seats in Hall County. He cited, as an example, five candidates who ran for sheriff in 2014. That was an open seat, the victor trying to succeed outgoing Sheriff Steve Cronic. Gerald Couch eventually prevailed after a runoff with Jeff Strickland.\n\nCouch now faces no opposition in the May primary or the November election.\n\nAlso, the field looked like it would get crowded in the race for the 9th District in 2012, but two of the five candidates who had previously announced their candidacy did not qualify.\n\nThe race came down to Collins, Fitzpatrick and Martha Zoller, with an eventual runoff between Collins and Zoller.\n\nStill, \u201cI think it is unusual to have (a lot of) candidates against an incumbent,\u201d Asbridge said.\n\nAs far as whether he believes a runoff will happen in this year\u2019s 9th District race, he said, \u201cI think it will be close. It\u2019s really hard to say ... I don\u2019t have a feel (there).\u201d\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t taken any polls that I can base anything on other than my gut feeling,\u201d Asbridge said.\n\nAlso, it seems \u201cDoug Collins has been campaigning against Paul Broun as much as he\u2019s been campaigning for Doug Collins,\u201d Asbridge said.\n\nThere were minor clashes between Collins and Broun at a May 9 townhall forum featuring all five candidates. The most tense moment came when the federal omnibus bill, which fully funded Planned Parenthood, was mentioned in a question by one of the audience members.\n\n\u201cIf you would have gotten Planned Parenthood out of the omnibus, then you would have done it, but you couldn\u2019t,\u201d Collins said.\n\nBefore he could explain further, he was loudly booed by several audience members. The audience reaction drew a sharp response from Fitzpatrick.\n\n\u201cShow some respect, please,\u201d he said.\n\nOne thing the candidates seemed almost in harmony in at the debate was their disdain for several federal agencies, such as the IRS, and the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cNone of those objectives will be achieved in the foreseeable future, regardless of who wins (this) week,\u201d Bullock said.\n\nElimination of the health care act, for example, would require a Republican president, Republican majority in the U.S. House and at least 60 Republican senators.\n\nAnd it\u2019s promises falling flat that fuel further distrust in the system, Bullock said.\n\n\u201cA consequence of candidates campaigning with promises of achieving unattainable goals is that constituents become further disillusioned when their choice wins but fails to deliver on the promises,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/section/6/article/117075/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/facebook_share_images/gainesville/020216thetimesogimgoptimzed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The 2014 election wasn\u2019t complicated, with two Republican candidates and one Democrat.", "title": "Political observers surprised to see large field in 9th District House race"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Political observers surprised to see large field in 9th District House race"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b8e\"", "article_summary": "As far as whether he believes a runoff will happen in this year\u2019s 9th District race, he said, \u201cI think it will be close.\nAlso, it seems \u201cDoug Collins has been campaigning against Paul Broun as much as he\u2019s been campaigning for Doug Collins,\u201d Asbridge said.\nThis time around, interest in the 9th District U.S. House seat has exploded, at least in the GOP, with Democrat waiting in the wings past Tuesday\u2019s primary.\nThe 2014 election wasn\u2019t complicated, with two Republican candidates and one Democrat.\nAlso, the field looked like it would get crowded in the race for the 9th District in 2012, but two of the five candidates who had previously announced their candidacy did not qualify."}
