Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig scored the best marks for effectiveness in a review of research on commercial diet programs, but many other plans just haven\u2019t been studied enough to evaluate long-term results.\n\nThe two plans are among the most popular and had the best evidence that dieters could lose meaningful amounts of weight and keep it off for at least a year, the review authors said.\n\nPooling results from several studies, the researchers found that Weight Watchers dieters lost an average of at least 8 pounds and kept it off for at least 12 months versus about 15 pounds for those using the Jenny Craig plan.\n\nLinks Weight Watchers welcome.weightwatchers.com Jenny Craig jennycraig.com\n\nMost participants remained overweight, with weight loss of between 3 percent and 5 percent of their initial weight \u2014 but that\u2019s a range that doctors typically recommend to achieve healthful benefits including lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really important first step to reach,\u201d even if it doesn\u2019t meet patients\u2019 expectations, said study author Dr. Kimberly Gudzune, an internist and researcher at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s medical school.\n\nThe study was published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nThe research review included 39 rigorous studies involving 11 popular diet programs that include support or counseling services and involve fees for products or services. Most studies compared the programs with standard diet information or behavioral counseling patients get from health care providers; long-term results for Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig were mostly better than the comparisons.\n\nThe researchers didn\u2019t attempt to make head-to-head comparisons of different diet plans. They note that the Affordable Care Act makes obesity screening and counseling more accessible to many Americans, and that with two-thirds of U.S. adults overweight or obese, it\u2019s important for doctors to know which diet plans work.\n\nDiet companies had no role in the research, Gudzune said.\n\nWeight Watchers and Jenny Craig include behavioral counseling, coaching or social support \u2014 important for long-term weight-loss success, according to an Annals editorial.\n\nWeight Watchers costs about $43 monthly, which includes costs for attending online or in-person support groups or coaching sessions. Participants can buy the company\u2019s low-calorie products or buy their own food, but each item is assigned points and dieters aim not to exceed a daily point limit.\n\nJenny Craig provides pre-made meals and costs about $600 monthly.\n\nMichele Rouse, an administrative coordinator at Johns Hopkins\u2019 medical school who used to work for Gudzune, said she had lost seven pounds since starting on Weight Watchers a month earlier and had already seen a drop in her elevated blood pressure. Rouse said she didn\u2019t know much about the new study and picked Weight Watchers because she\u2019d had success with it years ago.\n\nIt\u2019s too soon to tell whether the program will help her reach her 70-pound weight-loss goal, but Rouse said it\u2019s a sensible plan that\u2019s more like a lifestyle change than a harsh diet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not starving yourself,\u201d said Rouse, 49.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A summary of 39 scientific studies involving 11 popular diet plans singled out Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig as most effective.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "A summary of 39 scientific studies involving 11 popular diet plans singled out Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig as most effective.", "title": "Which commercial diet plans work best?
