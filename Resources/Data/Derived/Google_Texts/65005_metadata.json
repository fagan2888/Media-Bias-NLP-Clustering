Bill Cassidy made sure to bring up at every campaign stop last fall.\n\nThe first was the pitfalls of Obamacare. This was to be expected. Obamacare was a centerpiece of Republican campaigns across the country, and Cassidy - a doctor that has catered to the uninsured - could talk about the subject with some authority.\n\nThe second topic was a bit more personal: his wife, Laura.\n\n\"My wife is incredibly talented. Anyone who has ever met her knows that,\" Cassidy mentioned to the crowd during an appearance in Baton Rouge with John McCain in October.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Cassidy made a detour from his normal talking points and pointed to Laura standing at the back of the room during St. Tammany Tea Party rally. He enthusiastically told the crowd that she was not only a retired surgeon, but also his best friend.\n\nLaura is nearly perfect, Cassidy said, except for the pesky fact that she is an Alabama fan.\n\nThis is a common joke for Cassidy. Laura grew up in Mobile and attended the University of Alabama for college and medical school. Cassidy went to LSU.\n\n\"Most prominently, she roots for Alabama and I root for LSU,\" answers Cassidy, when asked about disagreements he and his wife might have.\n\nStill, Bill and Laura Cassidy see eye to eye on nearly everything else, so much so that their friends referred to them as a \"nearly perfect\" couple.\n\nIf there is one dominant influence is Louisiana's newest Senator's life, it is his wife. She - more than anyone else - has his ear. When Louisiana elected Bill, the state most certainly got a two-for-one deal, friends and political observers said.\n\nThey are known for their close relationship, a strong bond that has lasted almost three decades of marriage. Bill and Laura can frequently be spotted rounding the bends of the LSU lakes in the morning - their home looks out onto one of the lakes - chattering away to each other as if they were still dating.\n\n\"She knows exactly how I think. I think I know what she brings to the table. We are partners,\" Bill Cassidy said. \"I would not have run for Senate if it had not been a mutual decision.\"\n\nThe couple announced Bill's statewide campaign by appearing together in a video -- speaking for almost equal amounts of time about a joint public policy agenda. Bill consults Laura, on almost all personal and political decisions.\n\n\"All the political advisers he had, they were terrific. They really were, but Laura, in the final analysis, is always the one that could get the message through to Bill,\" said Richard Lipsey, a Cassidy family friend and political donor.\n\nA meeting in Los Angeles\n\nBill Cassidy and Laura Layton met in the 1980s when they were completing their medical residencies in Los Angeles. The two found each other at a Bible study for doctors and nurses, though they were training at different hospitals in different disciplines.\n\nBill would eventually become a gastroenterologist, and Laura would train as a surgeon, one of medicine's most demanding fields. As a child, Laura had wanted to follow in her father's footsteps and become a lawyer. But her dad, a judge in Alabama, pushed her to consider medical school. She was particularly talented at science and math.\n\n\"She was a rare species. There were not very many females involved in surgery at that time,\" said Stan Klein, a UCLA surgeon who oversaw Laura in her residency.\n\nIn the end, Laura's father may have known her better than she knew herself. Driven and confident in her own abilities, colleagues said Laura has a classic surgeon's temperament.\n\nDisciplined and organized were two traits that friends and colleagues consistently use to describe her. During the early part of her residency, Laura fit exercise into her long days by running several miles to the hospital and back, instead of driving to work in a car.\n\nKlein recalled her having a stronger personality than Bill when the two first started dating. Laura was always outspoken, whereas Bill came across as more contemplative. Then again, surgeons tend to be opinionated, he said.\n\n\"She's always been a leader - wanting to be a step ahead and wanting to show people what to do. She was always gracious by doing it though,\" Klein said.\n\nDuring her residency, Laura worked at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, a facility the shared many qualities with the old Charity Hospital in New Orleans. It primarily serves people who are poor and uninsured, and is certainly is not the right environment for every medical resident. The work there is particularly stressful, but Laura thrived.\n\n\"This hospital was like the perfect place for her because it is for the medically underserved. It is more work. It is more demanding. There are endless streams of patients to deal with,\" said Klein.\n\nBoth Cassidys, as doctors, took an interest in serving the poor, in big part because of their faith. Laura, Bill and their children attend The Chapel on LSU's campus in Baton Rouge. It's a nondenominational Christian Church popular with Louisiana political figures, including several members of Gov. Bobby Jindal's staff.\n\nLaura has traveled to Kenya, Ivory Coast and Swaziland to provide medical assistance. When they moved to Baton Rouge in 1990, both Cassidys took jobs at Earl K. Long, the public hospital that treated the poor and uninsured in town. The couple felt called, as Christians, to serve people who are less fortunate.\n\n\"We share our faith. We share a belief about the importance faith should play in our lives,\" said Bill Cassidy in an interview about his wife.\n\nBill lasted longer than Laura at Earl K. Long however. Laura rose to chief of surgery at the public hospital, but decided to move on to private practice after a couple of years. Colleagues said Laura was frustrated the hospital wasn't willing to make some changes to help its trauma department run smoothly. In an interview, she said she wanted more stable hours, particularly as the Cassidys prepared to have children.\n\n\"I didn't see myself, for the rest of my life, getting up at 2 a.m. and treating gunshot wounds and stab wounds,\" said Laura about leaving Earl K. Long.\n\nWhen she left, Laura moved into breast cancer surgery (while Bill stayed at Earl K. Long until the hospital closed in 2013.) She had a popular and busy practice until she retired about seven years ago. Laura was -- for a time -- one of the only female surgeons of any kind in the area, and the only one to work on breast cancer operations.\n\n\"She was the favorite doctor for women who needed to have breast surgery at the time,\" said Roberta Madden, a former patient who then enlisted Laura to help make breast cancer screenings more accessible to low-income women in Baton Rouge. The Cassidys helped her set up a program with the YWCA that offering affordable mammograms.\n\nWhile Laura isn't inclined to brag about herself, many agree her practice was highly regarded around Baton Rouge. When her husband first ran for state Senate in 2006, women gave him a warm reception, due to the good experience they or their family members had with Laura.\n\n\"People would meet me and say, 'Oh, you're HER husband. Oh, of course, I'll talk to you,'' Cassidy said.\n\nLaura retired and sold her practice around the same time Bill ran for his first public office in the Louisiana Legislature, but she says the two events are a coincidence. She had developed arthritis in her shoulder that made it difficult for her to perform surgery.\n\n\"I used to work 12 to 14 hours per day and I loved it,\" said Laura, \"Everything you do as a surgeon is looking down. I did that for a long time. Eventually, it catches up with you.\"\n\nStill, with her medical practice out of the way, Laura did have more time to devote to political life. Bill ran his first campaign in 2006, though the couple had been considering public office for years. With her demanding career off the table and slightly older children, they had the time to make it happen.\n\nEntering public life\n\nBill and Laura first dipped their toe in the politics waters back in 1992, when they took a course for doctors interested in politics sponsored by the American Medical Association. At the conference, the participants were divided up into groups for mock elections - with each person being assigned a different role. Bill was selected to be candidate. Laura, who was in the same group as Bill, was his campaign finance director.\n\n\"I'm good with numbers,\" she said.\n\nThe couple went to the conference because Bill was already thinking of running for public office, even though they waited for another 14 years to launch a campaign. Both Bill and Laura had busy medical careers. They were about to start a family and decided it wasn't the right time.\n\nInstead, they threw themselves into community service and work with their church. They taught Sunday school for awhile and Laura started attending regular Bible studies a few years ago.\n\nWhen Bill eventually launched his career for public office though, in 2006, Laura was right beside him. Friends say she was involved in picking staff and rejected campaign strategies that she didn't find comfortable.\n\n\"I think before Bill would do anything critical, he would talk to Laura because he trusts her implicitly. Laura is not the type of person who is going to give him an offhand opinion. She will have researched it and given him the facts. She will have formed an opinion of her own,\" Lipsey said.\n\nLaura is thought to have better political instincts than Bill and can be very protective of her husband. The new Senator can be long-winded in speeches and go off on tangents in one-on-one conversations. He also inherently trusts people (even reporters), whereas Laura is a bit more skeptical of people's intentions. She is far more reserved when she first meets someone.\n\n\"Laura is always right behind Bill - pushing Bill, but keeping Bill informed about what he should and should not be doing,\" Lipsey said.\n\nIf Laura thinks Bill is talking too much or revealing things he shouldn't - let's say to a reporter - she often gently pulls him away or redirects the conversation. At campaign fundraisers, Laura's been known to whisper suggestions into Bill's ear. She'll also keep him moving through a crowd, making sure he shakes as many hands as possible.\n\nHer public policy concerns also tend to become Bill's public policy concerns. After Laura founded a charter school for dyslexic students, Bill became more interested in education issues and school choice. As a congressman, he started the congressional dyslexic caucus last year.\n\n\"Our areas of interest differ. I know a fair amount about dyslexia. She knows a lot about dyslexia. I know a fair amount about charter schools. She knows a lot about charter schools, and then she shares that with me,\" Bill said.\n\n\"I think she would concede that I know more about health care,\" he added.\n\nFrom personal to political on education\n\nLaura and Bill began reading up on dyslexia after their youngest daughter was diagnosed a few years ago.\n\nLaura soon discovered that not only was her daughter's school not equipped to teach a child with dyslexia how to read, but no affordable primary school in the Baton Rouge really knew how to handle the learning disability.\n\nThe Cassidys ended up pulling their daughter out of the school she was attending. They, along with a handful of other parents, hired a private instructor to teach their children with dyslexia through a home school setup.\n\nBut that wasn't going to work for other children who were struggling. Laura says statistics show that as many one in five children suffer from some form of dyslexia. She was confident there was no affordable treatment in Baton Rouge.\n\n\"Private schools [that tend to dyslexia] are $30,000 to $50,000, which very few people can afford,\" Laura said, \"A few private schools are not the solution.\"\n\nIf a person never learns to read properly, they are going to have a hard time being successful in life, Laura said. She sees a direct connection between the lack of instruction on how to teach children with dyslexia in Louisiana and the high incarceration rate in the state.\n\nSo two years ago, Laura started Louisiana Key Academy, a public charter school for children who have dyslexic symptoms. It runs first through third grade now, and there are plans to add other levels until it is a complete kindergarten-through-eighth-grade institution. Laura is one of the Key Academy's founders and president of the school's board.\n\nThe school is free and doesn't require its pupils to have an official dyslexic diagnosis -- they are expensive. Instead, Key Academy makes students take a free diagnostic exam that will indicate whether it's likely they have dyslexia.\n\n\"It costs $1,400 to $1,500 to get tested which - you can understand - most people would never get tested. ... We screen you to see if you fall into the [dyslexic] category,\" said Laura.\n\nLaura says she started Key Academy to help students like her daughter, but not her daughter specifically. As a sixth grader, the Cassidy's daughter is too old to attend Key Academy now. It's likely by the time it reaches a full kindergarten-through-eighth-grade school, she will already be in high school.\n\nIt is much more beneficial and cost effective for students with dyslexia to receive help in the first grade. It becomes much more difficult to help preteens. So the school needed to start in the early grades first, regardless of her daughter's needs.\n\n\"Ideally, they would be in a school like this, at the latest, in first grade,\" said Laura, \"First grade is the easiest time to remediate.\"\n\nLaura may know a lot about education issues, but that isn't the only topic on which she has an opinion, and Bill is likely to take her thoughts into account on many other topics.\n\n\"When Laura says something, Bill snaps to attention and listens,\" Lipsey said.\n\n. . . . .\n\nJulia O'Donoghue is a state politics reporter based in Baton Rouge.
