Without that money or partners, the county will have to close a vulnerable section of South King County\u2019s only standalone family planning clinic in January.\n\nLeavitt first sought help three years ago after her daughter, Eve, was born. At the time, Leavitt had just arrived from the Ukraine, could not drive and spoke little English. After her mother-in-law learned about the Auburn clinic, Leavitt initially signed up as a client for Maternity Support Services (MSS). Thanks to this state program administered by King County, nurses conducted home visits to check on the baby\u2019s health, offered Leavitt tips for better breastfeeding and answered her questions about being a first-time mother.\n\n\u201cIt meant a lot to me,\u201d Leavitt said earlier this month in one of the clinic\u2019s meeting rooms, as Eve slept in her arms. The baby \u201cgot help when she needed it. We didn\u2019t have to wait until I had insurance or could drive a car, and I didn\u2019t have to borrow any money from anybody because I could afford paying the bill myself.\n\n\u201cAnd even if I didn\u2019t have the money at that time, I could pay the next time,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that at regular clinics. It really helped me. I didn\u2019t have to get a credit card.\u201d\n\nAbout 10,700 clients in the Auburn area \u2014 including women, teens, children and infants \u2014 rely on Public Health\u2019s nurses and staff to learn parenting skills and access supplemental nutrition programs. The family planning clinic offers reproductive health services, from cervical cancers screenings to treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and birth control. If the site shuts down and women can\u2019t drive further to the remaining clinics or find alternative providers, the community will likely have to deal with unintended consequences.\n\nAt worst, county officials estimate the number of unintended births could be as high as 576 within a year of the clinic\u2019s closure, costing more than $3 million in Medicaid expenses. As the editorial notes, the loss of the clinic would roll back the county\u2019s recent successes toward reducing the teen pregnancy rate.\n\nLocated in a commercial park, the clinic is not much to look at, but it appears to be a popular destination for new parents, women and teens. About 90 percent of clients are walk-ins. A client service specialist helps people sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOther random issues come up, too. That morning, a male client showed up and said he was suicidal. (The staff found a place for him to seek help.) In other words, the clinic is often a first stop for all sorts of people in trouble.\n\nThe county is not letting go of this valuable resource by choice. Local, state and federal funding has steadily declined over the years, even as demand has grown for services. For years, Public Health has tried to fill the funding gap. Today, there are no stones left unturned. Employees have agreed to wage concessions, but that\u2019s not enough.\n\nOther counties have long done away with direct services such as family planning, but that does not mean the state\u2019s most populous county should follow.\n\nWhen Dariia Leavitt recently needed help with her own medical issues, she says she came back to the Auburn Public Health Clinic because the sliding scale fees were reasonable.\n\nShe now works part-time as a grill cook at CenturyLink Field on game nights, and her family has health insurance, but she still goes to the clinic for family planning services because she has built a strong relationship with the nursing staff. Convenience is also a huge factor. She does not want to start over again with a new provider.\n\n\u201cI still want to come here to resolve my problems because of the years I\u2019ve been coming here and the good experiences I\u2019ve had here,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that if anything happens with me or my daughter, we have a place to go to. It\u2019s not just hopeless, or looking for a new place, or borrowing money to pay for\u201d higher costs.\n\nWho will step up to the challenge of helping women and mothers like her? Lawmakers, health providers, businesses and foundations should seize this moment.\n\nHere\u2019s some 2013 numbers to keep in mind, courtesy of Public Health \u2014 Seattle & King County:\n\nPublic Health provides 94 percent of Maternity Support Services in King County. The Auburn Public Health Clinic and its two satellite offices in Enumclaw and the Muckleshoot Reservation served 3,000 clients in the MSS and Infant Case Management program .\n\nand the Reservation served . The Women, Infants and Children supplemental nutrition program provides monthly payments to mothers to help them select healthful foods on a limited budget. Auburn and its satellites provide services to 5,600 WIC clients .\n\n. Family planning reduces poverty, improves health outcomes for women, decreases unintended pregnancy and prevents sexually transmitted diseases from spreading. In 2013, 2,000 clients came to the clinic for such services.\n\nDemographics for the Auburn Public Health Center:\n\n97 percent have incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level.\n\n59 percent are people of color.\n\n11 percent are homeless.\n\n42 percent of family planning clients are uninsured.\n\n29 percent of pregnant women served by MSS indicate issues with alcohol and drugs.\n\n9 percent of visits require an interpreter.\n\nTeen pregnancy rates:", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|editorialsopinion|opinionnorthwest|front|article", "description": "Dariia Leavitt, 25, is just one among thousands of clients watching closely to see if the Auburn Public Health Clinic remains open next January.
