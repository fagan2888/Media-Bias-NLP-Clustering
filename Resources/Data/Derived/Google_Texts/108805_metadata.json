We have to move away from that kind of thinking,\u201d Bradley said.\n\nCo-author of a new book, \u201cThe American Healthcare Paradox: Why Spending More is Getting Us Less,\u201d Bradley said her research shows that if the U.S. spent more on housing, education and income support, the country\u2019s overall health would improve.\n\nBradley and other speakers said the Affordable Care Act is a good beginning, but the country still has a long way to go to fix a dysfunctional health care system.\n\nAmong the 34 relatively wealthy European, Scandinavian and Asian countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the U.S. spending on health care is far higher than any other country.\n\n\u201cAnd in some ways we have tremendous benefits from high spending,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe have more kidney transplants, more knee replacements and more MRIs than anywhere else in the world.\n\n\u201cBut out of the 34 OECD countries we are 25th in maternal mortality, 26th in life expectancy and 28th in low birth weight. This issue is not only about the poor,\u201d Bradley added. \u201cIf you look at studies that compare people in the U.S. with higher income and more education, they fare worse than their counterparts in Western Europe.\u201d\n\nBradley said the factors that determine good health can generally be divided into three categories. \u201cIt\u2019s about 20% genetics, 20% health care and about 60% social determinants \u2014 things like income, housing, education. The U.S. does a great job on the health care part of the equation, but we don\u2019t do so well in the larger, more important area of social determinants.\u201d\n\nSatcher Notes How Far System Has Come\n\nIn the other bookend address closing the National Academy for State Health Policy conference, David Satcher, surgeon general under President Clinton and now director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute in Atlanta, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the first Surgeon General\u2019s report on tobacco.\n\nSatcher said that while the milestone indicates how far the country has come over the past half century in efforts to promote public health, there is still much work to be done. He urged state policy leaders to work with federal and private sector officials to push the vision of a reformed health system forward.\n\nFrom DSRIP to Pregnant Medicaid Beneficiaries\n\nBetween opening and closing remarks from Bradley and Satcher, some 630 policy leaders from all 50 states and the District of Columbia explored new wrinkles in health policy during three days of workshops and presentations.\n\nCalifornia, as is often the case in national health issues, was looked on as leader in several arenas, ranging from dealing with new complexities faced by pregnant Medicaid beneficiaries under the ACA to the arcane use of DSRIP \u2014 Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment programs.\n\nIn a workshop \u2014 \u201cCreatively Addressing Complexities in Coverage for Pregnant Women under the ACA\u201d \u2014 Ren\u00e9 Mollow, deputy director of the California Department of Health Care Services, gave an overview of how state officials are trying to make coverage more accessible for pregnant women.\n\nLow- and moderate-income pregnant women in all states now have multiple options for health insurance, including Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the commercial marketplace, and, in some states, Children\u2019s Health Insurance Programs, which cover pregnancy-related services. The array of options, along with new federal eligibility guidelines, has created a complex coverage landscape that can be difficult for women to navigate and for states to administer.\n\n\u201cWe hoped that the ACA would make things easier, but that\u2019s not really the case in some circumstances,\u201d Mollow said. \u201cIn California, one of our principle goals is to have one umbrella of public programs that will cover pregnant women, no matter what their circumstances are.\u201d\n\nMollow, one of three featured speakers in the workshop, said she and other California officials work closely with stakeholders. \u201cWe have a very robust advocacy group in California, particularly where it applies to motherhood and early childhood,\u201d Mollow said.\n\nThere are \u201clots and lots of discussions going on\u201d about how to smooth the way for pregnant women, Mollow said.\n\nGretel Felton, Medicaid deputy commissioner for beneficiary services for Alabama, stepped to the microphone during the question session after the presentations and said, \u201cThank you, Ren\u00e9, for figuring it all out for us. We really appreciate it.\u201d\n\nMollow also led a workshop aimed at increasing state officials\u2019 ability to maintain continuity of care for youths in the juvenile justice and foster care systems.\n\nCalifornia DSRIP Leading the Way\n\nLinette Scott, chief medical information officer for DHCS, also played a focal role in two workshops. She was moderator of a panel discussion examining ways for states to creatively use new ACA standards for not-for-profit hospitals to support community health. She also filled in for California colleague DHCS Medical Director Neal Kohatsu as a speaker in a workshop on DSRIPs.\n\nCalifornia, in 2010, was the first state to launch a formal DSRIP program \u2014 one of a new generation of ACA-era acronyms pronounced \u201cdisrip.\u201d It is one of the tools officials hope can shift the payment system away from fee-for-service.\n\nPart of the state\u2019s \u201cBridge to Reform\u201d Medicaid waiver, California\u2019s DSRIP is a pay-for-performance quality improvement initiative for the state\u2019s 21 public hospitals in 17 health care systems. The goal is to strengthen care delivery, improve efficiency and ultimately save money. California\u2019s DSRIP includes up to $3.3 billion in federal incentive payments.\n\n\u201cWe started this before the ACA kicked in and after the high-tech act had been passed but hadn\u2019t kicked in yet,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThis DSRIP was at the leading edge of that tech movement.\n\n\u201cData collection \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 was a major challenge when it started,\u201d Scott said. \u201cThe adoption of [electronic health records] has been a help but it\u2019s still early. This is still very much a train being built in motion.\u201d\n\nCalifornia, one of three states featured in the DSRIP workshop, was considered the \u201cveteran\u201d state and asked to share results and best practices. New Jersey was the \u201cintermediate\u201d state, and New York was the \u201cnewcomer.\u201d\n\nSocial Impact Bonds for Private Investors\n\nIn the true spirit of free enterprise, a new health care funding mechanism taking shape in the U.S. got some time in the spotlight during the Atlanta conference. Social impact bonds are being touted as a way for private investors to put up money for government health programs with the hope of getting paid back when the programs bear fruit by reducing costs and improving public health.\n\nSouth Carolina is exploring the possibilities.\n\n\u201cWho thinks farther out beyond the silos we\u2019re always talking about?\u201d asked Tony Keck, director of the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the corporations. A social impact bond takes some of risk away from legislatures and states and puts it onto private investors who say, \u2018We\u2019re willing to take that risk but we want a payout that\u2019s commensurate with that risk.'\u201d\n\nThe idea is to get expensive health programs started with private investments that will be repaid once the programs are paying dividends with a less-expensive health care system and a healthier population.\n\nHow to measure all that is yet to be determined.\n\n\u201cYou take these programs that need a lot of money up front but promise a long return and you have private investors put the money up,\u201d Keck said.\n\n\u201cYou can see when a bridge is built or a new road opens, but seeing progress or a completed process in health care is different. The key in social impact bonds is you need results and you need to be able to measure them,\u201d Keck said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>More than 600 state health policy leaders from all 50 states convened last week in Atlanta to discuss new ideas rising to the surface at the beginning of the Affordable Care Act era. </p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "More than 600 state health policy leaders from all 50 states convened last week in Atlanta to discuss new ideas rising to the surface at the beginning of the Affordable Care Act era.", "title": "State Health Policy Leaders Examine Reform Landscape", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/state-health-policy-leaders-examine-reform-landscape/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-10-14T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-14T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2648\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhat is different in the U.S. is that we believe that health and health care are the same thing \u2026 if we invest in health care, we\u2019ll have better health.\nATLANTA \u2014 Starting with an assessment of how far the U.S. health system still has to go and ending with a look back at how far it\u2019s already come, state policy leaders got a wide range of perspectives last week at the 27th Annual State Health Policy Conference.\nHe urged state policy leaders to work with federal and private sector officials to push the vision of a reformed health system forward.\n'\u201dThe idea is to get expensive health programs started with private investments that will be repaid once the programs are paying dividends with a less-expensive health care system and a healthier population.\n\u201cYou can see when a bridge is built or a new road opens, but seeing progress or a completed process in health care is different."}
