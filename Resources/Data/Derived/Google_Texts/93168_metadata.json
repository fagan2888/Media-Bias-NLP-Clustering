Over the weekend, the group also claimed to execute a British aid worker.\n\nDespite the controversial nature of the sign, the company\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Alcede, defended the content as well as the general decision to put it up.\n\n\u201cI look and see what\u2019s going on throughout the week, realize what\u2019s an issue, what needs to be fixed, and if I think it\u2019s important then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll voice my opinion,\u201d Alcede said to Houston-based KHOU.\n\nAlcede also claimed the sign could be used by parents as an educational tool.\n\n\u201cYou should show them [children] the news and say, \u2018This is reality, kids. Beheadings happen, but they shouldn\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time that Tactical Firearms has made waves in the community \u2013 and around the country \u2013 for its contentious signs. In the past, its posted statements such as, \u201cGuns are cheap compared to Obamacare and have better coverage,\u201d as well as \u201cPerry gets indicted and Obama does not. I call bull**** and demand impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe company has even targeted Congressman, like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).\n\n\u201cHarry Reid said our border is secure. Did they legalize crack in Washington,\u201d a past sign read.\n\nAs far as the most recent statement is concerned, Marco Romero of Katy told KHOU the sign was in \u201cpretty poor taste,\u201d although she defended the company\u2019s right to express its views.\n\nOn Facebook, meanwhile, commenters were far more supportive.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re speaking what many, many, many are thinking. Thank you!\u201d wrote a Facebook user named Zo Zo.\n\n\u201cLove ur signs and keep up the good work waking up America,\u201d added Jessica Adkins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Texas gun shop known for its controversial signs has managed to raise eyebrows once again by criticizing President Barack Obama and bringing up the gruesome issue of beheadings to do it.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "A Texas gun shop known for its controversial signs has managed to raise eyebrows once again by criticizing President Barack Obama and bringing up the gruesome issue of beheadings to do it.", "title": "\u200bTexas gun shop stirs controversy with \u2018Obama family beheading\u2019 sign", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/2d/e7/80/00/texas-obama-beheading-sign.si.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/188024-texas-obama-beheading-sign/", "type": "article"}, "MobileOptimzied": "width", "twitter": {"description": "A Texas gun shop known for its controversial signs has managed to raise eyebrows once again by criticizing President Barack Obama and bringing up the gruesome issue of beheadings to do it.", "creator": "@RT_com", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/news/2d/e7/80/00/texas-obama-beheading-sign.si.jpg", "title": "RT International", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "navigation": "tabbed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c69\"", "article_summary": "Did they legalize crack in Washington,\u201d a past sign read.\nA Texas gun shop known for its controversial signs has managed to raise eyebrows once again by criticizing President Barack Obama and bringing up the gruesome issue of beheadings to do it.\n\u201cLove ur signs and keep up the good work waking up America,\u201d added Jessica Adkins.\nDespite the controversial nature of the sign, the company\u2019s CEO, Jeremy Alcede, defended the content as well as the general decision to put it up.\nI call bull**** and demand impeachment.\u201dThe company has even targeted Congressman, like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.)."}
