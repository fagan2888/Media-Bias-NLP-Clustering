And the gay community is thankful. The San Francisco Gay Men\u2019s Chorus honored Mr. Kennedy with a rendition of \u201cGive \u2018Em Hope\u201d at a recent American Bar Association meeting in the city, The New York Times reported.\n\nMeanwhile, San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee, at this same event, expressed his gratitude to the justice for \u201cupholding the Constitution and justice for all\u201d in his opinions on the court that favored the gay rights cause.\n\nSEE ALSO: Justice Ginsburg to officiate at same-sex wedding\n\nMr. Kennedy, for his part, signaled that he would continue this pro-gay fight at the court level.\n\n\u201cFreedom is always a work in progress,\u201d he said, at the event, The Times reported.\n\nHis work on the Supreme Court for the gay-rights cause is somewhat of a surprise to those who know his background. Mr. Kennedy was nominated by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. At the time, he had few friends in the gay crowd, due largely to his federal appeals rulings on five cases that went against the gay-rights claim, The Times said.\n\nBut now? He\u2019s a heralded champion for the cause and is set to go down in history as the most important judicial figure in the gay-rights movement.\n\n\u201cHe is the towering giant in the jurisprudence of freedom and equality for gay people,\u201d said Evan Wolfson, the president of Freedom to Marry, in The Times report.\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is emerging as a friend of the cause, too. Over the weekend, she became the first member of the Supreme Court to officiate at a same-sex wedding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Justice Anthony Kennedy will likely go down in history as the biggest judicial friend the gay-rights movement has ever known, court watchers say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Justice Anthony Kennedy will likely go down in history as the biggest judicial friend the gay-rights movement has ever known, court watchers say.", "title": "Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s legacy: Friend of the gay cause", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/2/justice-anthony-kennedys-legacy-friend-gay-cause/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/06/30/6_302013_supreme-court-term-wrapup-38201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/06/30/6_302013_supreme-court-term-wrapup-38201.jpg", "description": "Justice Anthony Kennedy will likely go down in history as the biggest judicial friend the gay-rights movement has ever known, court watchers say.", "card": "summary", "title": "Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s legacy: Friend of the gay cause"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
