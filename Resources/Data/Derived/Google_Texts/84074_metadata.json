Scientific Games said it retained executive recruiter Egon Zehnder to assist it in finding Mr. Schweinfurth\u2019s successor. It also named Michael Quartieri, most recently chief accounting officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp., as its controller. Mr. Schweinfurth will receive a cash payment of $1.1 million over the year following his departure and most of restricted stock and options will vest ahead of schedule, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nWhiteWave Foods, a Denver-based food and beverage company, said CFO Kelly Haecker will leave at the end of March to spend more time with his family. The news was announced in conjunction with two other internal promotions. It said Greg Christenson, currently CFO of its $2.5 billion Americas Foods & Beverages division, will succeed Mr. Haecker in April. Compensation information wasn\u2019t immediately disclosed.\n\nSpectralink Corp., a maker of handheld workplace-communications devices based in Boulder, Colo., named Casey Hoffmann CFO, effective immediately.
