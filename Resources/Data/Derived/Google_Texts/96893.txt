A group of ten demonstrators were arrested Monday after refusing to leave the lobby of Gov. Nathan Deal’s office.

They were protesting Deal’s decision not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

Among the ten arrested include state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta. Fort and the others were hauled off to Fulton County Jail and charged with the misdemeanor of "preventing or disrupting a General Assembly session."

The progressive coalition Moral Monday Georgia organized the protest. They want Deal to change his mind and accept federal funds to expand Medicaid.

Protester Laura Bordeaux of Decatur stressed hundreds of thousands of Georgians would gain health coverage. She said Deal is playing politics with people’s lives.

“This is just not right. This is a moral imperative and Governor Deal knows that. He knows that. This is election year posturing is what it is,” said Bordeaux.

Deal has said repeatedly the state can’t afford the expansion, despite the federal government covering nearly its full cost.

Deal’s office declined comment about the arrests.
