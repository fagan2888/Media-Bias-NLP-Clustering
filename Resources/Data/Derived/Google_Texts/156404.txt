4. reddit

The completely user-generated news and link aggregator has exploded in popularity over the last few years. Registered users — dubbed redditors — submit links, then vote them up or down, with the most popular stories appearing on the front page. Thousands of subreddits — smaller forums of specific interest — cover everything from world news to kittens. Beware: Those who wander too far astray can stumble into content they may find objectionable. Reddit's "Ask Me Anything" subreddits (AMA and IamA for short) host informal question-and-answer sessions between users and newsmakers. President Barack Obama participated in a reddit AMA during his 2012 presidential campaign, taking questions on subjects ranging from foreign and fiscal policy to basketball and beer.

5. Snapchat

Similar to Instagram but with a self-destruct button. It's designed for those who'd like to share a moment, but don't want to preserve it for posterity. Snapchat allows users to send photos to friends and groups. Once a recipient opens a photo message — called a "snap" — there is a preset time limit in which to view the image. After that time limit — anywhere from one to 10 seconds — expires, the photo vanishes from the recipient's device, and is also deleted from Snapchat's main servers. The app has sparked controversy among those who think its transient nature encourages "sexting," the sharing of sexually explicit photos, and because its user base skews young: It's most popular among those age 13 to 23, though its over-40 population is growing.
