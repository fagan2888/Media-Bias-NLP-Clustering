Since May, a research working group made up of providers, researchers, transgender people and other supporters has been holding monthly meetings and guiding the project, which includes the survey, regional summits around the state and other outreach efforts.\n\nPeople can participate in the survey by visiting www.transformhealthar.org. The survey will continue through the end of January, after which the project will be eligible for a grant of up to $25,000 to fund the second phase.\n\nThe survey should not be confused with the U.S. Trans Survey, a national survey of transgender people that is not limited to health-care issues.\n\nZekis said transgender people face a variety of health-care issues that others do not. For one, most insurance companies exclude coverage for gender transition-related care, she said.\n\nThis is the case \u201ceven though the Affordable Care Act says there should not be any discrimination on the basis of sex,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Kate Stewart, a member of ArTEC\u2019s board of directors and a health management and policy professor at UAMS, said there is a lack of clarity about whether the federal health-care law requires insurers to cover transition care. A rule clarification that would require those services to be covered has been written and is currently out for public comment, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see where that goes. That might actually help a whole lot if it ends up being implemented the way that it\u2019s written right now,\u201d she said.\n\nZekis, who is transgender, said insurance companies sometimes will deny coverage even for services not related to transgender issues if a patient is transgender, as she learned when an insurer initially refused to pay for antibiotics she needed for an infection. Eventually the problem was straightened out, but at first the company assumed the antibiotics were related to gender transition and therefore were not covered.\n\nSuch situations can lead transgender people to try to keep health-care providers and insurance carriers from finding out they are transgender, Zekis said.\n\nAnother issue is a lack of knowledge on the part of many providers, particularly in small towns, about the health-care needs of transgender people. Often the patients \u201chave to train the providers themselves, which is not ideal,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nTransgender patients also may encounter a \u201clack of cultural competency and sensitivity\u201d when seeking treatment from some providers, she said.\n\nZekis said transgender patients often fear that care providers will not follow privacy laws and will allow information about them to become known in their communities, which could lead to further discrimination.\n\nTonya Estell of North Little Rock, an in-person assister who helps people enroll in health-care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, said even some transgender people are uninformed about transgender issues, especially in rural areas.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t even know the correct terminology,\u201d she said. \u201cI encounter people some days that say, \u2018Oh, there is actual terminology for what I feel?\u2019\u201d\n\nEstell said understanding is growing, however.\n\n\u201cSince transgender issues have been in the media more often, have been publicized with shows such as \u2018Orange Is the New Black,\u2019 with Caitlyn Jenner publicly disclosing and transitioning, things such as that, people are becoming more aware,\u201d she said.\n\nThe next Transform Health Arkansas summit is set for today at The Jones Center in Springdale from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Advance registration is not necessary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A survey currently underway in Arkansas is gathering information about the transgender community\u2019s health-care issues on an unprecedented scale.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A survey currently underway in Arkansas is gathering information about the transgender community\u2019s health-care issues on an unprecedented scale.", "title": "Health survey gathering info from Arkansas\u2019 transgender community", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/health-survey-gathering-info-arkansas-transgender-community", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_health-survey_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/health-survey-gathering-info-arkansas-transgender-community", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_health-survey_0.jpg"}, "title": "Health survey gathering info from Arkansas\u2019 transgender community", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T02:00:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce809\"", "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A survey currently underway in Arkansas is gathering information about the transgender community\u2019s health-care issues on an unprecedented scale.\nThe survey should not be confused with the U.S. Trans Survey, a national survey of transgender people that is not limited to health-care issues.\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been this big of an investment in transgender health in Arkansas.\u201dThe survey is part of Transform Health Arkansas, a project that is bringing health-care providers, researchers and the transgender community together to learn what health-care issues transgender people in Arkansas are facing so they can be researched further and addressed.\nSuch situations can lead transgender people to try to keep health-care providers and insurance carriers from finding out they are transgender, Zekis said.\n\u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened before here,\u201d said Andrea Zekis of Little Rock, executive director of the Arkansas Transgender Equality Coalition, or ArTEC."}
