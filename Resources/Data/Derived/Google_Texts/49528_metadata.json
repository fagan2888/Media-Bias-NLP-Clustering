Phaneuf / Ctmirror.org\n\nHealth insurance plans sold in Connecticut will no longer be allowed to limit coverage of medically necessary infertility treatment to people under 40, according to new guidance issued by the Connecticut Insurance Department Thursday.\n\nThe state has since 2005 required insurance plans to cover medically necessary expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, but only required the coverage for people under 40. The guidance removes the age limit.\n\nThe change will apply to insurance policies sold or renewed after Jan. 1, 2016. The mandate applies only to health insurance plans subject to state regulation. Many large employers\u2019 health plans are not subject to state regulation because they self-insure their benefits, making them subject to federal regulation but not state oversight.\n\nThe change followed a review process that included input from insurers and the National Women\u2019s Law Center. It determined that infertility treatment \u201cmay be clinically effective for ages above 40,\u201d the guidance said.\n\nInsurance Commissioner Katharine L. Wade said she began looking into the issue after reading a report by the National Women\u2019s Law Center. Wade, a former Cigna lobbyist, recalled the passage of the 2005 mandate, and said at the time, medical evidence supported having 40 as an age limit.\n\nThe review also followed guidance from the federal government indicating that age limits on coverage are discriminatory if they apply to services that are clinically effective at all ages. The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination in benefit design based on age.\n\nKeith Stover, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, praised both the change and the process that led to it.\n\n\u201cThis process went exactly as it should, which is with the department and its technical experts and the plans, with their quite literally national women\u2019s health leadership, and we worked out what I think is the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it was a very positive development.\u201d\n\nStover said the age limit that was included in the 2005 mandate was the \u201cmedical-slash-political compromise at that point.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd things have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThe science has changed, the culture has changed, the ACA has passed, so you have to be mindful even in good faith of the broader impacts and nondiscrimination.\u201d\n\nThe insurance department previously removed the age limit in the state's mandate for coverage of hearing aids in response to guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/13/ct-removes-age-limit-for-infertility-treatment-coverage-mandate/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Affordable Care Act, Connecticut Insurance Department, insurance, Katharine Wade", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/13/ct-removes-age-limit-for-infertility-treatment-coverage-mandate/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Health insurance plans sold in Connecticut will no longer be allowed to limit coverage of medically necessary infertility treatment to people under 40, according to new guidance issued by the Connecticut Insurance Department Thursday.", "title": "CT removes age limit for infertility treatment coverage mandate", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/13/ct-removes-age-limit-for-infertility-treatment-coverage-mandate/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/04/DSCN6044-1170x878.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/13/ct-removes-age-limit-for-infertility-treatment-coverage-mandate/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe0c\"", "article_summary": "Keith Stover, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, praised both the change and the process that led to it.\nThe mandate applies only to health insurance plans subject to state regulation.\nThe state has since 2005 required insurance plans to cover medically necessary expenses related to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, but only required the coverage for people under 40.\nKeith M.
