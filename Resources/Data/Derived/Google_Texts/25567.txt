MADISON, Wis. --Tax filing season is finally upon us. The IRS opens E-file Tuesday --that's when they'll begin accepting the returns that have already been completed and start processing those refunds.

Tax experts say one of the best things for consumers is filing early.

"You can't be a victim if you have your tax return in first," H&R Block District Spokesperson Jennifer Voss said.

According to Voss, last year the Affordable Care Act and its impact was a huge concern for some, and this year it's just as relevant.

"ACA's complicated the tax return process," she said.

"Everyone needs to understand if you have insurance you're going to be receiving a 10-95 of some form."

And if your goal is to make filing easier for yourself, Voss said be sure to have all your documents with you and ready to go.

"So, when you sit down you can get the process done and it's over and off your to-do list."
