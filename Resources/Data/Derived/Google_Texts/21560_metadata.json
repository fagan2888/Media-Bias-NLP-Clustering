Net loss, excluding one-time costs, came in at $11.8 million, or $0.19 per share, as the company dealt with higher research and development costs associated with its clinical studies. By comparison, Wall Street anticipated a smaller loss of just $0.16 per share. The truly damning factor was its guidance. Raptor is currently projecting $55 million-$65 million in Procysbi product sales in fiscal 2014 whereas Wall Street expected $69.2 million in Procysbi sales.\n\nNow what: With Raptor shares having more than tripled following the approval of Procysbi last year, the expectation from investors is that Raptor would be marching closer to profitability and that revenue would soar. Raptor's guidance would seem to indicate that things are moving in the right direction but at a much slower pace than Wall Street wanted to see. Even after today's drop, Raptor still seems a bit frothy to me given Procysbi's peak sales potential. For now, I'd suggest hunkering down on the sidelines and waiting for the Raptor pipeline and bottom line to do the talking.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:15", "date": "2014-03-14T18:15:00Z", "description": "Raptor shares nosedive after the company reports its fourth-quarter results and offers up sales guidance for fiscal 2014.
