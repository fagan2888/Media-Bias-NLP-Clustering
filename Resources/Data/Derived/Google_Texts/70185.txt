Rochester, N.Y. - Monroe County Executive Cheryl Dinolfo was sworn in to office Saturday morning.

At her inauguration, which was held at the Kodak Hall at the Eastman Theatre, Dinolfo discussed ways to improve the County government, how to keep property taxes flat and her belief that family is the foundation of our community.

"I believe that family is the foundation of our community, no matter how family is defined," said Dinolfo. "With our families, we share our values, what we care about, and what our roles and responsibilities to each other are."

In addition, she asked local leaders, elected officials, business owners and the heads of not-for-profit organizations to join her in looking at the County's challenges pragmatically.

In order to meet these challenges she plans on enacting her integrity agenda, which includes eliminating Local Development Corporations, creating an Office of Public Integrity and placing all Community contracts online for public review.

In regards to keeping the County tax rate flat to keep home ownership affordable Dinolfo stated, "We should never lose sight of our responsibility to keep our County affordable for all by keeping property taxes flat. Our homes are where our families come together, around their shared table, to plan, to dream, to act and ultimately build a better community with greater opportunity for all of us."

At the ceremony Dinolfo's husband, Judge Vincent Dinolfo, and her father, Russell Loria, administered the Oath of Office. The local Vietnam Veterans of America, Chapter 20 presented our nation's colors and Dinolfo's grade school principal, Sister Francella Quinn did the invocation.

13WHAM's news anchor Don Alhart served as the Master of Ceremonies and young local leaders, Jeremiah and Joshua West who started Champions for Change, led the Pledge of Allegiance.
