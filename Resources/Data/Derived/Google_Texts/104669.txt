Police detectives from Salem, Ore. announced yesterday that they have arrested Beau Smith on murder charges, stemming from the violent death of a 66-year-old. Smith was a well-known football player at Roseville High School who is currently attending Willamette University, where he also plays football.

According to the Salem Police Department, an autopsy was performed on the victim, Michael Hampshire, on Nov. 12. Results from the State Medical Examiner’s Office, coupled with the detectives' interviews with Smith, led to an arrest the following day.

Pathologists have ruled Hampshire’s demise an act of “homicidal violence.”

Police said Smith, 22, still has a California address. Further investigation is underway as Salem police investigators and members of the Marion County District Attorney's Office gather more evidence.

Roseville Press Tribune archives show Smith was often a highlight for sports news between 2007 and 2011, playing a pivotal role for the Tigers football program. As a senior, he led Roseville with 43 catches for 1,039 yards and eight touchdowns.

Smith also played baseball and started all 31 games of Roseville's section-title season in 2011.
