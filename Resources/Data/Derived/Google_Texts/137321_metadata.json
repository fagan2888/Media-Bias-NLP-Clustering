Pat Quinn signed Senate Bill 2636 on Sunday, saying that the law would help people all over the state suffering from seizures. Medical cannabis has been shown to have a beneficial effect on children with epilepsy, and withholding this treatment option from patients can reduce their chances for survival and quality of life. \u201cThis new law will help alleviate the suffering of many adults and children across the state,\u201d Quinn said in a statement. \u201cEpilepsy is a debilitating condition, and this much-needed relief will help to reduce some of its symptoms for those who endure seizures.\u201d\n\nSenate Bill 2636 was spearheaded by Sen. Iris Martinez (D-Chicago) in order to expand the state\u2019s medical marijuana law to include people with seizure disorders, like epilepsy, or traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related seizures. The bill will also allow minors to take part in the Illinois Medical Cannabis Pilot Program if they have both parental consent and physician recommendations. Before Senate Bill 2636, Illinois was one of three states that didn\u2019t allow minors to take part in their medical marijuana programs.\n\n\u201cMedical marijuana is an effective treatment option for people suffering from seizure disorders,\u201d Chris Lindsey of the Marijuana Policy Project told The Examiner. \u201cAs more elected officials become familiar with its medical benefits, more states will adopt laws that allow it.\u201d\n\n'Compassionate' Legislation\n\nRecently, families with severely epileptic children that have searched out medical cannabis in desperation have made headlines. Take Charlotte Figi, for example, the 6-year-old who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy. Charlotte was placed under special diets and given various treatments, but nothing worked until her family began using cannabis oil. It was unconventional, but it worked, bringing Charlotte\u2019s seizures down from 300 a week to only three per week.\n\nThe Epilepsy Foundation has since called for \u201cincreased medical marijuana access and research,\u201d noting that it\u2019s unacceptable for only a handful of states to have open access to the drug while others don\u2019t. \u201cThe Epilepsy Foundation believes that an end to seizures should not be determined by one\u2019s zip code,\u201d the website says. \u201cFamilies looking to access medical marijuana as a treatment are facing terrible decisions. One parent may move across the country to live with a child to seek this treatment. Other families may uproot entirely, including leaving their job, to move where they can access CBD oil.\u201d\n\nPerhaps this is why Illinois refers to the law as the \"Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Act.\" \u201cWe applaud Gov. Quinn and the legislature for adopting this compassionate and much-needed legislation,\u201d Lindsey told The Examiner. \u201cIt comes as a relief to countless patients and their families, many of whom tirelessly advocated for the new law. It will improve the quality of life for many Illinois residents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical marijuana, cannabis oil, illinois marijuana law", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Previously one of three states that barred children from participating in medical marijuana programs, Illinois recently passed a bill expanding access to both minors and adults who suffer from seizures.", "title": "Kids In Illinois Can Use Marijuana, Too \u2014 Under One Condition", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-law-illinois-expands-include-children-adults-suffering-seizures-294334", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/22/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Previously one of three states that barred children from participating in medical marijuana programs, Illinois recently passed a bill expanding access to both minors and adults who suffer from seizures.", "title": "Kids In Illinois Can Use Marijuana, Too \u2014 Under One Condition", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/medical-marijuana-law-illinois-expands-include-children-adults-suffering-seizures-294334", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/22/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/22/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-07-22T14:14:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-22T14:08:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Previously one of three states that barred children from participating in medical marijuana programs, Illinois recently passed a bill expanding access to both minors and adults who suffer from seizures."}, "article_summary": "Illinois has become the 23rd state to allow both adults and children to use medical marijuana in the treatment of seizures.\nThe bill will also allow minors to take part in the Illinois Medical Cannabis Pilot Program if they have both parental consent and physician recommendations.\n\u201cMedical marijuana is an effective treatment option for people suffering from seizure disorders,\u201d Chris Lindsey of the Marijuana Policy Project told The Examiner.\nBefore Senate Bill 2636, Illinois was one of three states that didn\u2019t allow minors to take part in their medical marijuana programs.\n\u201cThis new law will help alleviate the suffering of many adults and children across the state,\u201d Quinn said in a statement."}
