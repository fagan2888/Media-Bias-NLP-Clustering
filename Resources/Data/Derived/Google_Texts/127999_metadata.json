Because of the show\u2019s major network backing and primetime slot, he said, it was covered like any other television show. He said this forced many entertainment writers to write about all sorts of science topics not often covered in these publications, exposing the show to a new and possibly unintended audience.\n\nTyson was not as shocked by the backlash the show garnered from certain religious and political groups, mainly creationists who took issue with Tyson\u2019s insistence on discussing evolution, the Big Bang theory and the history of scientific discovery. Their criticism of the show did not bother Tyson at all. \u201cYou have to ask yourself, what are the numbers behind the people making these claims? Someone like Ken Ham [owner of the Creation Museum] has beliefs that are even crazy to many Christians.\u201d\n\nKen Ham\u2019s criticisms came in the form of a weekly review on his website Answers in Genesis, a creationist organization. Ham\u2019s comments gained some attention from the media and were often answered by science writers all over the Internet.\n\nBut Tyson wondered how Ham was even able to get anyone\u2019s attention. He speculated it had something to do with Ham\u2019s debate with Bill Nye, the Science Guy.\n\n\u201cEveryone knew Bill Nye, but almost no one had heard of Ken Ham,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cBut after the debate [Ham] realized he had some media attention. You have to wonder\u2014if that debate never happened if he would have even bothered covering the show at all?\u201d\n\nTyson said he has no interest in addressing the claims AIG made against him or the show.\n\n\u201cWhat I say is not an opinion,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cLife is too short to debate people\u2019s opinions. There is an old saying, if a debate lasts more than five minutes, both sides lost.\u201d\n\nThis is the reason Tyson says he doesn\u2019t debate. \u201cMy publicist wanted to set up a series of debates with me about Pluto, but I don\u2019t care that much\u2014call Pluto a planet, call it a planetoid, it doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d he said. \u201cJust make sure that whatever you call it, you are doing so informed.\u201d\n\nTyson said as an educator, his goal is not to tell people what to think, but to teach them how to think and provide them with scientific facts. It\u2019s up to them to decide what to do with this knowledge. \u201cI am not a totalitarian, I don\u2019t want to tell you what to believe. I want to provide you with the tools and evidence to arrive at your position on your own, and if you disagree with me, that\u2019s fine, as long as your disagreement does not harm others.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Cosmos\" host sounds off on the creationist movement, Answers in Genesis and its increasingly unhinged leader", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: Ken Ham\u2019s beliefs are even crazy for Christians", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Cosmos\" host sounds off on the creationist movement, Answers in Genesis and its increasingly unhinged leader", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: Ken Ham\u2019s beliefs are even crazy for Christians", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/23/neil_degrasse_tyson_ken_hams_beliefs_are_even_crazy_for_christians_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/neil_degrasse_tyson4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Cosmos\" host sounds off on the creationist movement, Answers in Genesis and its increasingly unhinged leader", "title": "Neil deGrasse Tyson: Ken Ham\u2019s beliefs are even crazy for Christians", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/neil_degrasse_tyson4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Dan Arel", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Answers In Genesis, Creationism, ken ham, Scientific Method", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEveryone knew Bill Nye, but almost no one had heard of Ken Ham,\u201d Tyson said.\nHam\u2019s comments gained some attention from the media and were often answered by science writers all over the Internet.\nHe speculated it had something to do with Ham\u2019s debate with Bill Nye, the Science Guy.\nSomeone like Ken Ham [owner of the Creation Museum] has beliefs that are even crazy to many Christians.\u201dKen Ham\u2019s criticisms came in the form of a weekly review on his website Answers in Genesis, a creationist organization.\n\u201cBut after the debate [Ham] realized he had some media attention."}
