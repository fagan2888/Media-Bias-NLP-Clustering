While it\u2019s still holding down the level of Medicare payments, Phillips notes, it\u2019s no longer holding down the growth in them.\n\nAnother policy was the lowering of inflation adjustments that providers receive from Medicare, which was designed to help offset by the cost of the coverage expansion under Obamacare.\n\nLast year there was a one-time reduction in Medicare hospital reimbursements, another Obamacare provision that only went into effect once expanded coverage became available. Another Obamacare effect was the expiration of Medicaid bonus payments to physicians.\n\nFinally, the shift toward Medicaid enrollment \u2014 again, due to Obamacare \u2014 has had an impact, since Medicaid pays providers less than private insurers, and because the newly covered are now more likely to seek out health care.\n\nAll told, these factors are holding down health-care inflation by 1.1 percentage points, and reducing core inflation \u2014 that is, PCE price index excluding energy and food \u2014 by about 0.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, Phillips says.\n\nGoldman Sachs/BLS\n\nBut, health inflation should rise over the next few quarters, Phillips says.\n\nFor one, there\u2019s not a lot of new public-sector health policy changes in store. Another factor is that wages in the sector are moving higher, notably at hospitals. And finally, state budgets have mostly healed. States \u2014 which by law must balance their budgets \u2014 pay for nearly half of Medicaid spending, and look to health when the going gets tough.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Health-care inflation has been muted for years, but a research analyst expects a number of factors to soon start lifting prices in the medical sector.", "creator": "@MKTWgoldstein", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DZ126_health_MG_20151111133720.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Steve Goldstein", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Health-care inflation has been muted for years, but a research analyst expects a number of factors to soon start lifting prices in the medical sector.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-goldman-sachs-expects-health-care-inflation-to-accelerate-2015-11-11", "author": "Steve Goldstein", "parsely-title": "Why Goldman Sachs expects health-care inflation to accelerate", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-11-11T14:45:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Health-care inflation has been muted for years, but a research analyst expects a number of factors to soon start lifting prices in the medical sector.", "title": "Why Goldman Sachs expects health-care inflation to accelerate", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-goldman-sachs-expects-health-care-inflation-to-accelerate-2015-11-11", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DZ126_health_MG_20151111133720.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DZ126_health_MG_20151111133720.jpg"}, "article.id": "953579D2-888D-11E5-9321-80934ADAEB0D", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0717\"", "article_summary": "Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Phillips points out in a research note that myriad government policies have contained prices.\nGoldman Sachs/BLSBut, health inflation should rise over the next few quarters, Phillips says.\nGoldman Sachs/BLS/BEAHealth-care inflation has been muted for years, but a research analyst expects a number of factors to soon start lifting prices in the medical sector.\nWhile it\u2019s still holding down the level of Medicare payments, Phillips notes, it\u2019s no longer holding down the growth in them.\nAll told, these factors are holding down health-care inflation by 1.1 percentage points, and reducing core inflation \u2014 that is, PCE price index excluding energy and food \u2014 by about 0.2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis, Phillips says."}
