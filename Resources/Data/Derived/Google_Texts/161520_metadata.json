One of the newly licensed stores \u2014 the Lodo Wellness Center at 16th and Wazee streets \u2014 is across from my office, so every day I watched the huddled masses stand in line, up and down the block, to purchase weed.\n\nOne day, I had an impulse to get in line with everyone else and buy some. Not because I smoke \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 but out of sheer curiosity. Surveying the scene, however, it seemed both too cool and too uncool at the same time.\n\nIt was a bit too cool for me, because everyone else in line seemed to be young and hip and I was dressed in my standard-issue lawyer uniform: white shirt, tie, vampire teeth (ba-dum-ching).\n\nMore than being too cool, however, it all seemed fatally uncool. I\u2019ve always thought of smoking weed as a rebellious act, a way of surreptitiously sticking it to the man. It just seems, well, uncool to be buying weed the way one would buy a loaf of bread and milk.\n\nBy comparison, a drug-using friend of mine in New York used to buy his drugs by taking the subway to a sketchy block in Brooklyn and getting inside his drug dealer\u2019s black Lincoln town car with tinted windows. Terrifying and stupid, yes. But not uncool.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I was in the jazz band (that gives you an idea of how uncool I was). One year, we played Paul Simon\u2019s classic tune \u201cLate in the Evening.\u201d You know the lyrics: \u201cThen I learned to play some lead guitar/ I was underage in this funky bar/ And I stepped outside to smoke myself a J\u2026 .\u201d Our teacher was forced to change the lyrics to \u201csmoke myself a cigarette \u2026 .\u201d Pretty lame, but it underscored for us that smoking \u201cJs\u201d was something that was really upsetting to authorities. And upsetting authorities is always cool.\n\nOr I think of Allen Ginsberg\u2019s great countercultural poem \u201cAmerica,\u201d where he defiantly proclaimed: \u201cI smoke marijuana every chance I get.\u201d To give you a sense of that poem\u2019s tone, the previous line is: \u201cI used to be a communist when I was a kid and I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d\n\nNowadays, admitting to smoking marijuana every chance one gets does not register as rebellious. It just seems awfully expensive at $40 an eighth.\n\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not saying that I disapprove of legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. Whatever challenges may arise, it means that fewer young minorities will have their lives ruined by being arrested merely for possessing some weed. A comprehensive new report by the ACLU confirmed that state and local governments enforce marijuana laws selectively against minorities. Legalization, if done carefully and smartly, is a good thing.\n\nBut we\u2019ll also need to admit that Jan. 1, 2014, marked the end of an era. Weed isn\u2019t Miles Davis and Willie Nelson anymore. It\u2019s just that store on Wazee between the deli and the nail salon.\n\nThe coming days and years will be hard, indeed, for Colorado\u2019s youth. They\u2019ll have to find an entirely new way to upset us. They\u2019ll succeed, of course, as always.\n\nMatthew Saks is a lawyer and freelance writer in Denver.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "The day cool died in Denver", "title": "The day cool died in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/10/the-day-cool-died-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 437, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__20140111_A19_OP11G_SAKSp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140110__20140111_A19_OP11G_SAKSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-10T17:35:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T01:40:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "I\u2019ve always thought of smoking weed as a rebellious act, a way of surreptitiously sticking it to the man.\nSurveying the scene, however, it seemed both too cool and too uncool at the same time.\nOne day, I had an impulse to get in line with everyone else and buy some.\nIt just seems, well, uncool to be buying weed the way one would buy a loaf of bread and milk.\nMore than being too cool, however, it all seemed fatally uncool."}
