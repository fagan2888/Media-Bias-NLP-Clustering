Illinois is set to become the latest state to partially decriminalize marijuana. The bill rolled through the state House chamber and the Senate passed legislation Thursday. The law would effectively eliminate punishment for marijuana possession in small amounts.

HB 218 makes small possession for personal use a civil offense. Individuals would be allowed up to 15 grams, before any criminal penalty would apply. Under the civil citation, there would be no jail time and a maximum fine of $125. Previously, simple possession charges could land a person in the county jail, probation and a hefty fine, in addition to a permanent criminal record.

“Under current Illinois law, simple possession of about 2 grams of marijuana is considered a misdemeanor and punishable by up to 30 days in jail and/or a $1,500 fine,” according to Huffington Post. “Possession of 10 to 30 grams, in contrast, is a felony and can come with a year in jail and/or a fine.”

Historically, the prohibition of marijuana in Illinois and elsewhere has had a disproportionate impact on African-Americans. Black people are seven times more likely to be arrested for possession than their white counterparts, according to the ACLU– despite remarkably similar rates of use.

If Gov. Bruce Rauner signs the bill, his state will join 19 others and the District of Columbia. To date, Rauner has not endorsed the measure.
