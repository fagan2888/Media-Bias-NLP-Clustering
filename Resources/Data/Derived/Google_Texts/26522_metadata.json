Typically, deductibles range from $500 to $6,000, depending on benefit design and household size. Members are responsible for the cost of care incurred up to the deductible limits within a given year.\n\nThese plans are exceptionally efficient vehicles for constraining health costs to all purchasers: insurers, employers, and patients alike, says Christopher Kerns, MBA, managing director, Research and Insights, The Advisory Board Company. And, for patients who can\u2019t afford traditional health insurance premiums, HDHPs are a low-cost option.\n\n\u201cThis explains their overwhelming popularity on the [Affordable Care Act] ACA health insurance exchanges; they\u2019re also favored by a plurality of employees on private health insurance exchanges,\u201d says Kerns. \u201cAlthough high deductibles make the premiums affordable, out-of-pocket expenses can still be burdensome for lower-income households, although typically far less than they would have been as uninsured patients.\u201d\n\nBut while saving money across the board is all well and good, multiple sources report that people with HDHPs forgo getting care or cut back on care due to having high deductible plans. Over time, that could lead to more healthcare costs if untreated chronic conditions snowball into more serious health issues, or if undiagnosed illnesses escalate into long-term, complex health problems. Health plans and employers considering high-deductible health plans must consider the short and long-term implications.\n\nNext: The positive effects", "article_metadata": {"DC.description": "Most payers and employers now offer high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), but questions remain regarding whether these options will actually help plans save on healthcare costs.", "Description": "Most payers and employers now offer high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), but questions remain regarding whether these options will actually help plans save on healthcare costs.", "og": {"url": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/managed-healthcare-executive/news/high-deductible-health-plans-hidden-costs", "image": "http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/HealthCare/2015/09/18/24909f9f-7cd3-4223-97f7-016efa169e07/Kerns_Christopher_021111_ppt.jpg", "site_name": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "description": "Most payers and employers now offer high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), but questions remain regarding whether these options will actually help plans and employers save on healthcare costs in the", "title": "High-deductible health plans: hidden costs"}, "DC.identifier": "http://managedhealthcareexecutive.modernmedicine.com/node/411237", "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "DC.date": "2015-09-23", "last-modified": "Thu, 8 October 2015 01:13:00 GMT", "DC.creator": "Karen Appold", "DC.source": "Managed Healthcare Executive", "google-site-verification": "WZJsn2WE41IwLNlFfGQmdu6DHXhiwsg_s5ZCzVREpaM", "DC.subject": "Business Strategy, cost effectiveness, cost-conscious care, deductibles, Editor's Choice MHE, health plan exchanges, health plans, high deductible, high-deductible insurance plan, Managed Care Outlook, MHE Articles, premiums", "emsContentType": "High-deductible health plans: hidden costs", "DC.title": "High-deductible health plans: hidden costs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2a2\"", "article_summary": "Health plans and employers considering high-deductible health plans must consider the short and long-term implications.\nMost payers and employers now offer high-deductible health plans (HDHPs), but questions remain regarding whether these options will actually help plans and employers save on healthcare costs in the long run.\nHDHPs are health insurance plans with fairly low monthly premiums, but relatively large out-of-pocket expenses for incurred medical care.\n\u201cThis explains their overwhelming popularity on the [Affordable Care Act] ACA health insurance exchanges; they\u2019re also favored by a plurality of employees on private health insurance exchanges,\u201d says Kerns.\nAnd, for patients who can\u2019t afford traditional health insurance premiums, HDHPs are a low-cost option."}
