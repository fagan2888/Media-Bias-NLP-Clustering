Regardless of who wins the general election this November and is the next president in January 2017, we citizens, need to start the process of working within our state legislatures to pass an amendment to the U.S. Constitution in order to bring about congressional reform as soon as possible. The debate needs to begin and be brought to America's attention, especially in light of recent events!

Our founding fathers envisioned citizen representatives, so our legislators should serve their term(s), then go home and back to work. Serving in Congress should be an honor, not a lifelong career of raising money for the next election.

If you agree with any of the items below, please help me make this a possibility:

• Members of Congress shall serve only one (1) single term: House of Representatives, four years; U.S. Senate, six years.

• A member of Congress shall only collect a salary while in office and shall receive no pay when their term expires.

• Members of Congress (past, present and future) shall participate in the Social Security system. All funds currently in the Congressional Retirement Fund shall be moved to the Social Security Fund immediately. All future congressional pay shall be subject to the same FICA tax rate as the American people. Then they will have skin in the game!

• Congress can purchase their own supplemental retirement plan and pay for it with their salary, just as most Americans strive to have the opportunity.

• Congress will no longer vote themselves a pay raise. Congressional pay will rise by the lower of CPI or 3 percent.

• Congress must participate in the Affordable Care Act health care exchanges in their represented state, just as their constituents do.

Don't you think it's time special interest money gets out of politics for good?
