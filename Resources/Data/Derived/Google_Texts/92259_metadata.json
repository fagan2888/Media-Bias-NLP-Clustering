The best way to do that was earning a state-qualifying time in something. Anything.\n\nAccomplishing this, however, wasn't going to be easy.\n\n\"My freshman year, I knew at some point between then and now I wanted to make state,\" he said. \"My whole goal this season was to make at least one state cut, so I knew the 100 breast would probably be my best option.\"\n\nDenton had some serious work to do, but wasted little time after shaving 5 seconds off his best time during the prelims Friday, leaving less than a second left to erase and clear the hurdle he had set for himself.\n\nIn his final opportunity, the sophomore found some game competition in his consolation final a lane to his right, and it helped guide him end to end with just a bit of time to spare. Denton looked up and the scoreboard flashed validation in bright red numbers: 1:04.87.\n\n\"It's so gratifying just knowing that all your training throughout the entire season has finally paid off. It's exciting to see where things can go from here,\" Denton said. \"I'm crazy excited. It's such an honor to make 5A state, and I'm really glad to be a part of such a great team of guys going to state.\"\n\nLoveland expanded its state roster Saturday at the Front Range League Championships at the Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center in Thornton beyond Denton, as junior teammate Evan Wullink also used his final chance to qualify for the 50-yard freestyle with a 23.04, good for ninth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith a combination of old standbys doing what they do and new contributors like Denton and Wullink, the Indians exceeded everyone's expectations \u2014 including their own \u2014 by finishing in fourth place in the conference with 399 points as Fossil Ridge claimed the FRL crown by a wide margin.\n\nLoveland coach Jon Scott is going to have to shift the Indians' travel arrangements for their trip to Colorado Springs.\n\n\"I'm going to have to get a bigger car because we added extra bodies,\" Scott joked. \"Our goal was to add to our state team, and we added two. To finish in fourth place, the same as last year but with the loss of two state-qualifying swimmers, is a good repeat.\"\n\nThe day started with a fourth-place finish in the 200 medley relay in 1:42.29, which was kicked off by Jackson Buyers. Buyers cleaned up individually by taking a pair of top five places in the 200 IM and 100 backstroke.\n\nThe junior was Loveland's highest placer coming in one of the better races of the day in the individual medley. Buyers went neck in neck with Fossil's Danny Kovac before eventually being out-paced in the final yards to take second in 1:57.38, his best time of the season. He followed it up with a fifth-place finish in the 100 back with a 54.51.\n\nOf course there's still room for improvement before state.\n\n\"I was fairly happy with (today), but I still need to work a lot on my turns; those are what's killing me,\" Buyers said. \"I really enjoy (the IM). I like a close race. I'm disappointed I couldn't pull it out in the end, but it was still fun; lots of adrenaline.\"\n\nSenior Dylan McNally also found his way into strong finishes during his individual races, going seventh in the 50 freestyle (22.64) and two spots better in the 100 free (49.47).\n\nSenior Colton Mitchell took 15th in the 200 IM (2:08.75) and 16th in the 100 butterfly (58.20), and junior Brennen Lang further improved on his times for fifth in the 200 free (1:48.83) and getting under 5 minutes in the 500 free for a 4:57.70 (10th).\n\nSophomore diver Ben Bryant picked up points for the Indians as well, scoring a 357 total to just sneak into fifth place. In true team fashion, the LHS leaders liked watching their teammates succeed more than doing so themselves.\n\n\"It's more exciting than me doing great in one of my races,\" Buyers said. \"It really means a lot.\"\n\nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/rhpreps\n\nFront Range League Championships\n\nAt Veterans Memorial Aquatic Center\n\nTeam scores \u2014 Fossil Ridge, 963; Fairview, 750; Legacy, 491.5; Loveland, 399; Fort Collins, 397; Greeley West, 363; Boulder, 352; Rocky Mountain, 261; Broomfield, 249; Monarch, 198.5.\n\n200 medley relay \u2014 1.
