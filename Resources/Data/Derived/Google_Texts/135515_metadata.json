It\u2019s an issue that animates the base, and they\u2019re not looking too kindly on those Republican candidates who have backed Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in their respective states. Yes, all eyes are on you Gov. John Kasich and Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nAccording to a Foundation for Government Accountability poll, on average, 60 percent of GOP voters from those four states were less likely to back a candidate who expanded Obamacare. If a Republican candidate had lobbied other states to do the same 69.5 percent were less likely to support that candidate\u2019s presidential campaign. And it should also surprise no one that 81 percent (on average) of the GOP primary voters from these states don\u2019t support President Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nThe FGA poll as conducted on August 24-27, with 2,182 likely GOP voters. Five hundred and two voters were from Iowa, 520 were polled in New Hampshire, 598 were from South Carolina, and 562 were surveyed in Florida.\n\nWhat about Kasich\u2019s rise in the polls? Doesn\u2019t that prove that maybe Republicans might be open to his candidacy? He won his second term in a landslide re-election campaign in 2014, and he\u2019s beating Hillary in Ohio. It\u2019s a state Republicans must win in 2016. He\u2019s doubled his numbers in the polls and was able to get a seat at the adult\u2019s table during the first Republican debate. Yet, he\u2019s still in the single digits, and a tad bit ahead of George Pataki. That\u2019s nothing to be proud of in this race, as National Review's Jim Geraghty wrote.\n\nHe could be a threat to Jeb Bush, who is seen as the other establishment candidate. The two candidates are reportedly heading for a showdown in New Hampshire. At the same time, the Medicaid expansion is going to be an issue. If Kasich\u2019s team is reading the FGA to indicate otherwise, they\u2019re heading for disaster.\n\nKasich has zero wiggle room for spin on his decision to expand Medicaid in his state since he has said God wanted Ohio to expand government-run health care in his state. Politico reported that the issue could \u201cdog\u201d him in Iowa and New Hampshire, but it isn\u2019t a \u201cfatal\u201d issue. Nevertheless, it\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t help him in a crowded GOP field. Additionally, the costs associated with expanding Medicaid means that Kasich\u2019s claim of balancing the books in the Buckeye State could easily be torpedoed in less than a decade as the program is known to be a budget buster, forcing state legislatures to find, on average, three to four dollars in cuts from other parts of their receptive budgets just to save a dollar on Medicaid. So, in a sense, it could evolve into a terminal illness for his candidacy. It also doesn\u2019t sound good that the new class of eligible recipients consists of young, childless, and able-bodied adults who have other options for health insurance. About a third of those who are now eligible for benefits under the expansion have criminal records.\n\nLastly, Forbes\u2019 Avik Roy has labeled the program a \u201chumanitarian catastrophe\u201d given how those without insurance fare better than those enrolled in Medicaid. Oh, and recipients have yet to report receiving better care under this government program.\n\nIncredibly expensive, not really helping the working poor, and the quality of care is awful. Justifying the expansion of such a program could be difficult given how deep the opposition is Republican primary voters.\n\nThe same problems with Medicaid expansion also apply to Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nLAST NOTE: Florida Republican strategist Rick Wilson's feelings on Gov. Kasich and Obamacare:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the one Republican in the field that not only embraced Obamacare, but took it out in his dad\u2019s station wagon and made out with it...It\u2019s not a strategy to win a Republican primary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Icebergs ahead.05/26/2016 20:34:18PM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Icebergs ahead", "title": "Matt Vespa - Poll: Obamacare Could Spell Trouble For Christie And Kasich", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/11/poll-obamacare-could-spell-trouble-for-christie-and-kasich-n2051064", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/224/6b742fee-7ee0-42f9-9a42-075f40b610a5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Icebergs ahead", "title": "Matt Vespa - Poll: Obamacare Could Spell Trouble For Christie And Kasich", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/11/poll-obamacare-could-spell-trouble-for-christie-and-kasich-n2051064", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/224/6b742fee-7ee0-42f9-9a42-075f40b610a5.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poll: Obamacare Could Spell Trouble For Christie And Kasich , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "So, this shouldn\u2019t come as a shock to everyone; Obamacare isn\u2019t popular with New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina, and Florida Republican primary voters.\nJustifying the expansion of such a program could be difficult given how deep the opposition is Republican primary voters.\nKasich and Obamacare:\u201cHe\u2019s the one Republican in the field that not only embraced Obamacare, but took it out in his dad\u2019s station wagon and made out with it...It\u2019s not a strategy to win a Republican primary.\u201d\nThe same problems with Medicaid expansion also apply to Gov.\nAnd it should also surprise no one that 81 percent (on average) of the GOP primary voters from these states don\u2019t support President Obama\u2019s health care law."}
