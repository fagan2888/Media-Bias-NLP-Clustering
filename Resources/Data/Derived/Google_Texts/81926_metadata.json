MAVEN\u2019s mission is to discover what happened and to study, among other things, the sun\u2019s effect on the early atmosphere.\n\nThe images \u2014 released in four colored panels: blue, green, red and composite \u2014 are constructed from data gathered by MAVEN\u2019s Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph, which studies Mars\u2019 atmosphere.\n\nThe blue panel shows hydrogen gas extending away from the surface, while the green one depicts oxygen remaining closer to the surface.\n\nThese two elements are important because they come from the breakdown of water and carbon dioxide in Mars\u2019 atmosphere, as well as match what his team thought they would see, said Nick Schneider, who leads the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph science team at the University of Colorado.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the images matched our simulation means that it exceeded our expectations,\u201d he said.\n\nScientific data gathering officially begins in early November, when MAVEN enters its final orbit. Then, Schneider said, they can do some comparative work.\n\n\u201cWe want to take these same images when the sun is very active because we expect that hydrogen atmosphere to be heated up and expanded and maybe even even dissipate,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, India\u2019s Mars Orbiter Mission \u2014 or MOM, and named \u201cMangalyaan\u201d (Hindi for \u201cMars craft\u201d) \u2014 successfully entered the planet\u2019s orbit, making India the first Asian nation to accomplish this feat and the first nation to do it on a its first attempt.\n\nThe MAVEN team will work with MOM\u2019s team to help construct a precise picture of Mars.\n\n\u201cThe missions are complementary,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cThey have a UV instrument on board. We\u2019re going to be looking in closer in for the rest of the mission, and they\u2019re going to be looking farther out. They can provide important data.\u201d\n\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or twitter.com/LauraKeeney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NASA\u2019s MAVEN data provides first images of Mars\u2019 atmosphere", "title": "NASA\u2019s MAVEN data provides first images of Mars\u2019 atmosphere", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/24/nasas-maven-data-provides-first-images-of-mars-atmosphere/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140924__mavenp1.jpg", "height": 445}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140924__mavenp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-24T16:46:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:31:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde7e9\"", "article_summary": "The first data sent back from NASA\u2019s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution has resulted in images of the Red Planet.\nMAVEN entered Mars\u2019 orbit on Sunday night.\nThe images \u2014 released in four colored panels: blue, green, red and composite \u2014 are constructed from data gathered by MAVEN\u2019s Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph, which studies Mars\u2019 atmosphere.\nThe MAVEN team will work with MOM\u2019s team to help construct a precise picture of Mars.\nMAVEN\u2019s mission is to discover what happened and to study, among other things, the sun\u2019s effect on the early atmosphere."}
