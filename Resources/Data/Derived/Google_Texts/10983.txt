Scott Stapp says he is homeless and facing financial ruin because he criticized President Obama. During a radio interview on Thursday, the former Creed singer claims the IRS decided to destroy him after he publicly expressed disappointment in Obama during a Fox News interview in 2012.

The rocker explains that within two months of his comments about Obama, tax authorities began to freeze his bank accounts. “I believe that the IRS situation is definitely a result of me expressing my dissatisfaction with President Obama. Absolutely. 100 percent.”

Stapp revealed to the world how dire his situation is when he posted a Facebook video on Wednesday in which he admitted to being broke and homeless after what he described as massive theft by various parties. He is currently living in a Holiday Inn after spending weeks in a truck, without enough money for food or gas. During Thursday’s radio interview, Stapp said that no one from Creed has contacted him to offer help, nor have his friends and family.

In the 2012 television interview, Stapp said he was “disappointed” in Obama, whose administration he described as “ineffective.” Check out the original video of Stapp’s comments about Obama, as well as the audio from Thursday’s radio interview, below. Tell us what you think.
