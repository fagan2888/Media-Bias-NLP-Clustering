And a number of changes have the hospital looking better in the short-term, including the speed at which patients are paying their bills, he said.\n\n\u201cLast year it was taking us around 63 days to get paid (on average) and now we\u2019re down to around 42 days, which is much closer to industry standard,\u201d Allen said.\n\nAdditionally, one of the bigger holes in the hospital budget appears to be closing. Charity care, for which the hospital receives no reimbursement from either the patient or insurance, cost the hospital $500,000 last year. By this time of the year in 2015, the hospital had already lost over $300,000 on charity care. By the end of this March, that number is only $55,000.\n\n\u201cThere has been a big swing in charity care,\u201d Allen said.\n\nOne reason may be a new policy put in place for charity care, but Allen said he thinks the biggest factor is Gov. Walker\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid in Alaska \u2014 a provision made possible by the federal Affordable Care and Patient Protection Act of 2010.\n\n\u201cI think when we really drill down, that\u2019s going to be the main reason,\u201d Allen said.\n\nFor one, Allen said the hospital can now sign patients up for Medicaid as they come in, rather than treat them without coverage. So far they\u2019ve done that with 29 patients, Allen said.\n\nAs for the city\u2019s $1 million loan to the hospital, Allen said $100,000 of that has been paid back, and the hospital is hoping to make another large payment later this year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paid back $100,000 of that and my plan is we\u2019ll pay down about $400,000 of that this fall,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, the hospital is facing continuing challenges. Income is down about $700,000 more than anticipated, and Allen said that another one of the principal factors that led to the hospital\u2019s financial struggles is still causing problems.\n\nThe electronic health records system that the hospital selected to manage all patient records has not worked, Allen said.\n\n\u201cWe just got the wrong system and we did not have a good implementation,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that after he came to the hospital there were new efforts to make the system work, but new problems arose that led to the decision to start over.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so imperative to have that system work properly for everything we\u2019re doing, and we can\u2019t mess that up,\u201d he said.\n\nFinding a new system is expected to take two to three months, and up to a year to implement, Allen said.\n\nHe concluded his presentation by discussing efforts to better partner with SEARHC Mt. Edgecumbe Hospital. The two hospitals put out a request for proposals for a consultant to look into the effort, and ECG Management, a national company that focuses on health care, won the contract. Allen said that report will be vital to the long-term success of the hospital, as funding looks tighter at the state level.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk in the Legislature about Medicaid reform and what can be done, which means to cut, basically,\u201d Allen said.\n\nMedicaid funding accounts for over a quarter of hospital revenue. One of the sources of local funding for the hospital, the Sitka excise tax on tobacco products, took an interesting turn last August.\n\nAfter the Assembly doubled the local tobacco tax there was a surge in sales to smokers who wanted to stock up before the new tax took effect, Allen said.\n\nThe hospital had been getting around $30,000 to $40,000 a month in tobacco tax, but in the period between the time the higher tax was passed and the date it took effect, it took in $300,000.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s thrown off our entire revenue for tobacco tax,\u201d Allen said.\n\nThe windfall was added to last year\u2019s budget, but Allen said once it\u2019s all added up the numbers are about on track with what was expected.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, TOM HESSE, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "Sitka Community Hospital isn't out of the red yet but things are improving, CEO Rob Allen says.
