John Kasich, who has spent the past four years growing government, is trying to rebrand himself as a small-government reformer.\n\nThe Kasich Action Plan, which his presidential campaign released Thursday, emphasizes balancing the federal budget. Kasich plans to accomplish this by shifting education, welfare and infrastructure programs to the states.\n\nTailored to draw support from fans of his House Budget Committee chairmanship in the 1990s, the plan would attempt to spur job growth by cutting income tax rates and simplifying the tax code.\n\nChris Edwards, the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s director of tax policy studies, told Ohio Watchdog.org the Kasich Action Plan would be more compelling if not for Kasich\u2019s record as governor.\n\nWhile Kasich calls for reducing the number of federal income tax brackets from seven to three via legislation he will propose within his first 100 days as president, Ohio still has nine income tax brackets.\n\n\u201cThe plan sounds very fiscally conservative, but Kasich\u2019s been a big spender in Ohio,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe gave him a grade of D on the last Cato report card. He\u2019s a pretty good tax-cutter, but general fund Ohio spending has gone up 35 percent since he\u2019s been in office.\u201d\n\nKasich increased Ohio\u2019s General Revenue Fund spending by $4.6 billion in his first two biennial budgets, with spending growth accelerating each year.\n\n\u201cWhen he was in Congress, he was great. He was very much a fiscal conservative,\u201d Edwards said before noting Ohio\u2019s Medicaid costs \u201care soaring\u201d because of Kasich\u2019s embrace of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion.\n\nRELATED: Ohio Medicaid spending is skyrocketing under Gov. Kasich\n\n\u201cIn Ohio we reined in Medicaid costs,\u201d Kasich wrote in a Washington Post op-ed Thursday. But his Obamacare expansion has made Ohio more reliant on federal spending, which he promises to cut as president.\n\nKasich increased Medicaid spending 33 percent during his first term \u2014 driven by more than $4 billion in Obamacare expansion money in 18 months.\n\nOhio\u2019s total Medicaid spending was $17.7 billion when Kasich took office; it was $23.5 billion in the 2015 fiscal year ending in June. Due to Obamacare expansion, Ohio\u2019s Medicaid costs are expected to hit $28.2 billion by 2017.\n\n\u201cEducation is a local issue,\u201d Kasich wrote in his op-ed. \u201cWe need high standards, but they are not Washington\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nKasich supports the federally backed Common Core State Standards Initiative, and he opposes an Ohio House proposal to allow local school boards to opt out of using Common Core math and language arts standards.\n\n\u201cIf we want to get serious about economic growth, we need less government and more \u2018us,'\u201d the governor asserted in his Washington Post column. Four years after the creation of Kasich\u2019s taxpayer-funded JobsOhio, Ohio\u2019s job growth ranks in the bottom 10 nationally.\n\nAt the Kasich Action Plan unveiling in Nashua, New Hampshire, Kasich stressed the importance of leadership \u2014 a theme he revisits each time Republicans in the Ohio General Assembly resist his policies.\n\n\u201cWe need to come together to do what\u2019s in the best interest of our country: Lead. Sometimes it\u2019s lonely,\u201d Kasich said on Thursday. \u201cLead.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been uncomfortable with traveling a lonely road. I think that\u2019s what leaders do,\u201d Kasich said in April 2012, when he began pushing for higher severance taxes on oil and natural gas drilling.\n\nIn addition to fighting for a severance tax hike, the Republican governor has fought Republican legislative supermajorities for increases in the state Commercial Activity Tax, sales tax and tobacco tax.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a change agent, and when you\u2019re a change agent you just expect to walk a lonely road at times,\u201d Kasich said after the Ohio House stripped Obamacare expansion from his budget in 2013.\n\nTeasing the Kasich Action Plan\u2019s release in a Wednesday interview with Chuck Todd on MSNBC, Kasich lamented the idea that politicians \u201call want to spend.\u201d\n\nKasich said President George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress \u201cblew a $5 trillion surplus\u201d at the turn of the century because of a \u201clack of leadership.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened because, frankly, they weren\u2019t vetoing enough stuff,\u201d Kasich said, because \u201cthey just didn\u2019t care that much about spending, because when you stand up on spending, and you block programs, you make people angry.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Kasich vetoed the Ohio General Assembly\u2019s ban on implementing Obamacare expansion and then expanded the program without legislative approval.\n\nKasich had said Medicaid expansion would \u201cstick states with large and unsustainable costs\u201d \u2014 in the end, he did exactly as President Obama and hospital lobbyists wanted.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment about the conflicts between his record and his presidential campaign proposals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
