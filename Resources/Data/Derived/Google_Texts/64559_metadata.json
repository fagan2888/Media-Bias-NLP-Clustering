But he also promised that better policing is a priority.\n\nCalling the proposals \u201cfairly fluid\u201d due to budget issues at the federal and state levels, the mayor said an improving economy and new \u201cefficiencies\u201d would enable the city to add new programs in 2015. Murray said he would push for the hiring of 50 new SPD officers to join the 1,300 already serving the city with a goal to add 100 officers before the end of his term.\n\nMurray said his SPD budget priorities for 2015 were to include more \u201ccivilian expertise,\u201d be more data driven, include more community, and to have more officers.\n\nMurray also said Friday his administration will hire a civilian chief information officer to help ensure \u201cbetter policing.\u201d New Chief Kathleen O\u2019Toole is deploying CompStat-driven patrol decisions that have driven how big city forces like NYPD are utilized.\n\n\u201cMore accountability remains our priority,\u201d Murray said Friday.\n\nMurray matched his SPD budget announcement with priorities for human services spends in 2015 including money to \u201cbackfill\u201d the DESC of Seattle service centers budget, support Project 360 to aid homeless youth, and help fund the Urban Rest Stop hygiene center.\n\nMurray also pledged to fund an initiative to increase capacity at Seattle shelters to help the nearly 3,000 people who sleep on the streets and create a program to transition \u201clongterm stayers\u201d to permanent housing. Earlier this year, CHS reported on the increase in trespass enforcement around Capitol Hill as the homeless population in the central city continues to climb.\n\nThe announcements come as the Murray administration has scrambled to address concerns over a rise in street crime on Capitol Hill and in the downtown core.\n\nEarlier this month, SPD increased patrols, put more officers on foot beats, and began deploying gang units in Pike/Pine in an effort to quell a spike in muggings, pickpockets, and assaults. Murray also responded to calls from business owners and the Chamber of Commerce with a pledge of a new \u201ccommunity policing\u201d plan for the East Precinct to be unveiled by Capt. Pierre Davis \u201csoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe short-term strategy is obviously we\u2019re saturating this place not just with precinct resources but with city-wide resources,\u201d SPD Chief Kathleen O\u2019Toole told CHS about the efforts around Pike/Pine. \u201cThe long-term strategy is that we\u2019re developing a community policing plan for every neighborhood of the city.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, officials are trying to be creative about solving Pike/Pine\u2019s crime issues until more officers can be brought onboard and the new funding kicks in. Starting this weekend, Seattle Parks says it will leave the sports field lights on in Cal Anderson until 2:30 AM to help the neighborhood\u2019s nightlife revelers make it home safely.\n\nUPDATE: Here\u2019s the full announcement from the mayor\u2019s office:\n\nMurray announces $3.3 million for new officers and $2.75 million for human services, including $1.5 million for more homelessness services SEATTLE (Sept. 12, 2014) \u2013 Seattle Mayor Ed Murray announced that his 2015-16 budget to be formally proposed on Sept. 22 will make new investments in public safety and the safety net, and today provided detail for his plans to fund best practices both in the police department and in homelessness services. \u201cThis administration will use the budget process to drive more transparency and innovation in City government, as well as better organization and performance,\u201d said Murray. \u201cPublic safety is our number one priority, and my budget for the police department reflects these basic budgeting principles by investing in best management practices, better use of data and more effective use of resources to get better outcomes.\u201d Murray\u2019s 2015-16 budget for the Seattle Police Department will propose funding more civilian expertise, including a civilian Chief Operating Officer and a civilian Chief Information Officer for improved operations and systems management and innovation. The COO has been hired, and has already implemented CompStat, the crime and disorder data tracking and analysis method made famous by Commissioner William Bratton in New York City in the 1990s, where it was credited with reducing crime by 60 percent. \u201cCompStat will take the police department to the next level in observing, mapping and tracking patterns of crime and disorder, and in mobilizing, analyzing and evaluating officer response,\u201d said Murray. \u201cIt is a major reform that I believe is the key to our future success in crime prevention, in efficient and effective deployment of SPD resources, and in police accountability.\u201d CompStat will be used in conjunction with the \u201cmicro-policing plans\u201d that Chief Kathy O\u2019Toole will deliver and make publicly available by the end of 2014, Murray said. The plans will reflect the specific needs and circumstances of each of the unique neighborhoods of the city, and are intended to reconnect officers with the communities they serve. CompStat will provide timely and accurate data to inform an ever-evolving patrol strategy, focusing resources on areas of concern and ensuring that police are present and visible where needed most. Murray said O\u2019Toole is also conducting a resource allocation study of position assignments within the department, and will seek to reassign officers from lower priority work to the high-priority work of patrol wherever possible. Additionally, Murray\u2019s 2015-16 budget will propose $3.3 million to fill every recruit class available to the City of Seattle at the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Center in both 2015 and 2016. \u201cI pledged during the campaign that we would add one hundred fully trained officers by the end of my four-year term, and my budget proposal puts us on a stable path to get there,\u201d said Murray. \u201cBy the end of 2015, based on current forecasts for attrition, we will be halfway toward my goal of one hundred additional officers, and my next two-year budget will plan to close the remaining gap. By the end of 2016, my budget will fund the highest number of fully trained officers in SPD\u2019s history.\u201d Murray said his 2015-16 budget proposal will fully fund compliance with the federal court order. Murray also announced plans in his 2015-16 budget to add $2.75 million in new investments in human services. He said his proposal will leverage new resources for homelessness services in particular, including expanding the best-practice strategy of rapid rehousing, and creating capacity at homeless shelters by moving long-term stayers into permanent housing \u2013 a suite of new investments in homelessness services totaling $1.5 million annually in 2015 and 2016. \u201cInvestments in rapid rehousing are more successful and less costly than any other strategy for assisting unsheltered individuals,\u201d said Murray. \u201cI signed onto the First Lady\u2019s Challenge to End Veteran Homelessness by 2015, and my budget proposal includes funding for a rapid rehousing program targeted at veterans that will help us achieve this important goal.\u201d Murray\u2019s 2015-16 budget will propose $600,000 annually to fund a program for 150 homeless single adults, targeting veterans, to receive rapid placement into housing, rental assistance, and employment support. Murray\u2019s budget proposal will also fund efforts to move 25 of the longest-term stayers at homeless shelters into permanent housing, which will free up 3,375 shelter bed nights. \u201cThere are more than 2,300 individuals living unsheltered in Seattle on any given night, and emergency shelters are at capacity, said Murray, who said his budget proposal commits $410,000 annually to provide subsidies for rental assistance, congregate housing or shared housing for long-term stayers, and leverages funding from the United Way of King County in a dollar-for-dollar match. \u201cShelters are meant to serve a temporary need, but a number of individuals are staying in shelters long term, to where one quarter of shelter users consume three quarters of shelter bed nights. Moving long-term stayers into permanent housing will help those individuals and increase shelter bed capacity for those currently without shelter.\u201d Additional human service investments in Murray\u2019s 2015-16 budget include: A one-time matching contribution toward the capital redevelopment of the North Public Health Center located near North Seattle Community College ($500,000),\n\nMitigating proposed budget cuts at Seattle/King County Public Health ($400,000), including: o Supporting maternity services; women, infant and children services; and family planning services at Greenbridge Public Health Center ($150,000) o Access and outreach services for new enrollments in Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, o Family planning health educators ($50,000), o HIV/STD education and outreach ($50,000), o Gun violence prevention ($50,000)\n\nFunding for an additional 40,000 to 100,000 lbs. of fresh fruit, vegetables, meats, or other proteins for more than 40 participating food banks, meal programs, and other providers ($100,000),\n\nSupport for the Breakfast Group Mentoring Program, a program providing young men of color in Seattle Public Schools with wrap-around services, individualized instruction plans and mentoring to complete their secondary education and access higher education or employment opportunities ($100,000),\n\nSupport for the Rainier Valley Corp to recruit emerging leaders from diverse immigrant communities and provide training, support and mentorship ($75,000), and\n\nFunding to fill a gap in senior center services in Lake City ($70,000).\n\nShare: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CHS Capitol Hill Seattle", "description": "Mayor Ed Murray announced Friday that his 2015 City of Seattle budget proposals will include a boost in the number of police officers serving the city and increased spending on homeless and mental \u2026", "title": "Mayor announces more officers, better policing part of 2015 budget plan", "url": "http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2014/09/mayor-announces-more-officers-better-policing-part-of-2015-budget-plan/", "image": "http://www.capitolhillseattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Screen-Shot-2014-09-12-at-12.34.09-PM-600x285.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-12T19:46:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-15T04:59:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 8248752, "card": "summary", "site": "@chsfeed"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3152\"", "article_summary": "Mayor Ed Murray announced Friday that his 2015 City of Seattle budget proposals will include a boost in the number of police officers serving the city and increased spending on homeless and mental health services.\nMurray said his SPD budget priorities for 2015 were to include more \u201ccivilian expertise,\u201d be more data driven, include more community, and to have more officers.\nMurray also announced plans in his 2015-16 budget to add $2.75 million in new investments in human services.\nBy the end of 2016, my budget will fund the highest number of fully trained officers in SPD\u2019s history.\u201d Murray said his 2015-16 budget proposal will fully fund compliance with the federal court order.\n\u201cThis administration will use the budget process to drive more transparency and innovation in City government, as well as better organization and performance,\u201d said Murray."}
