Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201c@amandacarpenter May your children all die from debilitating, painful and incurable diseases,\u201d Brauer tweeted to Cruz speechwriter and senior communications advisor Amanda Carpenter early Friday afternoon, after Carpenter tweeted a gung ho message in support of using the Congress\u2019 power of the budget to shield the American people from the ill effects of the unpopular 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nTen minutes later Brauer hinted that the first attack had proven to be taxing work, tweeting, \u201cBusy blocking the tapeworms that have slithered out of hellspawn @amandacarpenter\u2019s asshole. How\u2019s your day so far?\u201d\n\nBut within another four minutes, all the laughter had died in sorrow as Brauer reported, \u201cI\u2019m being attacked on Twitter for wishing one of Ted Cruz\u2019s pubic lice to experience the pain her boss is inflicting on Americans.\u201d\n\nIndependent Journal Review collected some prior work from Brauer, highlighting the public relations specialist\u2019s use of the epithet \u201ccumrag\u201d to describe an interlocutor who was guilty of tweeting while female.\n\nCalifornia Democratic party communications director Tenoch Flores initially fed the trouble by telling Yahoo\u2019s Chris Moody, \u201cThe problem with this kind of rhetoric is that it lets fringe characters\u2014those who are actively trying to shut down the government\u2014like Ted Cruz, off the hook.\u201d\n\nBut by sunset on the West Coast, Brauer\u2019s flagrant violation of the public relations code of honor could no longer be ignored. He had brought scandal to his client and had to be dismissed.\n\n\u201cThe comments by our volunteer communications chair are appalling and inexcusable,\u201d DPSC chairwoman Kerri Asbury announced early Friday evening. \u201cNo matter what our political disagreements may be, wishing harm is never an acceptable response during heated public debate or any other time. Mr. Brauer has apologized for his comments and expressed his remorse.\u201d\n\nSacramento County is slightly less monolithically Democratic than most of California. In the 2012 election, President Obama carried the county by 58 percent to Mitt Romney\u2019s 39 percent, while incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein got more than 60 percent in her race against novice Elizabeth Emken. However, two out of the county\u2019s four U.S. congressmen are Republicans, as are all of its state senators.\n\nFollow Tim on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Tim Cavanaugh", "description": "Sacramento County party cans Allan Brauer over tweets about cloacal vermin and digestive parasites", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A\u00a0top Democratic flack in one of the country's most Democratic state capitals\u00a0became the first victim of the Obamacare defunding campaign Friday night when he was fired for filthy and reckless tweet", "title": "Democratic Party flack fired after psychotic tweets against Ted Cruz aide", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/20/democratic-party-flack-fired-after-psychotic-tweets-against-ted-cruz-aide/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/allanbauer.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sacramento County party cans Allan Brauer over tweets about cloacal vermin and digestive parasites", "title": "Democratic Party flack fired after psychotic tweets against Ted Cruz aide Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/20/democratic-party-flack-fired-after-psychotic-tweets-against-ted-cruz-aide/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/allanbauer.jpg"}, "creator": "@bigtimcavanaugh", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-20 23:07:50", "sailthru.title": "Democratic Party flack fired after psychotic tweets against Ted Cruz aide", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "california,democratic-party,obamacare,ted-cruz,tim-cavanaugh", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "california,democratic party,obamacare,public relations,sacramento,ted cruz", "sailthru.description": "A\u00a0top Democratic flack in one of the country's most Democratic state capitals\u00a0became the first victim of the Obamacare defunding campaign Friday night when he was fired for filthy and reckless tweet", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/allanbauer.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d46\"", "article_summary": "Allan Brauer, Communications Committee chairman for the Democratic Party of Sacramento County (DPSC) had his resignation accepted Friday following a series of unhinged tweets directed at an aide to Texas Republican Sen.
