Peter Shumlin had not even decided to run for the state\u2019s top office when the federal Affordable Care Act was signed into law in March 2010, but the landmark legislation would soon begin to shape his governorship in ways he could not have imagined.\n\nShumlin, who was sworn into office in January 2011, began his tenure as the state\u2019s chief executive with a trademark swagger. Now as he approaches the end, having announced in June that he will not seek a fourth term, he is hoping to leave in place a working exchange that he has championed, but which has struggled for two years and one month to meet Vermonters\u2019 expectations.\n\nThe governor held a news conference Thursday to announce that the site should finally work today, Nov. 1, as the open enrollment period for 2016 health care plans begins. He remains \u201ccautiously optimistic,\u201d he said, a phrase he has likely uttered hundreds of times in the past year when asked about the exchange\u2019s progress.\n\nIf the site works today, Vermonters will finally have the product they were promised, albeit with more sweat, tears and frustration than anyone anticipated, including the Vermonters it is intended to serve. If it doesn\u2019t, the travails of the past two-plus years will continue.\n\n\u2018Everything is fine\u2019\n\nShumlin and his team were confident in the weeks leading up to Vermont Health Connect\u2019s launch on Oct. 1, 2013. Although some \u201cbells and whistles\u201d would not be ready for prime time, the site would generally work and provide Vermonters with the means to obtain affordable health care coverage, the governor maintained.\n\nThe state\u2019s original contractor, CGI, continued to project confidence in the technology until just before the launch, according to Shumlin. In fact, it was on the return trip home from a trip to China, with just days to go before the launch, when CGI delivered bad news, Shumlin said in an interview with the Vermont Press Bureau.\n\n\u201cI had been told that we were going to be driving a Chevy Chevette and that the bells and whistles would be added in the following year, but the Chevy Chevette would get you where you needed to go,\u201d Shumlin, sitting around a conference table with his top staffers, said. \u201cWhen I landed back in Seattle that day to change plans they were having a discussion on whether we would go forward or not.\u201d\n\nLawrence Miller, Shumlin\u2019s chief of health care reform, was secretary of commerce at the time. He recalled receiving assurances prior to the China trip that the exchange was on track. The governor, he was told, was free to pitch Vermont to overseas companies as a good place to do business.\n\n\u201cI had talked to (Mark Larson, former commissioner of Vermont Health Access) before we went just to be certain that we should be taking him to China,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Do we need to cancel that? No, everything is fine,\u2019\u201d Miller said.\n\nEverything is not fine\n\nBut in the days after the exchange\u2019s launch, bugs emerged. The site was slow and clunky. Even larger issues would soon emerge. Vermonters and the media began to grasp the significance of the functions that would not be available.\n\nShumlin and his staff also began to understand the challenges that were ahead.\n\n\u201cThe first several months were hell on wheels for all of us because we had more and more Vermonters who were backed up, unable to get the plans they wanted, unable to get a proper bill, unable to know whether they had health insurance coverage or not,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cJust like the federal government was facing, just like other states were facing. It was not a happy time.\u201d\n\nShumlin said President Barack Obama and other states that had built their own exchanges like Vermont were experiencing similar issues.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worth mentioning that we were as surprised as every other governor in America at about the same time and the president of the United States,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cWhen CGI told the president of the United States that their website was not going to work, that\u2019s about the same time that CGI told the governor of Vermont that his website was not going to work, and it was right before the launch. We all got the same treatment. Everything was beautiful until it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe administration and the insurance carriers offering plans on the exchange \u2014 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, MVP Health Care and Delta Dental \u2014 began work on contingency plans to allow Vermonters to enroll in plans. That process, although cumbersome and not automated as expected, seemed to work.\n\n\u201cPretty quickly we were able to get to a point where there was smooth enrollment process,\u201d said Cassandra Gekas, the exchange\u2019s operations manager.\n\nDon George, president and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield, said his company was concerned about the site\u2019s readiness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a bit opaque about just where the state is and what we should expect. They own and are operating the work plan,\u201d he told the Vermont Press Bureau. \u201cWe were very concerned about the state\u2019s readiness to go live.\u201d\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, George said he does not believe the administration misled his company or the public.\n\n\u201cI think that the state really felt, given where they were at, that this was going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we were in the dark. I think they were representing to us the status as they believed it was.\u201d\n\nThe company, acting on its initial concerns, prepared contingency plans ahead of the launch. Their preparation proved to be fortuitous. BCBS employees were able to work with customers and get them coverage.\n\n\u201cThey could have been in a circumstance in which their heads were exploding. They were very patient,\u201d he said.\n\nAnger, frustration\n\nTrinka Kerr, chief health care advocate at the Office of the Health Care Advocate, a division of Vermont Legal Aid, saw a different side. She said the exchange\u2019s struggles have had a major impact on many Vermonters.\n\n\u201cWe heard about a lot of different problems that people have had over the last couple of years. Problems that lasted for months and sorted of snowballed into other problems,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been hell for a lot of people. It really has. Really, really frustrating. That\u2019s not a secret.\u201d\n\nThere were many customers who had paid their premiums but did not have active coverage. Many of them delayed seeking health care treatment because they feared they would be on the hook for the costs, Kerr said.\n\n\u201cVermont Health Connect worked pretty hard to handle those cases as fast as they could, but they happened,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of them had tried to resolve the problems by themselves for months and were really frustrated and really angry. And if they had health care needs that compounded it.\u201d\n\nKerr added, \u201cThere have been plenty of angry people and you can\u2019t really blame them when they\u2019ve been making calls for months and not getting anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe governor insists he was not insulated from the frustration Vermonters were feeling. In fact, he said, he spoke to many of them personally as they struggled with the system.\n\n\u201cWho do you think they called? I talked to plenty of people who were pissed off that they called Vermont Health Connect, that they called my 800 number, and they hadn\u2019t gotten results,\u201d Shumlin said.\n\n\u201cI was talking to them. Everyone on the fifth floor was talking to them. We were all talking to them. There were over 10,000 of them,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller said, \u201cI\u2019d get referrals by text from people complaining in the grocery store to (the governor).\u201d\n\nShumlin added, \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Lawrence, here\u2019s another one. I just talked to them.\u2019\u201d\n\nBacklog of 10,000\n\nLooking back, Shumlin said the state should have lowered its own expectations and those of the Legislature and the public.\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake we made was not narrowing the scope of the work to what absolutely had to happen to make it function on that date,\u201d Shumlin said.\n\nGeorge, despite the hardship on Blue Cross, said he is not interested in pointing fingers at the governor or anybody else.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking or looking for him to take any more responsibility than he already has,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve continued with Optum and the people there to work long and hard. The governor\u2019s continued to hold people accountable to get it done. So, Blue Cross is not looking for anything further from the administration.\u201d\n\nDespite the extensive efforts by BCBS and other insurers, plenty of Vermonters remained in the lurch, especially those who needed to change personal information related to their accounts. The exchange was supposed to allow costumers to make online changes to their accounts, such as a marriage, the birth of a child or a change in jobs. But that function was not ready, and CGI could not figure it out quickly.\n\nThe result was a backlog of requested changes that had to be done through a manual, paper process. The staff of VHC could not keep up with them and at one point the pending requests numbered more than 10,000.\n\nBilling errors began to occur because changes were not reflected on customers\u2019 accounts. The problems for the Shumlin administration began to compound.\n\n\u201cThe lowest point of morale was when we had change-of-circumstances stacking up,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe had to be hiring extra people to come and do manual work that we knew was going to take forever, and our technology contractors were clear that there was no quick fix to our challenges. That went on for six, seven months.\u201d\n\nThe Blues blues\n\nThe lacking function also created problems for BCBS, said George. Bill discrepancies began to surface. For 2014 health plans, the company is owed $1.6 million for premiums that have not been paid and for claims it paid on insurance plans that had been terminated. The lacking technology did not provide a smooth flow of information to let the insurer know when plans were not active. The company expects to be owed additional money for 2015 health plans.\n\nThe company also incurred additional costs in the \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d to accommodate the contingencies and manual workarounds required to provide insurance to Vermonters on the exchange.\n\nGeorge said the company is not asking the state to cover those costs, and the company has managed to absorb them without passing it on in premiums.\n\n\u201cWe went through it with the lights burning in the building 24-7 and with the employees working extremely hard, but they bought in really early on to a mission commitment to always put the customers first,\u201d George said.\n\n\u201cThe conclusion that we came to as a group \u2026 was that a lot of our customers are about to have a really bad experience unless you\u2019re willing to step up and do something extraordinary in terms of the contingencies,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody in the company went forward with that commitment.\u201d\n\nHe conceded that the last two years have been an \u201cintense\u201d time for the company. But George said he and his employees worked hard to not \u201close our cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have frustrating thoughts and moments, but if you demonstrate them to your employees or your partners it doesn\u2019t help. It doesn\u2019t go toward a productive end,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAs difficult as the sledding becomes, you have to continue to think in terms of the solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I have a concern it\u2019s just this great culture that I\u2019m a beneficiary of here and these hardworking people, that the fabric of that will begin to come unraveled.\u201d\n\nWas it junk?\n\nIn the weeks and following the exchange\u2019s launch, Shumlin had a few immediate concerns. \u201cHow do we tread water long enough to figure out how no Vermonter loses health care coverage?\u201d he said.\n\nNext in line was assessing how to begin moving forward. Shumlin said he initially had one main question that required an immediate answer.\n\n\u201cIs what CGI built such junk that we need to scrap it and start again, or did they do enough good work so that there\u2019s a framework with which another contractor can come in and work on?\u201d he said.\n\nDoubts about CGI within the administration were rampant. So Shumlin\u2019s staff showed CGI\u2019s work to other contractors, including Optum, \u201cquietly while we were still working with CGI,\u201d he said. CGI would eventually be fired and replaced by Optum.\n\n\u201cThe direct conclusion was very clearly CGI did some good work here,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cWhat they were asked to do in the timeline that was laid out was no easier for CGI than it was for Oracle and the other large contractors that do this kind of work. And while they certainly gave us plenty of challenges, the basic body of the Chevy Chevette was not only savable but there was quality in that work. That was the good news for Vermont.\u201d\n\nThe governor said he leaned hard on CGI in the months after its launch to address the core issues with the site.\n\n\u201cI had many, many conversations with the CEO of CGI, so many that in the process of those conversations I asked everything, I said everything, and it wasn\u2019t always my most diplomatic moment,\u201d he said.\n\nNo A team for Vt.\n\nThe technology firm had fires to put out around the country, however. The federal site, also built by CGI, was in disarray and needed to be fixed. Shumlin said Vermont\u2019s project suffered as CGI\u2019s talent was focused elsewhere.\n\n\u201cMy sense of what happened was this: behind the scenes, and I\u2019ve never said this to the press, the president of the United States and I had the same contractor and the same problem. I think the president got the A team,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cWe clearly didn\u2019t have the A team coming in to fix our website.\u201d\n\nMiller left his position as commerce secretary and shifted to a new role overseeing Vermont Health Connect in early 2014. His first duties were to assess the assets in place and determine how to move forward.\n\n\u201cA lot of it at first was just walking around and saying, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve got to go on vacation. You\u2019re out of here for a week. Nobody is working seven days a week anymore. You have to take at least one day off,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMiller\u2019s arrival on scene began a host of changes, most notably the end of the state\u2019s relationship with CGI. Optum, which had \u201cbailed out the president,\u201d according to Shumlin, was hired to finish the job.\n\n\u201cOptum has been a dream. They have actually delivered on the promises they have made,\u201d he said. \u201cCGI did not deliver on the promises that they made. That\u2019s why we\u2019re no longer working with them.\u201d\n\nShumlin said he has been heavily involved with the project all along, joining meetings or conference calls each morning about VHC\u2019s progress. He said he continues to urge the state\u2019s partners to work faster.\n\n\u201cI get on the phone and pound on \u2014 or I work collaboratively with our contractors, with the CEO of Optum, with all the teams,\u201d he said, correcting himself mid-sentence.\n\nLine in the sand\n\nStill, even after Optum was hired, calls to abandon Vermont Health Connect began to grow louder.\n\nFirst it was largely from Republicans and opponents of the state-run exchange. But, by the beginning of 2015, even some Democrats began losing patience. House Speaker Shap Smith, now also a candidate for governor, began to harden his stance and said the state should begin a transition to the federal site if specific benchmarks Shumlin laid out in March were not met.\n\nShumlin, in laying out those benchmarks that called for adding the automated change-of-circumstance and reducing the change backlog, essentially drew a line in the sand. Should the state not meet them, he would begin the transition. But the governor maintained that a switch to the federal site would be bad news for Vermonters because they would lose state-level subsidies, making their insurance more expensive.\n\n\u201cWe could not go to the federal exchange without literally screwing a lot of low-income Vermonters,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cWhen folks were losing confidence because of the political pressure it was my job to say, \u2018Listen, there are times when you have to do the right thing despite the politics,\u2019 and I\u2019m glad that we did.\u201d\n\nGeorge said he does not believe that leaders should be faulted \u201cfor taking bold steps.\u201d BCBS still prefers that Vermont operate a functioning exchange of its own. Switching to the federal site \u201cwould cost us a sizable amount to go through that project again,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think, ultimately, having a Vermont exchange is best for Vermonters if we can make it work,\u201d George said. \u201cThere are 37 states that now are with the federal exchange. There are 13 with a state exchange. I think health care is local, and ultimately, a state exchange is local and it\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nFinally\n\nAs VHC staff shifted into overdrive to ensure that Vermonters were receiving their health care benefits, the administration and managers were concerned about the toll that the exchange\u2019s problems \u2014 and its portrayal in the press \u2014 were taking on them.\n\n\u201cThey read the press and they were up there just trying to get people insurance \u2026 and everyone is saying that we, and they, are scoundrels. They were just trying to do the right thing,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t concerned about the political problem.\u201d\n\nHealth Commissioner Harry Chen, for a time, served as the interim secretary of the Agency of Human Services. Doug Racine, who was secretary when the exchange launched, was fired in August 2014. Chen said the VHC staff impressed him with their determination to deliver results for Vermonters.\n\n\u201cI have never seen a group of people who keep coming back the next day when most people in their right minds wouldn\u2019t come back that next day,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThey\u2019re coming back knowing how long it\u2019s going to take, how big that pile is, but they kept coming back. It\u2019s astounding to me. Now, things are obviously a lot different.\u201d\n\nDespite two years of struggle, Shumlin said the state has managed to reduce its uninsured rate to 3.7 percent \u2014 tied for lowest in the country with Massachusetts.\n\nMore Vermonters have access to health insurance than ever before, even if it took longer than expected to complete the project, he said.\n\n\u201cNo question that this has been the biggest, most difficult challenge to deliver on,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are real people, with real lives, who work their tails off \u2014 sometimes with two, three jobs \u2014 and they finally have health insurance.\u201d\n\nneal.goswami @timesargus.com", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "newspaper, timesargus, montpelier, barre, vermont, election results, news, daily news, sports, obituaries, editorial, events, community, calendar, headlines, classifieds, real estate", "google-site-verification": "Gy2TvJVOPRCmiGNmQzTV43qo8_S1H7alfF6MwpfcLhM", "y_key": "a158acb4f2ab39b3", "Description": "Times Argus Online  -  Vermont news, Vermont election results, Barre News, Montpelier News, Central Vermont News, local news, Vermont government, Vermont sports, Vermont classifieds, Jobs in Vermont", "Subject": "Vermont Election News & Information"}, "article_summary": "Anger, frustrationTrinka Kerr, chief health care advocate at the Office of the Health Care Advocate, a division of Vermont Legal Aid, saw a different side.\n\u201cVermont Health Connect worked pretty hard to handle those cases as fast as they could, but they happened,\u201d she said.\nLine in the sandStill, even after Optum was hired, calls to abandon Vermont Health Connect began to grow louder.\n\u2018Everything is fine\u2019Shumlin and his team were confident in the weeks leading up to Vermont Health Connect\u2019s launch on Oct. 1, 2013.\n\u201cHow do we tread water long enough to figure out how no Vermonter loses health care coverage?\u201d he said."}
