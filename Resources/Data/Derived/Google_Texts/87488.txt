(CNN) Ben Carson sounds skeptical that the recent death of a Baltimore man in police custody was a mistake.

The type of severe spinal injury suffered by Freddie Gray "requires a great deal of direct pressure to that area," meaning, "there is a high likelihood that direct trauma occurred," the presidential prospect wrote on Facebook Friday.

"It would be almost impossible to acquire such an injury by simply rolling around in a van, regardless of how violently," he wrote Friday on Facebook. "Let us hope that whoever inflicted said trauma did not intend to yield such an outcome."

Carson's comments resonate uniquely among those who are seeking or are likely to seek the White House in 2016. He -- as was Gray -- is African-American. Carson is also a retired neurosurgeon and a former resident of Baltimore.
