For the first hundred years of cinema, when images were captured on celluloid and processed photochemically, disregard for black skin and its subtle shadings was inscribed in the technology itself, from how film-stock emulsions and light meters were calibrated, to the models used as standards for adjusting color and tone. That embedded racism extended into the aesthetics of the medium itself, which from its very beginnings was predicated on the denigration and erasure of the black body. As far back as \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d \u2014 in which white actors wearing blackface depicted Reconstruction-era blacks as wild-eyed rapists and corrupt politicians \u2014 the technology and grammar of cinema and photography have been centered on the unspoken assumption that their rightful subjects would be white.\n\nSundance Selects\n\nDeadspin\n\nThis Is Not Lesbian Pornography: Blue Is The Warmest Color, Defended\n\nTim Grierson\n\nWe're used to colorful back stories and inflated brouhahas impinging on our relationship with a movie. (Lars Von Trier, for one, can't seem to make a film without pissing off his leading lady or saying something stupid at a press conference.) In the world of art house cinema, which doesn't have the high profile of even the lowliest Hollywood movie, a little attention-causing controversy never hurts. But instead of Blue's NC-17 rating causing that controversy, it's the question of whether the man who demanded such intense performances went too far to achieve them. Suddenly, the emotional starkness on display in Blue doesn't feel like the work of three like-minded artists working in unison but, rather, the results of an older, unwavering tyrant (Kechiche is 52) browbeating his young actresses to keep filming even when, according to Seydoux, Exarchopoulos cut herself during an argument scene. These accusations fundamentally change the perception of Blue's intentions\u2014and could, I fear, irreparably alter viewers' impressions of what Kechiche and his actresses accomplished. The movie's intimacy and honesty\u2014which is suggested by the spontaneous, natural performances and Kechiche's caught-on-the-fly handheld shooting style\u2014are delivered with such rawness that we don't want to think it was achieved underhandedly. And if these two women stripped for extended sex scenes and later felt that he was too demanding of them, then the discussion shifts uncomfortably toward questions of male power plays and female subjugation. That's more serious than Von Trier making dumb jokes about identifying with Adolf Hitler. It gets close to exploitation. I don't want to dismiss the actresses' complaints. But I also don't think they should overshadow Blue's considerable merits.\n\nThe New York Times\n\nThis Bubblegum, Too, Shall Pop\n\nBen Ratliff\n\n\u201cStripped-down\u201d is a crazy description for \u201cPrism\u201d \u2014 a good interview decoy, a good term to use when you\u2019re telling your audience that you\u2019re making progress. The record is, if anything, more grandiose and researched than her earlier work. If Ms. Perry is acting out healthy vulnerability, she\u2019s showing the less healthy side, too. She seems lonelier and looking for validation, more ready to follow the status quo. A fair amount of \u201cPrism\u201d leans toward sounds that won Grammy Awards last year and some that will probably win them this year \u2014 parade drums, optimistic anthems sung in raggedy unison, and careful retreads from \u201970s and \u201980s dance music. It\u2019s fine to frame the musical quotations in the album as post Pop-art collage. But that collage seems to be the last five volumes of \u201cNow That\u2019s What I Call Music!,\u201d not the presumed supercollider of a pop savant\u2019s imagination. The outside echoes don\u2019t stop with \u201cRoar.\u201d Here\u2019s a straight \u201990s Euro-house track, \u201cWalking on Air\u201d: one waits for a wink to the audience, the acknowledgment that she\u2019s in on the game, but it doesn\u2019t really come. (Maybe straight homage is a form of vulnerability?) Here\u2019s \u201cLegendary Lovers,\u201d with a sitar loop and vapid lyrics intimating Eastern spirituality, speaking of karma, third eyes, and mantras; to call it a knowing rip on, say, mid-period-Madonna spirituality would be generous. Here\u2019s \u201cDark Horse,\u201d efficiently split between boilerplate trap and E.D.M., as well as the return of that Lumineer-y \u201chey!\u201d \u201cInternational Smile\u201d borrows Daft Punk\u2019s old rhythm feel, as well as its vocoder breakdowns. \u201cDouble Rainbow\u201d lays a 2011 Internet meme over a melody line that suggests Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cRunning Up That Hill.\u201d\n\nMagnolia\n\nNPR\n\nTime Untied: Why We'd All Be Better Off Without Release-Date Myopia\n\nLinda Holmes\n\nIf almost all of the coverage comes when the majority of people have no access, you're condemning a huge part of the audience \u2014 no matter what their level of curiosity, intelligence, and enthusiasm, no matter what they might bring to the table as a result of their unique experience \u2014 to passive engagement with criticism and culture. You're saying, \"Sit there while two coastal clumps talk about this really fascinating thing and decide what The Cultural Consensus is going to be, and then in a while, we'll ship it to you, by which point we won't be talking about it anymore.\" Looking at this kind of thing differently doesn't even mean that there's no right cultural moment to have a conversation; it just means that moment might be the one when something truly becomes a piece of cultural currency, which might be its arrival on demand, or on cable, or on PBS.\n\nInstagram / badgalriri\n\nThe Guardian\n\nRihanna, Lady Gaga and What's Really Behind Burqa Swag\n\nArwa Mahdawi\n\nOne of the many problems with burqa swag is its confusion over what a burqa is in the first place. There is a world of difference between a burqa, an abaya, a chador, a niqab etc. Yet in western discourse these are often grouped together. Indeed, the burqa has become something of a convenient symbol not just for the entire spectrum of Muslim culture, but for the Arab world and the Middle East in general. A handy way to lump all that \"otherness\" together and defuse the threat it poses. There's a certain glamour associated with the pariah status that, much as we might like to think otherwise, Muslims bear in western societies. Cavorting with the Muslim world generates a kind of transgression by proxy for the savvy pop star. You could say #burqaswag is this generation's Like a Prayer. While Madonna romping with saints and dancing around burning crosses may have shocked 1989 sensibilities, goading Catholics just isn't that risqu\u00e9 anymore. No, if you're really going to prove yourself as a modern day bad girl, the most effective place to do so is in a mosque. Indeed Madge herself appears to be quite aware of this. According to recent reports, Madonna is now studying the Qur'an.\n\nFox Searchlight\n\nGrantland\n\nThe Song of Solomon\n\nWesley Morris", "article_metadata": {"description": "The most intriguing articles about entertainment we&#39;ve come across in the past seven days", "author": "Nolan Feeney, Ashley Fetters, and Spencer Kornhaber", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The most intriguing articles about entertainment we&#39;ve come across in the past seven days", "title": "Burqas, Lesbians, and Black Skin: The Week's Best Pop-Culture Writing", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/Screen_Shot_2013_10_25_at_12.29.56_AM-3/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/Burqas-Lesbians-and-Black-Skin-The-Weeks-Best-Pop-Culture-Writing/280746/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf596\"", "article_summary": "No, if you're really going to prove yourself as a modern day bad girl, the most effective place to do so is in a mosque.\nBut I also don't think they should overshadow Blue's considerable merits.\nIn the world of art house cinema, which doesn't have the high profile of even the lowliest Hollywood movie, a little attention-causing controversy never hurts.\nWhile Madonna romping with saints and dancing around burning crosses may have shocked 1989 sensibilities, goading Catholics just isn't that risqu\u00e9 anymore.\nThat embedded racism extended into the aesthetics of the medium itself, which from its very beginnings was predicated on the denigration and erasure of the black body."}
