Keith Rothfus business is good, but they're keeping a wary eye on changes to minimum wage, interest rates and other factors.\n\n\u201cThat's my worst nightmare,\u201d Glen's Frozen Custard owner Glen \u201cRob\u201d Wilson said of the movement to increase the minimum wage. \u201cIf it goes to $15, I don't know what to do.\n\n\u201cIf you vote on anything, vote against raising the minimum wage,\u201d Wilson implored Rothfus, R-Sewickley, who joined Lower Burrell Mayor Rich Callender, retired mayor Don Kinosz and City Clerk Kelly Cook for a tour of city businesses.\n\nIn addition to the newly expanded Glen's Frozen Custard and GC Grill, the group stopped at Community Supermarket in Hillcrest Shopping Center, Hillcrest Distributing and Watson Real Estate.\n\nCallender said the tour was planned to give Rothfus a taste \u2014 literally in terms of Glen's custard \u2014 of the business climate in Lower Burrell.\n\nRepresentatives of all four businesses said they're doing well but are keeping an eye on how state and federal policies may affect them.\n\n\u201cWe have no complaints,\u201d said George Thimons, co-owner of the Community Supermarket grocery store for the past 25 years.\n\nThimons said the health insurance requirements under the federal Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, didn't impact their business because they already offered health benefits to their 90 employees, including part-timers.\n\nHowever, Thimons said that they provide insurance should be taken into consideration when raising the minimum wage is discussed.\n\n\u201cI think it would put a lot of people out of business,\u201d Thimons said.\n\nRothfus advocated for the market determining wages \u2014 such as when workers are in demand or when employers want to reward reliable employees.\n\nRothfus said he'd like to see the earned income tax credit program, which benefits low- to moderate-income people, made \u201cmore robust\u201d as a possible alternative to raising the minimum wage.\n\nWatson Real Estate, run by the father-and-son team both named Jim Watson, was the other longtime Lower Burrell business Rothfus visited.\n\nThe younger Jim Watson said the regional real estate market wasn't hit as hard as other parts of the country when the housing bubble burst in 2008.\n\nThe elder Jim Watson said their business is doing well, but he worries about the future if the historically low federal interest rate, which impacts mortgages, continues to increase.\n\nWatson and Kinosz told Rothfus about the Westmoreland County land bank in which they're involved, which aims to redevelop blighted properties such as the largely vacant Burrell Plaza on Leechburg Road.\n\nThe former home of J.C. Penney and Montgomery Ward department stores was the one dim spot on the otherwise sunny tour.\n\nGlen's wasn't the only new business Rothfus visited: Hillcrest Distributing is under new ownership and recently was remodeled.\n\nWarehouse manager Sean Robertson and worker Aaron Carter explained how their business took advantage of changes to the state liquor code last year that allows distributors to sell 12-packs of beer.\n\n\u201cThey did a beautiful job of expanding this,\u201d said Kinosz, who noted people often overlook that Lower Burrell is home to about 600 businesses.\n\nLiz Hayes is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
