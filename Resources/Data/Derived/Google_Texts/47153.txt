Explanations of the hints: epidemic proportions: obesity and other factors have fueled a diabetes crisis in the state; hands-free: Google might have been first with the driverless car concept, but now the old-line auto companies are getting in on it; also probably the cleanest: Singapore is known for having some of the strictest behavioral rules in the world; and I don't always do news quizzes, but when I do, it's Week to Week News Quiz: The Most Interesting Man in the World is known for saying "I don't always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis."
