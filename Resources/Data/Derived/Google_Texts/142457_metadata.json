A trace is possible, she said.\n\nA storm trough from the northwest is expected to enter Colorado late Thursday, giving a light chance of measurable snow in the metro area, Bowen said.\n\nEarly next week, rain, sleet and snow could reach Denver by Monday.\n\nTuesday and Christmas Eve should be great travel days in Colorado, Bowen said.\n\n\u201cIt is expected to be dry. Temperatures should be pretty nice,\u201d she said.\n\nDenver likely will have typical weather on Christmas, with temperatures climbing to the low 40s and a better chance of remaining dry than having snow.\n\nWhite Christmas days are somewhat rare in Denver, according to the Weather Service.\n\nUsing the definition of a White Christmas as at least an inch of snow on the ground, that has been the case only 38 percent of the time in the 114 years since 1900 \u2014 but 50 percent of the time in the past 30 years.\n\nBut for those who believe a White Christmas means at least a trace of snow must fall from the skies that day, that has happened only 14 percent of the time in 132 years since 1882, and 17 percent of the time the past 30 years.\n\nThe most snow ever recorded on the ground in Denver on Christmas was 24 inches, the day after the blizzard of 1982. The heaviest snowfall on Christmas was 7.8 inches in 2007, which broke a 113-year record.\n\nA relatively recent Christmas considered another \u201ctruly white Christmas\u201d was in 2006. A snowstorm Dec. 20 and 21 dropped 2 feet of snow. By Christmas, there was still 15 inches on the ground.\n\nThat came just one year after the balmiest Denver Christmas on record, when temperatures climbed to 69 degrees under sunny skies and the low temperature remained above freezing at 35 degrees.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver may yet have a White Christmas", "title": "Denver may yet have a White Christmas", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/20/denver-may-yet-have-a-white-christmas/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-20T12:38:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T12:38:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A relatively recent Christmas considered another \u201ctruly white Christmas\u201d was in 2006.\nWhite Christmas days are somewhat rare in Denver, according to the Weather Service.\nThat came just one year after the balmiest Denver Christmas on record, when temperatures climbed to 69 degrees under sunny skies and the low temperature remained above freezing at 35 degrees.\nA winter storm warning is in place for the mountains Saturday and Sunday, with the heaviest snow expected Sunday afternoon.\nThe most snow ever recorded on the ground in Denver on Christmas was 24 inches, the day after the blizzard of 1982."}
