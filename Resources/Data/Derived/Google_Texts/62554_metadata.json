They were political enemies since ... the 1950s,\" one source said.\n\nIn China, leftists are opposed to market-oriented reforms and Western-style democracy, while rightists are more liberal-minded. Precisely where President Xi sits is fluid, which is how he wants it, experts say.\n\n\"Xi went because he needs leftists in his fight against corruption,\" the source said.\n\nExperts believe that, in a worst-case scenario, conservatives could try to oust Xi, especially if the economy falters further and unemployment sky-rockets.\n\nThe president has walked a tightrope targeting \"tigers\", or senior figures, in his corruption crackdown.\n\nAmong them has been former security tsar Zhou Yongkang, a conservative heavyweight jailed for life in June.\n\nDespite that balancing act and China's plunging stock markets, Xi is sure to display confidence when he holds talks with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington this week and give little ground on issues that bedevil ties, from cyber security to China's territorial ambitions.\n\n\"HE'S THEIR GUY\"\n\nXi has also paid tribute to those on China's political right.\n\nZeng Yanxiu, the first party member purged in the 1957 Anti-Rightist movement against liberal intellectuals, died in Beijing on March 3, according to sources close to the family. He was 96.\n\nThe party banned the holding of a public service because Zeng's death coincided with the annual full session of parliament, the sources said.\n\nNeither Xi nor his father were close to Zeng, but the president sent a wreath, they added.\n\n\"Xi has been courting both the left and the right in the party,\" a second source with leadership ties said. \"Xi is a pragmatist, neither a rabid conservative nor excessive liberal.\"\n\nIn the living room of Zeng's flat at the time, a Reuters reporter saw visitors bow before a portrait of Zeng, flanked by wreaths from Xi and other leaders.\n\n\"Xi draws strength from convincing both sides of the ideological divide that he's their guy,\" said Christopher Johnson, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, referring to Xi's focus on funerals.\n\nAnother notable funeral Xi attended was for Qiao Shi, 90, a former chairman of parliament and once head of the party's anti-corruption watchdog who was a proponent of strengthening the legal system. Qiao died in Beijing on June 14.\n\nDISQUIET IN THE RANKS\n\nXi also went to the funeral of General Zhang Zhen, former vice chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission, who died in Beijing on Sept. 3 aged 100.\n\nAnti-graft investigators have focused particular attention on the military, causing much disquiet throughout the ranks, sources have said.\n\nWhile Xi appears to have attended no public weddings since assuming power, his own showed his penchant for keeping his cards close to his chest.\n\nXi, then 34, and his wife, Peng Liyuan, then 24 and a popular army singer, exchanged vows in a simple ceremony at Xi's home in the southeastern port city of Xiamen in 1987 where he was a vice mayor, official media reported last year.\n\nXi then informed the mayor, who invited colleagues to a dinner.\n\nThe first to arrive recognized Peng and asked, while shaking Xi's, hand: \"Why is she here?\"\n\nXi replied: \"She is my wife\", official media said.\n\n(Reporting by Benjamin Kang Lim.
