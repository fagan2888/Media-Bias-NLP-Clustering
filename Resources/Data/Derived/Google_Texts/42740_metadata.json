Sweeping government efforts to stop attacks are backfiring abroad and infringing on basic rights at home. CIA drone strikes are killing scores of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen. The National Security Agency is eavesdropping on tens of millions of phone calls worldwide \u2014 including those of 35 foreign leaders \u2014 in the name of U.S. security. And the Department of Homeland Security is using algorithms to \u201cprescreen\u201d travelers before they board domestic flights, reviewing government and private databases that include Americans\u2019 tax identification numbers, car registrations and property records. Will we create a Minority Report-style Department of Precrime next? Obama administration officials have a duty to protect Americans from terrorism. But out-of-control NSA surveillance, an ever-expanding culture of secrecy and still-classified rules for how and when foreigners and even Americans can be killed by drone strikes are excessive, unnecessary and destructive.\n\nTwelve years after September 11, 2001, the United States\u2019 obsession with al Qaeda is doing more damage to the nation than the terrorist group itself. Two new reports issued this week by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch detailed dozens of civilian deaths caused by drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. Classified documents obtained by the Washington Post suggest that CIA officials who carry out the strikes make little effort to track civilian deaths. \u201cThere is a lot more pressure building\u201d on President Barack Obama, Sarah Holewinski, head of the Center for Civilians in Conflict, a group pushing for greater transparency in drone strikes, told me this week. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have to look at these legal questions.\u201d Documents leaked by whistleblower Edward J. Snowden emerged this week, revealing NSA phone monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, 35 unidentified heads of state, and 70 million calls in France. The extent of the surveillance is sparking widespread indignation and endangering joint counter-terrorism operations among Germany, France and the United States. \u201cThe perception here is of a United States where security has trumped liberty,\u201d New York Times columnist Roger Cohen wrote from Berlin on Thursday, \u201cintelligence agencies run amok (vacuuming up data of friend and foe alike), and the once-admired \u2018checks and balances\u2019 built into American governance and studied by European schoolchildren have become, at best, secret reviews of secret activities where opposing arguments get no hearing.\u201d There is a serious terrorist threat to the United States. The administration is under enormous pressure to prevent attacks. But there are ways to safeguard the United States without sparking such a serious backlash abroad and at home. Holewinski called on the Obama administration to implement its promise to move command of drone operations from the CIA to the American military. She said the shift, which Obama announced this spring, is going \u201cvery, very slowly.\u201d Military control is one step toward a key goal: greater transparency in countries where drone strikes are enormously unpopular. Keeping the drone strikes as a covert CIA-run program makes accountability and determining the true number of civilian deaths impossible, she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The government&#39;s ever-expanding culture of secrecy is excessive, unnecessary, and destructive.", "author": "David Rohde", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The government&#39;s ever-expanding culture of secrecy is excessive, unnecessary, and destructive.", "title": "Our Fear of Al-Qaeda Hurts Us More Than Al-Qaeda Does", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/10/minorityreport/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/10/Our-Fear-of-Terrorism-Hurts-Us-More-Than-Terrorism-Does/280897/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb396\"", "article_summary": "CIA drone strikes are killing scores of civilians in Pakistan and Yemen.\nBut there are ways to safeguard the United States without sparking such a serious backlash abroad and at home.\nThe extent of the surveillance is sparking widespread indignation and endangering joint counter-terrorism operations among Germany, France and the United States.\nKeeping the drone strikes as a covert CIA-run program makes accountability and determining the true number of civilian deaths impossible, she said.\n20th Century Fox Three disclosures this week show that the United States is losing its way in the struggle against terrorism."}
