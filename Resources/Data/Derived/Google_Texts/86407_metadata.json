What many might not realize is that he is also a skilled arbiter of oratory. Which, when you think about it, only stands to reason.\n\nTo be a skilled arbiter of oratory, of course you first must be a sharp observer of it. And Obama has proven he is. He has an ear for what others are saying. For instance, he has observed that \u201cthere are those who say we cannot invest in science.\u201d Those people are wrong, by the way: \u201cScience is more essential for our prosperity, our security, our health, our environment and our quality of life than it has ever been before.\u201d\n\nIt also has been his observation that \u201cthere are those who say high-speed rail is a fantasy.\u201d They\u2019re wrong, too: \u201cIts success around the world says otherwise.\u201d\n\nAnd he has noticed \u201cthere are those who say the plans in (my) budget are too ambitious\u201d\u2014but . . . well, you know.\n\nObama also has caught \u201cthose who\u201d saying other stupid things: that the \u201cterrorist threat is beyond our control,\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019re at war with Islam,\u201d that \u201cwe should defer health care reform\u201d and that \u201cwe are going too far.\u201d Do not listen to them who.\n\nHaving listened so intently to those who have said things, Obama has developed a keen sense of what is fair to say.\n\nTwo years ago, he allowed that it was fair to say the rollout of Obamacare \u201chas been rough so far.\u201d At the same time, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say that . . . we would not have rolled out something knowing very well that it wasn\u2019t going to work.\u201d And that also makes sense when you think about it, because as he pointed out on another occasion, it\u2019s also \u201cfair to say that all governments think they\u2019re doing what\u2019s right, and don\u2019t like criticism.\u201d\n\nLast summer, the president decided it was \u201cfair to say that the U.S.-New Zealand relationship has never been stronger.\u201d This must have come as a stinging rebuke to all those who have been talking trash about the U.S.-New Zealand relationship.\n\nNot that the relationship between New Zealand and the U.S. is an exclusive thing, mind you. They\u2019re free to see other people. As Obama said around the same time about the bond between America and Ireland, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say there are very few countries around the world where the people-to-people ties are so strong.\u201d And yet, at the same time, \u201cit\u2019s fair to say that we have very few friends, partners and allies around the world that have been as steadfast and reliable as His Majesty King Abdullah\u201d of Jordan. Don\u2019t call him a Pollyanna on foreign affairs, though. After all: \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that, although the relationship between the United States and the Czech Republic economically is very strong, it can always be stronger.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s relations with Congress have not always been so strong and reliable, which may be one reason \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say our democracy isn\u2019t working as well as we know it can.\u201d At times, he has grown downright testy. Still, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that I\u2019ve shown a lot of patience and have tried to work on a bipartisan basis as much as possible.\u201d And who could be a better judge of that than he is?\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering, \u201cAren\u2019t there some things that it isn\u2019t fair to say? For instance, suppose the president were to honor a bunch of police officers in a Rose Garden ceremony. Wouldn\u2019t it be fair to say that those guys must have suspected, at some point, that they would receive such an honor?\u201d\n\nNope. As the president put it in 2010, \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that the folks behind me never imagined they would be here today.\u201d Didn\u2019t see that coming, didja?\n\nAs a matter of fact, an astonishing number of things are fair to say, according to the president. It\u2019s fair to say Martin Luther King Jr. \u201cwasn\u2019t the coolest kid on campus.\u201d And that Washington, D.C., \u201cmoves a lot slower than NASCAR.\u201d And that \u201cif we didn\u2019t have poetry, that this would be a pretty barren world. In fact, it\u2019s not clear that we would survive without poetry.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that he\u2019s stretching things just a little to say it\u2019s fair to say a thing like that. And you know what? On that point, there are those who say the same.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "It's fair to say Obama knows what's fair to say.", "title": "Obama's Empty Rhetoric", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/06/obamas-empty-rhetoric", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14309195351674.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14309195351674.jpg", "description": "It's fair to say Obama knows what's fair to say.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama's Empty Rhetoric"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-06T14:30:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/a-barton-hinkle"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "President Obama has long been regarded as a skilled orator.\nHaving listened so intently to those who have said things, Obama has developed a keen sense of what is fair to say.\nAs a matter of fact, an astonishing number of things are fair to say, according to the president.\nWouldn\u2019t it be fair to say that those guys must have suspected, at some point, that they would receive such an honor?\u201dNope.\nAt this point, you might be wondering, \u201cAren\u2019t there some things that it isn\u2019t fair to say?"}
