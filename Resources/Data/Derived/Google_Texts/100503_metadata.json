Lee Denney, R-Cushing, made presentations before the House Public Safety Committee during a legislative study that Denney said she requested after three previous attempts to expand the database failed.\n\nBut Rep. Jerry McPeak, D-Warner, described the study as a one-sided presentation by advocates who he said overlooked the possible legal consequences of taking DNA samples from individuals who have been accused but not convicted of a crime.\n\n\u201cI am afraid of giving up my freedoms,\u201d McPeak said. \u201cThis is going to take it away. It\u2019s really not fair.\u201d\n\nAll states require DNA from people convicted of a serious felony, but 28 states and the federal government take DNA samples from at least some arrestees. In Oklahoma, defendants convicted of certain felonies and misdemeanors e are already required to provide DNA samples to determine if they can be linked to unsolved crimes.\n\nDenney wants authorities to be able to secure DNA samples earlier in the criminal justice process, even before charges are filed.\n\nMcPeak says he favors obtaining DNA samples after a judge rules there is probable cause and a defendant is ordered to stand trial.\n\nDenney\u2019s attempts to expand the database have been inspired by the case of Jewel \u201cJuli\u201d Busken, a University of Oklahoma ballet student from Benton, Arkansas, who was raped and murdered in 1996. Busken disappeared from her Norman apartment complex and was later found dead on the shore of Lake Stanley Draper in far southeast Oklahoma City.\n\nBusken\u2019s case went unsolved until 2004, when forensic examiners matched DNA from semen stains found on Busken\u2019s clothing to Anthony Castillo Sanchez, who was imprisoned on a burglary conviction. Sanchez was convicted of first-degree murder, rape and sodomy and sentenced to death in 2006.\n\nCleveland County Sheriff Joe Lester, who helped investigate Buskin\u2019s death, said Sanchez had been accused of unrelated felony crimes before he was linked to Buskin\u2019s death and could have been identified sooner if DNA samples were required at the time of arrest.\n\n\u201cI think it will be a tremendous tool for law enforcement,\u201d Lester said.\n\nAndrea Swiech, division director of criminalistics at the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, said DNA testing can not only link suspects to unsolved crimes but also exonerate others.\n\nSwiech said DNA evidence is routinely used to exclude suspects during investigations and sometimes overturns cases in which people have been wrongfully convicted, such as Thomas Webb, who was released from an Oklahoma prison in May 1996 after serving 14 years for a rape that DNA testing proved he did not commit.\n\nSwiech said expanding Oklahoma\u2019s DNA database would involve an additional 32,800 DNA tests each year and require an additional $1 million in funding in the first year the database is expanded for additional equipment and personnel at OSBI.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Oklahoma lawmaker's proposal to require people arrested on felony charges to provide a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities ran into opposition Tuesday from a House colleague who said he believes it goes too far.", "Author": "TIM TALLEY", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/7/expansion-of-oklahoma-dna-database-to-be-studied/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An Oklahoma lawmaker\u2019s proposal to require people arrested on felony charges to provide a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities ran into opposition Tuesday from a House colleague who said he believes it goes too far.", "title": "Lawmaker wants to expand Oklahoma\u2019s DNA database"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lawmaker wants to expand Oklahoma\u2019s DNA database", "description": "An Oklahoma lawmaker's proposal to require people arrested on felony charges to provide a DNA sample to law enforcement authorities ran into opposition Tuesday from a House colleague who said he belie", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd179d\"", "article_summary": "Denney wants authorities to be able to secure DNA samples earlier in the criminal justice process, even before charges are filed.\nSwiech said expanding Oklahoma\u2019s DNA database would involve an additional 32,800 DNA tests each year and require an additional $1 million in funding in the first year the database is expanded for additional equipment and personnel at OSBI.\nMcPeak says he favors obtaining DNA samples after a judge rules there is probable cause and a defendant is ordered to stand trial.\nIt\u2019s really not fair.\u201dAll states require DNA from people convicted of a serious felony, but 28 states and the federal government take DNA samples from at least some arrestees.\nIn Oklahoma, defendants convicted of certain felonies and misdemeanors e are already required to provide DNA samples to determine if they can be linked to unsolved crimes."}
