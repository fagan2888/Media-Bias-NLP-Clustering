It appeared he had tethered his boat to his waist as he walked through the salty shallows.\n\nThe modest boat had two pieces of plywood projecting from either side. As the man walked ahead of the boat, he was constantly reaching below the surface and tossing something into his boat. At times, he\u2019d come up with something in each hand.\n\nThis continued for a period of time. It became clear that the plywood was positioned to prevent whatever was piling up in the boat from spilling overboard.\n\nI watched for more than 45 minutes until I just had to know more. I suggested to my friend we venture to a little closer.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019ve never owned a boat, though I\u2019ve lived around water most of my life. I subscribe to the notion that it\u2019s not necessary to own a boat as long as you have a friend or two that do. It\u2019s even better if that friend who has the boat also shares a common curiosity about such matters.\n\nAnyway, so here\u2019s the deal. What I was watching was a horseshoe crab harvest.\n\nThis creature is ancient. It\u2019s been around more than half a billion years.\n\nBut why would someone be hauling every horseshoe crab it could find into his boat? Where is he taking them and what happens when they get there?\n\nIf those questions popped into your mind too, then you\u2019re just the kind of person with whom I\u2019d want to share a boat ride.\n\nBlue bloods\n\nAs it turns out, the blood of a horseshoe crab is valuable. How valuable? How does $15,000 a quart strike you?\n\nA horseshoe crab\u2019s blood is in high demand because it is used to screen every drug, implant and medical device before it is used in humans.\n\nIn short, it\u2019s used to test for bacterial contamination. The blood, which is baby blue in color, saves countless human lives every year.\n\nThere are a handful of labs in the country that collect this blood and one of those is located in Charleston.\n\nGenerally, in the space of 72 hours, the crab is captured, transported, cleaned, sterilized, bled and then returned back to the ocean.\n\nApproximately 200 to 400 milliliters of the blood are taken and research indicates anywhere from 6 percent to 30 percent of the creatures die in the process.\n\nAmy Fowler, a marine scientist at the Fort Johnson Marine Research Institute, says any person to ever receive a flu or polio vaccine or undergo any surgery owes their life to a horseshoe crab.\n\nA living fossil\n\nHorseshoe crabs belong to the arthropod group, as in spiders and scorpions.\n\nIn mid-April through the month of May, these creatures will once again make their way to our waters for their mating season.\n\nThey play a part in our ecosystem as well.\n\nThere are 13 different migratory birds that feed on horseshoe crab eggs. The red knot, for instance, makes a 30,000-mile trip from Brazil to the Arctic and depends on the eggs to fuel that journey.\n\nSo if you\u2019ve ever looked at a horseshoe crab and judged it by its looks, you\u2019ve totally missed the boat.\n\nThey suggest there\u2019s a greater lesson: that there\u2019s an overriding purpose for all of God\u2019s creatures. It\u2019s hard to believe we\u2019re all here by accident.\n\nReach Warren Peper at peperwarren@gmail.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Horseshoe crabs\u2019 blood saves lives, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nArts & Travel, \r\nWarren Peper, \r\nWarren Peper, blood  ,ecosystem,horseshoe crabs,living fossil", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A couple of years ago, while in a friend\u2019s boat in the Charleston harbor, I noticed something that demanded further investigation.", "title": "Horseshoe crabs\u2019 blood saves lives", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20160319/160329981/horseshoe-crabs-x2019-blood-saves-lives", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160319/PC12/160329981/AR/0/AR-160329981.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160319/PC12/160329981/AR/0/AR-160329981.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A couple of years ago, while in a friend\u2019s boat in the Charleston harbor, I noticed something that demanded further investigation.", "title": "Horseshoe crabs\u2019 blood saves lives", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20160319/PC12/160329981/AR/0/AR-160329981.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 160329981}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Horseshoe crabs\u2019 blood saves lives , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nArts & Travel, \r\nWarren Peper, \r\nWarren Peper, blood  ,ecosystem,horseshoe crabs,living fossil", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T16:31:00Z", "author": "Warren Peper"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A couple of years ago, while in a friend\u2019s boat in the Charleston harbor, I noticed something that demanded further investigation."}, "article_summary": "Blue bloodsAs it turns out, the blood of a horseshoe crab is valuable.\nSo if you\u2019ve ever looked at a horseshoe crab and judged it by its looks, you\u2019ve totally missed the boat.\nThere are 13 different migratory birds that feed on horseshoe crab eggs.\nA horseshoe crab\u2019s blood is in high demand because it is used to screen every drug, implant and medical device before it is used in humans.\nWhat I was watching was a horseshoe crab harvest."}
