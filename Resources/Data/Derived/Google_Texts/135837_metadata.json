A new report from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that 11 million small business employees will see their health insurance premiums increase.\n\nRemember when the president and other Dems promised that Obamacare would cut family premiums by $2,500? Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum does.\n\nGood morning! 11 million will pay higher rates for health insurance sz CMS. So wait, who saves $2500? \u2014 martha maccallum (@marthamaccallum) February 25, 2014\n\nWho saves $2,500? Not the \u201ctypical family\u201d insured under a small business plan. The promised savings are just another lie for the New York Times to declare an \u201cincorrect promise.\u201d\n\nCMS claims 6 million small business workers will see lower premiums under Obamacare, but the report doesn\u2019t estimate the amount of the decrease. Chances are, if you liked the idea of lower rates, you can keep dreaming of lower rates. Period.\n\n@marthamaccallum Not the working stiffs! We are left holding the bag! \u2014 SHARON HAYNES (@SHARONHAYNES12) February 25, 2014\n\n@marthamaccallum next year we will pay twice in premiums with $12.7k deductibles. It's like 2nd mortgage . \u2014 Yulia Goldshteyn (@AY4WEB) February 25, 2014\n\n@marthamaccallum @TIMT57 Only 11M. Obama will spin this as \"11M men now covered 4 unwanted pregnancies!\" \u2014 Kevin Jackson (@Theblacksphere) February 25, 2014\n\n@marthamaccallum According to Sebelius, this is \"patently false.\" So is the loss of jobs. My company incurring $54 million in new expenses. \u2014 Todd (@jcmthe4th) February 25, 2014\n\n@marthamaccallum pj boy, and julia, who marry, then max their return by divorcing and taking part time jobs, and make artisan soap @ home \u2014 Epa Minondas (@WTEpaminondas) February 25, 2014\n\nAnd about that \u201c11 million\u201d figure \u2026\n\n@marthamaccallum It took a couple of minutes to hit me, but if they say 11 million we KNOW the figure will be much higher. They'll [1/2] \u2014 Marc Hoover (@MarcHoover1) February 25, 2014\n\n@marthamaccallum just \"adjust\" later, like previously projecting 7 million enrollees by 3/31 & now 5-6 million would be a \"hell of a start\". \u2014 Marc Hoover (@MarcHoover1) February 25, 2014\n\nRelated:\n\nFull Twitchy coverage of Martha MacCallum", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "'So wait, who saves'?
