By analyzing the MRIs of 949 people aged 8 to 22, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania found that male brains have more connections within each hemisphere, while female brains are more interconnected between hemispheres. Yes, take that, Mike from IT! It, like, so explains why you just dropped the eggnog while attempting to make flirty conversation with Janet from Accounting. Just kidding; we still have no idea why men or women do anything in particular. But the study, released today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is interesting because it is one of the first to discover differences in the brain\u2019s structural connectivity in a large sample size of people from a variety of age groups. By analyzing the subjects\u2019 MRIs using diffusion imaging, the scientists explored the brains\u2019 fiber pathways, the bundles of axons that act as highways routing information from one part of the mind to the other. After grouping the image by sex and inspecting the differences between the two aggregate \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d pictures, the researchers found that in men, fiber pathways run back and forth within each hemisphere, while in women they tend to zig-zag between the left, or \u201clogical,\u201d and right, or \u201ccreative,\u201d sides of the brain. Because female brains seem to have a stronger connections between their logical and intuitive parts, \u201cwhen women are asked to do particularly hard tasks, they might engage very different parts of the brain,\u201d said Ragini Verma, an associate professor of radiology at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the authors of the report. \u201cMen might over-engage just one part of the brain.\u201d\n\nThis could mean, for example, that men tend to see issues and resolve them directly, due to the strong connections between the \u201cperception\u201d and \u201caction\u201d areas of their brains, while women might be more inclined to combine logic and intuition when solving a problem. Their less-interconnected hemispheres might prompt men, for example, to be, \u201cgoing along, executing things very skillfully and maybe not taking into account that someone didn't [do something] because they were having a bad day,\u201d Verma explained. Meanwhile, \u201cgut feelings, trying to join the dots together \u2026 women are known to be very strong in that.\u201d The differences were less evident in young children, but they became prominent in the scans of the adolescents. Scientists have long known that male and female brains are distinct, but the degree of these differences, and whether they impact behavior, is still somewhat of a mystery. The field has repeatedly unearthed seemingly solid clues that turned out to be red herrings. In August, for example, a study in the journal PLoS One challenged the long-held idea that male and female brains exhibit differences in \u201clateralization,\u201d or strengths in one half of the brain or another. And past books on the \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d styles of thinking have been criticized for only including studies that reinforce well-known gender stereotypes. At the same time, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that male brains are from Mars and female brains are, well, from a different neighborhood on Mars. Researchers already know, for example, that men\u2019s brains are slightly bigger than women\u2019s (because men\u2019s bodies also tend to be bigger). Male and female rats navigate space differently. Women taking birth control pills, which alter estrogen and progesterone levels, have been shown to remember emotionally charged events more like men do in small studies. Migraines not only strike women more frequently, but they impact different parts of their brains, too.\n\nA study published last month in the journal Nature Communications found that genes are expressed differently in men and women throughout the brain. One reason autism rates are higher among males, the researchers suggest, could be because a form of the gene NRXN3 is produced at higher levels in male brains. And past research has shown that, across cultures, women\u2019s brains are more functionally interconnected when at rest than men\u2019s are, on average. This and similar findings have been used to support the idea that women are \u201cbetter at multitasking.\u201d And indeed, a study released late last month by researchers at the University of Glasgow in Scotland found that women do have an edge when it comes to switching between tasks rapidly, ostensibly because, back in the cave, we had to keep an eye on the kids while we ... did whatever else it is that cave housewives did. But examining the brain differences between the sexes also has an ugly past, since such findings have historically been used to paint women as less rational or intelligent. The 19th-century French anthropologist Paul Broca, who lends his name to the area of the brain responsible for speech, once said, \"We are therefore permitted to suppose that the relatively small size of the female brain depends in part upon her physical inferiority and in part upon her intellectual inferiority.\u201d \u201cWe see these differences everywhere, and we started to realize, damn, we simply assume they aren't there.\u201d At the same time, though, modern medicine can\u2019t afford to ignore these variations. Just as with any disease, understanding sex differences in brains might help neuroscientists better diagnose and treat disorders. \u201cWe see these differences everywhere, and we started to realize, damn, we simply assume they aren't there,\u201d Larry Cahill, a neuroscientist at the University of California at Irvine, told the Orange County Register. \u201cAnd these sex differences have implications for how the brain works and how to fix brains.\u201d Even pain medications don\u2019t take male and female pain perception differences into account, Cahill points out. Countless medical fields have long been treating women by pretending \u201cthey are simply men with pesky sex hormones.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The hemispheres of women&#39;s brains are more interconnected.
