But about 10 million of those who didn't have insurance now have coverage through the new marketplaces, which is often less generous or imposes more out-of-pocket costs or limits on which doctors they may see.\n\nThe majority of Americans shopping in the marketplaces buy middle-grade \"silver\" plans, which cover about 70 percent of health costs. That's less than what a typical employer-sponsored plan covers, although those with income low enough can get subsidies for their premiums or to help cover other cost-sharing.\n\nOne big reason for lower costs among employer-sponsored plans is that they typically don't combine deductibles, the amount a patient must pay in a year before their coverage kicks in, for drug costs and other medical costs, whereas most silver plans do.\n\nThe discrepancy between employer coverage versus marketplace coverage can result in patients having to pay much more out of pocket if they lose an employer plan, especially if they have chronic health conditions.\n\nThe researchers found that patients with one chronic condition who switched to a marketplace plan would find their out-of-pocket costs increased by 126 percent. The sickest patients, those with four or more chronic conditions, would see a smaller increase in out-of-pocket payments since they already would face a lot of extra costs, but they would still pay $1,145 out of pocket every year.\n\nFor those patients with multiple conditions, there is major danger that they could incur even higher medical costs if they don't take their drugs as prescribed, the researchers warned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare has given millions more Americans health insurance, but they have to pay more for prescription drugs than people with employer-sponsored plans.\nThe average person with a plan bought in a marketplace set up under the Affordable Care Act has to pay 46 percent of total drug spending, according to research published Monday in the journal Health Affairs.
