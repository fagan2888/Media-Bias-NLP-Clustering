Last November, when Homeland Security released its ten memos commandeering immigration policy from Congress, Secretary Johnson included a vague plan aimed at benefiting the tech industry, innocuously titled \u201cModernizing the Employment-Based Immigrant Visa System.\u201d But a secret memo recently leaked on an immigration law blog now reveals that this \u2018modernization\u2019 plan will not only fast-track hundreds of thousands of work permits to employment visa-applicants in violation of longstanding U.S. worker protection laws, but will enable hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to also receive work permits despite their unlawful status. As the full details leak out from the narrow clique of immigration lawyers and lobbyists advising the President, labor advocates are scrambling to warn the public.\n\nUnder our current system, most guest workers wishing to remain permanently in the U.S. must arrange for their employer to \u201csponsor\u201d them by filing an I-140 application, putting them in a queue for a green card. When a temporary (\u201cnon-immigrant\u201d) guest worker reaches the front of the immigrant visa queue, they are allowed to submit an application to \u201cadjust\u201d their \u201cstatus\u201d to that of permanent resident alien. Getting to this stage is key. By regulation an adjustment-of-status applicant automatically receives a coveted work permit or \u201cEAD\u201d. An EAD allows the alien to work anywhere in the country and apply for welfare. It\u2019s the central reason foreigners line up to come here and it\u2019s what Obama\u2019s attempting to distribute to illegal aliens under the DACA and DAPA programs. And for those on guest-worker visas, EADs allow them to stay in the country even when their \u201ctemporary\u201d visa (like an H-1b) runs out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe wait-time between filing an I-140 application and being allowed to file for adjustment-of-status (getting you the golden EAD) is regulated by the State Department and depends not only on one\u2019s filing date, but also on one\u2019s country of origin. But for the millions of aspiring alien workers from overpopulated countries like India, per nation visa quotas have meant a typical wait of 8 to 10 years to get their EADs\u2014Non-skilled workers from any country are also given lengthy wait-times, as there has never been a shortage of poor Americans who need employment. This per-country wait-time is now what Obama\u2019s unilaterally arranging to slash. From now on, filing an adjustment-of-status application won\u2019t be necessary to receive an EAD and any alien who merely has an I-140 petition that\u2019s been approved for a year can obtain the prized work permit.\n\nThe new executive action will cut the line of people waiting to get an EAD dramatically, a backlog of hundreds of thousands of people who would otherwise have to wait patiently in line. This action will be a major encouragement to come here by any means possible, with a likely surge of thousands of EAD applications hitting an already backlogged USCIS in the first week alone. For the weak labor market faced by most American workers, it\u2019ll be like a dam bursting.\n\nThis is a major coup for the axis of open immigration and Big Tech lobbyists. Big Tech would prefer to hire millions of temporary workers on H-1Bs over American workers because their visas are tied to their employer making them docile and unlikely to unionize. But flooding the labor market with current and future computer technicians, even with workers who\u2019ll have greater flexibility, is much more important\u2014it also gets rid of H-1B renewal and administrative costs.\n\nPerhaps the most striking part of Obama\u2019s move: illegal aliens will also be able to get EADs. All one needs to file an I-140 petition is an official ID; proving lawful presence isn\u2019t required. The thousands of business-owners around the country who knowingly hire illegal aliens can cynically sponsor petitions whether or not the underlying applicant is legal. Ultimately, the USCIS bureaucrats will reject his or her adjustment-of-status application (after 10 plus years), but they\u2019ll still be able to get that golden EAD.\n\nGenerally, I-140 petitions require aliens to submit a so-called Labor Certification showing that the petitioning employer has advertised for the position in a newspaper. This is meant to ensure that foreigners are not hired over American workers. As immigration attorneys have admitted, however, they show employers how \u201cto do exactly the opposite\u201d, for instance, by creating deceiving advertisements or disqualifying American interviewees on false pretences.\n\nFiling costs for I-140 visa petitions are not cheap; with attorney costs, they can be several thousand dollars. But petitioning for an illegal alien-employee, with a promise to take the cost off his wages, could create a beneficial indentured servant relationship for employers. Larger employers may also file the petitions en masse if they feel a big crackdown coming (highly unlikely, of course). Furthermore, what\u2019s to stop open-borders advocates, like La Raza, MALDEF, or LatinoJustice (where Justice Sotomayor was a board member) from creating a fund to finance the petition costs on behalf of employers? What about those groups\u2019 billionaire-backers, like George Soros, Paul Singer, or the Ford Foundation?\n\nThe legal authority proffered by DHS in the leaked memo is predictably a deliberate misinterpretation of the law. These are the same DHS attorneys of course who, with help from immigration attorneys, produced the 2010 memo \u201cjustifying\u201d the DACA executive amnesty program. They claim that two provisions of the Immigration & Naturalization Act, \u00a7205 and \u00a7274A(h)(3), give DHS Secretary Johnson discretion to issue unlimited numbers of EADs. Note that this is the same argument they\u2019re employing in an attack against Texas\u2019s amnesty injunction. The organization I work for, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, has eviscerated this argument in briefs submitted in support of Texas. Additionally, DHS has claimed the same authority for a separate move that would give work permits to spouses of H-1B-holders. We\u2019re in the process of litigating against that rulemaking, which, if we\u2019re successful, will be utterly disastrous for Obama\u2019s amnesty as well as this new rule change.\n\nUnlike the DACA executive amnesty program being challenged in the courts, USCIS is apparently opting to go through the normal regulatory process (although no details are up yet), complete with an opportunity for the public to submit comments. If enough patriotic American workers and their families flood the comment database, the agency may react like the ATF did when their proposed rule banning \u201cgreen tipped\u201d bullets was deluged with angry comments forcing them to rescind the proposal. If Americans care about their sovereignty like they do about their guns, Obama\u2019s new immigration re-write won\u2019t see the light of day.\n\nSmith is an investigative associate with the Immigration Reform Law Institute.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Most guest workers wishing to remain permanently in the U.S. must arrange for their employer to \u201csponsor\u201d them.", "description": "Most guest workers wishing to remain permanently in the U.S. must arrange for their employer to \u201csponsor\u201d them.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Most guest workers wishing to remain permanently in the U.S. must arrange for their employer to \u201csponsor\u201d them.", "title": "Obama\u2019s latest plan to rewrite immigration law", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/257041-obamas-latest-plan-to-rewrite-immigration-law", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack_092115getty_1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/257041-obamas-latest-plan-to-rewrite-immigration-law", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-19T10:00-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Ian Smith", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T10:00:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/the-administration/257041-obamas-latest-plan-to-rewrite-immigration-law", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Most guest workers wishing to remain permanently in the U.S. must arrange for their employer to \u201csponsor\u201d them.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s latest plan to rewrite immigration law"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama\u2019s latest plan to rewrite immigration law"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0720\"", "article_summary": "If Americans care about their sovereignty like they do about their guns, Obama\u2019s new immigration re-write won\u2019t see the light of day.\nFiling costs for I-140 visa petitions are not cheap; with attorney costs, they can be several thousand dollars.\nThe organization I work for, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, has eviscerated this argument in briefs submitted in support of Texas.\nPerhaps the most striking part of Obama\u2019s move: illegal aliens will also be able to get EADs.\nSmith is an investigative associate with the Immigration Reform Law Institute."}
