We could do that,\u2019 \u201d Heather said, glancing around at the crowd of people in line for lemonade and iced tea on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cWe had no idea it would get this big,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Veronica\u2019s family invited the Aurora police to the lemonade stand, Metz said he found out that Veronica wanted to be a police officer when she grew up.\n\nThe department talked it over and decided they wanted to make her wish come true. Officers took an oath on Veronica\u2019s behalf, inducting her posthumously as an honorary police officer.\n\nA crowd filled with Veronica\u2019s relatives, law enforcement and community members cheered as a plaque was presented to her parents, Ashley Moser and Ian Sullivan.\n\nGeorge Brauchler, prosecuting attorney for the trial in the shooting that left 12 dead, said that hope influenced him to bring his family to Saturday\u2019s event.\n\n\u201cWe resolved the formal business of that night of horror and heroes,\u201d he said, adding that he was glad to be able to come to a positive event with the community.\n\n\u201cAubrey, you should be very proud,\u201d he said. \u201cYou done good.\u201d\n\nAfter Veronica was sworn in, the lines began forming for lemonade sales in which all proceeds would be donated to the fund for the memorial garden.\n\nAubrey, who teared up alongside her mother as Veronica was sworn in, switched between serving lemonade and playing with other children at the event.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing something special,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause of my lemonade stand, Veronica gets to be a police officer.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Youngest Aurora theater shooting victim sworn in as police officer", "title": "Youngest Aurora theater shooting victim sworn in as police officer", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/05/youngest-aurora-theater-shooting-victim-sworn-in-as-police-officer/", "image": {"width": 492, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130719__Veronica-Moserp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130719__Veronica-Moserp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T13:40:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T21:35:31+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aurora Theater Shooting, Aurora Theater Shooting trial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3764\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBecause of my lemonade stand, Veronica gets to be a police officer.\u201dElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez\nWhen Veronica\u2019s family invited the Aurora police to the lemonade stand, Metz said he found out that Veronica wanted to be a police officer when she grew up.\nDearman overheard her mother, Heather Dearman, talking about raising money for the Aurora Municipal Center memorial garden for the victims, families and community affected by the theater shooting.\nRows of police officers stood with their right hands raised Saturday morning and, through tears, gave an oath on behalf of Veronica Moser-Sullivan to make the youngest Aurora theater shooting victim an honorary member of the force.\n\u201cShe looked up at me and said she wanted to have a lemonade stand to raise money for the garden, and I thought, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s cute."}
