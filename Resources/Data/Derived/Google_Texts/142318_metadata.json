He even broke administrative law in the process, according to a federal judge who reviewed the action and ruled it was illegal. Obama\u2019s response? He dug in his heels and doubled down in his determination to carry out his illegal plan, threatening any government employees who refused to execute his order with retribution.\n\nHe conducted military intervention in Libya without congressional approval.\n\nIn Operation Fast and Furious, the Obama administration ordered gun store owners to illegally sell thousands of firearms to Mexican drug dealers, resulting in the deaths of many including Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.\n\nHe gave $535 million in taxpayer dollars to campaign contributors and lobbyists, claiming it was for a revolutionary \u201cgreen energy\u201d startup called Solyndra that would create 4,000 new jobs. The company quickly went bankrupt, after selling its product for less than the cost of production. By publicly overstating the company\u2019s financial condition, Obama broke the same law that resulted in Martha Stewart, a private citizen, going to prison.\n\nBy appointing dozens of \u201cczars\u201d without seeking Senate confirmation, Obama violated the Constitution according to Democrats Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.\n\nHe signed Obamacare into law despite the fact that it was a revenue bill and did not initiate in the House of Representatives as per the Constitution.\n\nAs for his disrespect for American tradition, recall that as a candidate for the presidency he called for \u201cthe fundamental transformation of America.\u201d\n\nWhile downplaying and ignoring foreign threats to national security, Obama and his administration have both hyped the domestic threat of \u201cright-wing extremists,\u201d even participating in a raid of a lawful Texas political meeting in which all parties were detained and fingerprinted.\n\nAnd then, of course, there\u2019s the ever-present reality that Obama himself may not even be constitutionally eligible for office. In fact, if he\u2019s telling the truth about his parentage and the \u201cbirth certificate\u201d he produced after years of demands from the public is real, he could not possibly be a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d as required by the Constitution.\n\nSo with all of this history \u2013 and much more, in fact \u2013 why do we assume Obama will step aside willingly from the presidency following an election in 2016?\n\nExperience more of Joseph Farah\u2019s no-nonsense truth-telling in his books, audio and video products, featured in the WND Superstore\n\nI\u2019m not saying he won\u2019t. I\u2019m just asking why. And judging from the number of questions I\u2019m getting along these lines from the public, I\u2019d say there\u2019s great concern out there across the fruited plain.\n\nMaybe we assume he will respectfully leave office after two terms because he has publicly said he would. In 2013, Obama said he and his family might remain in Washington after leaving office.\n\nBut that begs the question of whether Obama is truthful.\n\nWhat do YOU think? Will Obama leave office willingly in January 2017? Sound off in today\u2019s WND poll\n\nRemember what he said about his immigration order before issuing it: \u201cThis is something I\u2019ve struggled with throughout my presidency. The problem is that I\u2019m the president of the United States; I\u2019m not the emperor of the United States. My job is to execute laws that are passed. And Congress right now has not changed what I consider to be a broken immigration system. And what that means is that we have certain obligations to enforce the laws that are in place even if we think that in many cases the results may be tragic. \u2026 [W]e\u2019ve kind of stretched our administrative flexibility as much as we can.\u201d\n\nRemember what he said about Obamacare before it was implemented: \u201cNo matter how we reform health care, we will keep this promise to the American people. If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor, period. If you like your health-care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health-care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\u201d\n\nRemember what he said about ISIS? Now what does he say? \u201cI didn\u2019t call the Islamic State a \u2018JV\u2019 team.\u201d\n\nAgain, do I think Obama will leave office in January 2017? Yes I do.\n\nBut, with a track record like this \u2013 and, actually much worse \u2013 should we simply take it for granted?\n\nMedia wishing to interview Joseph Farah, please contact media@wnd.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Question: Why are Americans so certain there will be a presidential election in 2016 and that Barack Obama will leave office in January 2017?
