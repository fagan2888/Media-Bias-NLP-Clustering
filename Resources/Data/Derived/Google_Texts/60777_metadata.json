The heart of the Affordable Care Act hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court. That nuclear deal with Iran seeming on the verge of crumble. At a White House celebration on gay rights, a heckler stole the show.\n\nIn the end, it became a defining week of the Obama presidency in its more than six-and-a-half years. It was marked by a remarkable string of political and legal victories, all capped by a powerful speech on race that showcased the signature rhetorical skill that that first helped put him on the map.\n\nHere are five ways that this might be the most consequential week of Obama's presidency:\n\n1. Soulful Singing From the Podium After a Stirring Speech on Race\n\nPlay\n\nMore than a week after nine churchgoers were shot and killed in a Charleston church, President Obama turned a moment of national mourning into one of the most emotional of his presidency. In a eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the senior pastor of the Emanuel AME Church whom the Obamas met personally back in 2007, the president delivered a message of racial unity and transcendence to an audience of 5,500 people. At one point, the president broke into song, leading the entire crowd in an impromptu hymn of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d Has any sitting president sung in such a way from a pulpit before?\n\n2. The Affordable Care Act Survives the Supremes\n\nPlay\n\nThe president\u2019s landmark health care law faced its second major test before the Supreme Court and survived. On Thursday, the Court decided to overlook what some called a drafting error in the law, upholding health insurance subsidies for over 6 million Americans in states using federal exchanges. The court ruled that it was Congress and the administration\u2019s initial intent that matters most -- granting middle- and low-income individuals living in states that did not create their own insurance marketplaces to continue to receive federal taxpayer aid.\n\n3. Court Backs Social Shift on Gay Marriage That Obama Helped Evolve\n\nPlay\n\nIn a monumental ruling, the Supreme Court ruled Friday that civil marriage rights must be extended to same-sex couples in all 50 states. The court\u2019s decision struck down state bans on gay marriage. And though Obama cannot take any credit for the ruling, it was a major victory for the Democratic Party and his progressive agenda. The ruling comes after a landslide shift in public opinion on gay marriage over the last decade, with the majority of Americans now supporting gay marriage. When Obama assumed office in 2009, he was not an open supporter of gay marriage, but in his words, \u201cevolved\u201d on the issue, and ultimately came out in public support of gay marriage during an interview with ABC News\u2019 Robin Roberts in 2012.\n\n4. Republicans Give Obama \u201cFast-Track\u201d Power on Trade\n\n.@POTUS and the @VP watch as the Senate takes the next step toward passing the most progressive trade deal ever. pic.twitter.com/XQKJPgnkRy \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 24, 2015\n\nA bill to grant President Obama \u201cfast-track\u201d authority to negotiate sweeping multi-national trade deals cleared Congress this week, after several embarrassing setbacks dealt by Democrats, paving the way for the president to secure the Trans Pacific Partnership -- one of his biggest second-term priorities and the largest U.S. free-trade agreement in more than 20 years. Though the deal itself has not yet passed, a green-light for Trade Promotion Authority was a key hurdle for the president just weeks after his own party\u2019s rank-and-file actively blocked him on the issue.\n\n5. Hostage Policy Shift to Help Families\n\nPlay\n\nAfter an exhaustive months-long policy review, President Obama on Wednesday announced that the United States is \u201cchanging how we do business\u201d in efforts to recover American hostages from terrorists and other criminals abroad.\n\nUnder the new policy, the government will no longer enforce a rule which forbid families of hostages from paying ransom to hostage-holders in attempts to secure the release of their loved ones. While the government will maintain a strict policy against paying ransom to terrorists, the government will now have a dedicated \u201cfusion cell\u201d to coordinate between government agencies and communicate directly with hostage-takers in facilitating their release.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "This Might Be Most Consequential Week of Obama Presidency", "description": "It's been a very good week for the Obama presidency.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "It's been a very good week for the Obama presidency.", "title": "This Might Be Most Consequential Week of Obama Presidency", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/consequential-week-obamas-presidency/story?id=32061896", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/gty_barack_obama_pinckney_eulogy_jc_150626_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2015-06-30", "twitter": {"description": "It's been a very good week for the Obama presidency.", "title": "This Might Be Most Consequential Week of Obama Presidency", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/consequential-week-obamas-presidency/story?id=32061896", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/gty_barack_obama_pinckney_eulogy_jc_150626_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@JordynPhelps", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,32061896", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,32061896", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/consequential-week-obamas-presidency/story?id=32061896"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-06-30", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,32061896", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/consequential-week-obamas-presidency/story?id=32061896"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/consequential-week-obamas-presidency/story?id=32061896", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,32061896", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-06-30 16:34:05", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "President Obama, President Obama's legacy , politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "President Obama, President Obama's legacy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdceae\"", "article_summary": "The ruling comes after a landslide shift in public opinion on gay marriage over the last decade, with the majority of Americans now supporting gay marriage.\nIn the end, it became a defining week of the Obama presidency in its more than six-and-a-half years.\nHere are five ways that this might be the most consequential week of Obama's presidency:1.\nThe heart of the Affordable Care Act hanging in the balance at the Supreme Court.\nPresident Obama began the last full week of June with his legacy in potential peril: A landmark trade bill stymied by his own party."}
