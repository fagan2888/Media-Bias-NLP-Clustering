Donna F. Edwards (D-Md.) partnered with Pelosi and fellow co-chair of the Steering and Policy Committee, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, (D- Conn.) to lead Wednesday\u2019s hearing, which was called \u201cEnsuring Access and Affordability of Prescription Drugs, While Spurring Innovation.\u201d\n\nLifesaving drugs are integral to the survival of the sick yet some believe that pharmaceutical companies take advantage of this necessity.\n\n\u201cThe intent of lifesaving drugs is just that\u2014to save lives, not to solely fill the pockets of executives and investors of large drug companies,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nExpert advocates for affordable care, including doctors and representatives from health organizations, testified to the problem many Americans face in getting reasonably priced medications.\n\nOne witness, Dr. Jeremy Greene of Johns Hopkins University, shared a story of a patient who had a pinworm, a parasite that affects about 40 million people in North America. Greene prescribed albendazole, a medication that had previously been worth pennies per pill.\n\n\u201cI was not prepared to see her return to my office an hour later with news that the drug now costs more than $150 per pill,\u201d Greene shared.\n\nWhile expensive medication is a nationwide issue, there is particular concern about African Americans\u2019 access to reasonably priced prescription drugs.\n\nPrince George\u2019s County health officer Pamela B. Creekmur attested to the issues that some Blacks face in getting medications.\n\n\u201cCosts of prescription drugs have been an issue for a long time in the African-American community,\u201d said Creekmur. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. It never has been fair. Something has to be done.\u201d\n\nPelosi mentioned that the Affordable Care Act was supposed to improve the ability of all Americans to tend to their medical needs, yet pharmaceutical companies prevent medications from being easy for all citizens to acquire.\n\nCreekmur noted that certain people pay $3,000 a month for lifesaving prescription drugs, a heavy toll that could prevent some from getting medications to help them survive.\n\nEdwards is adamant about ending this problem.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to the people we serve to put a stop to the price-gouging that is bankrupting patients and overcharging Medicare, straining hospitals, and fleecing taxpayers,\u201d said Edwards.\n\nThe congresswoman further urged, \u201cWe must continue to challenge each and every one of these drug companies, and by putting pressure on them, and even shaming them, they might change their tactics.\u201d\n\n2,938 total views, 2 views today", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Afro", "description": "The rise in prescription drug costs has been an issue of great concern for many Americans.
