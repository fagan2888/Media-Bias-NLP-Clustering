Thanks to a man named Albert Manero, one little boy has finally realized his dream of being able to hug his mother using two arms \u2013 his first ever \u201creal hug\u201d, according to him.\n\nAlbert Manero is an Aerospace Engineer Doctoral student at the University of Central Florida. He was put in contact with Alex via e-NABLE, a community of volunteers that share ideas and design files for 3D printing prosthetics, as well as stories, in hopes of providing as many quality 3D printed prosthetic hands and arms, to as many children that they possibly can. We\u2019ve done countless stories on e-NABLE in the past, where children have been given the opportunity to utilize both hands for the first time in their lives.\n\nThis story is a bit different though because Alex was born missing, not only his hand, but his entire right arm from just above his elbow. What Manero did was something that has not been done ever before. He created a 3D printed myoelectric arm, that responds to the electromyography muscle energy in Alex\u2019s bicep. \u201cHe flexes his bicep and it opens or closes his hand,\u201d Manero told 3DPrint.com.\n\nGrowing up as a little boy without an arm certainly is not an easy thing to do. Alex was happy being himself though, and even though he was missing one of his arms, he always would try his best to participate in the same activities as his friends, using the one arm he was given. Unfortunately though, Alex said that as he has grown older, it was beginning to get quite a bit harder to keep up with those friends.\n\nChildren fall victim to insurance companies that typically don\u2019t cover prosthetic devices for individuals who are under 18 years of age. This is because children are constantly outgrowing any devices that they are fitted with, thus causing medical bills to add up very quickly. Also devices for children must be produced on a smaller scale, using smaller electronics and more difficult assembly methods.\n\nWhen Albert Manero heard about Alex\u2019s story, he decided to put a team together of individuals who he believed would be able to help him create a myoelectric prosthetic arm for the little boy. Thanks in part to 3D printer manufacturer Stratasys, who donated some of the supplies, Manero and his team were able to 3D print, and assemble an entire working myoelectric arm for under $350. Similar prosthetic arms would cost over $40,000 to purchase, without the backing of health insurance.\n\nTo construct the hand, Manero told us that they used a Stratasys Dimension Elite FDM 3D Printer, and the entire process took between 6-8 weeks to accomplish. The design for the hand was taken from Steve Wood\u2019s open source Flexy-Hand.\n\nManero told us that he is in the process of uploading the design files and instructions to Thingiverse, so that anyone can download and print out their own arm. The electronic portion of the arm was created using off-the-shelf servos and several batteries.\n\n\u201cMy mother taught us that we\u2019re supposed to help change the world,\u201d explained Manero. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to help make it better. That\u2019s why we did it. The look on Alex\u2019s face when he used it for the first time was priceless.\u201d\n\nManero hopes that his design will help many more children and adults in need of prosthetic arms, find a quality, totally customizable solution that is extremely affordable. I know for a fact that it will.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already heard from another family who needs an arm,\u201d Manero stated. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to helping who we can and I\u2019ll be working with my team even when in Germany. I think 3-D printing is revolutionizing our world in many ways. I believe changing the world of prosthetics is very real. There\u2019s no reason why this approach shouldn\u2019t work on adults too.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been covering e-NABLE for almost a year now, and it is amazing to see just how quickly the 3D printed prosthetic hands and arms have developed, thanks to the open sourcing of the available designs. Individuals have created several innovative designs, and due to these designs being open source, others have taken them and improved upon them. Now thanks to the 1,000 plus e-NABLE members, Steve Wood for his Flexy-Hand invention, and Albert Manero, now anyone will be able to download and 3D print their own myoelectric prosthetic arms. I\u2019m anxious to see what happens next\u2026.\n\nWhat do you think about this incredible breakthrough in 3D printed prosthetics?
