Andy Harris (R-Md.) is hoping to resolve the \u201cbureaucratic mess\u201d that is the Veterans Affairs office by pushing a plan that would allow privatization of some vets\u2019 health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to describe a system where we begin to decompress the VA health care system, which is obviously overburdened, and begin to consider offering veterans who are newly assigned to the VA the benefit option of going to the private system and being taken care of in their local hospitals instead of in the VA system,\u201d Harris told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Tuesday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHarris said he is qualified to address the issue as a doctor and a former member of the Navy medical corps.\n\n\u201cDuring my training, I did time in a VA hospital,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI understand the military and the VA health system and I understand why the VA system is a bureaucratic mess.\u201d\n\nHarris said that his plan would benefit veterans who live far from VA centers, as well as cutting costs.\n\n\u201cThe VA budget has roughly tripled in the past 12 years, including the VA health budget,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWhen you look at the numbers, we\u2019re paying more for veterans and those priority one veterans in the VA system then we would if we bought them, for instance, a silver level plan on the Obamacare exchange.\u201d\n\nAccording to Harris\u2019 office, the lawmaker has not proposed any legislation for a veteran voucher program at this time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Maryland Republican is hoping to resolve the \u201cbureaucratic mess\u201d at the Veterans Affairs office.", "title": "Harris pushes VA privatization plan", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/andy-harris-veterans-affairs-va-scandal-private-fox-health-care-eric-shinseki-107098.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/07/16/andy_harris_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Department Of Veterans Affairs,Veterans,Andy Harris,Eric Shinseki", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Maryland Republican is hoping to resolve the \u201cbureaucratic mess\u201d at the Veterans Affairs office.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3e76\"", "article_summary": "Harris pushes VA privatization planRep.
