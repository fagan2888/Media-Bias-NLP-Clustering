It's also occurring at the government level, by way of unsustainable increases in outlays by Medicare and Medicaid, and at the individual level by way of increases in the insurance and out-of-pocket expenses for health care.\n\nI last addressed this issue substantively about 18 months ago in the two-part column Where Health Care Is Headed, wherein I addressed the unsustainable nature of HCE growth and the fact that most economists and the financial industry had not recognized the issue.\n\nThe general theme of my commentary concerning the health care industry over the past several years has been:\n\n-- The growth in costs was unsustainable.\n\n-- The imposition of the Affordable Care Act would cause the rate of growth in HCE to increase rather than decrease.\n\n-- The stocks of the companies in the sector would benefit for a few years.\n\n-- This process would force the markets and government to acknowledge the unsustainability issue.\n\n-- The implications of what this indicates about the probable countermeasures required would cause the stocks to begin to decline.\n\nThis process has played out very closely to that narrative, and it appears now, based on the performance of stocks in the sector, that the correction that started about three months ago should continue as government intervention to contain HCE is probable.\n\nTwo years ago, I wrote about the positive prospects for UnitedHealth Group (UNH), HCA Holdings (HCA) and the Health Care Select SPDR (XLV) over the following few years.\n\nFrom that time through to the peak in prices last July, UnitedHealth had appreciated 70%, HCA had increased by 107%, and Health Care Select had increased by about 50%.\n\nIn the past three months, however, they are down by 3.5%, 17% and 10%, respectively.\n\nThe biotechnology space has experienced the same, which I last addressed in the September column, \"Biotechs Get Crash Course on Corrections,\" with the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) up 100% and 125%, respectively, from October 2013 to mid-July 2015, but down 18% and 25% since then.\n\nThis is also evident in the health care insurance sector, which I last addressed in the June column, \"Health Care Names Pressure Other Insurance, Retail Stocks.\"\n\nBetween October 2013 and July 2015, Cigna (CI) and Anthem (ANTM) had appreciated by 115% and 93%, respectively, but are both down by about 14% since.\n\nThe performance of these and many others in the health care space compare to a 2% decline for the S&P 500 index and 4% decline in the Nasdaq Composite during the past three months.\n\nThe bottom line is that the markets are finally recognizing that the growth rate of HCE is not only unsustainable, but that it is at the point of representing an economic crisis that requires government intervention.\n\nIn the immediate, the government's logical and probable responses will fall roughly into two camps, direct and indirect.\n\nOn the direct side, the options include capping the costs for all manner of health care-related expenses, including insurance, procedures and pharmaceuticals. This may be considered an extension and broadening of the Affordable Care Act and the next incremental step toward a single-payer federal health care scheme.\n\nThe direct side may also include punitive taxes on unhealthy lifestyles; which may come in the form of federal taxes on tobacco and alcohol or in the form of federal support for state-run health care systems being reduced if the state does not increase taxes on the same.\n\nSince one of the primary issues is that the increase in HCE is preventing an increase in employment, an indirect way of counteracting that is to offer a tax incentive to employers to hire. Robert Green at Forbes wrote about this a few days ago.\n\nThere are many other issues and potential approaches to the problem and I will write more about in the future.\n\nThe most important point for investors is that it appears the awakening to the magnitude of the economic drag caused by health care expenses and its economic implications has finally arrived.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Real Money", "description": "Have we reached the point where something will be done about it?", "title": "Correction in Health Care Stocks Remains in Full Force", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://realmoney.thestreet.com/articles/10/08/2015/correction-health-care-stocks-remains-full-force", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "uc_ZLKLwygSe1BLShxx0yffUxa-chB9MJ1eJrMH0P6M", "fb": {"app_id": 458919507482096}, "description": "Have we reached the point where something will be done about it?", "keywords": "economic analysis,healthcare,investment strategy,Stocks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5fa1\"", "article_summary": "This is also evident in the health care insurance sector, which I last addressed in the June column, \"Health Care Names Pressure Other Insurance, Retail Stocks.\"\nThis may be considered an extension and broadening of the Affordable Care Act and the next incremental step toward a single-payer federal health care scheme.\nTwo years ago, I wrote about the positive prospects for UnitedHealth Group (UNH), HCA Holdings (HCA) and the Health Care Select SPDR (XLV) over the following few years.\nThe general theme of my commentary concerning the health care industry over the past several years has been:-- The growth in costs was unsustainable.\nFrom that time through to the peak in prices last July, UnitedHealth had appreciated 70%, HCA had increased by 107%, and Health Care Select had increased by about 50%."}
