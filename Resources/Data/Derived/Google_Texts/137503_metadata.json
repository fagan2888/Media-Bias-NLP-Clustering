It will now be expanding its overnight delivery from the Oregon border to Fresno, Calif. -- about the northern half of the large state.\n\nHowever, Google's small fleet of vans can't keep up with the new 400 miles of territory, so it's working with other shipping companies for the deliveries. As long as the customer types in an order by 7 p.m., the product will be there the next day. Google's partners in the service include Target, Walgreens, Whole Foods and Toys R Us.\n\n\u201cIn less dense areas, a partnership with other carriers makes more sense,\u201d Tom Fallows, product management director for Google Shopping Express told the WSJ. \u201cWe are very committed to making this an everyday affordable price point,\u201d he said.\n\nFallows declined to name the carriers, but customers will find out in the next few months. Google's blue and white vans will still be delivering in cities, but Google declined to give and statistics on the service.\n\nThe move to compete with Amazon is likely to be a costly one for Google, but one that's a necessity if it hopes to take on the e-commerce giant.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Google is expanding its overnight delivery service Google Shopping Express from Fresno, Calif. to the Oregon border, according to reports.", "title": "Google Shopping Express Expands Overnight Delivery in NoCal", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Bay Area", "description": "Google is expanding its overnight delivery service Google Shopping Express from Fresno, Calif. to the Oregon border, according to reports.", "title": "Google Expands Overnight Delivery in NoCal", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/blogs/press-here/Google-Express-Expands-Northern-California-Overnight-Delivery-261878321.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*800/GoogleShoppingExpress.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Google is expanding its overnight delivery service Google Shopping Express from Fresno, Calif. to the Oregon border, according to reports.", "title": "Google Expands Overnight Delivery in NoCal", "url": "http://www.nbcbayarea.com/blogs/press-here/Google-Express-Expands-Northern-California-Overnight-Delivery-261878321.html", "image": "http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/1200*800/GoogleShoppingExpress.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcbayarea", "site": "@nbcbayarea", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 75829892837}, "keywords": "Google, Target, Walgreens, Google Shopping Express, Northern California, Tom Fallows, e-commerce, Amazon", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCBayArea"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Google, Target, Walgreens, Google Shopping Express, Northern California, Tom Fallows, e-commerce, Amazon"}, "article_summary": "Google is expanding its overnight delivery service Google Shopping Express from Fresno, Calif. to the Oregon border, according to reports.\n\u201cIn less dense areas, a partnership with other carriers makes more sense,\u201d Tom Fallows, product management director for Google Shopping Express told the WSJ.\nIt will now be expanding its overnight delivery from the Oregon border to Fresno, Calif. -- about the northern half of the large state.\nGoogle's blue and white vans will still be delivering in cities, but Google declined to give and statistics on the service.\nAs long as the customer types in an order by 7 p.m., the product will be there the next day."}
