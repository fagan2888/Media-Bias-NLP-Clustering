The University of Chicago-trained molecular geneticist laid out his reasons why and I asked you to tell me what you thought.\n\nI recently wrote a column about Regnal Jones, the executive director of a wildly successful program that has helped nearly 5,000 students from underrepresented racial and socioeconomic groups enter health professions.\n\nI heard from many of you, including physicians, interns, medical students, pre-med students and even the parents of medical students. Some of you agreed with Jones saying, among other things, that medical school costs and malpractice insurance are exorbitant, and doctors are often consumed by paperwork rather than patient care.\n\nOthers acknowledged the challenges, but said, despite them, the rewards are tremendous.\n\nOne of the most compelling emails came from Dr. Dionne Hart, a psychiatrist who works for the Federal Bureau of Prisons and is based in Minnesota. She got involved with CAHMCP in 1993 and describes herself as a \"proud graduate\" of the program.\n\nHere's a portion of her email:\n\nI was quite surprised when I recently learned Dr. Jones no longer has the same passion for medicine that helped motivate me to a successful career. I was a 21-year-old divorced mother of three (children, ages 2, 3 and 4) with a dream when I met Dr. Jones. I realized the odds were against me to succeed, but I did. I am now a graduate of a Mayo Clinic Residency program.\n\nI cannot disagree with the statistics and barriers outlined in your article. While I remain very grateful to Dr. Jones, I respectfully disagree with his choice to walk away rather than change the system. We need more bright students to choose a career in medicine. Yes, there will be personal and financial sacrifices but there will also be tremendous opportunities.\n\nThe amount of debt to enter medicine is excessive but the American Medical Association is spearheading a program to innovate changes in medical education. Yes, we need more residency spots but that issue can be addressed by Congress. Yes, most physicians will be employed by a hospital or large group, but that also means improvements in the quality of life for many physicians who are no longer burdened by a pager 24 hours a day.\n\nThe article failed to mention that most physicians would choose the same career again despite those challenges. Physicians can teach, develop public policy, perform research, and most importantly collaborate with others to improve the health of an individual, family and community. I have debt but I've also taken advantage of available loan repayment programs to alleviate the debt. One program led to my choice to work in a correctional facility after completing a residency. I probably would not have considered a career in public service but I'm so grateful that I did.\n\nSo, I telephoned Hart.\n\nShe told me that when she met Jones, she was a University of Chicago graduate and a social worker at a community mental health center on the West Side.\n\n\"The first thing he said when he met me was, 'You're a Rush kid,'\" said Hart. \"I wound up going to Rush Medical College. I had a tough time, but (Jones) had this network of people that he introduced me to and I could call on him or them if I needed help. Rush had a day care and I used that when I needed.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "I recently wrote a column about Regnal Jones, the executive director of a wildly successful program that has helped nearly 5,000 students from underrepresented racial and socioeconomic groups enter...", "title": "Doctor offers a second opinion on health careers", "url": "http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-10-09/news/ct-x-1009-trice-column-20131009_1_health-careers-medical-students-second-opinion", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5530052e/turbine/chi-default-open-graph-ct-logo/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001837105818}, "description": "I recently wrote a column about Regnal Jones, the executive director of a wildly successful program that has helped nearly 5,000 students from underrepresented racial and socioeconomic groups enter", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc94d0\"", "article_summary": "I heard from many of you, including physicians, interns, medical students, pre-med students and even the parents of medical students.\nDoctor offers a second opinion on health careersJones said that he no longer recommends medical school to his students in the Chicago Area Health and Medical Careers Program, based at the Illinois Institute of Technology.\nI was a 21-year-old divorced mother of three (children, ages 2, 3 and 4) with a dream when I met Dr. Jones.\nWhile I remain very grateful to Dr. Jones, I respectfully disagree with his choice to walk away rather than change the system.\n\"I wound up going to Rush Medical College."}
