The self-styled police were wearing orange traffic safety vests with the words \u201cSharia police\u201d written in English on the back.\n\nThe young men, who are believed to be followers of Salafism, have been seen distributing leaflets urging people to refrain from alcohol, drugs, gambling, attending concerts, watching pornography or visiting prostitutes.\n\nThe group has also declared a nightlife area of the city of 340,000 to be a \u201cSharia Controlled Zone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntimidation or provocation won\u2019t be tolerated,\u201d Wuppertal Police Chief Birgitta Rademacher was quoted as saying by Deutshe Welle on Friday. She further said that only police appointed and employed by the state have the legitimate right to act as police in Germany.\n\nThe German Government has strongly condemned the nightly patrols by the self-imposed Sharia police.\n\n\u201cSharia law is not tolerated on German soil,\u201d Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told German daily newspaper Bild on Saturday. \u201cNobody can take it upon themselves to abuse the good name of the German police.\u201d\n\nJustice Minister Heiko Mass also told Bild that the state alone is responsible for the administration of justice in Germany. \u201cAny Illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Muslim community in Germany did not seem to approve of the Sharia police. \u201cThese few teen yobs do not speak in our name,\u201d Ayman A. Mazyek chairman of the central council of Muslims in Germany told the Tagesspiegel am Sonntag newspaper and was cited by Deutshe Welle.\n\n\u201cThese people are perverting the name of our religion. With this shrill and foolish action, they are really hurting Muslims,\u201d he added.\n\nOfficials say that 1,800 people are part of the Salafist scene in the North Rhein-Westphalia area, with ten percent of the members considered to be violent extremists.\n\nThe German Salafi movement was responsible for the 2012 campaign to distribute 25 million free copies of translated Coran, the holy book of Muslims, into German homes.\n\nJoin the Conversation.
