Comedian Mindy Kaling will make her Super Bowl debut in an ad for Nationwide, the latest company to release a teaser of its big game spot.

In the teaser, the “Mindy Star” actress convinces herself she is invisible and tests what kind of antics she can get away with. The aim of the ad is to show that Nationwide sees its customers as individuals, not numbers.

Nationwide, the official insurance sponsor of the National Football League, released a teaser of the ad on Thursday. The full ad, the company’s first Super Bowl ad since 2007,will appear during the game on Feb. 1.

Several Super Bowl advertisers release previews of their Super Bowl spots or the ads in their entirety ahead of the big game, a move that can help drum up buzz for the commercials. Bud Light and Dove Men+Care are among the advertisers that released teasers for their ads earlier this week.
