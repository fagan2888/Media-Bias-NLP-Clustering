(AP Photo/Abdul Basit)\n\nHow do you calculate the human costs of the U.S.-led War on Terror?\n\nOn the 12th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, groups of physicians attempted to arrive at a partial answer to this question by counting the dead.\n\nIn their joint report\u2014 Body Count: Casualty Figures after 10 Years of the \u2018War on Terror\u2014Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival, and the Nobel Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded that this number is staggering, with at least 1.3 million lives lost in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan alone since the onset of the war following September 11, 2001.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nHowever, the report notes, this is a conservative estimate, and the total number killed in the three countries \u201ccould also be in excess of 2 million, whereas a figure below 1 million is extremely unlikely.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the researchers do not look at other countries targeted by U.S.-led war, including Yemen, Somalia, Libya, Syria, and beyond.\n\nEven still, the report states the figure \u201cis approximately 10 times greater than that of which the public, experts and decision makers are aware of and propagated by the media and major NGOs.\n\nIn Iraq, at least 1 million lives have been lost during and since 2003, a figure that accounts for five percent of the nation\u2019s total population. This does not include deaths among the estimated 3 million Iraqi refugees, many of whom were subject to dangerous conditions during this past winter.\n\nFurthermore, an estimated 220,000 people have been killed in Afghanistan and 80,000 in Pakistan, note the researchers. The findings follow a United Nations report which finds that civilian deaths in Afghanistan in 2014 were at their highest levels since the global body began making reports in 2009.\n\nThe researchers identified direct and indirect deaths based on UN, government, and NGO data, as well as individual studies. While the specific number is difficult to peg, researchers say they hope to convey the large-scale of death and loss.\n\nSpeaking with Democracy Now! on Thursday, Dr. Robert Gould, president of the San Francisco Bay Area chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility and co-author of the forward to the report, said:\n\n\u201c[A]t a time when we\u2019re contemplating at this point cutting off our removal of troops from Afghanistan and contemplating new military authorization for increasing our operations in Syria and Iraq, this insulation from the real impacts serves our government in being able to continue to conduct these wars in the name of the war on terror, with not only horrendous cost to the people in the region, but we in the United States suffer from what the budgetary costs of unending war are.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gould\u2019s forward, co-authored with Dr. Tim Takaro, the public is purposefully kept in the dark about this toll.\n\n\u201cA politically useful option for U.S. political elites has been to attribute the on-going violence to internecine conflicts of various types, including historical religious animosities, as if the resurgence and brutality of such conflicts is unrelated to the destabilization cause by decades of outside military intervention,\u201d they write. \u201cAs such, under-reporting of the human toll attributed to ongoing Western interventions, whether deliberate of through self-censorship, has been key to removing the \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of responsibility.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although a conservative estimate, physicians' groups say the figure 'is approximately 10 times greater' than typically reported.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Although a conservative estimate, physicians' groups say the figure 'is approximately 10 times greater' than typically reported.", "title": "Body Count Report Reveals At Least 1.3 Million Lives Lost To US-Led War On Terror", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/body-count-report-reveals-at-least-1-3-million-lives-lost-to-us-led-war-on-terror/203815/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP318318147220.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-27T22:19:43-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although a conservative estimate, physicians' groups say the figure 'is approximately 10 times greater' than typically reported.", "title": "Body Count Report Reveals At Least 1.3 Million Lives Lost To US-Led War On Terror", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AP318318147220.jpg", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "war on terror", "published_time": "2015-03-28T05:00:54-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-27T22:19:43-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "(AP Photo/Abdul Basit)How do you calculate the human costs of the U.S.-led War on Terror?\nIn Iraq, at least 1 million lives have been lost during and since 2003, a figure that accounts for five percent of the nation\u2019s total population.\nWhile the specific number is difficult to peg, researchers say they hope to convey the large-scale of death and loss.\nOn the 12th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, groups of physicians attempted to arrive at a partial answer to this question by counting the dead.\nThe researchers identified direct and indirect deaths based on UN, government, and NGO data, as well as individual studies."}
