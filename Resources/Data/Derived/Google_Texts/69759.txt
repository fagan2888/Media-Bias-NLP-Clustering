LITTLE ROCK, AR - More support is rolling in for a plan that would put an end to a waiting list for therapy services for Arkansans with disabilities.



The Arkansas Waiver Association is now supporting the Community First Choice Option or CFCO.



Recently, families of more than 2,800 Arkansans with disabilities advocated at the capitol for the legislature to approve the plan.



CFCO, seeks to make therapy services available to people with disabilities outside of an institutional setting.



"There are close to 3,000 people on waiting list, some have been waiting for eight years," says Diana Varady.



"Making sure that people have an equal opportunity to receive services in their home as opposed to an institutional setting like a nursing home or a intermediate care facility is very important," says Charlie Green.



Some lawmakers have said they are not sure about accepting additional funds made possible by the affordable care act, to expand services.



CFCO supporters hope the plan will be presented to committee soon.
