They won in a wave landslide running against Obamacare. The national Republican brand or image didn't say a word, which makes the mandate that they have all the more incredible. It is rare that a political party running for office in a midterm election, not standing for anything, ends up with a mandate. And they have one. And it is the biggest, and perhaps the most important mandate a political party has had in the recent era. And it is very simple what that mandate is. It is to stop Barack Obama. It is to stop the Democrat Party. There is no other reason why Republicans were elected yesterday.\n\nRepublicans were not elected to govern. How can you govern with a president that disobeys the constitution? How can you govern with a president that is demonstrably lawless when he thinks he has to be? The Republican Party was not elected to fix a broken system and to make it work. The Republican Party was not elected to compromise. The Republican Party was not elected to sit down and work together with the democrats. The Republican Party was not elected to slow down the speed the country is headed to the cliff, and go over it slowly. The Republican Party was elected to stop before we get to the cliff. And that's the mandate.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "From the November 5 edition of Premiere Radio Networks'\u00a0The Rush Limbaugh Show:", "title": "Limbaugh: Republicans Have A Mandate \"To Stop Barack Obama.\" They \"Were Not Elected To Govern\"", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/11/05/limbaugh-republicans-have-a-mandate-to-stop-bar/201455", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2014/11/05/limbaugh-fb.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-05T14:06:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/video/2014/11/05/limbaugh-republicans-have-a-mandate-to-stop-bar/201455", "title": "Limbaugh: Republicans Have A Mandate \"To Stop Barack Obama.\" They \"Were Not Elected To Govern\"", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Video", "tag": "Premiere Radio Networks", "published_time": "2014-11-05T13:18:35-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T12:47:47-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/media-matters-staff/70"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Republican Party was elected to stop before we get to the cliff.\nIt is rare that a political party running for office in a midterm election, not standing for anything, ends up with a mandate.\nThe Republican Party was not elected to slow down the speed the country is headed to the cliff, and go over it slowly.\nThe Republican Party was not elected to fix a broken system and to make it work.\nThe Republican Party was not elected to sit down and work together with the democrats."}
