A Nevada Supreme Court decision stopped it until jurisdiction - whether the case should stay in Clark County or not - is determined.\n\nAdelson\u2019s appearance followed several days of testimony to make such a determination.\n\nHis was often spent offering unprompted asides about his hard-scrabble upbringing, his advice to Pisanelli and, particularly, his low opinion of Jacobs. Adelson\u2019s chatty responses that didn\u2019t always answer the question at hand even caused his own lawyer, Russell Jones, to jump up objecting.\n\nThroughout, Adelson sprinkled tidbits about himself and his life: He has full-focal lenses embedded in his eyes, but they weren\u2019t working so well Tuesday necessitating the use of a magnifying glass; he was a court reporter early on; his 18-year-old son is an award-winning moot court competitor; and he prefers doing business by phone, not email.\n\n\u201cI recently told my secretary that I need to get, like, a Gmail,\u201d he said as an aside after being asked about his work email accounts. He needed privacy, he said.\n\nAt another moment, the Republican donor who recently hosted possible presidential candidates in Vegas for the weekend related something he read in The New York Times.\n\n\u201cI do read the Times,\u201d he said, knowing there might be skeptics in the room, adding that he even subscribes.\n\n\u201cCome on now,\u201d Pisanelli said with mock shock.\n\nIt was clear Adelson knew the legal lingo often responding to questions from Pisanelli with \u201casked and answered\u201d and protesting that questions were \u201coverreach\u201d as well as refusing to speculate, \u201cthis is a court of law based on facts, not a court of hypothesis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judge later told Adelson he could in fact answer a hypothetical question.\n\nWhen Adelson would go on a tangent, typically accusing Jacobs of being delusional or incompetent, Pisanelli would ask if he was finished.\n\n\u201cFor the time being,\u201d Adelson said once, with a slight smile.\n\nAdelson is expected to return to the stand on Friday morning.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Billionaire casino CEO and chairman Sheldon Adelson knew what the lawyer questioning him was getting at, and he was having none of it Tuesday in a Clark County courtroom where he spent all day answering questions related to a wrongful termination lawsuit, offering comic relief, meandering answers and sharp words for the man suing him.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Billionaire casino CEO and chairman Sheldon Adelson knew what the lawyer questioning him was getting at, and he was having none of it Tuesday in a Clark County courtroom where he spent all day answering questions related to a wrongful termination lawsuit, offering comic relief, meandering answers and sharp words for the man suing him.", "title": "Billionaire Sheldon Adelson takes shots at ex-CEO in court", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/28/billionaire-sheldon-adelson-takes-shots-at-ex-ceo-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/5173faef01aefb13740f6a7067004656.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/28/5173faef01aefb13740f6a7067004656.jpg", "description": "Billionaire casino CEO and chairman Sheldon Adelson knew what the lawyer questioning him was getting at, and he was having none of it Tuesday in a Clark County courtroom where he spent all day answeri", "card": "summary", "title": "Billionaire Sheldon Adelson takes shots at ex-CEO in court"}, "Author": "KIMBERLY PIERCEALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The judge later told Adelson he could in fact answer a hypothetical question.\nWhen Adelson would say one thing, Pisanelli retrieved testimony Adelson gave in a 2012 deposition for the case that usually indicated the opposite.\nBut attorney James Pisanelli, representing Jacobs, argued Adelson decided everything from firing to stock bonuses to seating inside his Macau casino\u2019s restaurants.\nWhen Adelson would go on a tangent, typically accusing Jacobs of being delusional or incompetent, Pisanelli would ask if he was finished.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 8,000 miles away, your honor,\u201d he told Judge Elizabeth Gonzalez, adding it would be impossible to direct from Las Vegas staffs of tens of thousands who work in Macau."}
