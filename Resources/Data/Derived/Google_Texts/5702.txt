University of Colorado police on Sunday identified a man who was found dead on the Boulder campus on Saturday night as a 51-year-old transient.

CU police Cmdr. Robert Axmacher said officials are waiting to release the man's name until next of kin are notified.

The Boulder County Coroner's Office will release the cause and manner of death, but Axmacher said the death didn't appear to be suspicious and there's no ongoing public safety concern.

Emergency crews at 8:40 p.m. Saturday responded to the Bruce Curtis Building, located near the intersection of Broadway and College Avenue, on reports of an adult male who was unconscious.

Paramedics determined that the man was deceased, according to CU police.

It was the second time in two days that a person has been found dead in a public place near Broadway in Boulder.

Boulder police on Friday night investigated the death of a woman whose body was found in the Boulder Creek Path underpass near Broadway and Arapahoe Avenue.

The coroner's office has not yet released the woman's name. Police said there were no outward signs of foul play in her death.
