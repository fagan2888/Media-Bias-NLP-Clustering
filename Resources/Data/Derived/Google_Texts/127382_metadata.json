The switch plays a fundamental role in achieving the promises of Obamacare \u2014 lower costs and more access. Not all North Texas physicians are taking the bait.\n\nThe KERA radio story.\n\nDr. Calvin Simmons is old school. He doesn\u2019t have time limits on patient visits and relies on manila folders stuffed with paper charts. He\u2019s been practicing this way for almost forty years, and he\u2019s not about to pick up an iPad to take notes during an exam.\n\n\u201cI get patients weekly who say the reason I came to see you is because my neighbor said you would look at me while we were talking,\u201d he says.\n\nSimmons, who works at Family Medical Associates in Lewisville, is among the minority of family doctors in North Texas who haven\u2019t gotten on board with electronic medical records, or EMRs*. EMRs are supposed to make caring for patients easier \u2013 simplifying tedious tasks like writing down medical histories, filling out lab requests and managing prescriptions. Simmons says instead of speeding the process up, it distracts him.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re doing electronic medical records for the most part, you\u2019re more attentive to the electronic medical records than you are to the patient,\u201d Simmons says.\n\n(Lauren Silverman/KERA News) Dr. Robert Abbate created OneTouchEMR, a startup in Dallas that sells an iPad app to manage electronic medical records, after searching for a software that was easy to use and coming up empty-handed.\n\n(Lauren Silverman/KERA News) Both Dr. Calvin T. Simmons left) and Dr. Edward Kremer have been practicing at Family Medical Associates in Lewisville, TX for decades. While Kremer has embraced electronic medical records, Simmons refuses to let go of paper.\n\n(Lauren Silverman/KERA News) Dr. Edward Kremer uses his laptop, equipped with a free electronic medical records software called Practice Fusion, to take notes and keep track of all of his patients.\n\nA Second Opinion\n\nTexas doctors in small practices are divided. Just look in the office next door to Calvin Simmons.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t function without an electronic record right now,\u201d Dr. Edward Kremer says.\n\nKremer works with Dr. Simmons, they even cover for each other when one goes out of town. But when it comes time to see a patient, Kremer wheels in a laptop to the exam room instead of carrying a clipboard. He\u2019s an early adopter.\n\n\u201cI started using electronic health record back in 1993, it was a monochrome screen on a portable computer, operating DOS 3.0.\u201d\n\nBack then the system just kept track of basic information and meant less rewriting. The software he uses now, called Practice Fusion, can notify him of allergy alerts and possible drug interactions.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m at home a patient calls me in the middle of the night I can look of up their electronic health record see what I did to them last,\u201d he says.\n\nIt also makes it possible for the patient to access lab results online, rather than having to swing by the office. Dr. Kremer is excited by the potential of cloud-based record keeping and data analysis. His colleague, concerned.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: each doctor has had patients leave because of their approach to technology \u2013 some ditched Simmons, he says, because they wanted him to go digital. Others dropped Kremer because they didn\u2019t like his face glued to the screen.\n\nIncentives, And Penalties\n\nThe federal government has been trying to coax doctors and hospitals to adopt EMRs and health information technology with financial incentives. But soon there will be penalties instead of rewards. Starting in 2015, physicians not using a certified EMR will have Medicare reimbursements cut by 1%. The deduction rate increases in to 2% in 2016, 3% in 2017, 4% in 2018, and up to 95% depending on future adjustments.\n\nTravis Broome leads policy and oversight of electronic health records at the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services in North Texas. He says a key component of Obamacare is switching from paying for services to paying for quality.\n\n\u201cSo if you\u2019re going to pay for quality, you need to measure quality,\u201d Broome says. \u201cMeasuring quality in the past was very, very difficult without technology and we think electronic health records are the tools we need to do that.\u201d\n\nBroome says 80 percent of hospitals in North Texas have gone digital and cashed in on nearly two hundred million federal incentive dollars.\n\nSoon, neither patients nor doctors will have much of a choice. The future is in electronic health records. It\u2019s how and when we use them that\u2019s up in the air.\n\n*Several definitions exist for electronic medical records (EMRs) and electronic health records (EHRs). You will often hear the two terms used interchangeably, but they refer to slightly different things. The EMR is a software system to replace paper charts. EHRs refer to software that connects physicians and other caregivers and coordinate patient information, such as medications, medical history, immunizations, laboratory data, and radiology reports.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "doctors,electronic health records,emrs,medicare,obamacare,obamacare 101", "og": {"image": "http://breakthroughs.kera.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/EMR-photo-laptop-shutterstock.jpg", "type": "website"}, "description": "For years the government has been trying to convince doctors to trade in their pads and pens for computers and tablets \u2013 and not just because their handwriting", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bec\"", "article_summary": "*Several definitions exist for electronic medical records (EMRs) and electronic health records (EHRs).\n\u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019re doing electronic medical records for the most part, you\u2019re more attentive to the electronic medical records than you are to the patient,\u201d Simmons says.\nSimmons, who works at Family Medical Associates in Lewisville, is among the minority of family doctors in North Texas who haven\u2019t gotten on board with electronic medical records, or EMRs*.\nTravis Broome leads policy and oversight of electronic health records at the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services in North Texas.\nWhile Kremer has embraced electronic medical records, Simmons refuses to let go of paper."}
