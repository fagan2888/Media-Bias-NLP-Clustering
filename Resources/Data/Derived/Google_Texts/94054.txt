MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) — Replicas of a sculpture of a knotted pistol that was designed in honor of the late musician John Lennon are being displayed this month in Monterrey, a northern industrial city that knows about gun violence.

The 13 pieces in a variety of colors and designs were made by individuals and organizations. They include a soccer ball motif by the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, as well as a 1960s-style pop art design by Lennon’s fellow Beatle Paul McCartney.

“The presentation is very eloquent, the gun barrel obstructed to promote non-violence … it’s a good idea,” said visitor Lorenzo Zamarron.

The original sculpture, called “Non-Violence,” was created by Swedish artist Carl Fredrik Reutersward as a tribute to Lennon, who preached non-violence but was shot to death outside his New York home in 1980. It was part of the Strawberry Fields memorial in New York’s Central Park and later given to the United Nations, according to the website for the Non-Violence Project.
