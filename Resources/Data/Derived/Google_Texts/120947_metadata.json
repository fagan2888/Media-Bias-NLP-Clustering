A sudden fall. A loud growl. An ominous-looking character. There are many different things that can wake us up from dreams. Chances are, that in those few seconds after, you\u2019ll be able to remember your dream. Fall asleep again though, and it\u2019s forgotten \u2014 unless you\u2019ve taken notes. Very little is understood about why we dream. In an effort to get closer to that answer, however, researchers have discovered the parts of the brain responsible for remembering dreams, and why some people don\u2019t.\n\nThe researchers, from the Lyon Neuroscience Research Center in France, had previously found that people who were likely to remember their dreams, so-called \u201chigh dream recallers,\u201d had twice as many moments of wakefulness and were more reactive to auditory stimuli during sleep than those who rarely remembered dreams, called \u201clow dream recallers.\u201d At the time, the researchers said that these dreamers\u2019 higher levels of neural activity could lead to an easier time remembering what happened.\n\nWhy Some People Remember Their Dreams\n\nThey went a step further in their new study, looking for dream-related regions of the brain that activated during sleep and wakefulness in both groups of dreamers. Out of 41 people, 21 identified themselves as \u201chigh dream recallers\u201d \u2014 remembering them about 5.2 mornings per week \u2014 while the remaining 20 said that they were \u201clow dream recallers,\u201d who remembered their dreams only two times each month.\n\nUsing positron emission tomography (PET) to look at their brains\u2019 activity, the researchers found that \u201chigh dream recallers\u201d showed stronger spontaneous activity in two regions of the brain. One of them, the medial prefrontal cortex, is responsible for making associations between context, locations, events, and adaptive responses like emotions. The second area, called the temporoparietal junction, is responsible for imitation, and forming pictures of oneself and other people in the brain. Hence, the two together could not only help in creating dreams, but also remembering them, too.\n\n\u201cThis may explain why high dream recallers are more reactive to environmental stimuli, awaken more during sleep, and thus better encode dreams in memory than low dream recallers,\u201d Perrine Ruby, a researcher at the Center, said in a statement. \u201cIndeed, the sleeping brain is not capable of memorizing new information; it needs to awaken to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAlthough some people may lament the fact that they can\u2019t ever remember their dreams, there are methods that might be able to help, and many of them involve training your brain to remember and recreate scenes \u2014 activities both of the aforementioned brain parts are good for.\n\nThe Window Treatment\n\nAlthough dreams may seem scattered, in-between the jumps there is detail and some kind of chronology. We can train our brains to remember these details when we awaken by recreating the scene in real life. It\u2019s a technique called the window treatment, according to Discovery.\n\nFor five minutes, watch whatever scenes unfold outside of a window. Observe everything: colors, objects, buildings, cards, people, animals, and movements. Everything from what someone looks like to the colors of their shoes to the speed that they are walking. If there are animals, pay attention to whether they are butterflies or moths, for example, or the specific breed of a dog. If a car is driving down the street, what kind of car is it? Are there any embellishments on it? The goal is to detail, in your head, exactly what you\u2019re seeing \u2014 do not generalize.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve done this, write everything down in a notebook. By experiencing the events and recounting them, you\u2019re training your brain to remember details in real life, and eventually your dreams, too.\n\nWaking Naturally\n\nThis is simple. When alarm clocks wake us up, they\u2019re more likely than not to jolt us out of bed. Like splashing water all over our REM sleep \u2014 when our dreams are most likely to happen \u2014 they quickly snap us out of our dreams. Waking up naturally is a much smoother transition between dream sleeping and wakefulness, and chances are that dreams could be more easily remembered this way. Even taking an extended nap can improve a person\u2019s chances of remembering.\n\nDream Journal\n\nIf you\u2019re serious about remembering your dreams, and even getting into a more advanced stage of dreaming, called lucid dreams, a dream journal may be effective, according to Lucidity. This technique is similar to the window treatment, although it\u2019s done in fragments, by recording any sliver of information you remember from a dream. Rather than waiting for the morning to write in the journal, keep it close to you at night, and as soon as you wake up from a dream, write whatever you can remember \u2014 again, all the details, like you would with the window treatment. If you don\u2019t want to write everything down, take notes of key points. Soon enough, dreams should start to become more vivid, and remembering them should be easier as well.\n\nSource: Eichenlaub J, Nicolas A, Ruby P, et al.
