This is just too good an opportunity to pass up.\u201d\n\nMore than 22% of Long Beach residents do not have health insurance, according to city officials. The state average is about 18%.\n\nAlthough Covered California has funding for some community-based organizations seeking to become authorized enrollment entities, it does not offer funding for city or county governments.\n\n\u201cThat was definitely a factor in our considering whether this was right for us or not,\u201d said Long Beach Health Director Kelly Colopy. \u201cWe think it\u2019s important enough for Long Beach that we should be doing this whether we\u2019re getting reimbursed or not,\u201d Colopy said.\n\nColopy said the new duties will not require extra staff members or add to existing workloads because health department staff members already screen residents for eligibility for several government sponsored programs, including Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cPart of why this makes such good sense for us is because expanded Medi-Cal \u2014 along with the exchange \u2014 will mean so many more people will qualify,\u201d Barrit said. \u201cIt makes sense that people like us who are already doing the work should go the extra step to be certified so residents can go directly into Covered California,\u201d Barrit said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already getting a lot of people shopping and asking us what they\u2019re eligible for. We can steer them in the right direction now, but once we get the training and are cleared by Covered California, we can actually sign them up. That\u2019s right in line with our public health mission,\u201d Barrit said.\n\nOther City, County Governments May Follow\n\nOfficials at the League of California Cities don\u2019t know of other cities considering the same path as Long Beach, but \u201cit will probably be only larger cities that have health departments,\u201d said Eva Spiegel, spokesperson for the organization.\n\n\u201cMost cities don\u2019t do health and human services so it\u2019s not a common issue. Health programs are almost always run by counties in California,\u201d Spiegel said.\n\nCounty governments \u2014 some of them with their own health insurance plans offered through Covered California \u2014 have been getting ready for changes in enrollment and eligibility for months, if not years.\n\nContra Costa County, one of the counties offering coverage through the exchange, is applying to become a Covered California certified enrollment entity.\n\n\u201cWhile we do own our own HMO and it is being offered in Covered California, we would be applying for certification no matter what because it\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d said Wanda Session, assistant to Contra Costa Health Services Director William Walker. \u201cThis is the population that we serve and we have traditionally reached out to low income to help them enroll in coverage. This makes good sense for us,\u201d Session said.\n\n\u201cThis really is a big opportunity for people like us who have fought for years and years to get people coverage. Now, not only is the coverage there, but for the most part people who didn\u2019t used to be able to afford it \u2014 or couldn\u2019t even get it because of pre-existing conditions \u2014 can get it now,\u201d Session said.\n\nSome Counties May Keep Things Separate\n\nSome of California\u2019s 58 counties may elect to leave Covered California enrollment in the hands of the new employees in three new call centers set up in the past several months.\n\nCounties will be busy with expanded Medi-Cal enrollment and will be working closely with Covered California, whether they elect to become authorized enrollment entities or not.\n\nStatewide, counties have added 2,500 workers to handle changes associated with the Affordable Care Act, according to officials at the County Welfare Directors Association of California.\n\n\u201cBecause of our existing responsibility to determine eligibility for Medi-Cal \u2014 along with other social service programs such as CalFresh and CalWORKs \u2014 our eligibility workers are different than the \u2018certified enrollment counselors,'\u201d said Sarah Jimenez, communications and outreach coordinator for the Welfare Directors Association.\n\nJimenez said city and county health issues are not usually comparable.\n\n\u201cThe issue before the City of Long Beach would be an apples-to-orange comparison because cities \u2014 with the exception of the city/county of San Francisco \u2014 do not determine health and human services eligibility and enrollment like counties do,\u201d Jimenez said.\n\nCovered California enrollment workers usually ask a few quick questions to identify individuals likely to qualify for Medi-Cal. Likely beneficiaries are directed \u2014 via a \u201cwarm handoff\u201d \u2014 from state call center workers to county eligibility workers at one of 32 county service centers across the state.\n\n* * *\n\nGeorge Lauer is the California Healthline Features Edito.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 1374972679394361}, "description": "Originally published at California Healthline.
