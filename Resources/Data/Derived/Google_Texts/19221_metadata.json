Will White House staff enroll in Obamacare?\u201d\n\nYglesias thinks Henry is asking whether, if the choice is either no insurance at all or Obamacare, Carney would choose Obamacare\u2013which would indeed be an uninterestingly obvious decision. But that\u2019s not what Henry said, and it seems clear he was asking something else\u2013one of two things, actually:\n\n1) Would Carney give up whatever insurance he has now to sign up for Obamacare on an exchange?\n\nor\n\n2) If Carney were uninsured, would he sign up for an Obamacare plan or obtain insurance some other way, given that he could probably afford an alternative (if there is one)? This is analagous to asking public officials if they\u2019d send their kids to public schools.\n\nNot the most brilliant question ever\u2013Carney was able to duck it by basically answering \u201cno\u201d for # 1 and \u201cabsolutely\u201d for #2 (and who\u2019s going to check?). But it\u2019s not the dumbest either\u2013and at least version #2 isn\u2019t the \u201cno brainer\u201d Yglesias assumes, since Obamacare\u2019s choices may have limitations on access to doctors up with no affluent D.C. yuppie like Carney will not put. \u2026\n\nBasically, Henry is trying to raise the argument that what Obamacare offers to the uninsured poor isn\u2019t a product that the top 40% are likely to purchase themselves--like providing free public education so mediocre the affluent jump through hoops to get out of it.** You may not care about that, if you are willing to abandon any notions of solidarity or social equality or class-mixing in order to get the poor some kind of insurance as cheaply as possible. Yglesias may not care about it (he seems like a take-care-of-the-poor, let-me-have-my-brie snob). But it\u2019s not dumb to care about it.\n\nP.S.: Some would suggest that Slate\u2018s cheesy sneering hype of a weak item itself reflects the increasing desperation of trying to grab hits from Buzzfeed readers on a partisan cocooned Internet the highly competitive Web environment in which we find ourselves. I prefer to think Yglesias, like Paul Krugman, is working on a fabulous book project and only has a few precious seconds to devote to his column these days. \u2026\n\n_____\n\n**\u2013Is Henry\u2019s implicit claim accurate? Is that what will happen? We don\u2019t know. Only one way to find out for sure, which is to let the Obamacare exchanges get started and see what happens. That\u2019s one of the strongest reasons for not blocking Obamacare now, via threat of shutdown or default, even if you don\u2019t like it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Mickey Kaus", "description": "Wicksell Weeps:\u00a0Matthew Yglesias, still basking in the glow of his 2011 prediction of the \"magnificent\" economic boom of 2012\u00a0(\"Happy days ... will be here", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Wicksell Weeps:\u00a0Matthew Yglesias, still basking in the glow of his 2011 prediction of the \"magnificent\" economic boom of 2012\u00a0(\"Happy days ... will be here again\"), declares (according to Slate's he", "title": "World\u2019s Dumbest Blog Item Ever of All Time!", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/04/worlds-dumbest-blog-item-ever-of-all-time/", "image": {"width": 90, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/themes/thedc/images/the-dc.png", "height": 90}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/10/04/worlds-dumbest-blog-item-ever-of-all-time/", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "description": "Wicksell Weeps:\u00a0Matthew Yglesias, still basking in the glow of his 2011 prediction of the \"magnificent\" economic boom of 2012\u00a0(\"Happy days ... will be here...", "card": "summary", "title": "World\u2019s Dumbest Blog Item Ever of All Time!
