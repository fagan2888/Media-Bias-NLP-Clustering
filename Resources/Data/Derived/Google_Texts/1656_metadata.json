Insurance companies can require in-person health care delivery, as a condition of coverage, for patients residing in counties with more than 150,000 residents.\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Rep. Perry Buck, R-Windsor, and Rep. Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, would remove population restrictions effective Jan. 1, 2017.\n\nIf passed, the bill would preclude health plans from requiring in-person care if consulting, monitoring and other care could be administered effectively at a distance. It would prevent plans from reimbursing providers who deliver telehealth on a different basis than for in-person care. Health plans could not charge different deductibles, co-payments or co-insurance amounts or set different annual or lifetime dollar maximums.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado House advances bill on statewide delivery of telemedicine", "title": "Colorado House advances bill on statewide delivery of telemedicine", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/28/colorado-house-advances-bill-on-statewide-delivery-of-telemedicine/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150128__telemedicine-demonstrationp1.jpg", "height": 466}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150128__telemedicine-demonstrationp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-28T10:32:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:49:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Insurance companies can require in-person health care delivery, as a condition of coverage, for patients residing in counties with more than 150,000 residents.\nIf passed, the bill would preclude health plans from requiring in-person care if consulting, monitoring and other care could be administered effectively at a distance.\nA bipartisan bill that would bolster telehealth across Colorado by preventing insurance plans from requiring in-person care to patients when it can be appropriately provided remotely passed the House Wednesday.\nHealth plans could not charge different deductibles, co-payments or co-insurance amounts or set different annual or lifetime dollar maximums.\nThe bill, which now moves to the Senate, would expand current state law on telehealth \u2014 care delivered remotely via computers, cameras, smartphones and other devices."}
