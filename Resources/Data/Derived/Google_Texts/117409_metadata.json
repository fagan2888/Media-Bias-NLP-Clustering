Though rare, the disease often affects more than one person in families carrying these defective genes, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reported \u2014 a truth Hollywood movie producer Gordon Gray learned himself.\n\nGray, who\u2019s known for producing The Rookie and Miracle, recently revealed his two young daughters Charlotte, 4, and Gwenyth, 2, were diagnosed with the disease in March; there is currently no cure. Initially, children with the disease start experienced vison problems, seizures, or personality and behavior changes during onset, which is usually between ages 5 and 10. Over time, the NINDS added, children\u2019s symptoms significantly worsen and become \u201cblind, bedridden, and demented.\u201d\n\nABC News reported Gray\u2019s daughter Charlotte is already showing signs of struggle.\n\n\u201cShe has the same heart and she still loves life, but she is having a hard time,\u201d Kristen Gray, the children\u2019s mother, told ABC. \u201cWe don't know what tomorrow's going to look like for Charlotte and Gwenyth.\u201d\n\nWith hopes to bring light to their situation, Gray and his wife have begun the Charlotte and Gwenyth Gray Foundation to Cure Batten Disease, a foundation devoted to raising the necessary money \u201cto fund the urgent medical research to save the lives of all children devastated by this disease.\u201d This amounts to $10 million.\n\nABC added Gray believes he\u2019s found the scientists and doctors in position to \u201ccure our girls,\u201d but there\u2019s a severe lack of funding. To reach his goals as soon as possible, Gray has asked a large group of people, including celebrities like Reese Witherspoon and Channing Tatum, to donate a single dollar to the foundation through various social media networks; those donating or simply spreading the word are using the hashtag #CureBatten.\n\nAs of this print, the foundation has raised $528, 001 so far, growing from just $356,000 the day before. Kristen said the outpour of Hollywood support in the two days since announcing their crowdfundraiser gives her and her family hope.\n\n\u201cIt gives us hope that not only are we going to be able to save our daughters, but we're going to be able to save these other children,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd her husband concluded: \u201cWe\u2019re never going to give up hope.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "rookie, producer, gordon, gray, raises, awareness, batten, disease, after, daughters, diagnoses", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Gordon and Kristen Gray have launched a foundation to raise awareness and money for the rare and fatal batten disease.", "title": "Hollywood Comes Together To Fight Batten Disease", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/rookie-producer-gordon-gray-raises-awareness-batten-disease-after-daughters-diagnoses-338036", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/12/rookie-producer-gordon-gray-raises-awareness-batten-disease-after-daughters-diagnoses.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gordon and Kristen Gray have launched a foundation to raise awareness and money for the rare and fatal batten disease.", "title": "Hollywood Comes Together To Fight Batten Disease", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/rookie-producer-gordon-gray-raises-awareness-batten-disease-after-daughters-diagnoses-338036", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/12/rookie-producer-gordon-gray-raises-awareness-batten-disease-after-daughters-diagnoses.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/12/rookie-producer-gordon-gray-raises-awareness-batten-disease-after-daughters-diagnoses.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-12T16:53:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-12T16:53:57-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Gordon and Kristen Gray have launched a foundation to raise awareness and money for the rare and fatal batten disease."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ed8\"", "article_summary": "Batten disease is a rare, neurodegenerative disorder children inherit from their parents: two defective genes, one from each parent.\nThough rare, the disease often affects more than one person in families carrying these defective genes, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) reported \u2014 a truth Hollywood movie producer Gordon Gray learned himself.\nGray, who\u2019s known for producing The Rookie and Miracle, recently revealed his two young daughters Charlotte, 4, and Gwenyth, 2, were diagnosed with the disease in March; there is currently no cure.\nInitially, children with the disease start experienced vison problems, seizures, or personality and behavior changes during onset, which is usually between ages 5 and 10.\nABC added Gray believes he\u2019s found the scientists and doctors in position to \u201ccure our girls,\u201d but there\u2019s a severe lack of funding."}
