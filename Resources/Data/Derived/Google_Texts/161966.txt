While the Affordable Care Act (ACA) market reform provisions have undoubtedly limited the usefulness of health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs), when it comes to pre-Medicare age retirees, these vehicles may still prove to be an important tool for employers.

HRAs were once a popular vehicle that employers funded to assist employees with the cost of health insurance coverage without actually providing such coverage through their own plans—a strategy that can now generate steep penalties. Despite this, an exception allows employers to continue to provide assistance through HRAs to retired employees (who may be eligible for premium assistance tax credits) while reducing the employer’s exposure to the Cadillac tax—if the proper steps are taken to ensure that the HRA qualifies as a retiree-only HRA.
