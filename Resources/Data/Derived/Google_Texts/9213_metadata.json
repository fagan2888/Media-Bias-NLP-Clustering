U.S. health care costs rose by just 3.7 percent in 2012, according to a report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), marking the fourth consecutive year of slow growth.\n\nEven spending on prescription drugs has continued to slow over the past several years, largely because of the rise of cheaper generic drugs \u2013 and the expiration of patents of several big-name drugs, including Lipitor and Plavix. That allowed cheaper generics to enter the market.\n\nRelated: Hepatitis-C Could Wallop the U.S. in the Coming Decades\n\nThe one exception, however, has been spending on new innovative specialty drugs that are being rapidly cranked out by pharmaceutical companies to treat multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia, and osteoporosis \u2013 even erectile dysfunction.\n\nSince 2007, the cost of many of the brand names associated with those drugs has skyrocketed, according to a recent Bloomberg News analysis, with prices in many cases doubling and tripling. \"While the consumer price index rose just 12 percent in the period,\u201d Bloomberg reported, \u201cone diabetes drug quadrupled in price and another rose by 160 percent.\"\n\nThe analysis was done in conjunction with Los Angeles based DRX, which provides software to compare health care plans. The study highlighted the extraordinary growth in cost of these drugs, both in percentage growth during the past few years and absolute costs.\n\nFor example, patients being treated with Cimzia for rheumatoid arthritis must pay $3,322 for two injections. A patient using Copaxone for multiple sclerosis must pay $6,072 for 30 syringes, according to the analysis. A single capsule of Viagra to treat erectile dysfunction costs $34.\n\nFor health care industry mavens who fret about long-term costs, the emergence of yet another high-profile specialty drug has many worrying.\n\nRelated: Insurers Scrutinize Drug Costs After $84,000 Sovaldi Surprise\n\nSovaldi, a new specialty drug manufactured by Gilead Sciences Inc. and approved by the Food and Drug Administration six months ago, offers huge advances in the treatment of Hepatitis C and guarantees a cure rate of 90 percent. But the medicine, which is getting a lot of attention, costs $1,000 per pill \u2013 or $84,000 for the obligatory 12-week treatment.\n\nAs many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by Hepatitis C and could benefit greatly from the new treatment. Still, the total cost of simply covering those people with the new drug would exceed the $300 billion that the U.S. currently spends annually on pharmaceuticals.\n\nSovaldi is just the leading edge of an extraordinary surge in specialty drugs that threatens to saddle consumers, health insurers, businesses and others with unprecedented and unsustainable costs \u2013 even as these drugs offer important advances in treating cancer, multiple sclerosis and other serious illnesses and disease.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only unaffordable for the individual, but the system can\u2019t absorb that much,\u201d John Rother, chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, said Monday in an interview. \u201cThere are something like 200 specialty drugs in the pipeline. And if they\u2019re all priced that way, that\u2019s going to break the bank.\u201d\n\nRelated: We Can Find Consensus on Health Care Cost Reforms\n\nRother and his group of business leaders, health care providers and some drug manufacturers launched a campaign last week to highlight the mounting cost of specialty drugs. Rother has urged pharmaceutical officials to find ways to reduce the cost of breakthrough therapie,s while continuing to cover companies\u2019 research costs and compensate them for innovations that can save lives and reduce medical complications.\n\n\u201cWe need to reward the innovation, but they need to keep it affordable,\u201d Rother said. \u201cWe need a new model for pricing that better balances rewards for innovation with the need for affordability and accessibility for patients. I think it has gotten out of balance recently and that\u2019s not going to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nFor health insurers who must pick up the tab for many of these new drugs, Sovaldi is a cautionary tale of things to come. Karen Ignagni, president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), the major health insurance lobby, was even more direct in her criticism of the rapid growth in the cost of specialty drugs. \u201cWhen you look at the six-figure prices of specialty drugs, you come away with the conclusion that the pricing is anything that pharmaceutical companies and manufacturers can get away with,\u201d she told CNN last week.\n\nThe chief spokesperson for U.S. drug manufacturers said recently, \u201cIt is penny wise and pound foolish to focus solely on the price of a new medicine while completely ignoring the value it provides to patients and the health care system broadly.\u201d\n\nRelated: Has the U.S. Found a Cure for Rising Health Costs?\n\n\u201cCuring Hepatitis C not only dramatically improves patients\u2019 lives, but has the potential to save the U.S. health care system as much as $9 billion per year by preventing expensive hospitalizations and avoiding thousands of liver transplants that routinely cost over $500,000 each,\u201d said John Castellani, president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).\n\nCastellani took a shot at the insurance industry, saying that the increased attention on the cost of new medicines \u201cis being fueled by the fact that we have an outdated insurance model that is forcing patients to pay an ever-growing share of their prescription drug costs.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurers are increasingly imposing unprecedented cost-sharing on patients that deters them from utilizing the medicines they need to manage \u2013 or even cure \u2013 their disease while covering the vast majority of costs of more expensive hospitalizations and services these medicines could prevent.\u201d\n\nCara Miller, a spokesperson for Gilead Sciences, defended the drug's pricing in an emailed statement: \u201cWhile Sovaldi greatly enhances the standard of care for Hepatitis C, it was priced such that the total regimen cost is equal to that of prior standard of care regimens.\u201d\n\nJoseph Antos, a health care expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said that both sides are being somewhat disingenuous. Drug manufactures are seeking to justify exorbitant prices on economic grounds when \u201cthere\u2019s no exact science here at all,\u201d while insurers, consumers and others resort to public relations postures that \u201chave little to do with price negotiations.\"\n\nTwelve of the Most Expensive Specialty Drugs Drug Purpose Price Manufacturer Sovaldi Hepatitis C $1,000 Per Pill Gilead Sciences Copaxone Multiple Sclerosis $6,072 for 30 Syringes Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Avastin Cancer $5,560 for 2 Vials Genentech Rebif Multiple Sclerosis $967 per mililiter Merck KGaA Avonex Multiple Sclerosis $1363 for 1 Injection Biogen Idec Inc.
