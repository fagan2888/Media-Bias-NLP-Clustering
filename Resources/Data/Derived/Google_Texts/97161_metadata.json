However, his fingerprints match the biometric records of a Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte in a federal database, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said.\n\nMonroy-Bracamonte was first removed from the country in 1997 after being convicted in Arizona for possession of narcotics for sale. Monroy-Bracamonte was arrested and repatriated to Mexico a second time in 2001, Kice said.\n\nThe suspect and his wife went on a lethal crime spree:\n\nauthorities sought a motive for the shootings that began when Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range as he checked out a suspicious car in a motel parking lot. (snip)\n\nAfter he was killed, the gunman shot Anthony Holmes, 38, of Sacramento at least twice, including once in the head, during an attempted carjacking. He was in fair condition.\n\nThe attackers then stole a pickup truck and fled about 30 miles northeast into neighboring Placer County.\n\nTwo deputies who approached the pickup while it was parked alongside a road were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon and never had a chance to return fire, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said.\n\nHomicide Detective Michael David Davis Jr., 42, died at a hospital 26 years to the day after his father, for whom he was named, died in the line of duty as a Riverside County deputy.\n\nDeputy Jeff Davis was treated for a gunshot wound to the arm. The two deputies are not related.\n\nThe gunman fled into a neighborhood near a high school and ran into a home.
