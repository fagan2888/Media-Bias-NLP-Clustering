A 21-year-old man died after over-correcting his car and crashing into a field in Kearny County.

The Kansas Highway Patrol reports this happened around 4:45 a.m. on US 50 west of Deerfield.

The 2001 Chevrolet truck was driving eastbound on US 50 when the driver lost control of his vehicle. The truck traveled across a ditch and a yard before entering an adjacent field and rolling over multiple times. The driver was ejected; a report says he was not wearing a seat belt.

KHP says that Gerardo Gonzalez-Rivera of Garden City was the driver killed in the accident.
