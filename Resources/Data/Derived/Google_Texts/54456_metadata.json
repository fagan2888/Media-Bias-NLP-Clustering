People are willing to \u201cburn up their political capital with their relationships much faster\u201d because of that pressure.\n\nGOP-dominated firms \u2014 including Clark Geduldig Cranford & Nielsen, S-3 Group, BGR Group, Lugar-Hellmann Group, Gavel Resources, Fierce Government Relations, Harbinger Strategies and Republic Consulting \u2014 are in high demand as clients scramble for access to the new Congress.\n\nAnd that\u2019s on top of thousands of Republican lobbyists in bipartisan firms large and small.\n\nMeanwhile, recent bipartisan deals on budget initiatives, Medicare payment rates and legislation to curb human trafficking have all paved the way for higher expectations in the corporate world.\n\n\u201cEven with slim majority in the Senate, periodic Democratic filibusters and an administration that often sits back and throws bombs at Republicans, clients expect GOP consultants to find the path forward to advance their priorities,\u201d said Loren Monroe, a principal at BGR Group. \u201cFrankly, any good lobbyist should be comfortable being evaluated on their ability to help clients accomplish objectives.\u201d\n\nMany of the same trends happened after the 2008 elections, when firms close to senior Democrats began to reap the benefits of having President Obama in office and Democrats holding majorities in both chambers.\n\nTwo firms in particular \u2014 Podesta Group and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck \u2014 saw their lobbying earnings skyrocket in 2009. In the years prior, both had been near the bottom of the top 20 firms by revenue. As Obama entered the White House, they shot to the top.\n\nAfter the 2008 elections, \u201cthere was heightened activity and expectations to have relationships with the Democrats,\u201d said Al Mottur, a senior Democrat at Brownstein. \u201cBusiness interests looked to engage in that activity to protect their interests. You have the same thing happening now on the Republican side.\u201d\n\nPolicy fights during that time, however, were on large legislative packages such as the economic stimulus, ObamaCare and Dodd-Frank financial reform, so the pressure from clients wasn\u2019t as intense, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen Congress reforms the entire financial services sector, Goldman Sachs isn\u2019t expecting guaranteed results from their lobbying efforts, nor should they be,\u201d Mottur said.\n\nA policy environment fostering \u201cincremental, smaller initiatives,\u201d like the recent \u201cdoc fix\u201d compromise, may mean higher expectations, he said.\n\nWhile Brownstein profited from Democratic control, it has managed to sustain high earnings by bringing on former GOP leadership aides such as Barry Jackson and Marc Lampkin, who both worked for Speaker John Boehner John BoehnerOvernight Finance: Puerto Rico bill clears panel | IRS chief vows to finish term | Bill would require nominees to release tax returns Overnight Defense: Pentagon chief fears sequestration's return GOP senator: Reid's 'ramblings' are 'bitter, vulgar, incoherent' MORE (R-Ohio).\n\nThere\u2019s another shift happening on K Street as lobbying spending begins to tick upward, creating pressure to perform.\n\n\u201cWhen times were tough in this town, there probably was a resistance to bringing on additional resources,\u201d and the directive \u201cfrom C-suite was to lower the cost of Washington,\u201d said Bill Jarrell of Gavel Resources, a Republican firm founded this year.\n\nDuring the economic decline, many corporations and business interests cut back on advocacy.\n\n\u201cBut now in this new world, you\u2019re seeing more opportunities,\u201d he added.\n\nOne Republican lobbyist, who asked not to be named, said that more legislative activity means that his Democratic counterparts are being held to a higher standard as well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increased pressure for everyone to get back on their game,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Republican-controlled Congress is creating great expectations on K Street.", "description": "The Republican-controlled Congress is creating great expectations on K Street.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
