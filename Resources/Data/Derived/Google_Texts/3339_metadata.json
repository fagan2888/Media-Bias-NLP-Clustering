As a scientist at the Boulder-based National Center for Atmospheric Research, he has the advantage of understanding exactly what conditions in the sky produce these explosions of color.\n\n\u201cThere are a couple of things that have been working in our favor in the past few weeks,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of those things is that seasonal monsoon moisture is producing clouds that serve as canvases for the color.\n\nLight from the sun when it\u2019s low in the sky is scattered in the atmosphere such that reds and oranges are brought out. A low sun under a cloud deck can equal brilliant sunsets.\n\nBut large airborne particles from wildfires in the western United States have heightened the effect of scattering on the Front Range, and it\u2019s the combination of smoke and monsoon moisture that\u2019s creating the remarkable views, Weber said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Smoke from fires, clouds enhance area\u2019s sunsets", "title": "Smoke from fires, clouds enhance area\u2019s sunsets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/02/smoke-from-fires-clouds-enhance-areas-sunsets/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__BN20130902_Z00_BNCD02SUNSETSp1.jpg", "height": 417}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130902__BN20130902_Z00_BNCD02SUNSETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-02T20:03:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T14:24:01+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95ef\"", "article_summary": "One of those things is that seasonal monsoon moisture is producing clouds that serve as canvases for the color.\nLONGMONT \u2014 If you\u2019ve noticed an abundance of spectacular sunsets along the Front Range lately, you\u2019re not alone.\n\u201cThere are a couple of things that have been working in our favor in the past few weeks,\u201d he said.\nLight from the sun when it\u2019s low in the sky is scattered in the atmosphere such that reds and oranges are brought out.\nBut large airborne particles from wildfires in the western United States have heightened the effect of scattering on the Front Range, and it\u2019s the combination of smoke and monsoon moisture that\u2019s creating the remarkable views, Weber said."}
