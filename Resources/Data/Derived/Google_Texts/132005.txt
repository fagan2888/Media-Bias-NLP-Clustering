Some states are tinkering with the federal governmentâ€™s Medicaid expansion program by using it to force new Medicaid patients to pay for and invest in their own health coverage.

As reported by NPR, the states of Michigan and Indiana have already implemented Medicaid expansion programs that require copays of participants, and strongly encourage them to invest up to $25 a month in what is essentially a health savings account from which they will pay part of their own medical expenses.
