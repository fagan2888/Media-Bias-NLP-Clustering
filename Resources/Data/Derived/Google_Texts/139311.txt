Oklahoma City police arrested a man who is accused of inappropriately touching a young boy. Police say they also found a photo of the boy naked in the man's cellphone.



According to police, at about 9 p.m. Wednesday, officers responded to a child molestation report in northwest Oklahoma City. A mother said her son, who is under five years old, told her that he wanted a gun, because 20-year-old Deon Mitchell touched him in his private area when he was taking a bath.

The mother had Mitchell's cell phone and showed police a photo of the victim standing beside a bath tub naked.

The mother told police that she has known Mitchell for a long time and he watches her kids when she goes to work.

Officers then took Mitchell into custody. He has been booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on charges of lewd acts with a child under 16 and child pornography.
