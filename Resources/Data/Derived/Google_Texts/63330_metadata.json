And check out OPM\u2019s FEGLI handbook as of April 2014.\n\nOPM also announced there will be a FEGLI Open Season from Sept. 1, 2016, through Sept. 30, 2016, but the effective dates for any changes to coverage will be delayed about a year \u2013 to the beginning of the first full pay period on or after Oct. 1, 2017. FEGLI Open Seasons are rare: The last one was in 2004. Retirees can never increase their FEGLI coverage, but employees and retirees can reduce or cancel FEGLI at any time regardless of Open Season.\n\nFederal employees are automatically enrolled in basic life insurance when they are hired, and can choose to add other options, based on different factors, including dependents. The government pays one-third of the premium cost for basic insurance, and the employee pays two-thirds. (The Postal Service pays the whole tab for basic insurance for its employees.) Employees who choose other options outside of basic insurance foot the entire bill. According to OPM, 73 percent of federal employees in 2013 were enrolled in the FEGLI program.\n\nFor an analysis of FEGLI, check out this 2012 Retirement Planning column from Government Executive columnist Tammy Flanagan.\n\n(Image via T33kid/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kellie Lunney", "description": "Premiums will increase for retiree basic coverage and other options under older age bands.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Premiums will increase for retiree basic coverage and other options under older age bands.", "title": "Some Feds Will See Life Insurance Rate Hikes in January", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2015/08/some-feds-will-see-life-insurance-rate-hikes-january/119028/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/11/shutterstock_83946874.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Premiums will increase for retiree basic coverage and other options under older age bands.", "creator": "@klunney", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/11/shutterstock_83946874/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Some Feds Will See Life Insurance Rate Hikes in January", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-11T16:15:03Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/11/shutterstock_83946874.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Some Feds Will See Life Insurance Rate Hikes in January", "keywords": "federal employees health benefits program, fegli, benefits", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/11/shutterstock_83946874/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "channel-pay-&-benefits,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Premiums will increase for retiree basic coverage and other options under older age bands."}, "article_summary": "Some federal employees and retirees who have life insurance will see their premium rates change as of Jan. 1, 2016.\nHere are the highlights from OPM\u2019s announcement:No changes to premium rates for Basic Insurance for employees.\nMost premium rates for Option A, Option B, and Option C will decrease.\nRates under Post-Retirement Basic Insurance with a 50 percent reduction and no reduction will increase.\nFederal employees are automatically enrolled in basic life insurance when they are hired, and can choose to add other options, based on different factors, including dependents."}
