Marco Rubio (R-FL) cast the deciding vote for Obamatrade on Tuesday as it squeeked through the U.S. Senate 60-37, and his Senate office is still outright refusing to answer whether he even knew what he was voting on.\n\nRubio, a Republican presidential candidate, was the deciding vote necessary for the U.S. Senate to clear the final 60-vote threshold and eventually, later this week, send to President Barack Obama\u2019s desk the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) bill that would fast-track at least three highly secretive trade deals that Obama has been negotiating for years.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTPA will, now that it\u2019s going to pass, effectively ensure the congressional approval of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The text of the TiSA and T-TIP agreements is currently entirely secretive, even to lawmakers on Capitol Hill and their staffs, though WikiLeaks did uncover several TiSA documents that leaked and prove the deal would surrender congressional power over U.S. immigration policy to the executive branch and perhaps to a newly created transnational entity.\n\nThe TPP text for the Pacific Rim trade deal that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) notes would give the Sultan of Brunei\u2014who has implemented Sharia Law in his nation and banned Christmas, literally\u2014an \u201cequal vote to that of the United States,\u201d on the other hand, is available for members of Congress to read. The only catch is they have to go to a secret room inside the Capitol basement for classified readings to read it in person, they can\u2019t take notes, and only their staffers with enough high enough security clearances can go with them to read it\u2014and their staff can\u2019t go without them.\n\nBefore the Senate voted on TPA to fast track these deals the first time back in May, Breitbart News asked every Senate Republican if they read the text of the TPP before voting to fast-track it. Only a handful said they did.\n\nSens. Rand Paul (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), James Lankford (R-OK) and Mike Lee (R-UT) went to go read it. Rubio, on the other hand, was one of many who has consistently and repeatedly refused to answer whether he read the deal text. His office refuse to answer yet again on Tuesday whether he went to go read it before the first time he voted for TPA or before the second time he did\u2014on Tuesday\u2019s cloture vote\u2014and that means he\u2019s again choosing to give the public impression he did not read the text of the deal before he voted to fast track it through Congress.\n\nThis could have significant implications for Rubio on the campaign trail as he seeks the Republican nomination for the presidency as activists in early states are furious with his decision to support Obamatrade when it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nNew Hampshire conservative and Merrimack Councilman Bill Boyd, who\u2019s endorsed Paul for president, told Breitbart News while on a recent reporting trip to New Hampshire that he\u2019s upset that Rubio didn\u2019t read the deal before he voted to fast-track it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been the biggest advocate against Obamacare and the ACA, and for all the time Nancy Pelosi kept on saying \u2018we have to pass this bill to find out what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d Boyd said.\n\nYou\u2019re telling me Marco Rubio voted for a bill without reading it? Are you kidding? You know what, we elect people to go down there to represent us. At a bare minimum you have staff. Staff should be providing some kind of an executive summary. If it\u2019s a thousand pages, you should be cutting it up and giving it to staff and get 10 or 20 page synopses. If your staff can\u2019t bring a particular issue on in a two page memo than they have no idea what they\u2019re talking about. For Sen. Rubio to admit that, that\u2019s kind of surprising. That\u2019s kind of surprising not to read a document and make an opinion without even looking at it. You need to be able to formulate an opinion. If somebody gives you the cliff notes version of a bill, that\u2019s at least better than not reading it at all. So that\u2019s kind of surprising.\n\nBoyd told Breitbart News he endorsed Paul for president because Paul is not just fighting the Democrats and the Washington machine\u2014he\u2019s fighting the Republican establishment and Wall Street too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a middle class kid, and my wife and I we lead middle class lives\u2014and Senator Paul rallying against Wall Street and corporate cronyism I think is very compelling,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cI\u2019m a student of the constitution, a big fan of the Bill of Rights and to me there\u2019s no bigger advocate for the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and I\u2019ll throw in the Declaration of Independence than Senator.\u201d\n\nDerry town councilman Mark Osborne also was shocked that Rubio didn\u2019t read the bill before he voted for it.\n\n\u201cI would be embarrassed to show for a town council meeting never having read the information that I needed to,\u201d Osborne said in an interview when asked about how Rubio\u2019s staff won\u2019t answer if he read the TPP before voting to fast-track. Osborne\u2019s interview came inside a local New Hampshire diner while Paul shook hands and visited with various patrons. Osborne hasn\u2019t endorsed anyone in 2016, but said he\u2019s looking closely at Paul.\n\n\u201cI think we elect this people to do the work that we as a citizenry can\u2019t do,\u201d Osborne continued with his answer about Rubio and TPP text.\n\nWe\u2019re not able to go to Washington to read all these bills\u2014we elect them to do that. They need to be reading these bills. I support Senator Paul\u2019s stance on that 100 percent, number one. Number two, if the bills are being written in a way that no one has time to read it, either one something is sketchy or two the way these bills are being drafted has to change.\n\nDown in South Carolina, it\u2019s not much better for Rubio on this issue.\n\nTaylor Brown, a conservative columnist for the massively influential South Carolina online news outlet FITSNews, told Breitbart News that Rubio\u2019s actions are \u201ccompletely irresponsible.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s completely irresponsible,\u201d Brown said in an email.\n\nIf you want to change international business, and commerce in general, for the next 50+ years, you need to know what\u2019s in it. You\u2019d think after the ACA failed so miserably without being read, our Senators would have learned their lesson. Apparently not. Rubio is willing to allow the President to completely change the way we make and ratify treaties on the chance that the Republicans will win the White House in 2016 making them able to do this same type of thing. Even if I supported Obamatrade, which I don\u2019t, I firmly believe all elected officials should read what they pass, and be knowledgeable of what they\u2019re inflicting on their constituents and American citizens in their entirety. If our Senate passes Obamatrade, they will have failed America.\n\nGreenville-based WORD radio host Vince Coakley told Breitbart News that Rubio already burned Republicans by working with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill. This, Coakley says, is the icing on the cake that proves Rubio can\u2019t be trusted.\n\n\u201cSenator Rubio already betrayed our trust by joining the Gang of 8 on immigration,\u201d Coakley, who\u2019s launched the Sacred Honor USA PAC, designed to get more liberty-minded leaders elected, people who won\u2019t follow the Washington establishment, said in an email. \u201cPracticing the Nancy Pelosi rule on legislation of this magnitude\u2014\u2018we need to pass the bill so we can find out what\u2019s in it\u2019\u2014is no way to rebuild that trust. By failing to answer such a simple question, how can we take him seriously as a Presidential candidate?\u201d\n\nBreitbart News has given Rubio more than a month\u2014and at least five separate opportunities\u2014to answer whether he read the text of TPP before he voted for it.\n\nIn Iowa, he\u2019s not faring much better. Steve Deace, a nationally syndicated conservative radio host based in the Hawkeye State, told Breitbart News he too is disgusted with Rubio on this matter.\n\n\u201cI believe we already have a political party that passes massive bills without reading them so we can find out what\u2019s in them,\u201d Deace said in an email. \u201cI would hope Rubio of all people would\u2019ve learned the dangers of such massive bills the public doesn\u2019t trust after his experience with the Gang of 8\u2019s comprehensive amnesty plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio Casts Deciding Vote For Obamatrade Without Even Reading It", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Marco Rubio Casts Deciding Vote For Obamatrade Without Even Reading It", "title": "Marco Rubio Casts Deciding Vote For Obamatrade Without Even Reading It - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Marco-Rubio-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-24T08:42:55-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/23/marco-rubio-casts-deciding-vote-for-obamatrade-without-even-reading-it/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio Casts Deciding Vote For Obamatrade Without Even Reading It", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Marco-Rubio-AP.jpg", "title": "Marco Rubio Casts Deciding Vote For Obamatrade Without Even Reading It - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Marco Rubio, Obamatrade, TiSA, Trade Promotion Authority, Trans Pacific Partnership, Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-23T14:11:42-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-06-24T08:42:55-07:00", "tag": "Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23ac\"", "article_summary": "You\u2019re telling me Marco Rubio voted for a bill without reading it?\n\u201cI think we elect this people to do the work that we as a citizenry can\u2019t do,\u201d Osborne continued with his answer about Rubio and TPP text.\nRubio, on the other hand, was one of many who has consistently and repeatedly refused to answer whether he read the deal text.\nRand Paul (R-KY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), James Lankford (R-OK) and Mike Lee (R-UT) went to go read it.\nIf somebody gives you the cliff notes version of a bill, that\u2019s at least better than not reading it at all."}
