A woman has suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident in McPherson.

It happened around 11:45 a.m. Saturday on K-153 near Iron Horse Road. The Kansas Highway Patrol said 60-year-old Liana Ward went around a curve when she lost control of her Harley-Davidson on a patch of gravel.

Ward then hit a guardrail and was thrown from the motorcycle.

EMS took her to a local hospital, and she was later flown to a hospital in Wichita. Hospital staff would not comment on her current condition.

Troopers said Ward was wearing a helmet.
