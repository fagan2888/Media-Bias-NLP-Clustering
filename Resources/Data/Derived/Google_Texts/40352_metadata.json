In Sacramento, Nick Janes reports on the plight of Katherine Cadman, who eagerly signed up for an insurance policy through the state\u2019s exchange \u2014 and then tried to use it to see a doctor. Doctors, however, are not anxious to see customers from ObamaCare plans, thanks to the lousy reimbursement rates:\n\nOne viewer said she did months of research before picking the plan that Blue Cross recommended. But it\u2019s still been a nightmare. Katherine Cadman says her emails and calls aren\u2019t getting anywhere. She says she signed up for an Anthem Blue Cross Plan, but doctors keep refusing to see her. \u201cIt\u2019s just not right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does make you feel like you\u2019re a second-class citizen.\u201d Chris and Tammy Dunn told us the same exact thing about their experience trying to find a doctor to fix Chris\u2019 back. He says an in-network doctor turned him down. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept in four months,\u201d said Chris. When we again reached out to Anthem again for answers on Wednesday and they issued the following statement: \u201cOur records indicate that this doctor has a contract with Anthem Blue Cross to treat our Covered CA members, and we will reach out to him to determine what the issue is.\u201d\n\nThe doctor apparently was on the plan \u2026 emphasis on the past tense. The providers in question decided not to provide service under the reduced reimbursement rates that Anthem\u2019s ObamaCare-compliant plan delivers. That\u2019s his choice; doctors don\u2019t have to accept insurance plans, after all, especially if the reimbursement doesn\u2019t cover his or her costs to provide services. That, however, leaves Covered California consumers asking this question:\n\n\u201cWhat are we left with as far as being Covered California subscribers?\u201d Cadman asked. \u201cThe bottom of the barrel?\u201d\n\nWhen payments get cut to bottom-of-barrel rates, what do consumers expect to happen?\n\nIn the San Francisco area, they\u2019re discovering that the doctors that will accept them work in areas they\u2019d rather not visit:\n\nCalifornia\u2019s health care exchange promised potential customers they would have enough physicians to choose from. But some new enrollees, including an Alameda County woman, are discovering that their doctor choices are extremely limited. Julia Turner is surprised that she even has to search for a doctor. When she signed up for a policy through Covered California late last year, her long-time physician was listed as participating in her Blue Shield plan. It turned out; however, that he is not accepting patients with her Blue Shield policy, purchased on the Covered California exchange. When Turner called around to find someone else to treat her, she got more frustration. \u201cThe only doctors accepting new patients are urgent care clinics,\u201d Turner told KPIX 5 ConsumerWatch. None of the doctors are located in the city in which she lives. Instead, Turner said, \u201cThey are in areas of East Oakland that have a lot of violence.\u201d\n\nOnly one doctor on the Blue Shield list for Turner\u2019s plan in her area was both board-certified and accepting new adult patients \u2026 out of 41 listed. KPIX got Blue Shield to add her existing doctor into the network, but Turner isn\u2019t happy with the outcome:\n\n\u201cThis is not what we were promised. I see those (Covered California) commercials now and I want to scream,\u201d Turner said.\n\nYes. You were promised a free lunch, and expected that to be realistic. The laws of supply and demand, and cost and pricing, do not get wished away or legislated out of existence.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "(Un)Covered California.", "title": "Video: ObamaCare enrollee can\u2019t get doctor to see her", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/02/20/video-obamacare-enrollee-cant-get-doctor-to-see-her/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-20T20:21:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T21:41:39+00:00"}, "keywords": "Covered California, doctor shortage, insurers, ObamaCare,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc702\"", "article_summary": "That, however, leaves Covered California consumers asking this question:\u201cWhat are we left with as far as being Covered California subscribers?\u201d Cadman asked.\nIt turned out; however, that he is not accepting patients with her Blue Shield policy, purchased on the Covered California exchange.\nWhen she signed up for a policy through Covered California late last year, her long-time physician was listed as participating in her Blue Shield plan.\nKPIX got Blue Shield to add her existing doctor into the network, but Turner isn\u2019t happy with the outcome:\u201cThis is not what we were promised.\nI see those (Covered California) commercials now and I want to scream,\u201d Turner said."}
