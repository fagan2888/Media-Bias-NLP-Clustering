The group is recommending that hospitals find ways to minimize the number of those procedures. Research shows that repeated exposure to pain may create changes in brain development that last into childhood.\n\n\n\nCurrent guidelines say Americans should start screening for colorectal cancer at age 50. But researchers at the University of Michigan find nearly 15-percent of patients diagnosed are younger than that. The study calls for increased awareness about the warning signs of colorectal cancer.\n\n\n\nMore than 20 countries have now reported cases of the Zika virus. And the World Health Organization says it's expected to spread across all of Latin America and the Caribbean. The mosquito borne illness has been linked to a birth defect that causes an abnormally small head. The CDC is warning pregnant women to avoid travel to countries that have been affected.\n\n\n\n(Chris Martinez, CBS News)\n\nCopyright CBS News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pediatricians are asking hospitals to take special care with their newborns.", "og": {"site_name": "OZARKSFIRST", "description": "Pediatricians are asking hospitals to take special care with their newborns.", "title": "Today's Top Medical News -- January 25, 2016", "url": "http://www.ozarksfirst.com/news/todays-top-medical-news-january-25-2016", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/01/04/newborn-baby-hand-holding-parent-s-finger_6218603_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1631794217050460}, "google-site-verification": "yajPFA3faS8IXhyhEQy0u8jahhAZ84S-y6tkL5ZMPeU", "keywords": "News,Morning News,Regional News,Health and Medical", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-01-25T14:05:02+0000", "modified_time": "2016-01-25T14:05:02+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad87\"", "article_summary": "The American Academy of Pediatrics is warning hospitals that even routine medical procedures can cause significant pain to newborns.\n(Chris Martinez, CBS News)Copyright CBS News\nThe CDC is warning pregnant women to avoid travel to countries that have been affected.\nThe group is recommending that hospitals find ways to minimize the number of those procedures.\nAnd the World Health Organization says it's expected to spread across all of Latin America and the Caribbean."}
