He is not running against Hillary Clinton\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a candidate, I\u2019m a candidate, and I suspect that there will be other candidates. The people in this country will make their choice.\u201d His socialist platform is \u201cone that resonates\u201d with the American people, and he believes he can effectively appeal to them no matter who his opponent is, or how large her war chest is. But, as he\u2019s said, he\u2019s engaged in \u201ca real struggle against the billionaire class.\u201d\n\n2.

President Sanders would overturn Citizens United\n\n\u201cThe major issue of our time is whether the United States of America retains its democratic foundation or whether we devolve into an oligarchic form of society where a handful of billionaires are able to control our political process by spending hundreds of millions of dollars to elect candidates who represent their interests,\u201d he said last September. The best way to do that, he said, is to overturn Citizens United, because \u201cfreedom of speech does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders: I'm not running against Hillary Clinton, I'm running against the oligarchy", "title": "6 Things You Need to Know About Bernie Sanders", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Sanders: I'm not running against Hillary Clinton, I'm running against the oligarchy", "title": "6 Things You Need to Know About Bernie Sanders", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/26/bernie_sanders_im_not_running_against_hillary_clinton_im_running_against_the_oligarchy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie_sanders7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sanders: I'm not running against Hillary Clinton, I'm running against the oligarchy", "title": "6 Things You Need to Know About Bernie Sanders", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie_sanders7.jpg", "creator": "@scottekaufman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Eric Kaufman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b7b\"", "article_summary": "Yes, we did say \u201csocialist\u201dTwice now, actually, because not only is Senator Sanders not afraid of the word, he openly embraces it.\nHe is not running against Hillary Clinton\u201cI\u2019m not running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said.\nThe best way to do that, he said, is to overturn Citizens United, because \u201cfreedom of speech does not mean the freedom to buy the United States government.\u201d\nTopics: News, Politics NewsWith news that Senator Bernie Sanders will have a more formal unveiling of his presidential campaign this afternoon, it seems like a good time to get to know the self-proclaimed socialist from Vermont.\nBut, as he\u2019s said, he\u2019s engaged in \u201ca real struggle against the billionaire class.\u201d2."}
