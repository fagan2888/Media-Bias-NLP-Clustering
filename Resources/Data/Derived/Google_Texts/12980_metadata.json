While no one knows what\u2019s ahead, there are ways you can age-proof your brain. With a little bit of luck, then, you may be able to retain your mental abilities until death (or as long as humanly possible). After all, dementia is not a natural or inevitable part of aging.\n\nEven if the scientific methods below are not 100 percent guaranteed, you will know, at the very least, that you are doing all you can to thwart one of the saddest plights in life. Even more, you will be living a darn healthy lifestyle.\n\nIf nothing else, please remember just this one thing \u2014 healthy is the better road to walk not because it is morally superior or less expensive or better for your country\u2019s health care system (though it may be all of those things). No, a healthy life is a happier life for the most plain (and dare we say selfish) reason of all \u2014 it just feels good. Climbing stairs won\u2019t make you feel as winded, you won\u2019t get depressed as often, you will feel more comfortable moving and walking and dancing and enjoying yourself compared to if you live a less healthy lifestyle.\n\nSo let\u2019s begin:\n\nNever Underestimate Exercise\n\nNot only does exercise reduce your risk of depression, the more you exercise the more you reduce your risk of developing dementia. Physically active people tend to maintain better cognition and memory than inactive people; according to Dr. Arthur Kramer, a professor and director of the Beckman Institute, as we age, our brain networks become less well connected but exercise increases connectivity. In fact, Kramer\u2019s work suggests high exercise levels might reduce your risk of Alzheimer\u2019s by 30 to 40 percent when compared to minimal exercisers.\n\nEssentially, exercise not only improves vascular function throughout the body but also in the brain, while also increasing the size of the hippocampus. Since this part of the brain is key to memory formation, reversing the natural shrinking process that occurs over time by exercising, you might naturally improve your chances of aging gracefully. Various studies, including those mentioned here, point to weight-training as particularly helpful, especially for women.\n\nAnd hey: Exercise is first on this list for a reason. If you do nothing else, get out there and move.\n\nExercise Reuters\n\nFriends with (Cognitive) Benefits\u2026\n\n\u2026is how these University of Michigan researchers dubbed their 2010 study showing how a simple and friendly conversation with people improved participants\u2019 abilities to solve problems. By comparison, the researchers discovered discussions with a competitive edge had no cognitive benefits. (Absolutely nada. Zip. Go home, you need a break if you\u2019re getting all crazy and cutthroat again.) Previous research from the same team found social interaction with a friend may be comparable to playing solving a crossword puzzle, in terms of boosting your working memory and your ability to concentrate.\n\nPlenty of studies come to similar conclusions, with one 15 year study showing that the support and inspiration derived from multiple social networks increased cognitive health, lowering dementia risk in older Swedes. It would seem, then, that you should never invite all your friends to the same party. Keep your social circles separate for maximum stimulation and brain health.\n\nFriendship Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.\n\nYes, It's True: Eating Matters\n\nChoice, choice, choice, choice, choice. Every day, generally no less than three times a day you choose to put food into your mouth. Why not select the foods that will help not hurt your chances of aging well? It probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to know that healthy eating is delicious eating.\n\nThe simplest way to go is to follow the new MIND Diet, a Frankenstein hybrid created from the best parts of diets shown to protect against dementia. The diet is clear and easy to follow and lowered the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s by more than half among the study participants who followed it faithfully. Yet, it also helped protect against dementia in those who cheated (so there).\n\nFor the minimalists, who can\u2019t stand to follow a whole series of guidelines, try these three simple diet rules. Whenever possible, add in antioxidant-rich foods, such as blueberries, broccoli, carrots, kale, soybeans, and grapes. At least once a week, swap your portion of meat or dairy products for a serving of fish, rich in omega-3 fatty acids \u2014 salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines, and others listed here. Finally, add spice to your life. Black pepper, ginger, cinnamon, oregano, basil, parsley, and vanilla are high in antioxidants, while the active ingredient in turmeric may protect directly against dementia.\n\nMIND Diet Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.\n\nPurposeful Living Is Strong Living\n\nStrangely, a Rush University study of older adults published in the Archives of General Psychiatry found evidence that having meaning and direction promotes cognitive health \u2014 even in cases where a person has already developed plaques and tangles, the signature brain changes in people with Alzheimer\u2019s. In fact, the participants in the study with the highest sense of purpose were about 2.4 times more likely to remain free of Alzheimer's over the next seven years (the range of the study) than people with a lower sense of purpose.\n\nWhat did the participants describe as their purpose? Some of the reasons that helped these aging adults face their day were family, religion, exercise, and music. Compose the symphony you dreamed of before the kids came along, or take those hikes through the beautiful and still woods.\n\nLet\u2019s Play Games\n\nPossibly the saddest day ever for the people behind Lumosity, which charges customers a monthly fee for scientifically designed brain-training games, was the day Florida State University came to town. Researchers at FSU randomly assigned participants to play Portal 2 (action puzzle games) or Lumosity for eight hours. All the participants were pre- and post-tested on problem solving, spatial skills, and persistence. While Lumosity players showed no gains on any of these measures, Portal 2 players improved their scores on all three constructs, while showing significant gains on spatial tests.\n\nIn defense of Lumosity, one study is not enough to definitively make or prove this point. However, this one study reminds us that playing any game may be beneficial to our brains.\n\nPortal 2 Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.\n\nSometimes You Need a Little Help\n\nAn older house has rusty pipes and the boiler is a little tired and some of the wiring may be shot and it simply does not run as well as a young house. As we get older, our internal machinery may not work as efficiently as it once did and so we may not absorb as many nutrients from our food. For this reason, it may be necessary to take supplements so as not to risk becoming deficient in any key nutrients or vitamins. In particular, vitamin B12 may be key to our brain health, a team of Rush University researchers discovered. Older adults with the lowest levels of vitamin B12 had smaller brains and even scored lowest on tests measuring thinking, reasoning and memory.\n\nYikes! Pop a multi-vitamin, dude.\n\nSupplement Photo courtesy of Shutterstock.\n\nExperimenting Is Not Just For Kids\n\nEnroll in a philosophy class, learn a language, take oboe lessons, practice your calligraphy, purchase the food for and follow a new recipe, attend a workshop in flamenco dancing\u2026 do something or anything you\u2019ve never done before and you will naturally improve your brain.\n\nIt\u2019s truly that simple \u2014 new activities forge new connections in your brain and creating new pathways for your gray matter is what your brain wants and needs. Just as your heart beats and your stomach digests, well, your brain makes connections. And just as your belly would begin to growl awful loud if you didn\u2019t add a little food now and then, your brain is hungry for the kind of new connections formed whenever you read, learn a new sport, or take a joy ride through an unknown neighborhood or town. By some miracle known as life, you are here participating in the earth experience. Enjoy the many facets of this existence as best you can and your brain should stay present for the entire trip, even the later years.\n\nFinally, for a solid overview of aging and dementia risk, watch this not-so-short YouTube video featuring Dr. Claudia H.
