A boutique hotel and apartments are planned for the iconic Reynolds Building in downtown Winston-Salem.

The Piedmont Triad region has had no new hotels built in the past three and a half years. That stands to reason because occupancy rates have remained fairly flat over the same period. Suddenly, though, six new hotels are being planned collectively in downtown Greensboro and Winston-Salem.

Triad Business Journal reporter Catherine Carlock is covering this real estate trend for the newspaper this week. She says, “Developers smell opportunity in these cities for several reasons including, a pickup in loan activity that gives established hotel developers more access to loans for economic development projects. There is also a lot of capital that is pouring into the downtown areas in both cities.”

WFDD contributor Justin Catanoso recently sat down with Carlock to find out what development projects stand the best chance of moving forward.
