You just come up with some spin that explains why you're winning, even when you're losing, and the other side is losing even when they're winning.\n\nChina? Totally isolated.\n\nThe United States is not looking for conflict with China but steps it is taking in the South China Sea are self-isolating and prompting other countries to seek help from Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said on Friday.\n\nChina has a global infrastructure network encompassing parts of Africa and the Middle East. It's also one of three major world powers.\n\nObama Inc. also claims that Russia is isolated. If two out of the three world powers are isolated, what does the word \"isolated\" even mean? Nothing. Russia carved up Ukraine and is set to win in Syria. China is expanding its territory and Obama has failed to either stop it or even meaningfully defy it. Instead Obama Inc. apologized for overflying one of China's new islands.\n\nOh yes. China is isolated all-right. Everyone except Obama is isolated. Or maybe it's the other way around.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "Obama Inc: Russia and China are \"Isolated\"", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261565/obama-inc-russia-and-china-are-isolated-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/01/obama-wears-tan-suit-149481242256_4.jpeg?itok=W7QGLf4b", "updated_time": "2016-01-23T11:32:38-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261565/obama-inc-russia-and-china-are-isolated-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/01/obama-wears-tan-suit-149481242256_4.jpeg?itok=W7QGLf4b", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama Inc: Russia and China are \"Isolated\""}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-23T11:32:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-23T11:32:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c77\"", "article_summary": "If two out of the three world powers are isolated, what does the word \"isolated\" even mean?\nObama Inc. also claims that Russia is isolated.\nYou just come up with some spin that explains why you're winning, even when you're losing, and the other side is losing even when they're winning.\nChina is expanding its territory and Obama has failed to either stop it or even meaningfully defy it.\nEveryone except Obama is isolated."}
