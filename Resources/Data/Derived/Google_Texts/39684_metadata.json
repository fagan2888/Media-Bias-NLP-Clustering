Brinsko helped Coble stock up again.\n\n\u201cIf you need to get more than one box, get more than one box,\u201d Brinsko said. \u201cBut you need to check them every morning so that we can adjust things.\u201d\n\nCoble, who is unemployed, lives with her sister and can\u2019t afford insurance even now that the health law is in place, relies on the clinic for health care.\n\n\u201cThey do a great job with everything,\u201d Coble said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do without them.\u201d\n\nNancy Hudson was the clinic\u2019s director as Obamacare rolled out and now consults for the clinic. She expected the insurance exchange, or marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act would reduce the number of uninsured patients the clinic sees. The opposite happened, she says.\n\n\u201cWhat we found within our patient population and within the community is that a lot of the advertisement and information about the marketplace brought people [in who] didn\u2019t know anything about free clinics and did not qualify for any of the programs within the ACA marketplace,\u201d Hudson says.\n\nAnd now they get free or low-cost care at the clinic, which is designated by the government at an FQHC, or federally qualified health center.\n\nThe health law was designed to cover the poorest people by expanding Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people. But the Supreme Court made that optional. The result in states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid is a gap, where some people make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for insurance subsidies. In North Carolina, about 319,000 people, like Coble, fall into the Medicaid gap.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Reporting Consortium,States,Syndicate,The Health Law", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "Patients are flocking to community health clinics for care in North Carolina and elsewhere.
