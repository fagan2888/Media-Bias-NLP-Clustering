However, six months later, I continue to suffer from my concussion and the time has come to take my health seriously.\"\n\nAdams currently represents the riding of Mississauga-Brampton South.\n\nAdams' team had been accused of paying for the memberships of supporters, alleged donations that are illegal under the Elections Act.
