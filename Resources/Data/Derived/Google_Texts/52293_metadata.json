Pat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition as the violence at the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Colorado Springs unfolded on Friday. \u201cAnd as a movement we have always unequivocally condemned all forms of violence at abortion clinics.\u201d\n\nMahoney is not quite accurate when he claims the pro-life movement, which is fueled primarily by religious activists, has always condemned violence, since some extremists who still work for anti-choice groups have not only condoned violence but practiced it. But even leaving aside such unpleasant details, another unsettling truth lingers for religious conservatives opposing abortion rights: the chain of causation between the Christian right and antiabortion violence, even if unintended, is undeniable.\n\nAs we\u2019ll see, the historical record demonstrates that violence directed at abortion providers correlates strongly not to the legalization of abortion, but to the later rise of religious antiabortion activism. This fact, when considered together with the harsh rhetoric and tactics of the religious right\u2019s abortion-related activism, leaves little doubt about the causal relationship.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade ruling, which legalized abortion across the country, understandably gets much attention in abortion discussions, but by the time Roe was decided in 1973 abortion was already legal in 17 states. Ironically, it was Ronald Reagan, as governor of California, who signed a law loosening abortion restrictions in that state in 1967, and many other states joined the trend around the same time.\n\nThere were very few reports of even minor incidents of violence as abortion laws were liberalized in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, because abortion was not a major controversy. It wasn\u2019t until the mobilization of the Christian right in the late \u201970s that violence started becoming a fact of life for doctors and clinics, as abortion suddenly became a highly charged moral, political and religious issue.\n\nThe timeline shows that the rise of antiabortion violence correlates almost exactly with the rise of the modern religious right. The formation of the so-called Moral Majority in the late \u201970s is often cited as the launching point of the modern religious right, and it\u2019s noteworthy that the group\u2019s leader, Jerry Falwell, used passionate rhetoric and dark imagery in discussing abortion, casting it as horrific, a form of mass murder, a product of true evil. Falwell portrayed abortion, and by implication anyone connected with it, as grotesque and inhumane, using detailed descriptions of mutilated body parts in his pitch to followers.\n\nAmericans have grown accustomed to sensationalism from abortion opponents, but such alarmist language was generally absent from earlier public discussions of the topic. After signing the above-mentioned California abortion bill, for example, Reagan said abortion was \u201ca subject I\u2019d never given much thought to.\u201d Nor did many other politicians, on the left or right. The word \u201cabortion\u201d does not appear in any GOP national platform until 1976, and even then only to say that the party was divided on the issue. By 1980 the influence of the newly formed Moral Majority was apparent, with the GOP platform taking a stance supporting a constitutional amendment banning abortion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rise of violence aimed at abortion providers matches the rise of the religious right's heated abortion activism", "title": "The religious right is neither: The real history of how decades of radical, violent rhetoric led to the Planned Parenthood shooting", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The rise of violence aimed at abortion providers matches the rise of the religious right's heated abortion activism", "title": "The religious right is neither: The real history of how decades of radical, violent rhetoric led to the Planned Parenthood shooting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/01/the_religious_right_is_neither_the_real_history_of_how_decades_of_radical_violent_rhetoric_led_to_the_planned_parenthood_shooting/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/reagan_falwell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rise of violence aimed at abortion providers matches the rise of the religious right's heated abortion activism", "title": "The religious right is neither: The real history of how decades of radical, violent rhetoric led to the Planned Parenthood shooting", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/reagan_falwell.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Niose", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, Colorado Shooting, Editor's Picks, Planned Parenthood, Religious Right, right wing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, Colorado Shooting, Editor's Picks, Planned Parenthood, Religious Right, right wing, Life News, News\u201cThe pro-life movement is praying for the safety of all involved,\u201d said the Rev.\nThe timeline shows that the rise of antiabortion violence correlates almost exactly with the rise of the modern religious right.\nPat Mahoney of the Christian Defense Coalition as the violence at the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Colorado Springs unfolded on Friday.\nBut even leaving aside such unpleasant details, another unsettling truth lingers for religious conservatives opposing abortion rights: the chain of causation between the Christian right and antiabortion violence, even if unintended, is undeniable.\nAs we\u2019ll see, the historical record demonstrates that violence directed at abortion providers correlates strongly not to the legalization of abortion, but to the later rise of religious antiabortion activism."}
