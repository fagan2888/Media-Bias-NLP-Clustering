That was the sound of good news: Somebody had found them a patient.\n\nWhen Bonilla answered the phone, one of the scam\u2019s professional \u201cpatient recruiters\u201d would read off the personal data of a senior citizen. Name. DOB. Medicare ID number. Bonilla would hang up and call Medicare, the enormous federal health-insurance program for those over 65.\n\nShe asked a single question: Had the government ever bought this patient a power wheelchair? No? Then the scam was off and running.\n\n\u201cIf they did not have one, they would be taken to the doctor, so the doctor could prescribe a chair for them,\u201d Bonilla recalled. On a log sheet, Bonilla would make a note that the recruiter was owed an $800 finder\u2019s fee. \u201cThey were paid for each chair.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 'Grandpa Scam' That's Costing Seniors a Bundle\n\nThis summer, in a Los Angeles courtroom, Bonilla described the workings of a peculiar fraud scheme that \u2014 starting in the mid-1990s \u2014 became one of the great success stories in American crime. The sucker in this scheme was the U.S. government. That wasn\u2019t the peculiar part. The tool of the crime was the motorized wheelchair.\n\nThe wheelchair scam was designed to exploit blind spots in Medicare, which often pays insurance claims without checking them first. Criminals disguised themselves as medical-supply companies. They ginned up bogus bills, saying they\u2019d provided expensive wheelchairs to Medicare patients \u2014 who, in reality, didn\u2019t need wheelchairs at all. Then the scammers asked Medicare to pay them back, so they could pocket the huge markup that the government paid on each chair.\n\nA lot of the time, Medicare was fooled. The government paid. Since 1999, Medicare has spent $8.2 billion to procure power wheelchairs and \u201cscooters\u201d for 2.7 million people. Today, the government cannot even guess at how much of that money was paid out to scammers.\n\nNow, the golden age of the wheelchair scam is probably over. But, while it lasted, the scam illuminated a critical failure point in the federal bureaucracy: Medicare\u2019s weak defenses against fraud. The government knew how the wheelchair scheme worked in 1998. But it wasn\u2019t until 15 years later that officials finally did enough to significantly curb the practice.\n\nRelated: Federal Government Pays Workers $5M Not to Work\n\n\u201cIf you play it right, you can make a lot of money quickly, stealing from Medicare,\u201d said James Quiggle, of the nonprofit Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, recounting the lesson of the past decade and a half. \u201cYou can walk into the United States, with limited English skills, no knowledge of medicine, and \u2014 if you hook up with the right people, that know how to play the system like a Stradivarius \u2014 you can become an overnight millionaire.\u201d\n\n\u2018I Said I Didn\u2019t Need It\u2019\n\nIn the courtroom in Los Angeles, 42-year-old Olufunke Fadojutimi was on trial. Prosecutors alleged she\u2019d run a wheelchair-scam operation out of an office-park suite in suburban Carson, Calif. As these scams go, this one was medium-sized. It billed Medicare for about 1,000 power wheelchairs.\n\n\u201cI said I didn\u2019t need it,\u201d witness Heriberto Cortez, 73, testified on the stand. Cortez was recalling the day when a stranger \u2014 allegedly one of Fadojutimi\u2019s patient recruiters \u2014 came to his house and offered him a wheelchair. He said no. She didn\u2019t listen. \u201cShe insisted,\u201d Cortez said. \u201cShe said that they were giving the chairs away.\u201d\n\nLater in the trial, 71-year-old Rodolfo Fernandez testified that a woman showed up at his house in Los Angeles. The woman asked if he was on Medicare. He was. The next day, she came back with a van. Other seniors were already inside. \u201cThey took us to a clinic. They did an exam on us,\u201d Fernandez recalled, translated speaking through a Spanish interpreter.\n\nRelated: Tax Exempt Groups Owe IRS Nearly $1 Billion\n\nAuthorities said the doctor at this clinic was in on the scam, too. He was paid to find the same problems, every time. The patient was too weak to use a cane. Or a walker. Or even a non-motorized wheelchair. Only a motorized wheelchair would do. Instead of making lame men walk, the doctor\u2019s job was to make walking men lame \u2014 at least on paper.\n\nA surge in power wheelchairs and scooters paid for by Medicare: Since 1999, Medicare has spent $8.2 billion to procure power wheelchairs and scooters for 2.7 million people. Today, the federal government does not know how much of that money was actually paid to scammers.\n\nIn his testimony, Fernandez noted that the clinic was in a second-floor walk-up. \u201cI had to climb the stairs,\u201d Fernandez said, in order for the doctor to proclaim him unfit to climb stairs. After seeing the doctor, prosecutors said, both Cortez and Fernandez got power wheelchairs from Fadojutimi\u2019s company. The company then sent Medicare the bills. Medicare paid.\n\nToday, Cortez\u2019s wheelchair sits in his garage, still wrapped in plastic from the factory. Fernandez\u2019s wheelchair is occupied by an enormous stuffed animal wearing a Los Angeles Lakers hat. \u201cI put my little teddy bear on top of it,\u201d Fernandez said, as jurors smiled at a photo of the bear in the chair.\n\nAn Overwhelmed System\n\nFraud in Medicare has been a top concern in Washington for decades, in part because the program\u2019s mistakes are so expensive. In fiscal 2013, for instance, Medicare paid out almost $50 billion in \u201cimproper payments.\u201d These were bills that, upon further reflection, contained mistakes and should not have been paid.\n\nRelated: EPA Fails at Simple Cost-Benefit Analysis\n\nNo one knows how much of that money was actually lost to fraud, and how much of it was caused by innocent errors.\n\nThe power-wheelchair scam provided a painful and expensive example of why Medicare fraud works so often. The fault lay partly with Congress, which designed this system to be fast and generous. And it lay partly with Medicare bureaucrats \u2014 who were slow to recognize the threat and use the powers they had to stop it. As a result, scammers took advantage of a system that was overwhelmed by its own claims and lacked the manpower and money to check most of those claims before it paid.\n\nThe scheme first appeared in the mid-1990s in Miami \u2014 a city whose mix of elderly people and professional scammers has always made it the DARPA of Medicare fraud, where bad ideas begin.\n\n\u201cThe patients would be walking,\u201d said one former Justice Department official, recalling investigations from that time. \u201cAnd they\u2019d have the wheelchair, a $2,500 wheelchair, sitting in the corner with stacks of [stuff] on it. And [investigators] would say, \u2018Why do you have this?\u2019 And they would say, \u2018They told me I could have this, so I took it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFraudsters, they were learning, had invented a new twist on an old trick: the Medicare equipment scam.\n\nThe original equipment scam had sprung up in the 1970s, at a time when Medicare was young and criminals were still learning how to steal its money. Doctors, for example, could bill Medicare for exams they didn\u2019t do. Hospitals could bill for tests that patients didn\u2019t need.\n\nThe equipment scam was the poor man\u2019s way in, an entry-level fraud that didn\u2019t require a medical degree or a hospital. Instead, the crooks only had to set up a \u201cmedical equipment\u201d company and get access to the Medicare system. Then, they needed to learn a simple scheme, in which the fraudster would run the normal order of medical decision-making in reverse.\n\nA legitimate medical-supply company, of course, has to must wait for a patient to see a doctor, then come looking for somebody to fill a prescription. But a fraudster starts with a prescription he wants to fill. Then he goes looking for a patient and a doctor to foist it on.\n\nBy the 1990s, fraudsters had already perfected parts of this equipment scam. To find the patients, for instance, they had learned to use professional recruiters, called \u201cmarketers\u201d or \u201ccappers.\u201d These recruiters induced seniors to hand over their Medicare ID numbers. Sometimes, they just paid the patients a bribe. Other times, they talked them into giving the number up free. The government is offering free wheelchairs, but only for a limited time. If you don\u2019t act now . . .\n\nRelated: Obamacare Fraud Controls Found Severely Lacking\n\nMost fraudsters had also learned to buy off a doctor or two, paying a set price for each bogus prescription. But some had also perfected a cheaper method. They corrupted dead doctors instead. \u201cThe Russian mob up in Brooklyn has been doing this for years. . . . They scour the obits. They find out when Doctor Morris has died. They immediately write to Medicare and they say, \u2018Hi, I\u2019m Doctor Morris, and I\u2019m changing my address,' \u201d said Lewis Morris, a former top official at the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 office of the inspector general.\n\nIf it works, the dead doctor\u2019s mail is delivered to the live crook. Including paperwork with the doctor\u2019s Medicare ID number. \u201cSo the new Doctor Morris, Sammy Scumbag, starts writing scrip in the name of Doctor Morris,\u201d Morris said. Recent reforms have lessened this problem.\n\nThe payoff of this whole scheme came when a scammer sent Medicare a bill. The bill would say that the bought-off doctor had prescribed some piece of equipment to the bought-off (or hoodwinked) patient. The fraudster would say that he had supplied that thing. Now, he wanted Medicare to pay its share \u2014 usually, 80 percent of the price tag.\n\nBut what was the best kind of equipment to use?\n\nBanjo also told the jury that he objected to something a prosecutor had said: that Fadojutimi\u2019s wheelchair operation had \u201cstolen\u201d money from the government. \u201cThis is not about stealing,\u201d Banjo said, trying to draw a moral distinction. \u201cThis is fraud.\u201d\n\nAfter a five-day trial, jurors found Fadojutimi guilty on all seven counts of health-care fraud, plus one count of conspiracy and one count of money laundering. She is awaiting her sentence.\n\nA scam\u2019s slow death In the past few years, at last, the government says it has outsmarted the wheelchair scammers. For one thing, Medicare began using competitive-bidding processes to lower what it paid for wheelchairs. The total spending on wheelchairs and scooters \u2014 which had reached as high as $964 million in 2003 \u2014 fell to $190 million last year. It also required wheelchairs to be given out on a rent-to-own basis, instead of paid for all upfront. That gave more time to check if the claim was bogus.\n\nAnd in 2012, Medicare also made a crucial change in the way it handled wheelchair claims. Now, in 19 states, the government reviews all wheelchair bills before it pays them. Finally, last year the feds went after the Scooter Store.\n\nThat company had become famous for its commercials telling seniors: \u201cYour power chair will be paid in full.\u201d In 2007, the store had already been fined for fraudulent practices, which included billing Medicare for power wheelchairs that patients did not want or need. Last year, as part of a new investigation, federal agents with a search warrant raided the Scooter Store headquarters in New Braunfels, Texas.\n\nNo new criminal charges have been brought. But Medicare was still concerned enough to cut off funding to the Scooter Store. It was a death sentence. The business, heavily dependent on federal payments, shut down last fall. Last year, about 124,000 people got power wheelchairs from Medicare. That was the lowest total since 2001, equivalent to one for every 400 beneficiaries. That\u2019s the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that, when officials go back to try to figure out what the scammers stole, they get mired in an unholy bureaucratic mess. When officials review old wheelchair bills, they discover that at least 80 percent of them were \u201cimproper\u201d: They contain major errors and shouldn\u2019t have been paid as is. Perhaps the patient\u2019s diagnosis didn\u2019t actually qualify for a power wheelchair. Perhaps the paperwork was incomplete. How many of those bills were sent in by fraudsters, trying to squeeze through the system\u2019s blind spots? Medicare can\u2019t say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to talk to the patient. You\u2019d have to talk to the providers\u201d and ask if the wheelchair was really needed, said Shantanu Agarwal, a doctor who is Medicare\u2019s top fraud fighter. \u201cAnd then, at the end of it, you could make a reasonable, fact-based, experienced-based determination about whether this is probably fraud,\u201d Agarwal said.\n\nMedicare doesn\u2019t have the time or money to do that for power wheelchairs now. Today, even while the wheelchair scam is in decline, that same \u201cpay and chase\u201d system is allowing other variants of the Medicare equipment scam to thrive. They aren\u2019t perfect. But they work.\n\nIn Brooklyn, for instance, the next big thing is shoe inserts. Scammers bill Medicare for a $500 custom-made orthotic, according to investigators. They give the patient a $30 Dr. Scholl\u2019s. In Puerto Rico, the next big thing seems to be arms and legs. In one case there, two dozen companies billed Medicare for $5.3 million in prosthetic legs inside of a year. In many cases, their \u201cpatients\u201d had no record of amputations in their medical history. Many of them didn\u2019t even live in Puerto Rico.\n\nBut Medicare paid for the legs.\n\nAlice Crites in Washington contributed to this report, which originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:\n\nHow the VA Developed Its Culture of Coverups\n\nA Sinkhole of Bureacracy\n\nRick Perry Claims Indictment Part of Larger Rule of Law Problem", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In the little office where they ran the scam, a cellphone would ring on", "title": "Billions Blown on Power Wheelchairs in Medicare Scam", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/18/Billions-Blown-Power-Wheelchairs-Medicare-Scam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07312012_healthcare_wheelchair_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/18/Billions-Blown-Power-Wheelchairs-Medicare-Scam", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07312012_healthcare_wheelchair_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 In the little office where they ran the scam, a cellphone would ring on", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc946b\"", "article_summary": "A surge in power wheelchairs and scooters paid for by Medicare: Since 1999, Medicare has spent $8.2 billion to procure power wheelchairs and scooters for 2.7 million people.\nSince 1999, Medicare has spent $8.2 billion to procure power wheelchairs and \u201cscooters\u201d for 2.7 million people.\nToday, even while the wheelchair scam is in decline, that same \u201cpay and chase\u201d system is allowing other variants of the Medicare equipment scam to thrive.\nThe wheelchair scam was designed to exploit blind spots in Medicare, which often pays insurance claims without checking them first.\nMedicare paid."}
