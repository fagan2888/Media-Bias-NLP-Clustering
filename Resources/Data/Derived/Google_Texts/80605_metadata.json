Bush administrations. Elizabeth Foley is a constitutional law professor at Florida International University College of Law.\n\nThe Constitution states that it\u2019s Congress\u2019s job to make the laws and the president\u2019s to faithfully execute them. It does not permit a president to suspend a law or grant special dispensations from its requirements. But President Obama has done just these things on numerous occasions, and only the federal courts can preserve the constitutionally mandated separation of powers by definitively rebuffing his illegal actions.\n\nSeparation-of-powers lawsuits are generally straightforward: A private party, injured by some unconstitutional government action, sues for relief. Last month, the Supreme Court decided Noel Canning v. NLRB, a suit brought by a bottling company adversely affected by a National Labor Relations Board decision. The court unanimously concluded that the president\u2019s appointments to the board, which had been made without Senate confirmation, violated the Constitution.\n\nWhen a president suspends a law, however, private parties often lack \u201cstanding\u201d to sue, because the act of not enforcing a statute doesn\u2019t injure them in any individualized way. But such suspensions undoubtedly injure Congress as an institution. By arrogating to himself a power to rewrite laws, a president violates his duty of faithful execution and infringes on Congress\u2019s lawmaking prerogatives. A suspension nullifies the law suspended and diminishes Congress\u2019s power.\n\nSuch acts trigger a genuine constitutional crisis and undermine our democracy. Federal courts are well equipped to resolve such crises, as Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 78: \u201cThe interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning.\u201d\n\nThis week, the House Rules Committee approved a resolution authorizing a lawsuit challenging Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act suspensions. Skeptics of the lawsuit, which is expected to be authorized by the full House next week, argue that such congressional lawsuits \u2014 to date, mostly initiated by Democrats \u2014 usually fail because of a lack of standing.\n\nHowever, there is a simple reason most of these suits have failed: To assert an institutional injury to the House or Senate, courts want proof that the chamber, as an institution \u2014 and not a rump group of legislators \u2014 believes it has been injured. For example, in its 1997 ruling in Raines v. Byrd , the Supreme Court denied standing to six congressmen who sued President Bill Clinton over the Line Item Veto Act, for three reasons:\n\nFirst, the injury the lawmakers alleged \u2014 a dilution of their voting power caused by future exercises of the line-item veto \u2014 was conjectural, since no president had yet exercised that veto.\n\nSecond, private plaintiffs (for example, those who would have personally benefited from federal largess but for a presidential line-item veto) would be readily available to challenge the act, so there was no need to resort to legislative standing. Indeed, in the following term, a private plaintiff sued, and the court ruled the act unconstitutional.\n\nFinally, the court denied the legislators\u2019 standing because they weren\u2019t litigating on behalf of their colleagues. In the words of the court, the six \u201csimply lost [the] vote\u201d on the act, declaring: \u201cWe attach some importance to the fact that [the six] have not been authorized to represent their respective Houses of Congress in this action, and indeed both Houses actively oppose their suit.\u201d\n\nWhen legislators do represent their institution\u2019s views, however, courts have granted standing. In 1939\u2019s Coleman v. Miller, the Supreme Court granted standing to 21 Kansas senators who had sued the state\u2019s lieutenant governor over his tiebreaking vote in support of a constitutional amendment, which the senators argued nullified the legislative will of the Senate. The court agreed that the Senate had suffered an institutional injury. Significantly, the senators \u2014 a majority of the chamber \u2014 unequivocally represented their chamber\u2019s institutional position.\n\nA few days ago, in the case of Kerr v. Hickenlooper, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit held that five Democratic Colorado legislators had standing on facts far less compelling than those of the House lawsuit. The legislators challenged their governor\u2019s execution of a state constitutional amendment, asserting that the amendment nullified their power to raise taxes. Standing was granted despite the absence of an explicit institutional authorization for the lawsuit by their colleagues.\n\nIn numerous other cases, federal courts have recognized a single chamber\u2019s standing to assert institutional injury caused by the executive\u2019s refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas. In these cases, the chamber passed a resolution authorizing litigation to vindicate its institutional injury, which was described as a nullification of chamber\u2019s investigatory power.\n\nAs the Supreme Court made clear in Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen\u2019s Fund in 1975, subpoenas are \u201cinherent in the power to make laws\u201d and an \u201cintegral part of the lawmaking process.\u201d A failure to comply with a chamber\u2019s subpoena, in other words, is an injury to the lawmaking power of the chamber itself. The institutional injury caused by executive nullification of a subpoena is far less than that caused by executive nullification of a law. If ignoring a congressional subpoena is sufficient to establish legislative standing, ignoring a law should be more than sufficient as well.\n\nThe House lawsuit isn\u2019t a stunt, and it isn\u2019t frivolous. Precedent fully recognizes legislative standing to vindicate the nullification injury inherent in a president\u2019s suspension of law. And while impeachment and cutting appropriations are useful political options to consider, neither can force the faithful execution of the law, much less prevent future presidents from continuing the destruction of separation of powers. For a tailored and proportionate legal declaration of the proper dividing line between Congress and the president, courts \u2014 and courts alone \u2014 are the appropriate venue.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "david rivkin, elizabeth price foley, boehner lawsit, noel canning v nlrb, house republicans standing to sue, house obama lawsuit", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Federal courts must stop the president from flouting the Constitution.", "title": "Federal courts need to stop Obama from flouting the Constitution", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/federal-courts-need-to-stop-obama-from-flouting-the-constitution/2014/07/25/138f5bfc-12bc-11e4-98ee-daea85133bc9_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/07/24/Editorial-Opinion/Images/Obama-0425b-3054.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/federal-courts-need-to-stop-obama-from-flouting-the-constitution/2014/07/25/138f5bfc-12bc-11e4-98ee-daea85133bc9_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "david rivkin, elizabeth price foley, boehner lawsit, noel canning v nlrb, house republicans standing to sue, house obama lawsuit", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "138f5bfc-12bc-11e4-98ee-daea85133bc9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Federal courts must stop the president from flouting the Constitution."}, "article_summary": "For a tailored and proportionate legal declaration of the proper dividing line between Congress and the president, courts \u2014 and courts alone \u2014 are the appropriate venue.\nIn these cases, the chamber passed a resolution authorizing litigation to vindicate its institutional injury, which was described as a nullification of chamber\u2019s investigatory power.\nIn numerous other cases, federal courts have recognized a single chamber\u2019s standing to assert institutional injury caused by the executive\u2019s refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas.\nThe institutional injury caused by executive nullification of a subpoena is far less than that caused by executive nullification of a law.\nBut President Obama has done just these things on numerous occasions, and only the federal courts can preserve the constitutionally mandated separation of powers by definitively rebuffing his illegal actions."}
