Lance Bass, former member of boy-band *NSYNC, tweeted today that he was going to the White House to discuss health care reform with President Obama. Looking rather dapper in a suit and a purple checked shirt, Bass tweeted a picture of himself at the White House encouraging his followers to go to "HealthCare.org."

One problem: the website to sign up for insurance plans under the Affordable Care act is Healthcare.gov. HealthCare.org is a different website not connected to the Affordable Care Act.

This isn't the first time celebrities have screwed up trying to promote a cause they support: it took Lady Gaga a few tries before correctly tweeting the right address to HealthCare.gov, and actress Molly Ringwald was in need of a geography lesson after she tweeted her support for Wendy Davis as the governor of Houston.

Lance, please stick to singing and failed attempts to launch yourself into orbit.
