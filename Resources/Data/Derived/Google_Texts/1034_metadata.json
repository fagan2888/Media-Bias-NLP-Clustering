Mike Pence once again will go up against John Gregg, a pro-business Democrat who has enjoyed a long career in Indiana\u2019s legislature.\n\n\u201cPence is known for his support of issues involving traditional morality \u2014 pro-life, anti-gay rights,\u201d said Marjorie Hershey, a political scientist at Indiana University. \u201cThat puts him in conflict with the business-oriented branch of the Indiana Republican Party, which doesn\u2019t want businesses or the state itself linked with discrimination against a group toward whose rights public sentiment has become substantially more favorable in a pretty short time.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: How Bernie Sanders will pay for his vast socialist agenda, and its true cost, is a mystery\n\nIf Mr. Gregg can gain traction, there is a chance he could swing down-ballot votes for Democrats seeking other statewide offices, such as the Senate, said Andy Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne.\n\nDescribing himself as a \u201cgun-totin,\u2019 Bible-quotin,\u2019 Southern Indiana Democrat,\u201d Mr. Gregg had a long career in the Indiana House of Representatives, where he served from 1987 to 2003. He was speaker of the House from 1996 to the end of his tenure.\n\nHis supporters hope Mr. Gregg\u2019s plain-spoken persona will endear him to moderate Republicans seeking a change from Mr. Pence\u2019s leadership.\n\nSEE ALSO: Donald Trump calls for ban on Muslims entering U.S.\n\n\u201cThe different advantage we have this time around is that Mike Pence has to run on his record this time,\u201d said Tim Henderson, Mr. Gregg\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act this year made Indiana a major national embarrassment, and he just doesn\u2019t have a good record to run on.\u201d\n\nHe was referring to the religious freedom law Mr. Pence signed earlier this year to allow businesses to cite religious beliefs as a defense if sued. But the law was written so broadly that critics said it allowed businesses to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons. Mr. Pence later signed a revised version to clarify that it did not allow such discrimination, but his favorability ratings still took a hit.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s become kind of a lightning rod,\u201d said Leslie Lenkowsky, a public affairs professor at the University of Indiana.\n\nThe stakes for Indiana Democrats are high: In the past 40 years, a Democratic presidential candidate has won the state only twice \u2014 most recently President Obama in 2008. But he barely won by 25,000 votes, a slim margin considering his strong campaign infrastructure in the state and widespread national enthusiasm for his presidential bid, Mr. Downs said.\n\nIn the same time period, Indiana has had seven governors, three of whom were Democrats.\n\nPredicting the outcome of next year\u2019s gubernatorial race is no mean feat, even if it is a rematch of the 2012 election, Mr. Lenkowsky said, noting troublesome issues in the Pence administration.\n\nFor example, the Republican governor has had to address an HIV outbreak in which 250 people have been diagnosed with the virus this year.\n\nIn August, a bridge on Interstate 65 \u2014 a key thoroughfare between Indianapolis and Chicago \u2014 nearly collapsed, causing several accidents and major traffic delays. The Indiana Department of Transportation had graded the bridge as failing for more than a decade, and Democrats said the Pence administration did not do enough to improve the state\u2019s aging infrastructure.\n\nDrew Anderson, a spokesman for the Indiana Democratic Party, said Mr. Gregg could better represent \u201cthe crossroads of America\u201d because of his stance on education \u2014 he wants to fund statewide pre-kindergarten \u2014 and his plan for funding infrastructure repairs and rebuilding.\n\nThe Pence campaign officials said they expect the same result in a rematch with Mr. Gregg.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats are saying this election is all about Mike Pence\u2019s record as governor,\u201d said Pence spokesman Robert Vane. \u201cAnd our answer to that is, \u2018We hope so.\u2019 Governor Pence has a tremendous record on the issues most important to Hoosiers.\u201d\n\nMr. Vane pointed to campaign contributions as a sign that Mr. Pence has wide support inside and outside the state.\n\n\u201cJohn Gregg is raising significant amounts of money from outside Indiana,\u201d he said. \u201cNational unions, big labor, public sector unions \u2014 they\u2019re all financing his campaign, while Governor Pence\u2019s last finance report showed that over 90 percent of his contributions came from Hoosiers and over 90 percent of his contributors were Hoosiers.\u201d\n\nRepublicans pointed to the state\u2019s 4.5 percent unemployment rate, its 130,000 new private sector jobs and the Health Indiana Plan 2.0 under Mr. Pence\u2019s leadership as reasons the incumbent should be re-elected.\n\nThe gubernatorial election will have a tremendous effect on other elections in the Hoosier State, likely influencing a down-ticket effect. One of the biggest races that would be affected by the gubernatorial race: the election to replace retiring Republican Sen. Dan Coats.\n\n\u201cFrom the point of view of political parties in the state and partisan voters, winning the governorship is a really big deal,\u201d Mr. Lenkowsky said. \u201cThis means that what would determine who captures an open seat in the U.S. Senate could be determined by what happens within the state itself \u2014 a challenge for Democrats who want to win back control of Congress\u2019 upper chamber.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana has several statewide elections next year that Democrats hope will help them gain more leverage in the red-leaning state, but the contest for governor has stolen the spotlight &mdash; a rematch of the 2012 election.", "Author": "Anjali Shastry", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Indiana has several statewide elections next year that Democrats hope will help them gain more leverage in the red-leaning state, but the contest for governor has stolen the spotlight \u2014 a rematch of the 2012 election.", "title": "John Gregg, Democrats hope to gain leverage in Indiana races", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/7/john-gregg-democrats-hope-to-gain-leverage-in-indi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/07/127_2015_ap-7612149088308201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/07/127_2015_ap-7612149088308201.jpg", "title": "John Gregg, Democrats hope to gain leverage in Indiana races", "description": "Indiana has several statewide elections next year that Democrats hope will help them gain more leverage in the red-leaning state, but the contest for governor has stolen the spotlight &mdash; a rematc", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Mike Pence, John Gregg"}, "article_summary": "His supporters hope Mr. Gregg\u2019s plain-spoken persona will endear him to moderate Republicans seeking a change from Mr. Pence\u2019s leadership.\nDescribing himself as a \u201cgun-totin,\u2019 Bible-quotin,\u2019 Southern Indiana Democrat,\u201d Mr. Gregg had a long career in the Indiana House of Representatives, where he served from 1987 to 2003.\nThe Pence campaign officials said they expect the same result in a rematch with Mr. Gregg.\nMr. Pence later signed a revised version to clarify that it did not allow such discrimination, but his favorability ratings still took a hit.\n\u201cThe Democrats are saying this election is all about Mike Pence\u2019s record as governor,\u201d said Pence spokesman Robert Vane."}
