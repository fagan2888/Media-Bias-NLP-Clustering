Larimer County divers recovered the body of a 22-year-old Highlands Ranch man after he fell from a cliff at Seaman Reservoir on Friday night.

The name of the victim has not been released.

The Larimer County Coroner’s Office will release the victim’s identity and the manner and cause of death at a later time, according to a Saturday news release by the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office.

A 911 call was made at 7:19 p.m. Friday. A group of people were cliff diving at Seaman Reservoir north of Colorado 14 and west of U.S. 287 when the victim fell into the water.

“One person fell off a cliff, went into the water and could not be located,” the news release says.

The Larimer County Dive Rescue Team and Poudre Fire Authority responded to the incident, along with sheriff’s office personnel.

It took more than an hour to find the body and bring it out of the water.

The circumstances that led to the fall are still under investigation.
