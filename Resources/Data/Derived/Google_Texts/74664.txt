On Monday, only NBC's Today mentioned the "important news" that the Supreme Court was set to hear a case that could potentially dismantle ObamaCare. In a news brief in the 7 a.m. ET hour, anchor Natalie Morales reported: "...the Supreme Court is gonna hear this week a challenge to President Obama's signature health care policy that could deal it a crippling blow."

Morales explained the point of contention: "The question the justices must answer: who qualifies for federal subsidies that lower the cost of health insurance premiums? More than six million lower-income Americans depend on the subsidies, which reduce premiums by an average of almost $270 a month."

The headline on screen read: "ObamaCare Faces Tough Test; The Question: Who Qualifies for Federal Subsidies?"

Wrapping up the mere 34-second brief, Morales added: "The health insurance industry warns that if the challengers succeed, the Affordable Care Act would enter what they call a death spiral."

Neither CBS This Morning nor ABC's Good Morning America offered any coverage of the upcoming hearing at the high court.
