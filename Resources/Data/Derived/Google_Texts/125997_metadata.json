The Christan ministry says it have seen a spike in need since food stamps to low-income families were reduced in November with cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

But D.C. itself has an 8.9 percent unemployment rate even as it sits at the center of a metro-area unemployment rate of just 5.4 percent. For people who haven\u2019t gone to college \u2014 the kind of people who live in the neighborhood where Obama was speaking \u2014 the unemployment rate is 20 percent. That\u2019s a disaster. And while Obama talked about plenty of things that could help those unemployed families \u2014 subsidized health care, better schools for their kids \u2014 he didn\u2019t really talk about anything that would get them jobs. The biggest applause line of the speech was about raising the minimum wage, which is great, but also doesn\u2019t help you very much if your current wage is $0.\n\nAnd Steyn weighs in on a similar note:\n\n\u2018Work\u2019 and \u2018purpose\u2019 are intimately connected: Researchers at the University of Michigan, for example, found that welfare payments make one unhappier than a modest income honestly earned and used to provide for one\u2019s family. \u2018It drains too much of the life from life,\u2019 said Charles Murray in a speech in 2009. \u2018And that statement applies as much to the lives of janitors \u2014 even more to the lives of janitors \u2014 as it does to the lives of CEOs.\u2019 Self-reliance \u2014 \u2018work\u2019 \u2014 is intimately connected to human dignity \u2014 \u2018purpose.\u2019 So what does every initiative of the Obama era have in common? Obamacare, Obamaphones, Social Security disability expansion, 50 million people on food stamps. ... The assumption is that mass, multigenerational dependency is now a permanent feature of life. A coastal elite will devise ever smarter and slicker trinkets, and pretty much everyone else will be a member of either the dependency class or the vast bureaucracy that ministers to them.\n\nEven if incomes are equal, in other words, they\u2019re not really equal if one is earned, and the other is merely bestowed. (This is often true even when the incomes in question are large ones, as trust-fund types are notoriously prone to being aimless and dissolute.)\n\nThis problem of \u201cwork inequality\u201d isn\u2019t addressed by President Obama, and, in fact, is exacerbated by his programs. Increased dependency on the government may have its political advantages -- as The Rainmakers sang in their 1980s hit, \u201cGovernment Cheese\u201d \u201c \u201cThey\u2019ll turn us all into beggars \u2018cause they\u2019re easier to please\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s incompatible with the notion of social equality that underlies American democracy. Beggars, even if they\u2019re doing pretty well, are dependents, and a dependent class can never really be equal members of the polity.\n\nIn science fiction writer Jerry Pournelle\u2019s future history from the 1970s, 21st-century America became divided into two classes: \u201cCitizens,\u201d dependent on government, mostly residing in \u201cwelfare islands\u201d where drugs and sex provided a substitute for purpose, and \u201cTaxpayers,\u201d who actually had jobs and enjoyed certain additional legal privileges. That future seemed farfetched, then. It seems less so now, as President Obama talks about \u201cPromise Zones\u201d for the poor.\n\nSo why is President Obama less interested in the shortage of jobs and more focused on mere \u201cincome inequality?\u201d I think there are two reasons. First, while expanding the dependency class might be bad for America (and for the dependents), it\u2019s good for the political party that passes out the pork. And second \u2014 and this is more troubling \u2014 I think Obama has no idea how to address the underlying jobs problem. Let\u2019s hope our next president has some better ideas.\n\nReynolds is professor of law at the University of Tennessee and the author of The New School : How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself.
