It began in March and was supposed to be completed by this winter. But the now $6.9 million project is already behind schedule and hundreds of thousands of dollars over the city\u2019s original estimate.The loss of business is fueling tensions between local merchants and the city government as Palo Alto shifts from a quaint town of small shops to a more upscale suburban metropolis.\n\n\u201cThe California Avenue project stinks,\u201d said Al Ghafouri, owner of Printer\u2019s Caf\u00e9. \u201cEverybody is having a lot of trouble on California Avenue. No exceptions. Everybody.\u201d\n\nDissatisfaction among the California Avenue merchants was brewing before construction even began. Despite a unanimous city council vote in favor of the project, some business owners felt they weren\u2019t consulted.\u201cI think that there\u2019s a little bit of a disconnect between whatever the forces are that were really behind the project and the people that are here,\u201d said Michael Ekwall, owner of California Avenue restaurant La Bodeguita Del Medio.Project inspector James Beauchamp said he expects renovations to be completed in March 2015. But delays and miscommunications are leaving business owners frustrated and skeptical. \u201cIt was supposed to be done in August and now they\u2019re thinking a year from Christmas,\u201d said Steve Frank, owner of Avalon Yoga.There is precedent for such concern. The Mitchell Park Library and Community Center was more than two years behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget. The Streetscape Project has already increased its budget several times as well.The cost of replacing the fountain at the Caltrain station was projected to be $70,000, but is actually costing $647,000. Building sidewalks is costing $1.15 million compared to the estimated $700,000. Even planting and irrigation costs are over $70,000 above projected costs. Palo Alto officials attributed the sharp increases to design modifications and utilities upgrades that were added.\n\nThe city council, however, believes that such expenses will prove worthwhile. In the Feb. 14, 2011 meeting where the council approved the project, the city\u2019s economic developer Thomas Fehrenbach cited several cities that had completed similar projects where business dramatically improved \u2014 some by up to 37 percent. Council members today agree that the potential downfalls and high costs will ultimately pay off.\n\n\u201cI think in the long term it will be a really good investment,\u201d council member and former mayor Pat Burt said.Some business owners, despite their woes, agree with the city council that the renovations are a necessary improvement.\u201cI walk that street all the time, and having to look out for four lanes of traffic, it\u2019s insane. It\u2019s just not safe,\u201d said Kerry Hoctor, owner of Village Stationers. \u201cBy taking it down to one lane each way, it slows people down. Maybe you have a couple of people stuck at a crosswalk or whatever, but they\u2019re stopping and they\u2019re looking at your store, hopefully, that\u2019s the whole idea. You don\u2019t want them zipping by.\u201dStill, with property values increasing because of the renovations \u2014 and rents along with them \u2014 some business owners worry that California Avenue\u2019s unique character is changing.\u201cThere used to be a funky little bookstore, it\u2019s becoming an upscale hot dog restaurant \u2026 there used to be a little Indian restaurant, now it\u2019s an upscale pizza restaurant,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThe Counter is there. Starbucks is there \u2026 most of the businesses are going to be chains.\u201dBurt, the council member, agreed: \u201cThe downside to it is that we could make it so nice that it becomes gentrified \u2026 driving out small businesses.\u201dEither way, owners can agree on one thing: the project is here to stay, and they have to accept it.\u201cWhether it\u2019s really impacting our business or we see it grow, I\u2019m willing to pay the piper now to hopefully, when this is all done, have a beautiful California Avenue,\u201d Hoctor said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "The Streetscape Project construction has driven street traffic to a trickle and caused businesses to lose up to 40 percent of their revenue, feeding frustrations among owners who aren\u2019t being compensated for the losses.", "title": "California Avenue businesses in Palo Alto lament lost revenues amid construction - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/construction-workers-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-01T10:02:41+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/11/21/california-ave-construction-businesses-lost-revenues-palo-alto/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Business + Tech", "tag": "The Streetscape Project", "published_time": "2014-11-21T08:40:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-01T10:02:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Streetscape Project construction has driven street traffic to a trickle and caused businesses to lose up to 40 percent of their revenue, feeding frustrations among owners who aren\u2019t being compensated for the losses.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/construction-workers-1.jpg", "title": "California Avenue businesses in Palo Alto lament lost revenues amid construction - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3555\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe California Avenue project stinks,\u201d said Al Ghafouri, owner of Printer\u2019s Caf\u00e9.\nEverybody.\u201dDissatisfaction among the California Avenue merchants was brewing before construction even began.\n\u201cEverybody is having a lot of trouble on California Avenue.\nBut delays and miscommunications are leaving business owners frustrated and skeptical.\nThe city council, however, believes that such expenses will prove worthwhile."}
