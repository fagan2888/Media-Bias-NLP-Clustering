But some think the findings may reflect a change in how teenagers see their social worlds \u2014 one that may not be particularly positive.\n\nFor research published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, D. Matthew T. Clark, Natalie J. Loxton and Stephanie J. Tobin looked at a survey given to high school students from 1991 to 2012. The survey asked them how much they agreed with statements like \u201cA lot of the times I feel lonely\u201d and \u201cI usually have a few friends around I can get together with.\u201d\n\nThe researchers found that teenagers actually got less lonely, at least as measured by their self-reports, between 1991 and 2012. They write:\n\n\u201cThis decline contrasts with the idea that society is becoming increasingly lonely, an idea present in both popular media and research. The contrast may be due to negativity bias, a bias that causes negative events to appear more negative the closer events are to the present. People may imagine examples of isolation in the present easily but forget examples from the past.\u201d\n\nThey add that while \u201csocial media can reduce feelings of loneliness,\u201d they doubt that its rising popularity caused the decline they saw, \u201cbecause social media became prominent recently and after declines in loneliness began.\u201d\n\nThe authors also note that, as loneliness decreased, what they call \u201csocial network isolation\u201d \u2014 measured by students\u2019 responses to the statements \u201cThere is always someone I can turn to if I need help\u201d and \u201cI usually have a few friends around I can get together with\u201d \u2014 actually increased. In other words, though students in 2012 may have felt less lonely than they did in 1991, they were also more likely to feel that they didn\u2019t necessarily have someone to rely on.\n\nIf teens are more socially isolated than they used to be, at least by these measures, why isn\u2019t it bothering them more? Dr. Clark told Op-Talk in an email that people might see less need for friendship than they used to: \u201cWorse social networks may not have produced an increase in the experience of loneliness because people are more self-sufficient.\u201d Today, he said: \u201cPeople may feel like they do not need to rely on people as much as previously. People can choose more aspects of their life, including what job to choose, where to live, and who to marry. Labor specialization could lead to a focus on the individual.\u201d\n\nAnd while factors like labor specialization may not always affect teenagers directly, they \u201cmay lead to changes in cultural values and attitudes, which would affect the attitudes and motivations of high school students.\u201d\n\nWe may also need to question the idea \u201cthat social networks are all there is to belonging,\u201d said Dr. Clark. \u201cBelonging may also encompass how you fit in with society at large. Belonging may be also be about your skills, and a belief that you have skills that are respected and useful to your culture.\u201d In other words, there may be ways to feel a part of something larger, even if you\u2019re all by yourself.\n\nSo should we stop worrying about loneliness? Not according to John T. Cacioppo, a psychologist who studies the phenomenon. For one thing, he said, the data Dr. Clark and his team analyzed show \u201cat best very modest decreases\u201d in young people\u2019s loneliness. And high schoolers may not be the group researchers are most concerned about right now: \u201cWhere we and others have seen what looks to be an increase is in middle-aged and older adults.\u201d Loneliness may have harmful physical effects, he noted, and those are more likely to show up in older people than in kids.\n\n\u201cThese are teenagers, and they might not be needing their social networks in the way that you or I as adults might really need our social networks,\u201d Emily White, author of the book \u201cLonely: Learning to Live With Solitude,\u201d told Op-Talk. When she and her spouse separated, she said, \u201cI needed help in all sorts of ways, and if that help hadn\u2019t been there I would\u2019ve felt lonely, whereas if I was 16 and you asked me after drama class whether my social support network mattered a lot to me, my answer might have been no.\u201d\n\nShe also floated a potential explanation for the finding that students\u2019 self-reported loneliness dropped even as social network isolation increased. Environmentalists, she said, sometimes use the term \u201cenvironmental amnesia.\u201d \u201cWhat it means is that every generation is born into a more degraded ecosystem,\u201d she explained, \u201cand they take that degraded ecosystem as their baseline, and they adjust to it.\u201d Maybe teenagers today have a sort of \u201csocial amnesia\u201d \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m wondering if these high-school students have had weaker support networks their whole lives, and so they\u2019re reporting less loneliness because that\u2019s what they\u2019re used to.\u201d\n\nRobin Marantz Henig, a co-author of \u201cTwentysomething: Why Do Young Adults Seem Stuck?\u201d and a New York Times Magazine contributing writer who has also explored loneliness, thinks the drop in that condition might be \u201ca reflection of changes in expectation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy husband and I have very similar social networks,\u201d she told Op-Talk, but while she feels lonely, he does not, \u201cbecause he\u2019s very self-sufficient and doesn\u2019t expect to be spending a lot of time with people.\u201d Maybe teenagers now expect to have fewer friends than they did in the past.\n\nStill, if loneliness really is declining in young people, that could bode well for the future. \u201cIt clearly is something that becomes more common as people get older,\u201d she said, \u201cif it\u2019s really the case that the next generation is starting from a better place, that would be encouraging.\u201d\n\nAnd understanding why teenagers\u2019 loneliness is dropping \u2014 if, indeed, it is \u2014 might give us clues about how to help those kids who are still lonely. Dr. Cacioppo wonders if the spread of anti-bullying programs in schools had anything to do with the drop Dr. Clark and his team saw. And, he said, such programs might give us ideas for addressing loneliness in schools, too.\n\nBut are we truly ready to address loneliness? Media coverage over the last few years has certainly drawn attention to the issue. However, says Ms. White, attention hasn\u2019t always meant acceptance. Loneliness \u201cseems to have become more talked about, which is great, but also slightly more controversial.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems like as people are getting lonelier, there\u2019s this sort of chorus that says that we\u2019re not,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re comfortable with the thought that we\u2019re getting increasingly lonely.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141210112736, "twitter": {"description": "New research suggests they are \u2014 but some say their expectations of social life might be changing, possibly for the worse.", "title": "Are Teenagers Getting Less Lonely?", "url": "http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/are-teenagers-getting-less-lonely/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/12/06/opinion/nyto-lonely/nyto-lonely-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytopinion", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 10, 2014", "keywords": "Age Chronological,Books and Literature,Friendship,Psychology and Psychologists,Research,Social Media,Teenagers and Adolescence,Youth,Deeper Dive", "GBLC": "Deeper Dive", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/op-talk/Are Teenagers Getting Less Lonely?
