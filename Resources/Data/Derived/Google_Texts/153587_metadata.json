When that failed, it has been about reducing any possibilities for a presidential legacy.\n\nEven with unprecedented obstruction, things have been accomplished.\n\nTo name a few: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act for women; American automakers' rescue; Affordable Care Act; Don't Ask, Don't Tell repeal; end of the Defense of Marriage Act; Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals; federal employees paid family leave; higher wages for federal contractors; Wall Street reform; Paris agreement on climate change; gun safety executive action; nuclear security summit covering weapons and materials; Iran nuclear deal; restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nYou may have political or religious beliefs against one or more of the above, but millions of U.S. citizens agree with every one of the policies.\n\nOur country continues to move forward with three candidates still vying to be president. Two offer agendas to keep moving forward while one is asking for votes through fear-mongering. One Democrat is offering a very idealistic set of goals not attainable unless the GOP agrees with large tax increases.\n\nDonald Trump has no concept of being a commander-in-chief as evidenced by his bizarre, contradictory foreign policy speech. He is asking for large spending increases to expand our military capabilities and to bring our country's infrastructure into the 21st century. He plans to pay for it by large reductions in taxes. Hopefully, he will explain how he plans to change the basic laws of math.\n\nIt is my sincere hope that, as voters, we have reasonable intelligence. If we want our voices to be heard, everyone should make the effort to vote.\n\nJohn L.
