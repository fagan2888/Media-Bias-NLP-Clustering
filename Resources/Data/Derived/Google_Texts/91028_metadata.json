Finance on Monday that his opposition to pay hikes was only about the welfare of the workers.\n\n\u201cI just want to make sure people understand the consequences of raising the minimum wage, which is\u2026 youth unemployment, and increased prices, and more automation,\u201d Puzder explained. \u201cLabor participation for people 16 to 29 years old is plummeting, and it\u2019s plummeting because we\u2019re pricing them out of the market with these minimum wage increases, and there are experienced workers who are willing to take the jobs because they\u2019ve had their hours cut to under 30 [hours per week] because of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nYahoo! host Shibani Joshi noted that surveys had shown that the median age of fast-food employees was 29, and more than half of the workers were forced to use welfare programs.\n\n\u201cSo, is youth unemployment really the focus here, when the older 29 year olds are the ones that are getting really getting impacted, and they\u2019re on public assistance because their wages aren\u2019t high enough?\u201d Joshi asked.\n\nPuzder argued that less than 5 percent of employees over 21 at Carl\u2019s Jr. were on minimum wage. And if the minimum wage was increased then younger potential workers would be \u201cat home looking at posters from the last election or waiting for mom to make dinner, as opposed to being out there actually working, and getting the experience they need to go forward in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Americans who are just trying to make ends meet,\u201d Joshi observed. \u201cIt\u2019s not just people working at your stores, Carl\u2019s Jr. and Arby\u2019s and other stores. It affects a lot of other companies as well, and it affects their quality of life.\u201d\n\nPuzder insisted that the solution was a \u201cdynamic, growing economy\u201d instead of a minimum wage increase because \u201cif people have jobs, their wages go up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t solve that problem by having the government artificially mandate a wage increase when there is no economic growth to support that,\u201d he opined. \u201cIf government gets out of the way, businesses will create jobs, wages will go up, and the country will go back to a state of prosperity instead of what we\u2019re in now.\u201d\n\nAs Huffington Post pointed out, Puzder did not address the imbalance between minimum wage workers and fast-food CEOs, who make 721 times more on average.\n\nWatch the video below from Yahoo!
