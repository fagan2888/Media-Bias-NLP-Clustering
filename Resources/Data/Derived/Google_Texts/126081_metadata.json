Catania and former Council member Carol Schwartz \u2014 are trying to sway the District\u2019s majority Democratic voters to turn away from Ms. Bowser.\n\nThe heavily Democratic city has never elected a mayor who was not a Democrat.\n\nMr. Obama hasn\u2019t always made his support known in local races.\n\nFormer Mayor Adrian Fenty asked Mr. Obama for his endorsement before he was unseated by Vincent C.
