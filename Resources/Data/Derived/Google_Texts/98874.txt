Kelly Manley, along with Mike and Olivia O'Malley are visiting Panama City Beach from the Tampa area for the Fourth of July. But for Olivia, she not only spent time vacationing in the Panhandle, but also paid it forward Sunday for a school project.

"Her summer requirement is to write, take Flat Francis to four different places this summer, take pictures, and write about it," said Manley. "And, one of them has to be a random act of kindness that she and Flat Francis have to do. So, the beach cleanup today (Sunday) is doing that purpose."

Manley and O'Malley joined dozens in Panama City Beach Sunday morning to take out the trash in the first ever Pier Park Beach Clean-Up.

After a night filled with fireworks, food, and red, white, and blue, Pier Park Director of Marketing and Business Development Michael Kerrigan says the shopping center wanted to bring a community together to restore what he says is one of the area's biggest resources.

"Luckily we live in a community that really cherishes the beach and really wants to get involved in help keeping it beautiful," said Kerrigan. "We know this is going to happen every Fourth of July, so we're just happy to do our part in giving back a little bit and helping in the clean-up effort."

The clean-up gave those like Cariloha store owner Randy Williams hope, seeing the camaraderie of a community helping put the beautiful back in the world's most beautiful beaches.

"It's a beautiful scenery out here, and we need to keep it that way," said Williams. "We need to do this, in my opinion, a little bit more often."

Kerrigan says 25 people showed up for the clean-up Sunday. The shopping center gave volunteers frisbees and refreshments for helping clean up the beach.

According to Kerrigan, Pier Park is planning on holding another cleanup for July fifth next year.
