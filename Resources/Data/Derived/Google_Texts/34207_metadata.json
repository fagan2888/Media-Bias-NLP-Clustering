It turns out that Cruz and his family have always had coverage.\n\nWhile campaigning in New Hampshire on Thursday, Sen. Cruz claimed that he was currently without health insurance, \u201cYou know who one of those millions of Americans who\u2019s lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me. I don\u2019t have health care right now. I had purchased an individual policy, and Blue Cross Blue Shield canceled all their individual policies in the state of Texas effective December 31st. So our health care got canceled. We got a notice in the mail. Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market.\u201d\n\nHis didn\u2019t make sense because people don\u2019t get only a single letter in the mail and dropped. What Cruz was describing did not sound real because it wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the Cruz campaign was forced to admit that he had been moved to another plan:\n\nCruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said Friday that Mr. Cruz\u2019s insurance broker had told him that he lost his health coverage when his Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas preferred provider organization or PPO, policy terminated on Dec. 31.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz had in fact been automatically enrolled by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas in another, narrower-network \u201chealth maintenance organization\u201d plan that kept him covered in January.\n\nCustomers don\u2019t get one letter and dropped. If the customer does not pick a new plan in the marketplace, their insurance provider moves them to a new plan automatically.\n\nLike most Republicans, Cruz has to lie to attack the Affordable Care Act. Since the law is working, the GOP has to lie and invent dire circumstances to paint a picture of failure.\n\nThe truth about Ted Cruz\u2019s health insurance situation makes the case for Obamacare. Cruz was not tossed off of his insurance. He was not left uninsured. Unlike the old system, his insurance company didn\u2019t get to drop him and say sorry about your luck.\n\nTed Cruz has no conscience. He will lie about anything if he thinks it will help get elected president. The problem with Cruz\u2019s lie about Obamacare is that it proves that the law is working.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz's recent claim in New Hampshire that he does not have health insurance has been revealed to be a complete and total lie.
