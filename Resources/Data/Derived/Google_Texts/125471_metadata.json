Salad\u2014not the highfalutin, ramps-and-pine-nuts kind, but the patriotic, iceberg-lettuce-and-a-petrified-tomato-wedge kind\u2014is the food you order when you\u2019re at a place where you\u2019re expected to be eating food (chain restaurants, broadly), but it\u2019s a time of year when you should not really be eating the food they serve there (the seemingly 10-month annual timespan known as \u201cswimsuit season\u201d). Salad is a necessity, a type of proto-Soylent. In its purest form, it says, \u201cI\u2019m taking care of a basic bodily need, but it\u2019s just crunchy water!\u201d Salad, at its best, feels like a strategically good choice without being truly satisfying to the soul, like dating someone who\u2019s not that smart, but has a beach-adjacent timeshare.\n\nRelated: 3 New Food-Delivery Apps Make Ordering Even Simpler\n\nSalad has its faults, and it knows it. It\u2019s healthy, but it will never win the popularity contest against your Chipotle burritos, or even your Quizno\u2019s subs. So the one thing salad should really never be is less healthy than a Big Mac. A Big Mac! It\u2019s the sandwich that\u2019s shorthand for everything that\u2019s wrong with the American diet.\n\nAnd yet, a new report from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine points out 100 restaurant salads that are \u201cworse\u201d than a Big Mac. The group defines \u201cworse\u201d in terms of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and calories, of which a Big Mac has 550, according to PCRM. (McDonald\u2019s says the famous burger has only 530.) According to PCRM, a Big Mac also contains 29 grams of fat, 75 mg of cholesterol, and 970 mg of sodium.\n\nHere are the worst five salads, according to those metrics:\n\nApplebee\u2019s Grilled Shrimp 'N Spinach Salad, Regular\n\nFrom Applebee\u2019s: \u201cTender spinach, crisp bacon, roasted red peppers, red onions, toasted almonds, and hot bacon vinaigrette topped with grilled shrimp.\u201d\n\nFrom PCRM: 1,000 calories, 10 g saturated fat, 195 mg cholesterol, and 2,990 mg sodium. This salad has the highest sodium.\n\nCalifornia Pizza Kitchen's Moroccan-Spiced Chicken Salad, Full\n\nFrom CPK: \u201cOne of a kind, with roasted butternut squash, dates, avocado, toasted almonds, beets, red peppers, chopped egg, and cranberries. Tossed with housemade Champagne vinaigrette.\u201d\n\nFrom PCRM: 1,500 calories, 10 g saturated fat, 295 mg cholesterol, and 1,380 mg sodium. This salad has the most calories.\n\nChili's Quesadilla Explosion Salad\n\nFrom Chili\u2019s: \u201cGrilled chicken breast with shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, house-made corn and black-bean salsa, crispy tortilla strips, a drizzle of ancho-chile ranch sauce and citrus-balsamic dressing. Served with freshly toasted three-cheese quesadillas.\u201d\n\nFrom PCRM: 1,430 calories, 28 g saturated fat, 175 mg cholesterol, and 2,620 mg sodium. \u201cWorse than two Big Macs in all categories.\u201d\n\nIHOP's Crispy Chicken Cobb Salad With Avocado\n\nFrom IHOP: \u201cThe most satisfying salad. With crispy chicken, smoky bacon, hard-boiled egg, juicy tomatoes, and tangy blue cheese crumbles all tossed in a tasty ranch dressing, this salad has it all. Also available with grilled chicken.\u201d\n\nFrom PCRM: 1,350 calories, 29 g saturated fat, 590 mg cholesterol, and 2,980 mg sodium. This salad has the highest fat and saturated fat.\n\nIHOP's Crispy Chicken Cobb Salad With Grilled Chicken\n\nFrom PCRM: 1,130 calories, 27 g saturated fat, 635 mg cholesterol, and 2,880 mg sodium. This salad has the most cholesterol.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to the other 95.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to be skeptical about here: PCRM promotes a vegetarian diet and opposes the use of animals in scientific research, and it\u2019s received plenty of criticism from the American Medical Association as a result. Also, many of these salads bring fibrous, nutritious ingredients like spinach and beets along for the sodium-and-fat ride, so \u201cworse than\u201d is in the eye of the beholder, to a certain extent.\n\nStill, the group has a point: Some mass-produced salads are basically nachos in disguise. Once something comes with \u201cfreshly toasted three-cheese quesadillas,\u201d it\u2019s not a salad, it\u2019s a Super-Bowl party appetizer.\n\nWhat explains consumers\u2019 continued willingness to order calorie-bomb salads? In at least one study, researchers found that customers perceived a food item that was presented in a \u201chealthier\u201d food category, like salad, to be more wholesome than a similar item that had identical ingredients but was listed under a less-healthy category, like pasta. (This might scientifically be known as the \u201cBut it\u2019s the light Ben & Jerry\u2019s\u201d principle.)\n\nAnd paradoxically, just by listing salads on the menu, restaurants can prompt customers to order even less healthy (and more expensive) fare. Thanks to a mind trick called \"vicarious goal fulfillment,\" a person can feel that his goal of healthy eating is met by simply seeing a salad on the menu and considering ordering it\u2014before ultimately going with the house sirloin. You don\u2019t have to know how unhealthy the Quesadilla Explosion Salad is. You don\u2019t even have to point to it on the shiny trifold menu and glance bashfully at the waiter. You think you\u2019re eating healthier just because the word \u201csalad\u201d is there.\n\nRelated: The 17 Best Supermarkets in America in 2015\n\nIf you\u2019d like a salad that doesn\u2019t have the calorie count of a body-builder\u2019s last meal, PCRM recommends avoiding creamy dressings, skipping the cheese, and topping the dish with beans instead of bacon. (\u201cChickpeas are a tasty addition to almost any salad,\u201d the group notes dubiously.)\n\nOr you could admit that you want something salty, greasy, and cheese-slathered, and eat the Big Mac already.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Let\u2019s be honest for a second: Salad is usually not the most delicious thing on a", "title": "Why a Big Mac Is Healthier Than You Think", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Why-Big-Mac-Healthier-You-Think", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03242011_mcd_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/18/Why-Big-Mac-Healthier-You-Think", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03242011_mcd_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Let\u2019s be honest for a second: Salad is usually not the most delicious thing on a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4e67\"", "article_summary": "Or you could admit that you want something salty, greasy, and cheese-slathered, and eat the Big Mac already.\nThe group defines \u201cworse\u201d in terms of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and calories, of which a Big Mac has 550, according to PCRM.\nAccording to PCRM, a Big Mac also contains 29 grams of fat, 75 mg of cholesterol, and 970 mg of sodium.\nSo the one thing salad should really never be is less healthy than a Big Mac.\nAnd yet, a new report from the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine points out 100 restaurant salads that are \u201cworse\u201d than a Big Mac."}
