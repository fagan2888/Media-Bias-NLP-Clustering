According to the law, children from anywhere other than Canada or Mexico cannot be immediately deported; they have to be taken into U.S. Custody first.\n\nArtesia residents have mixed reviews about the government\u2019s plan to house the immigrants in the small town of about 15,000 people.\n\n\u201cIt makes me very angry,\u201d said Pat Tiedemann.\n\nJerry Ortega is on the other end of the spectrum.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t bother me one bit. They\u2019re not hurting me here,\u201d said Ortega.\n\nBoth Tiedemann and Ortega live in a neighborhood right next to where the immigrants will be housed.\n\n\u201cI know the border patrol agents are going to be very good baby sitters, but I don\u2019t know there\u2019s just so many unknowns,\u201d said Tiedemann.\n\nArtesia police said they are planning to increase patrols near the facility. Some people aren\u2019t sure it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t judge a book by its cover,\u201d said Ortega. \u201cThey might be nice kids, families that just need help.\u201d\n\nAccording to Representative Pearce, the federal government will run the operation.
