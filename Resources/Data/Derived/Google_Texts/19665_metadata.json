For example, Chicago-based consulting firm Huron Healthcare will collaborate with some 1,000 hospitals on developing best practices for communication. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, meanwhile, is exploring further drilldown into patient population features to improve HCAHPS scores, especially as the population diversifies and cultural competency becomes essential to improvement.\n\nThe role of taking demographics into account in improving communication has largely been overlooked, said Huron Managing Director Matthew Bates. \"The best answer for understanding the cultural differences in patient demographics is to meet patients where they are and not where you want them to be,\" he told the publication. \"Yes, change is hard--you have to make it a priority. But once you make it a priority, you can change.\"\n\nFor example, he said, in a hospital that serves a largely Spanish-speaking patient population, being able to communicate with those patients is not listed as an HCAHPS communication issue but it is still vital for aligning hospital services and patient preferences.\n\nCultural competency and the ability to communicate with patients from varied backgrounds on their levels is especially important in areas such as end-of-life care, where patients must understand exactly what a provider is telling them, added Kevin Keck, M.D., chief medical officer for West Hartford, Connecticut's SCIO Health Analytics. Hospitals seeking to improve in these areas should enforce strengthened communication protocols from the top down, Keck added.\n\nHealthcare experts have suggested improving patient satisfaction scores does not necessarily improve outcomes, but recent research published in Management Science found that caregiver-patient communication is the number-one factor in preventable readmissions, FierceHealthcare previously reported. Investing in communication training programs, the study found, could improve 30-day readmission rates by up to 5 percent.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nImproved doc-patient communication linked to reduced readmissions\n\nGuide outlines steps to become a culturally competent hospital\n\nDo patient satisfaction surveys value comfort over outcomes?\n\nHospitals work to capture patient voices to improve healthcare experience\n\nAre high-end, hotel-like amenities a waste of money?\n\nHospitals develop online ratings strategy in quest for patient satisfaction\n\nDo hospitals care too much about patient satisfaction scores?\n\nPatient satisfaction may not correlate with care quality\n\nHow to balance patient satisfaction and quality care\n\nStudy questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical quality\n\nHospitals with unhappy patients still provide high-quality care", "article_metadata": {"description": "Improving Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores is a top priority within the hospital sector, and to make meaningful improvements, provider-patient communication that incorporates demographic information is key, according to Healthcare Finance News.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Improving Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores is a top priority within the hospital sector, and to make meaningful improvements, provider-patient communication that incorporates demographic information is key, according to Healthcare Finance News.", "title": "Cultural competency, communication key to better HCAHPS scores", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/cultural-competency-key-improving-hospitals-communication-scores/2015-10-14", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,communication,Cultural Competency,diversity,HCAHPS,Huron Consulting Group,Operations & Business Management,Patient Engagement,Patient Experience,Patient Population,Patient Satisfaction", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca829\"", "article_summary": "Hospitals develop online ratings strategy in quest for patient satisfactionDo hospitals care too much about patient satisfaction scores?\nPatient satisfaction may not correlate with care qualityHow to balance patient satisfaction and quality careStudy questions link between patient satisfaction and clinical qualityHospitals with unhappy patients still provide high-quality care\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, meanwhile, is exploring further drilldown into patient population features to improve HCAHPS scores, especially as the population diversifies and cultural competency becomes essential to improvement.\nCommunication measures account for 50 percent of the HCAHPS Patient Experience Index, leading many hospitals to pay special attention to that aspect of care.\nFor example, Chicago-based consulting firm Huron Healthcare will collaborate with some 1,000 hospitals on developing best practices for communication."}
