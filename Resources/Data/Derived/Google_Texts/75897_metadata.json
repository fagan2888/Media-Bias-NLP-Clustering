Contrast Cruz's book with Barack Obama's autobiography, Dreams from My Father, which contained numerous unchallenged falsehoods.\n\nPulling at strings, Lund also claimed falsely that \"a Ted Cruz spokesman...walks back the candidate's comment that Robert Dear might have been a 'transgendered leftist activist,'\" referring to a retort Cruz made regarding a vicious killer in Colorado Springs. Lund linked to the New York Times for proof of this claim, perhaps hoping nobody would check his source, which made no such admission.\n\nSpeaking of the New York Times, an OpEd by Frank Bruni this week also praised Cruz's brilliance while fretting that \"voters should be wary \u2014 very wary \u2014 of Ted Cruz,\" warning (hysterically) that Cruz will try to convince voters that he is not \"nasty:\"\n\n\"...Expect orchestrated glimpses of a high-minded Cruz, less skunk than statesman, his sneer ceding territory to a smile.\"\n\nBruni continues to provide a statement from Ted Cruz's \"freshman roommate\" who says he would \"rather have anybody else be the president...\" for evidence that Americans should be terrified. Ted Cruz was 17-years-old when he resided with this particular roommate.\n\nWhile the mainstream media has largely ignored Cruz; it is unlikely that they will be able avoid him much longer.\n\nNeither of the above articles addressed Cruz's stand on policy issues.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has been the target of some particularly bizarre attacks in recent days by mainstream publications such as the New Yo", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/new-york-times-rolling-stone-attempt-to-smear-ted-cruz-fail-miserably", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/e0/11/e01106e354d8b9607a4777c9b83253b4.jpg?itok=Gx8wA_90", "type": "article", "title": "New York Times, Rolling Stone attempt to smear Ted Cruz, fail miserably"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has been the target of some particularly bizarre attacks in recent days by mainstream publications such as the New York Times and Rolling Stone Magazine.", "creator": "@reneenal", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/e0/11/e01106e354d8b9607a4777c9b83253b4.jpg?itok=Gx8wA_90", "title": "New York Times, Rolling Stone attempt to smear Ted Cruz, fail miserably", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2015-12-05T08:14:20-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Elections Topics, Ted Cruz, jeb lund, Frank Bruni, media bias, a time for truth", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has been the target of some particularly bizarre attacks in recent days by mainstream publications such as the New York Times and Rolling Stone Magazine.\nOn Thursday, Jeb Lund wrote an article for Rolling Stone Magazine lamenting, for example, that Ted Cruz's book A Time for Truth \"possesses only 66 end notes.\"\nLund's article, which links to Soros-funded hyper-partisan publications ThinkProgress and MediaMatters, further complained (hysterically):\"He [Ted Cruz] is gaffe proof because the gaffes are not arrived at by error.\"\nTed Cruz was 17-years-old when he resided with this particular roommate.\nContrast Cruz's book with Barack Obama's autobiography, Dreams from My Father, which contained numerous unchallenged falsehoods."}
