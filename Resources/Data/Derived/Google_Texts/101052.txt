A POPULAR pub chain could be set to invest more than £1million in a Dovercourt town centre grotspot that has been derelict for more than a decade.

JD Wetherspoon has bought the former Co-Op site at 60 Kingsway and plans to convert it into a new pub, which could create 50 new jobs.

Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon believes more businesses could be attracted to the town following the takeover.

He said: “We are pleased to have purchased a site in Dovercourt.

“We believe that a Wetherspoon pub will be a great asset to the town and also act as a catalyst for investment from other businesses. We would invest more than £1.3 million on the pub and create approximately 50 jobs.”

The conversion and licensing would need to be given the all-clear by Tendring Council, and Mr Gershon said it was currently not known when work could begin.

Wetherspoon owns hundreds of pubs across the country, selling alcohol, and food at affordable prices.
