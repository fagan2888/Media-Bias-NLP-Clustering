Diem Brown, the MTV reality star who was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 23, lost her long battle with the disease Friday, according to the network. She was 32.

“MTV is tremendously sad to hear the news that Diem Brown has lost her long battle with cancer. We send our deepest condolences to her family and friends. Diem was a true fighter and brought passion to everything she touched. We will miss her,” MTV said in a statement provided to msnbc.

Brown rose to fame in 2006 as a cast member of MTV’s “Real World/Road Rules Challenge.” She revealed her cancer diagnosis in her debut challenge and went on to complete in multiple MTV “Challenge” specials, successfully battling two bouts of ovarian cancer along the way. While on the set of her eighth “Challenge” appearance this summer, Brown collapsed – her cancer had returned for a third and final time, this time spreading to her colon.

Brown maintained a blog about her struggle with cancer on People.com. She wrote about her treatments, the ups and downs, and kept readers up to date even during her toughest days.

After her second bout with ovarian cancer, Brown traveled to Washington, D.C. to learn more about the Affordable Care Act. She expressed support for Obamacare, especially because it allowed people with pre-existing conditions, like herself, to access affordable health insurance.

“Having a pre-existing condition made me feel trapped with my health insurance plan since 2002 with no options – until now,” Brown wrote in her People.com blog in October 2013. Brown encouraged her readers to visit the health care marketplace last year.

Brown posted her last updates on Nov. 11 via Twitter – she was optimistic until the end.
