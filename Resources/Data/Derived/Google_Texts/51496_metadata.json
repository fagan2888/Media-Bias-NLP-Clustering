One parent accuses the other of abusing their child. The accused parent, however, will sometimes say the child was brainwashed into making false accusations.\n\nThe stakes are enormous \u2013 a child can end up in the custody of an abuser, or an innocent parent can be labeled a monster. A family court judge must decide who is telling the truth and then seal the family\u2019s fate.\n\nWhen Parents Brainwash Their Kids\n\n\u201cParental alienation\u201d is the idea that one parent can maliciously turn a child against the other parent for no good reason. Dr. Richard Warshak calls it \u201cdivorce poison.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kids hear a steady drumbeat about a parent\u2019s flaws and lies that portray the parent as unloving and unworthy of love,\u201d explained Warshak, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and author of \"Divorce Poison.\"\n\nAlienated children, he says, will \u201cpull away from a formerly loved mother or father, and often an entire extended family, leaving the rejected relatives puzzled over what they might have said or done that caused a total rupture in relations.\u201d\n\nChildren who suffer from parental alienation may behave reprehensibly toward a caring parent without feeling any shame and hold no positive thoughts or memories of that parent, said Warshak.\n\nWhen alienation is extreme, children can be manipulated into making false accusations ofchild abuse against even the most loving parent, he said.\n\nAre Some Judges Ignoring Child Abuse Because of \u201cParental Alienation\u201d Claims?\n\nThe widespread acceptance of parental alienation claims in family courts nationwide has sparked a heated controversy.\n\nCritics, like law professor Joan Meier of George Washington University, believe judges too often reject child abuse allegations made during custody battles because they assume the child was brainwashed to lie.\n\n\u201cIf you raise child abuse in court, you've got to make a very strong case. If you can't nail it, not only will you lose custody, you may lose all access to your child because the assumption will be that you've poisoned your child's brain with these ideas,\u201d said Meier.\n\nIn a pilot study of 240 cases, Meier\u2019s provisional findings suggest that in 80 percent of parental alienation cases where a mother alleged child abuse against the father, the mother lost primary or joint custody of her kids. Many of these parents, Meier believes, \u201cwere punished for reporting abuse.\u201d\n\nThere is also concern within the medical community. \u201cThere is insufficient scientific evidence that parental alienation is a real mental disorder,\u201d said Dr. Paul Appelbaum, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and former president of the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nWhile badmouthing another parent can be harmful to children, Appelbaum said that \u201cwe ought to be careful about throwing around terms [like parental alienation] that carry such strong pejorative connotations, especially when the consequences can change a child\u2019s life forever.\u201d\n\nAn Underground Network to Hide Children\n\nDamon Dumas spoke to ABC News about the child abuse he said he suffered at the hands of his father. He said that a family court judge ignored his allegations, concluded that he had suffered parental alienation by his mother, and ordered him into the full custody of his father. Damon\u2019s father has denied ever abusing his son and a judge in their case agreed there was no credible evidence to corroborate the accusations of abuse.\n\nWith his mother\u2019s help, Dumas ran away from home and into a secret underground network of friends and strangers who hide children from a parent with custody. During those dark days, Damon says even his mother did not know his exact whereabouts: \u201cShe handed me off to someone she trusted, who handed me off to someone else that she trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nDumas spent 1 year and 8 months in hiding, always moving, and living in 10 different homes despite \u201ccrushing loneliness,\u201d he said.\n\nToday, Dumas advocates for other children who claim that family court judges wrongly found \u201cparental alienation\u201d by one parent, instead of child abuse by the other. Working with the organizations Safe Kids International and The Women\u2019s Coalition, he helps raise awareness about what they call \u201cthe epidemic of court-licensed abuse.\u201d\n\nFamily Court Judges Must Decide Who Is Telling the Truth\n\nLegal experts say parental alienation claims can be treated very differently depending on where you are and which judge hears your case.\n\n\u201cYou can take the same story, same facts, presented the exact same way, and you will get a different result depending on which judge\u2019s courtroom you walk into,\u201d said veteran family law attorney Lynne Gold-Bikin.\n\n\u201cSometimes these parents are telling the truth, and sometimes they\u2019re not,\u201d said Gold-Bikin, who has represented parents both claiming and being accused of parental alienation.\n\nFamily court judges may find it difficult to know who is being truthful. \u201cThey are not given a crystal ball when they get on the bench,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "\u201cParental alienation\u201d is the idea that one parent can maliciously turn a child against the other parent for no good reason.
