Like any job, bud trimming comes with perks and pains. Most places will feed you for free (although larger operations will often not be well-prepared to feed large groups, so get in line quick). There are usually free buds to smoke and many places have dabs set up as well. Be sure not to oversmoke, however, because you're still at work. You'll often be provided with a place to crash overnight, although it's a good idea to bring stuff to camp or sleep in your car.The downside to most trim jobs is the hours. Trimming is easy to get the hang of, but it's meticulous work, and drudgery at that. Much like data entry, working the mailroom, or any other back-end business operation, trimming is a production environment where perfect sustained quality is expected. You may find yourself working 10-12 hour days, sometimes even longer. I've put in a few 20 hour days, and seen jobs stretch out for several weeks.Also, always keep in mind you're working with a drug. Although generally socially acceptable in most parts of the country, it is still technically illegal. At any point, the place you're working could get raided. If it does, you'll likely be O.K. so long as you don't have a prior record. If you have any outstanding warrants or court orders, ID collection time is a good time to either pray or run.Working in the drug trade isn't glamorous. Rather than smoking a blunt with Snoop and Redman while reloading your little friends to go Don Dada on the world, you'll be sitting on a bench listening to music while clipping twigs out of a piece of broccoli. Thousands of times a day...for days...- Written by Brian Penny for Main Street
