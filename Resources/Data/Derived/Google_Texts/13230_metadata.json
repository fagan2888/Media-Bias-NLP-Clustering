Since your heartbreaking performance as the world's most famous sex researcher in Kinsey \u2014 for which you won our 2004 Movies for Grownups best actor award \u2014 your work has consisted almost exclusively of movies that can be described this way: \"A man shoots people. Or possibly strangles them. Or stabs them with something pointy.\"\n\nThe body count rises alarmingly in Run All Night, the story of Jimmy, a booze-soaked retired hit man (Neeson, natch) who must protect his virtuous son, Mike (RoboCop star Joel Kinnaman), from an army of thugs hired by a mobbed-up businessman (Ed Harris). Director Jaume Collet-Serra and an army of three screenwriters (never a good sign) tart up the proceedings by arranging for Jimmy to be seized by guilt. (See: just about any hit man movie of the past 10 years.) What's worse, Jimmy's oldest friend just happens to be the very mobster now trying to kill him and Mike.
