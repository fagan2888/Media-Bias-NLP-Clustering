It was the fastest pace since the second quarter of 2010 and suggested the recovery was more durable after output slumped in the first quarter because of an unusually cold winter.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had expected the second-quarter GDP growth pace would be revised down to 3.9 percent. The economy contracted at a 2.1 percent pace in the first quarter.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nGross domestic income, which measures the income side of the growth ledger, surged at a 4.7 percent rate, consistent with strong job gains during the quarter. That was the largest increase since the first quarter of 2012.\n\nThis alternative growth measure decreased at a 0.8 percent pace in the first quarter.\n\nCorporate profits rebounded from a decline that had been spurred by the expiration of a depreciation bonus.\n\nGrowth in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was unrevised at a 2.5 percent rate.\n\nBusinesses accumulated $83.9 billion worth of inventory in the second quarter, less than the initially reported $93.4 billion. That saw restocking contributing 1.39 percentage points to GDP growth rather than 1.66 percentage points.\n\nThe relatively smaller inventory build means less stock overhang, which bodes well for third-quarter GDP growth.\n\nWhile trade was a drag for a second consecutive quarter, export growth was raised to a 10.1 percent pace from a 9.5 percent rate. Business spending on equipment and nonresidential structures, such as gas drilling, was revised higher.\n\nHousing market-related spending was revised slightly down as was government spending.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-09 07:51:07 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent/_jcr_content/image.img.png/0/0/1452387069745.png?ve=1", "description": "The economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter and details of a report pointed to sustainable underlying strength.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Second-quarter GDP growth revised up to 4.2 percent"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Second-quarter GDP growth revised up to 4.2 percent\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent/_jcr_content/image.img.png/0/0/1452387069745.png?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-28T12:35:37Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"85172728-c748-4052-aa1c-f9d02582bb16\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "The economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter and details of a report pointed to sustainable underlying strength.", "dc.description": "The economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter and details of a report pointed to sustainable underlying strength.", "dc.identifier": "85172728-c748-4052-aa1c-f9d02582bb16", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "prism.channel": "fbn", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "Reuters", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Second-quarter Gdp Growth Revised Up To 4.2 Percent", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-09 07:51:07 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "The economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter and details of a report pointed to sustainable underlying strength.", "title": "Second-quarter GDP growth revised up to 4.2 percent | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent/_jcr_content/image.img.png/0/0/1452387069745.png?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.abstract": "The economy rebounded more strongly than initially thought in the second quarter and details of a report pointed to sustainable underlying strength.", "dc.date": "2014-08-28", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Second-quarter GDP growth revised up to 4.2 percent\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent/_jcr_content/image.img.png/0/0/1452387069745.png?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-28T12:35:37Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2014/08/28/second-quarter-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-42-percent.html\",\"post_id\":\"85172728-c748-4052-aa1c-f9d02582bb16\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc274\"", "article_summary": "Economists polled by Reuters had expected the second-quarter GDP growth pace would be revised down to 3.9 percent.\nThe composition of growth in the second quarter was even more encouraging, with the sources of growth broad-based.\nThe relatively smaller inventory build means less stock overhang, which bodes well for third-quarter GDP growth.\nThat saw restocking contributing 1.39 percentage points to GDP growth rather than 1.66 percentage points.\nBusinesses accumulated $83.9 billion worth of inventory in the second quarter, less than the initially reported $93.4 billion."}
