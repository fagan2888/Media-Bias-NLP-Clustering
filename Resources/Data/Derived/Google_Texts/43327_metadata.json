Two weeks after fielding complaints about a political cartoon we published earlier this month depicting the NRA as a bunch of terrorists -- a reference to the San Bernardino jihadists\u2019 easy access to AR-15 semi-automatic rifles -- the Washington Post is taking a beating for a cartoon depicting Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s daughters as organ-grinder monkeys.\n\nRegular readers of this column will know that political cartoons are often a target of criticism because they boil down arguments into images that necessarily lack much nuance or context. They simply hit you over the head. The good ones do, anyway. The misfires often do, too, now that I think about it.\n\nThe Post cartoon in question was one of those misfires. The animated cartoon, by Pulitzer Prize winner Ann Telnaes, put the Republican presidential candidate from Texas in a Santa suit and had him turning a jack-in-the-box-style crank. \u201cTed Cruz uses his kids as political props,\u201c read the caption. The reference was to a campaign video in which Cruz, snuggled on the sofa with his family, reads his young daughters such timeless classics as \u201cHow Obamacare Stole Christmas\u201d and \u201cRudolph the Underemployed Reindeer.\u201d It\u2019s actually funny and pretty well done.\n\nTelnaes seemed to be saying -- and she spelled it out later, in response to criticism -- that if candidates choose to use their children in campaign advertisements or other appearances, they relinquish the kids-are-off-limits protection that the media usually afford them.\n\nAnd one can understand that logic.\n\nThe problem is, Cruz is not the first politician to parade his adorable family in front of cameras. Virtually everyone does it at some point, and there\u2019s a good reason for it: It has a humanizing effect. Americans aren\u2019t just electing a president, they\u2019re electing a leadership package that includes family. Barack Obama has allowed us to glimpse his girls, as has George W. Bush, and Hillary Clinton is doing something similar now in a new ad featuring husband Bill and their new grand baby. It\u2019s part of a campaign called \u201c7 things Hillary Clinton has in common with your abuela.\u201d We won\u2019t hold our breath waiting for the Clintons to take heat over that one.\n\nThe reason the off-limits rule is usually honored -- and should be honored -- is that children are completely without culpability in these matters, and they can\u2019t fight back.\n\nI\u2019m a great believer in fair comment, but I can\u2019t fault the Post for retracting the cartoon. It singles out Cruz for something everyone else gets away with, and does so in an unnecessarily unkind way. Monkeys?\n\nThe ironic side plot here is that Cruz has been one of the most vocal critics of \u201cthe liberal media.\u201d That sorry excuse for a debate in November, hosted ham-handedly by CNBC, provided great fodder. Now we\u2019ve got the Post\u2019s controversial cartoon. Cruz has played this theme expertly, so it\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s closing fast on Donald Trump.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThanks to everyone who purchased (or asked for) a copy of my new book, \u201cThe Bakersfield Sound: How a Generation of Displaced Okies Revolutionized American Music.\u201d I was expecting a good response but nothing like this.\n\nIt\u2019s the No. 1 seller at the Bakersfield Barnes & Noble -- and apparently by a pretty substantial margin. Management tells me it\u2019s outselling the likes of Bill O\u2019Reilly and Stephen King, both of whom have relatively new releases in the local top five, by a margin of roughly 15 to 1 each.\n\nI had a book signing at B&N Wednesday evening. When I walked in 15 minutes before the scheduled 5 p.m. event and saw the line I assumed the baristas at the in-store Starbucks were having trouble with the espresso machine. Nope. B&N is already deep into its fourth shipment of the book.\n\nLast I checked, \u201cThe Bakersfield Sound\u201d was No. 1 on Amazon.com in the country-music genre. It tops even Colin Escott\u2019s new \u201cI Saw the Light,\u201d a repackaged re-release of his excellent Hank Williams biography of 2004. \u201cI Saw the Light\u201d has been made into a major motion picture set for release in March. That\u2019s fast company.\n\n\u201cThe Bakersfield Sound\u201d is also available at The Bakersfield Californian, Russo\u2019s Books, Crystal Palace, Bakersfield Music Hall of Fame, Kern County Museum -- call first because they might be sold out -- as well as Boo Boo Records in San Luis Obispo and the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, or at www.bakersfield.com/TheBakersfieldSound online.\n\nThank you to everyone for the incredibly generous and warm reception. I'm bracing for the post-Christmas reviews. And accepting pitches for the screenplay version.\n\nExecutive Editor Robert Price and The Californian welcome your comments and suggestions.
