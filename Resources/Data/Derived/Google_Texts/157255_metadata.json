Tom Matsuda, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s implementation manager in the governor\u2019s office, will take over as interim director.\n\nMs. Andrews alluded to some of the problems the exchange has faced in a statement on Friday, but she did not explain why she was stepping away.\n\n\u201cThis has been one of the most challenging but fulfilling roles that I\u2019ve had in all my years in health care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Hawaii Health Connector has been my baby. It has required constant nurturing and attention. Although in many ways it is still growing and changing, the Connector has reached a point where I now need to let go and let someone else take charge.\u201d\n\nFrom its outset, Hawaii\u2019s exchange has faced many of the same problems that have plagued the federal health care website and other state exchanges around the country.\n\nThough the Hawaii Health Exchange website was supposed to be open on Oct. 1, software problems kept the site dark until Oct. 15. Ms Andrews publicly apologized for the delay last month.\n\nAs of Nov. 15, only 257 people had enrolled in health care programs through the state exchange.\n\nAnnouncing the resignation, Sherry Menor-McNamara, chair of the exchange\u2019s board, said Ms. Andrews had been \u201cthe driving force behind the Hawaii Health Connector.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder her leadership, she took a concept and created a tangible product with a very compressed time period,\u201d Ms. Menor-McNamara said in a statement. \u201cDespite the inherent challenges of building a very complex system, Coral always reminded us why we were doing this. She was a tireless advocate determined to give the uninsured in Hawaii access to health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131122182100, "BN": "affordable-care-act", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 22, 2013", "keywords": "Exchanges", "GBLC": "Exchanges", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Ian Lovett", "SCG": "affordable-care-act", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Ian Lovett", "byl": "Ian Lovett", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/11/22/head-of-hawaii-insurance-exchange-steps-down/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "In a statement, the departing director, Coral Andrews, alluded to some of the problems the Hawaii exchange has faced but did not explain why she was stepping away.", "card": "summary", "title": "Head of Hawaii Insurance Exchange Steps Down"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/affordable-care-act/post", "description": "In a statement, the departing director, Coral Andrews, alluded to some of the problems the Hawaii exchange has faced but did not explain why she was stepping away.", "CG": "U.S.", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 22, 2013", "article": {"section": "U.S.", "tag": "Exchanges", "published_time": 1385162460, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2013-11-22T23:21:00-05:00"}, "utime": 20131122232100, "PUD": 20131122, "pdate": 20131122, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "In Practice", "description": "In a statement, the departing director, Coral Andrews, alluded to some of the problems the Hawaii exchange has faced but did not explain why she was stepping away.", "title": "Head of Hawaii Insurance Exchange Steps Down", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/news/affordable-care-act/2013/11/22/head-of-hawaii-insurance-exchange-steps-down/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v3/../../packages/images/nytdesign/2013/national/inPractice/inPractice-75.png", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Head of Hawaii Insurance Exchange Steps Down", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "The executive director of Hawaii\u2019s state health care exchange announced her resignation on Friday amid delays in getting the insurance marketplace off the ground.\nThough the Hawaii Health Exchange website was supposed to be open on Oct. 1, software problems kept the site dark until Oct. 15.\n\u201cThe Hawaii Health Connector has been my baby.\nAs of Nov. 15, only 257 people had enrolled in health care programs through the state exchange.\nThe director, Coral Andrews, who has led Hawaii Health Connector for two years as the state worked to build the exchange, will step down on Dec. 6."}
