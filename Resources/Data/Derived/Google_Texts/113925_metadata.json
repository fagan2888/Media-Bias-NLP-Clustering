A Nike spokesman confirmed the departure.\n\nChief Operating Officer Eric Sprunk will lead Nike\u2019s technology organization while the company searches for a replacement, according to an internal memo reviewed by CIO Journal. \u201cThe Tech vision and strategy will be essential to developing and supporting global business needs in many areas,\u201d Mr. Sprunk said in the memo. \u201cOur commitment to creating this infrastructure remains steadfast, and we will continue to invest in our IT teams and business.\u201d\n\nThe London-born Mr. Watson joined Nike in April 2014 after more than four years at Barclays PLC, where he most recently worked as CIO of Europe, Middle East & Global Operations. Prior to Barclays, he was senior vice president and global head of technology services for Wells Fargo & Co. He also has held senior roles at Citigroup Inc., Unisys Corp., Microsoft Corp. and First-e Bancorp.\n\nAt Nike, Mr. Watson worked on a vision and five-year strategy to reset technology as a critical platform for growth, the memo said. Nike struck a deal with Juniper Networks in August to co-create a new, scalable data center cloud and retail network infrastructure. CIO Journal wrote that Nike would use Juniper\u2019s products, including software-defined networking, to serve as the foundation for virtualizing multiple Nike data centers around the world.\n\nIn October, the Financial Times named Mr. Watson the world\u2019s fourth most influential LGBT leader. Fortune Magazine listed him as number 19 on this year\u2019s 40 under 40 list noting, among other things, his 19 iPads and Tom Ford bespoke suits.\n\nUpdate: Mr. Watson announced his departure via Twitter on Wednesday evening.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Chief Operating Officer Eric Sprunk will lead Nike\u2019s technology organization while the company looks for a replacement.", "title": "Nike CIO Anthony Watson Leaves Company, Citing Personal Reasons", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/10/nike-cio-anthony-watson-leaves-company-citing-personal-reasons/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Nike CIO Anthony Watson Leaves Company, Citing Personal Reasons", "description": "Chief Operating Officer Eric Sprunk will lead Nike\u2019s technology organization while the company looks for a replacement.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Steven Norton", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CIO Journal.
