If Secretary of State John Kerry was ‘very angry’ after Iran released footage of the 10 U.S. sailors who were captured last month, he’s going to be outraged if the Islamic Republic publicizes even more images, which the country has promised are “100 times more embarrass[ing].”

A day after receiving an award from Iran’s supreme leader for detaining the American sailors, Sardar Fadavi, head of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy,addressed Iranian lawmakers about the incident, telling them his personnel had collected information from the sailors’ laptops and cell phones that had not yet been released, in addition to more footage.

This information would be released, he said, if the United States ever sought to humiliate Iran.

“If U.S. officials say they are angry with and frustrated by the footage released, they would be 100 times more embarrassed if the IRGC releases other films of the capture, the Iranian commander said,” Tasnim, the state-owned news agency reported.

“Iran does not seek to humiliate any nation, he said, but stressed that if they want to humiliate Iran, the IRGC would publish the footage and make them even more embarrassed and humiliated,” it continued.

Iranian lawmakers praised Fadavi and his personnel for their “timely and calculated action” against the U.S. sailors, or what parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani called, the “intruding pirates.”
