The site also requires users to register and provide basic personal information in order compare specific plans that would apply.\n\n\n\nThe database includes rates for the five carriers selling plans to Illinois residents via the exchange: Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Illinois in Chicago; Land of Lincoln Health Inc. Co-op, also in Chicago; Louisville, Ky.-based Humana Inc., Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna Inc. and Health Alliance, an arm of Springfield-based Carle Foundation.\n\nIt details rates in the five levels of coverage, called platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic plans. The categories reflect the percentage of expected health care costs, or actuarial value, covered by each health plan. Under the Affordable Care Act, bronze plans cover, 60 percent of actuarial value; silver plans, 70 percent; gold plans, 80 percent; and platinum plans, 90 percent.\n\nThe database allows a user to find rates for plans of various household sizes and of varying ages. It does not include other details about the plans, such as deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or provider networks, though this information is available for comparison purposes on the exchange itself.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Andrew L.
