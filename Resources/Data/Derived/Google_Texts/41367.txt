Complying with a court order, Long Island College Hospital and the city's Fire Department agreed to start receiving ambulances at LICH at 3 p.m. on Friday.

The hospital and the state Department of Health had put LICH on ambulance diversion status more than two months ago as part of efforts by SUNY Downstate to close the hospital. The next court date in the battle over keeping the hospital open will be September 11. At that time the court will hear a request from Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and community groups to join the case seeking to restore LICH as a full service acute care facility and to find a new operator.

Colleen Demarest, the state Supreme Court judge who ordered the ambulance runs to be reinstated has also demanded that by Sept. 20, LICH provide the court with an accounting of how it has spent a $149 million bequest it received in 1998, the Othmer Endowment Fund. At issue is doctors' claims that SUNY's quest to close the hospital is based solely on its desire to sell its real estate for residential development, and that the hospital is needed and financially viable.

A second Brooklyn hospital matter is also being heard on Sept. 11, when a bankruptcy court will again convene to hear matters related to Interfaith Medical Center's closing.
