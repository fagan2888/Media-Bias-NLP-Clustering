One family is not spending their Thanksgiving the way they had planned.

Ocean Villa condos has been without power since Monday. Ocean Villas condo owner Jae Fishbein is getting creative this Thanksgiving.

She and her boyfriend set up camp stoves after she came home Monday night to find the power out.

"Electricity is not overrated by far when I realized it was out for good I was scrambling for flashlights and I do have some camping equipment, so I was pulling out lanterns and things like that, but it did make a lot of things difficult," said Ocean Villa Condo Owner Jae Fishbein.

Fishbein is one of twelve full-time residents living at Ocean Villas and was not informed of the outage, until she saw this notice posted outside the building.

And for accommodations, they say not a whole lot has been done. "Not very well at all that's my opinion you know they offered an extension cord," said Ocean Villas visitor Ronnie Scott.

"But there wasn't really any offering of anything it was just an explanation of what was going on," said Fishbein.

The notice said the outage was from a break in the main bus duct, which feeds power to all units.

"You know I do live here, but there are people here spending their time and their money to come stay here and vacation, I kind of feel worse for them than I do for myself," said Fishbein.

For short-term renters, the notice suggests asking individual unit owners for alternative lodging accommodations. Fishbein said despite the outage, they're still making the most of this Thanksgiving.

"It's not that difficult to cope with it because I do have my daughter here and that makes things a lot better," said Fishbein.

One hundred and twenty-five units have been affected by the outage. The power will not be back on until a part is made and then installed .

Management expects they'll have the power back up and running on December 4.
