But co-host Bill Hemmer was so biased, he might as well have been wearing a \"VOTE GOP\" t-shirt.\n\nIt was bad enough that conservative Lar Larson was alotted the first and last words. But he also had plenty of uninterrupted time to give a negative review of President Obama\u2019s past record. Larson's first round of attacks on Obama was:\n\nHe seems to be at the center of a lot of the corruption and ineptitude of government. ObamaCare, of course, leading the list right there. So, if the recession ended in June of the year that the president took office, now almost five years ago, and the improvements for people who lost their jobs have not been coming very fast and the president works on everything except that problem \u2013 you know, he keeps inventing new regulations that help destroy jobs in America, he makes energy more expensive, he shuts down the coal industry, he refuses to sign the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 all of those things could help Americans in a practical way and he\u2019s off worried about income inequality that his own polls tell him doesn\u2019t really matter.\n\nCo-host Hemmer responded warmly, saying, \u201cYou give Dan (Gerstein, a Democrat) a lot to think about.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host Alisyn Camerota said Obama \u201ccould argue he\u2019s won legislative victories and he thinks he\u2019s still fighting for some respect,\u201d Larson responded:\n\nThe thing is, he really hasn\u2019t, though. Think about what the job of the federal government is: guard national security. Are we safer today than we were when he took over? No, take a look at Iran, take a look at the Middle East, take a look at Syria, take a look at Egypt, take a look at our relationship with Russia. So as a coach, I think President Obama would have long ago been fired for his performance. His performance is poor. And if you think about it, the only reason the unemployment numbers are low is so many people have looked at the economy and said, \u201cI give up.\u201d\n\nGerstein is hardly a flaming liberal. He\u2019s a former advisor and spokesman for Joe Lieberman. And Gerstein announced at the beginning, \u201cListen, I\u2019m no apologist for the president. I\u2019ve been deeply disappointed in him.\u201d But when asked to respond to Larson, Gerstein said:\n\nLars\u2019 distorted perspective is exactly why Washington is held in such low regard. \u2026All he\u2019s saying is, \u201cthe president,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s all the president\u2019s fault.\u201d It\u2019s one side, it\u2019s one side. I\u2019ll be the first to admit the president has been timid and weak on the economy. He\u2019s not shown the leadership I would have liked to see. But there has been a congress obstructing him every step of the way. We have gridlock, we have dysfunction\u2026\n\nOops, no blaming the Republicans allowed! Hemmer broke in to say scornfully: \u201cDan, move it\u2026 understood, I got it. Move forward, though, OK? What does this portend for Democrats trying to win office in November? Make it quick and Lars will get a response here.\n\nGerstein changed the subject as directed. He predicted a \"status quo\" election because of disgust with both parties. Hemmer interrupted again, this time to prod Larson for a GOP-friendlier prediction: \u201cIf the drag on the economy and the numbers continue, Lars, what is the down ballot effect for Democrats?\u201d\n\nSure enough, Larson said the Democrats will \u201close a lot of seats and I think that\u2019s appropriate.\u201d Then he quickly moved off-topic by bashing President Obama again, this time on energy. That is, if knocking President Obama could ever be considered \u201coff topic\u201d on Fox.\n\nGerstein asked if he could respond and was told, \u201cmake it quick, we\u2019re out of time,\u201d by a curt Hemmer. Gerstein noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve had the most productive energy production under President Obama than we\u2019ve had with any president in modern history.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cfair and balanced\u201d Hemmer interrupted \u2013 and just happened to make sure the segment ended on an anti-Obama note: \u201cAnd many would say, 'Do more because it leads to jobs.' We\u2019ll pick it up next time.\u201d\n\nSure you will, Bill. With just the same kind of objectiveness you\u2019ve shown here, I\u2019ll bet.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "E/KavO1k1LFw7hmUf1lR1QX8LvSAwlBZBSCNQXlJXIw=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/could_fox_s_objective_news_host_bill_hemmer_be_any_more_biased_01202014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Could Fox\u2019s \u2018Objective News\u2019 Host Bill Hemmer Be Any More Biased?"}, "Title": "Could Fox\u2019s \u2018Objective News\u2019 Host Bill Hemmer Be Any More Biased?"}, "article_summary": "So as a coach, I think President Obama would have long ago been fired for his performance.\nOn today\u2019s \u201cobjective news\u201d show, America\u2019s News HQ, co-host Bill Hemmer made the \u201cfair and balanced\u201d rules very clear: no talk of obstructionist Republicans allowed; criticize President Obama all you want.\nBut co-host Bill Hemmer was so biased, he might as well have been wearing a \"VOTE GOP\" t-shirt.\nThat is, if knocking President Obama could ever be considered \u201coff topic\u201d on Fox.\nI\u2019ve been deeply disappointed in him.\u201d But when asked to respond to Larson, Gerstein said:Lars\u2019 distorted perspective is exactly why Washington is held in such low regard."}
