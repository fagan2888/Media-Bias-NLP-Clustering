Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), one of Congress\u2019 less-conservative Republican members, could hardly contain his frustrations with the prevailing political winds on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cWeek one, we had a Speaker election that did not go as well as a lot of us would have liked,\u201d Dent told reporters . \u201cWeek two, we got into a big fight over deporting children, something that a lot of us didn\u2019t want to have a discussion about. Week three, we are now talking about rape and incest and reportable rapes and incest for minors\u2026 I just can\u2019t wait for week four.\u201d\n\nA few months later, however, Congress has managed to put one foot after another, and everyone involved is suddenly patting themselves on the back. The Washington Post noted this week:\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of self-congratulating going around Capitol Hill these days \u2013 members of Congress are, in not-so-insignificant ways, doing their jobs. And while we realize that for most working Americans that wouldn\u2019t be particularly noteworthy, for the Congress we\u2019ve come to know in the last several years, actual legislating is cause for great celebration.\n\nColby Itkowitz flagged a series of headlines from news outlets, impressed with congressional activity. \u201cGlimmers of Hope on the Hill,\u201d one read . \u201cBipartisanship breaks out on Capitol Hill \u2013 at least for now,\u201d said another\n\nAssorted partisans are getting in on the new Beltway fun. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), boasted this week, \u201cI\u2019ve actually been somewhat surprised and more optimistic than I have been in a long time about how the Senate is beginning to work again.\u201d\n\nKarl Rove added yesterday, \u201cCongress is finally back on track.\u201d\n\nThere are a couple of reasons to explain this suddenly popular thesis \u2013 and several more reasons to be deeply skeptical of it.\n\nPart of the issue here is the soft bigotry of low expectations. The 112th Congress, covering 2011 and 2012, was arguably the worst in American history, struggling to complete even routine tasks, and claiming the dubious honor of being the least productive of any Congress since clerks started keeping track nearly a century ago. The 113th Congress, covering 2013 and 2014, was nearly as atrocious.\n\nWith this recent history in mind, when the Beltway and political journalists witness lawmakers striking a bipartisan deal on the \u201cdoc fix,\u201d for example, they\u2019re not just pleasantly surprised \u2013 they\u2019re genuinely thrilled to see something constructive happen for a change. The pent up demand for basic legislating is so great, the significance of routine work is easily exaggerated as a remarkable breakthrough for good governance.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Republican partisans have a built-in incentive to overstate Congress\u2019 record: they\u2019re in charge of both chambers for the first time in nearly a decade. When a GOP insider says Congress \u201cis finally back on track,\u201d the message comes up with a not-so-subtle subtext: \u201cThings stunk when there was a Senate Democratic majority, so Leave Republicans in charge indefinitely.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s take a breath. The work on the \u201cdoc fix\u201d was arguably the first legitimate example of Congress passing an important bill smoothly and efficiently since 2010, but one law does not a Congress make.\n\nRoughly 100 days into the new Congress, this is still an institution that prioritized an oil pipeline worth about 35 permanent jobs . It\u2019s also eagerly pushing a massive tax break that will exclusively benefit multi-millionaires and billionaires\n\nThis Congress voted for the umpteenth time to repeal the Affordable Care Act for no reason; this Congress struggled for months to work on an anti-human-trafficking bill that had no opponents; this Congress subjected Loretta Lynch to delays that no one could explain or defend.\n\nThis Congress nearly tore itself apart over Homeland Security funding ; this Congress has picked wildly unnecessary culture-war fights that are going nowhere; and this Congress passed a demonstrably ridiculous budget plan that sets the stage for ugly, partisan fights for the rest of the year.\n\nTwo months into the new Congress, two members had already resigned in disgrace.\n\nReflecting on Congress in February, Eugene Robinson said of the Republican majority, \u201cIf the party\u2019s aim is to show Americans it is ready to govern, we are witnessing an epic fail.\u201d\n\nI hate to spoil everyone\u2019s fun, but the \u201cglimmers of hope\u201d on Capitol Hill are probably a mirage.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Much of the Beltway media and Republican establishment wants the public to feel good about Congress again.
