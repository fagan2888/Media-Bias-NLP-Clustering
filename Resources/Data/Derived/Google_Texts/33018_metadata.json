George W. Bush ran the Texas Rangers. Barack Obama\u2019s hoop dreams petered out as a reserve player on his Hawaii high school team. And yet no modern president\u2014not Ford with football nor Bush with baseball\u2014is as identified with a sport as Obama is with basketball.\n\nIn his new book, The Audacity of Hoop, longtime Sports Illustrated writer Alexander Wolff explores the role basketball has played not only in Obama\u2019s life, but also in Obama\u2019s America. I recently spoke with Wolff about the president and the sport and asked him, among other things, why Obama doesn\u2019t wear shorts when he plays, and whether a Republican president would put more emphasis on football. A lightly edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nJZ: When did you first notice that basketball was something important to Obama?\n\nAW: I didn\u2019t know until the 2008 presidential campaign, until he really started to showcase it. In New Hampshire he played with firefighters and policemen and these small groups. I think it was a conscious decision to get him in unconventional settings. And whether that was a decision that was made because they wanted to emphasize his youth and vigor, or just a generational thing, I don\u2019t know.\n\nHow much did his race play into viewing him through the prism of basketball then? If it had been John Edwards playing those pickup games, do you think it would have been viewed differently?\n\n[His campaign] wanted to make sure he was established on another level, on a policy level, before they introduced basketball. In some ways it was a twist on that whole Bill Bradley dilemma. You\u2019ll remember that Bradley ran away from basketball, he wouldn\u2019t even play with his campaign staff, because he was so concerned about being regarded as the ex-jock. Obama didn\u2019t care if people judged it as something traditionally African-American or not. It\u2019s what he really wanted to do, especially during these long days on the campaign trail. I think about him running with the University of North Carolina varsity during the campaign. That was a kind of Clinton-playing-the-saxophone-on-Arsenio-Hall moment for Obama. There was a recognition that, \u201cOkay, this is not John McCain. This is a younger, more vigorous, generationally-in-synch-with-me kind of person.\u201d\n\nWhen Obama played with UNC, it was right before the North Carolina Democratic primary, and he was trying to beat Hillary Clinton. That was a route she obviously couldn\u2019t take. Do you think there was a gender dynamic at play as well?\n\nOn some level it underscored the difference with Hillary, but I wonder if that was so carefully calculated. There were, however, a number of gender-related missteps having to do with basketball once he was president. Certainly when he started filling out the bracket for ESPN that first year, he didn\u2019t do the women\u2019s draw and he took a lot of heat for it. There was a bit of a reflexive boys\u2019-club thing going on. Which is ironic, because there were a lot of women in his administration with basketball backgrounds. Samantha Power was a real ball player in high school and loves sports. Obviously Susan Rice was a really accomplished basketball player. Mary Jo White apparently was an outstanding five-foot-one, really feisty player. It seems as if he\u2019d wanted to bring some women into that circle through basketball\u2014he could have, and he didn\u2019t.\n\nIf you look at the current Republican presidential field, it\u2019s more football-oriented. Rubio and Jeb talk about their fantasy teams, Christie shows up in Jerry Jones\u2019s box. Do you think there\u2019s a partisan split to sports that these guys reflect? That Democrats like basketball and Republicans like football?\n\nGenerally the Democratic Party is kind of like the game of basketball: It\u2019s untidy and there\u2019s a lot of turnovers. And the Republican Party is like football: It\u2019s very regimented and the kingmakers crown who the next nominee is going to be, and you wait your turn and it\u2019s top-down. Now, that got scrambled somewhat by digital media and some other factors, but I think it pertains for the most part to the last 30 or 40 years.\n\nBasketball has had a little more of a liberal or diverse profile than football, whose great centers of interest are in the Southeast and Texas, which are very Republican and have become even more so. Still, in the last couple years, filling out an NCAA tournament bracket has become all the rage on the right. There was all this sniping about it early, that Obama was shirking his duties and all that. But the last couple years, you\u2019ve had Paul Ryan getting on the bandwagon with the Badgers, and Marco Rubio filling out a bracket that had Florida winning, and Chris Christie showing up at the Big East Tournament.\n\nOne of the great ironies is that in 2012, Obama\u2019s going against Mitt Romney, and everybody, in the spirit of equal time, runs to Romney and asks Romney for his bracket, and he shrugs his shoulders and fesses up that he wasn't really following it. And then last year Romney did fill out a bracket, and he finished in the 99th percentile. So I guess timing is everything in politics, and poor Mitt Romney didn\u2019t have the timing.\n\nYou write about this new generation of basketball stars who are politically engaged, whereas past stars weren\u2019t. There\u2019s that possibly apocryphal remark Michael Jordan made about why he wouldn\u2019t support a Democrat running against Jesse Helms, saying, \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too.\u201d Obviously, LeBron James is not afraid of offending Republicans or anybody else with some of his political statements. But do you think LeBron would be doing the political stuff if Obama weren\u2019t president?\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny you ask that question, because I was just turning over in my head yesterday\u2014is it a cause-and-effect thing? Obama\u2019s elected, therefore these players suddenly get politicized? I think it was a two-step process. I think Obama runs for president; he\u2019s so identified with basketball, he has this standard of cool that he\u2019s setting, and NBA players will glom on to anything that\u2019s cool and trendy; and they glom on to him.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s a second order of fact: He is elected; he has these things he\u2019s trying to accomplish; there\u2019s this generational change\u2014it\u2019s become more acceptable to care about philanthropic things than it was back in the Jerry Maguire \u201cShow Me the Money\u201d days, in which Michael operated. So it was actually that process: \u201cOkay, we rode this horse, he became president, now what do we do?\u201d There was this weird, almost call-and-response thing going on between the White House and the NBA locker room, in which Obama said, \u201cOkay, I need more signups during this critical period for the Affordable Care Act, the signup period happens to fall during the NBA season. Let me get Alonzo [Mourning] on the phone. Let me get Magic on the phone. Let me get Kobe to Tweet out this is where people should go to sign up.\u201d Or Obama rips the Arizona immigration legislation, and lo and behold the Suns wear \u201cLos Suns\u201d jerseys on Cinco de Mayo.\n\nThere\u2019s this valence of stuff that both parties, the White House and the NBA locker room, are aware of. A lot of them golf with him a whole lot. They brought in all those NBA stars for his 49th birthday party. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s coordination, but they\u2019re interacting. I think they kind of rode into town together on it, NBA players and Barack Obama.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that golf has now replaced basketball as Obama\u2019s favorite recreational activity, but at the same time he\u2019s playing golf with basketball guys: Alonzo Mourning, Ray Allen, Steph Curry, and Dell Curry. Is it at all telling that he plays golf with basketball players?\n\nYeah. And if it weren\u2019t basketball players, it seems as if he\u2019s almost defiantly not playing with Vernon Jordan, the classic Bill Clinton golfing partner, the Washington insider, because everyone\u2019s saying he should, that doing so will improve the tone in Washington. What\u2019s the phrase? He has no more fucks left to give about whatever people have been saying. That\u2019s certainly been true these last couple years of his second term.\n\nHe\u2019s the president, so if he does anything, it\u2019s going to be in this very hermetic environment. Here\u2019s a guy who grew up in Hawaii, and he\u2019s now essentially confined to a limo or the residence or the Oval Office or Air Force One. There\u2019s a bubble, and golf is a chance to get outside it. He can\u2019t really play basketball outside of it. He did play on the Vineyard a few times early in his presidency, and obviously on the outdoor White House court, but he can\u2019t leave the bubble playing basketball outside.\n\nI think golf also feeds his competitive instinct, because he isn\u2019t real good at it. I think the self-improvement part of him likes it. He\u2019s seen his basketball skills deteriorate, and he has commented on that. I think he still sees room for improvement in his golf game, and that makes sense. He\u2019s a pretty competitive guy. One of the things that surprised me the most is just how much of a trash-talker he is. Michelle Obama told [Sports Illustrated writer] Scott Price that when they would play Scrabble with Barack\u2019s mother, she was a trash-talker. In Scrabble games! That starts to begin to explain it, although to hear that his mother, who\u2019s the daughter of people from Kansas, who became an academic, was a trash-talker, even at Scrabble, that\u2019s not what you would expect. You\u2019d expect he would have picked that up somewhere else.\n\nYou look at Obama on the basketball court in his gray shirt and black sweatpants\u2014what you hilariously describe as the \u201cpolice-academy-trainee look\u201d\u2014and then you look at his game, which you liken to Lenny Wilkens\u2019, and the way he plays basketball is not cool. But then there\u2019s this hyper-competitive and trash-talking side of him, both on the court and then also in the political arena, saying he wants the ball for the last shot and comparing himself to LeBron. Do you think that\u2019s what NBA guys identify with?\n\nYeah, I think there\u2019s something there. The only real naysaying of his game came from David Stern, who said he\u2019s really not that good. And Barack Obama himself admits he can\u2019t really go to his right, he never developed a right hand. Part of it was maybe not having his dad take him in the driveway when he was growing up.\n\nBut if you listen to Ernie Grunfeld, Magic Johnson, real NBA people will look at the glass half full about his game, and he\u2019s self-taught, he\u2019s not classically trained. And look at that picture from the North Carolina scrimmage: He\u2019s in the lane, hanging with Tyler Hansbrough coming over at him. And even though he\u2019ll only get into the lane with one move, it\u2019s a fake right and dribble left move, he\u2019s in the lane mixing it up.\n\nSo no, he\u2019s not going to throw down a dunk, but there\u2019s something\u2014you know, cool is such an ineffable thing. It\u2019s your posture, how you carry yourself. All the descriptions of him as a pickup player describe a cool head. He was the guy who, back at Harvard Law School, would defuse arguments on the court. You can imagine him saying \u201cmy bad\u201d and patting someone on the butt, just being slightly above it all and not being a hothead. And if you think of the coolest NBA players going back to Clyde Frazier, that was their thing. They were cultivating their persona even as they were playing the game. I think if anybody recognizes that in a player, NBA players do.\n\nThere\u2019s your game, and then there\u2019s this parallel thing, which is your reputation that you\u2019re cultivating, you\u2019re taking care of, you\u2019re protecting. And if you go back to Obama\u2019s memoir, Dreams from My Father, he talks really explicitly and pretty insightfully about how it was on the basketball court that he learned you didn\u2019t show people parts of yourself you didn\u2019t want them to see. And that brings me to another thing that is really revealing. We talked earlier a little bit about Bill Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio. The thing about Clinton was, he wasn\u2019t cool. He was asked the question boxers versus briefs, and he answered the damn thing. He was going to tell you anything. And when Obama was asked the same question\u2014and I\u2019m sure he rehearsed the answer\u2014but the old pickup-basketball player in him said, I don\u2019t answer those humiliating questions, but whatever it is, I look good in them! A guy who would say something like that, you don\u2019t even need to see him play basketball to know that he can play basketball. That just gets it. Whereas Clinton would go out wearing those short shorts when he went jogging, those things that Nolan Richardson famously said of, \u201cWe gotta get you out of those Marilyn Monroes.\u201d\n\nI never heard that.\n\nWhen Arkansas won the national championship and visited the White House, Richardson gave Clinton a pair of those classic baggy Razorback shorts, the down-below-the-knee model. They usually give the president a jersey, but in this case they gave him the shorts, and Richardson said, \u201cWe gotta get you out of those Marilyn Monroes.\u201d No one would ever have to tell Barack that. In fact, the sweatpants pretty much give the game up. Rick Telander had this great throwaway line in one of his columns way back about it. He said you notice the sweatpants. What\u2019s up with that? It\u2019s gotta be his bird legs. He\u2019s really self-conscious about his bird legs. The only picture I\u2019ve ever seen of him in shorts playing basketball, it\u2019s in the book, he\u2019s playing on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in August, and it must have been a really hot day. And I think that goes back to the whole growing up in Hawaii and kind of learning how to protect your reputation on the basketball court.\n\nAfter George W. Bush left office, people thought maybe he should be baseball commissioner. Where do you see Obama and basketball going once his presidency is over?\n\nI would be really surprised if he made basketball the centerpiece of anything he did. I just think his ambitions\u2014he\u2019s such a serious person\u2014and I think his ambitions are going to take him to things like the My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative and things that are much more serious. Now, will basketball be part of his idiom? I think it will be. I think he\u2019s seen the game again and again. Whether he\u2019s trying to bond with somebody from another country or trying to establish a rapport with someone here, he\u2019s called on the game again and again, and it\u2019s worked pretty successfully for him. So I think if anything, it will be part of his vocabulary, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be a centerpiece.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The secrets and symbolics of the president\u2019s obsession with basketball are finally revealed", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 Cond\u00e9 Nast 2016", "author": "Jason Zengerle", "og": {"site_name": "GQ", "description": "The secrets and symbolics of the president\u2019s obsession with basketball are finally revealed", "title": "Why Won't Obama\u00a0Wear Shorts on the Basketball\u00a0Court?", "url": "http://www.gq.com/story/why-obama-wont-wear-basketball-shorts", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/564df526c5e56a9a71bb2441/16:9/pass/obama-ball-is-life.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "gq.com", "description": "The secrets and symbolics of the president\u2019s obsession with basketball are finally revealed", "title": "Why Won't Obama\u00a0Wear Shorts on the Basketball\u00a0Court?", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/564df526c5e56a9a71bb2441/16:9/pass/obama-ball-is-life.jpg", "site": "@GQMagazine", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 108943, "app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "Barack Obama,Alexander Wolff", "article": {"section": "News & Culture", "published_time": "2015-11-19T16:35:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T20:33:03.374Z"}, "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,Alexander Wolff"}, "article_summary": "Where do you see Obama and basketball going once his presidency is over?\nDo you think there\u2019s a partisan split to sports that these guys reflect?\nAnd yet no modern president\u2014not Ford with football nor Bush with baseball\u2014is as identified with a sport as Obama is with basketball.\nThere was a bit of a reflexive boys\u2019-club thing going on.\nGenerally the Democratic Party is kind of like the game of basketball: It\u2019s untidy and there\u2019s a lot of turnovers."}
