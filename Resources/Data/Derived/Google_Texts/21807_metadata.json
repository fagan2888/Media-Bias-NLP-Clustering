About 250 people attended the event, which marked the group\u2019s second annual event on the topic.\n\nTakeaways included:\n\n\u2022 Industry continues to be the biggest driver when it comes to things communicating with other things, mainly because big manufacturing companies have a lot of machines and can quickly reap savings from increased efficiency and productivity.\n\n\u2022 Connected cars remain a hotbed of innovation, though one Ford executive suggested driverless cars may be farther off than some eager tech buffs suggest.\n\n\u2022 Healthtech innovation continues to be driven by health-care policy changes that aim to achieve better care at lower cost, and it is quickly taking us to a point where our health will be monitored constantly.\n\n\u2022 The urban landscape continues to get smarter, thanks to, among other things, GPS tracking of snowplows and cars sharing real-time traffic data.\n\n\u2022 Standards are a growing concern, as different companies \u2014 and different countries \u2014 adopt different technologies. This means there\u2019s money to be made in translating one machine\u2019s language to another machine\u2019s language.\n\nMore details follow.\n\nCars\n\nMike Tinskey, Ford\u2019s director of global vehicle electrification and infrastructure, said driverless cars are in the pipeline, but he dampened the enthusiasm of fellow tech geeks who think they\u2019ll be here soon. He said driver-assist technologies, like smart cruise control that eases the throttle when approaching a slower vehicle, will continue to develop. But he said self-driving cars \u201care a long way off.\u201d\n\nKate-MeLynda Migon, sales director for Gemalto M2M, said connectivity in cars will keep developing as they network with other household devices and learn more about you. Once a car knows you stop for coffee every day, it will anticipate that.\n\n\u201cEventually the car will pre-order that latte and pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll just pick it up.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Migon said, \u201cwhen you drove past the grocery on the way home, you\u2019re car will tell you what you\u2019re missing from the fridge.\u201d\n\nAlso, Tinskey said, Ford electric vehicles \u201ccoach\u201d drivers in real time, typically improving fuel economy by 11 percent in the first three months of ownership.\n\nHealth and wearables\n\nMuch talk in this sector is about wearable devices and sensors, but the real value is in building the software that will run and understand those sensors.\n\n\u201cThe ability to get real-time, continuous physical measurement from patients who want to stay healthy, or health care providers who want to keep people out of the hospital, is quickly evolving,\u201d said Gary Conkright, CEO and Founder of physIQ. \u201cThe by-product of that will be a tsunami of data.\u201d\n\nDrew Palin, chief medical innovation officer of Preventice, said the \u201csensors will become commodities over time,\u201d like computer chips now, and analytics will be the competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cFor every patient we monitor for a month, we collect one gigabyte of data,\u201d Palin said. \u201cThere is no way doctors can look at all that. You\u2019re going to need sophisticated analysis to distill this data into what is meaningful.\u201d\n\nPanelists said health-care policy changes are creating pressure to improve care while showing cost savings. They said health-care providers are increasingly paid for results rather than for every procedure they perform. Although some in Congress are pushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Conkright said he expects recent trends to continue.\n\n\u201cThat train has left the station,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there is one thing we can all agree on, it\u2019s that we were on an unsustainable path with regards to rising health care costs. Regardless of what happens (with the new Congress), I don\u2019t see that changing.\u201d\n\nPalin drew chuckles when he said he sees a day when wearables are connected not just to smart phones but to other smart devices in the home.\n\n\u201cWhen you walk in, your TV will come on and say: \u2018Good job, Drew. You got some exercise today. I\u2019m going to open the freezer so you can have a fudge bar.\u2019\u201d\n\nSecurity and privacy\n\nBrandon Jung, Google\u2019s Americas head of Cloud Platform Partners for Business, said users simply click privacy agreements without reading them so it\u2019s up to companies to do the right thing. At Google, he said, that means being as transparent as possible.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reputation risk if we do privacy poorly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we screw it up at all, we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nMichel Maeso, Ayla Networks\u2019 vice president for global sales and service, said standards for privacy are emerging and that they change depending on the age of the person you are talking to. He said younger people are much more comfortable sharing data that is valuable to retailers.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re learning where those edges are, where it\u2019s not cool,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go through this grand experiment as more devices come online.\u201d\n\nBrenna Berman, the City of Chicago\u2019s chief information officer, said the city wrestles with the question often. The city shares administrative data on its Data Portal, and Berman said officials are often urged to monetize that information by selling it to businesses.\n\n\u201cWho owns that data?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe feel the people own that data.\u201d\n\nHomes\n\nHouses are getting smarter, but adoption comes slowly as people are reluctant to make changes. Most customers won\u2019t switch to, say, a smart thermostat simply to save a few dollars, said Mohammad Shahidehpour, director of the Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at the Illinois Institute of Technology.\n\n\u201cSurveys show that you have to present a better picture than just saving money,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to know that, when they are using a smart appliance, they are saving the environment.\u201d\n\nIvan Sheldon, director of Here (formerly Navteq), said the key to consumer adoption is ease of use.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "A day of Internet of Things: Smart cars, health care, data security", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Blue Sky", "author": "Blue Sky", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Several panels of experts tackled everything from cars that will order your morning coffee to houses that will greet you as you walk in the door \u2014 offering congratulations for that extra bit of exercise you squeezed in at lunch.", "title": "A day of Internet of Things: Smart cars, health care, data security", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/chi-iot-illinois-technology-association-bsi-20141121-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-546f875e/turbine/chi-iot-illinois-technology-association-bsi-20141121", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp07.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Internet of Things, Illinois Technology Association, Mike Tinksey, Ford, Gary Conkright, physIQ, Affordable Care Act, Brandon Jung, Google, Brenna Berman", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82050487", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-11-21", "Description": "Connected cars, data security and health care were among topics at the Illinois Technology Association's event that focused on the Internet of Things.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Internet of Things, Illinois Technology Association, Mike Tinksey, Ford, Gary Conkright, physIQ, Affordable Care Act, Brandon Jung, Google, Brenna Berman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd947d\"", "article_summary": "\u2022 The urban landscape continues to get smarter, thanks to, among other things, GPS tracking of snowplows and cars sharing real-time traffic data.\n\u2022 Connected cars remain a hotbed of innovation, though one Ford executive suggested driverless cars may be farther off than some eager tech buffs suggest.\nThe city shares administrative data on its Data Portal, and Berman said officials are often urged to monetize that information by selling it to businesses.\nSuch is the nature of the Internet of Things, the subject of a full day\u2019s worth of panels presented Thursday by the Illinois Technology Association.\nRegardless of what happens (with the new Congress), I don\u2019t see that changing.\u201dPalin drew chuckles when he said he sees a day when wearables are connected not just to smart phones but to other smart devices in the home."}
