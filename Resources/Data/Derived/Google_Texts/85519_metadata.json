But it\u2019s not going to look like what any one person will see when they shop, because they will get a lot more detailed information based on their geography, their income, all those things that are specific to them.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how she sees it.\n\nSo far, premiums look pretty good\n\nMichigan's premiums stack up relatively well against the national average, says Udow-Phillips.\n\n\u201cWhat this report tells us when we look at it for Michigan, is that on average, premiums for what people think are going to be the most commonly purchased plans on the exchange\u2026look pretty favorable in Michigan relative to both what we\u2019re looking at for national average costs, and also in comparison to what a lot of employer-paid premiums look like today.\u201d\n\nOf course, not every plan is listed in the White House's early release.\n\nNot by a long shot.\n\n\u201cThe report that was released was just to give people an overall snapshot,\u201d says Udow-Phillips.\n\nBut it does provide sample prices for four plans, which are ranked as \"catastrophic,\" Bronze, Silver, and Gold.\n\nThe amount of coverage you get increases as you move toward Gold.\n\nThere\u2019s more: you don\u2019t just select from one Bronze plan.\n\nYou can buy, for instance, the \u201clowest Bronze\u201d level, or the \u201csecond lowest Bronze\u201d plan and so on.\n\nWhat that means for you if\u2026you\u2019re 27 years old\n\nSo let\u2019s give this exchange a spin.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re 27 years old, meaning you can\u2019t be on your parents' insurance anymore.\n\nWe\u2019ll call you Josh.\n\nAnd Josh has a job, but he\u2019s only part time, or maybe Josh\u2019s boss doesn\u2019t offer health insurance.\n\nSo Josh makes $25,000 a year, he\u2019s young and healthy, and he\u2019s not looking to pay a lot of money for the Cadillac of health insurance plans.\n\nBut then again, Josh does live like a wild man, with all that bungee jumping and climbing sheer cliffs without a harness.\n\nSo Josh skips over the Bronze plans and checks out the Silver plans.\n\nIf Josh wants to buy the second lowest Silver plan on Michigan\u2019s exchange example, the Obama administration says he\u2019ll pay about $202 a month in premiums.\n\nBut Josh also qualifies for a tax credit subsidy too. That would reduce his premiums to $145 a month.\n\nWhat that means for you if you\u2019ve got a family\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, if you\u2019re a married mom named Shannon with two kids and your family brings in $50,000 a year, you can also buy the second lowest Silver plan for $731.\n\nThat goes way down with the tax credit subsidies available to a family. The estimated monthly cost would be $282 a month.\n\nThe lowest Bronze plan will be even cheaper for Shannon and her family, at just $80 a month in premiums, but the coverage would not be as good.\n\nBut what if you\u2019d like a plan with more coverage, and you\u2019re willing to pay more?\n\nWell, we don\u2019t yet know what a family of four can expect to pay for a Gold plan.\n\nBecause this early preview of the exchange doesn\u2019t provide that.\n\nIt only offers weighted averages across the state, and it only looks at Bronze and Silver plans.\n\nWhat it means for you if you\u2019re really sick\n\nNow let\u2019s say Shannon has a chronically ill kid named Ben, and that illness wreaks havoc on his immune system, so Shannon\u2019s family is in and out of the hospital a lot.\n\nAnd Shannon\u2019s husband has a history of heart attacks, including one in the last year.\n\nPlus, Shannon\u2019s mother, sister, and aunt battled breast cancer.\n\nShannon may feel she needs to buy a plan on the exchange that offers a TON of coverage.\n\nShe\u2019s looking for something that will pay for 90% of common healthcare costs.\n\nWhich, when this exchange was first designed, would have meant she\u2019d probably want to buy a Platinum plan.\n\nHere\u2019s the bad news: some, maybe even a lot of Michigan\u2019s insurance companies won't offer platinum plans on the exchange.\n\nIt\u2019s because the companies are wary of the cost, says Udow-Phillips.\n\n\u201cBecause they\u2019re a little bit concerned, especially with this first foray in the healthcare exchange, that the only people who would sign up for the platinum plans are people who would expect to use a lot of healthcare services, and would be generally sicker than the population at large.\"\n\nNobody knows just how many Michiganders will sign up\n\nMore than a million people in this state are uninsured.\n\nA good chunk of them will be eligible for Medicaid when that program expands in the spring.\n\nUdow-Phillips projects about 320,000 people will actually enroll in the Medicaid program after the expansion.\n\nThat\u2019s \u201cmany more people than will initially enroll in the health insurance exchange,\u201d she says.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the rest will all go buy insurance on the exchange.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re projecting that about 120,000 people will get their health insurance on the individual market in the first year.\u201d\n\nBut by 2019, it could be that half a million people are on Michigan\u2019s exchange.\n\nThat gap will keep closing as awareness and education about the exchange improves, Udow-Phillips says.\n\nShe also projects that a lot of employers will take a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach and opt to offer their workers insurance, rather than sending them all onto the exchange.\n\nThat picture will look a lot clearer come October 1.\n\n- Meleanie Kruvelis and Mark Brush, Michigan Radio Newsroom\n\n*This post has been updated.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Michigans new healthcare exchange goes live next Tuesday (October 1), and the White House put out a sneek peak of sorts.
