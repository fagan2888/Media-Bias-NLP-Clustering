They said it\u2019s maddeningly difficult to fix problems once they arise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a tremendously frustrating and laborious experience,\u201d said Steve Nearman, a broker and financial adviser, who has placed nearly 100 cases for clients on D.C. Health Link.\n\n\u201cI made excuses for them for the first three months, because it was unprecedented demand, but now we\u2019re in September,\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know why things aren\u2019t getting quicker.\u201d\n\nMy column last week about a Harvard-educated lawyer who wasted months trying to get insurance via the District\u2019s exchange triggered a spurt of detailed e-mails from others complaining of similar difficulties.\n\nI don\u2019t write this to bash the Affordable Care Act. Far from it.\n\nLike the brokers and almost all who wrote me, I strongly support the health law and value its benefits. I ask merely that it function properly.\n\n\u201cThere are good things about it, but it\u2019s being ruined by poor execution, not only at the federal but now on the state level,\u201d Robert Poli, president of the Insurance Marketing Center in Rockville, said.\n\nThe District was supposed to be a rare bright spot for the health law. Its Web site was one of only four that didn\u2019t crash on opening day in October. The city has performed better than Maryland, which is replacing its site after notorious problems.\n\nStill, my inbox suggests the District still has much to fix. Here\u2019s a sampling of horror stories:\n\n\u25a0 Catherine Shaw, a retiree who lives in Georgetown, applied for coverage July 2, but \u201csome glitch\u201d prevented her income information from entering the system. She reapplied last month, only to be stymied by a conflict with her first application. She applied a third time, but said she was told there is still is \u201cno known date as to when this process would be completed.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Amy Dara Hochberg, a yoga teacher in Northwest, said it required four months and \u201cnumerous phone calls\u201d to get coverage in the spring. When insurance was finally activated, she was charged for all of April even though only five days remained in the month. She said the problems \u201ccost me time without health care coverage when I needed it, energy that took me away from my work and life, and money lost on the April premium.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Amy Muhlberg, a government relations consultant who lives near Eastern Market, had to buy expensive coverage under the federal COBRA plan for March after the District exchange improperly denied her application. She was the wrong person to rebuff. As a former staff member on a Senate committee that considered the ACA, Muhlberg knew precisely what it required. She took the case to an administrative law hearing before it was cleared up.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to me was annoying, but I had the resources to suck it up,\u201d Muhlberg, who has a PhD in biochemistry, said. \u201cWhat truly bothered me was that there were other people out there that this happened to who did not have the resources I had.\u201d\n\nWhat can be done? Poli, whose company works with about 300 brokers who have dealt with the District\u2019s system, and Nearman offered some constructive suggestions.\n\nFirst, continue to upgrade the exchange\u2019s Web site. Far too much information goes astray, and it\u2019s too difficult to make updates or fixes.\n\nSecond, do more to educate the exchange staff, insurance company personnel and the public about how the process works.\n\nThird, shorten the delay between passing an application from the exchange to an insurance company, and sending the individual the bill to pay to complete the sign-up process.\n\nThere\u2019s little time to spare. The volume of work is going to jump soon. A new open enrollment period begins in November, and the Web site starts handling companies\u2019 group insurance plans in 2015.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think D.C. is ready,\u201d Poli said.\n\nI discuss local issues Friday at 8:50 a.m. on WAMU (88.5 FM).
