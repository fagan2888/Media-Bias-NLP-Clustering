But with Vasalgel, a non-hormonal form of male birth control, could hit the U.S. market as early as 2017, assuming the contraceptive passes muster with the FDA.\n\nDeveloped by the Parsemus Foundation, a nonprofit focused on developing low-cost medical approaches that have been neglected by Big Pharma, the product has proven highly effective in tests involving three kinky baboons and a clinical trial involving rabbits (which, as the saying goes\u2026 well, you know). Human trials in the United States are set to begin early next year.\n\nThe contraceptive was inspired by work on a similar injectable, male birth control called RISUG, which is currently undergoing clinical trials in India. Local men involved in the trial have been successfully using the product for the past 15 years, but Vasalgel\u2019s formulation differs slightly because it is being developed in the U.S. to conform to FDA standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe miracle, sperm-blocking substance itself.\n\nThe product works via a single injection of a contraceptive polymer directly into the vas deferens (the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra). The polymer then blocks any sperm from passing through the tubes for an extended period of time. The procedure is far less invasive than a vasectomy, which involves the cutting of the vas deferens, and it\u2019s also much easier to reverse. All it takes is another injection and your little spermatozoon friends can swim free again. Best of all, Vasalgel\u2019s makers promise that it will cost less than a doctor\u2019s visit or an $800 IUD, the non-hormonal birth control option for women.\n\nBut there is one issue. With the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for low-cost solutions, the Parsemus Foundation is being forced to rely on donations and crowdfunding to bring Vasalgel to market. \u201cSince long-term methods aren\u2019t a big money-maker (it\u2019s a lot more profitable to sell pills to men\u2019s partners every month), big pharma isn\u2019t interested,\u201d they write on their site. \u201cSo we\u2019re relying on public support.\u201d Currently, the foundation is seeking individual contributions to help them continue with their clinical trials, which you can find out more about here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from empowering men with a cheap, effective and convenient way to practice somewhat safe sex (with a monogamous partner), Vasalgel could also be a major advancement for women who can\u2019t afford birth control or are unable to take it for medical reasons. Not to mention the long list of adverse effects caused by the pill that, until now, have always been a woman\u2019s burden. In light of the national debate over birth control under the Affordable Care Act, it could also have a huge cultural impact by turning the tables of public scrutiny onto the male body, as The Daily Beast points out.\n\nBut will guys really opt for an injection over the old-fashioned condom? For most men, the answer is probably a emphatic yes. As Norman Mailer once said, \u201cThe only thing you can depend on with condoms is that they will take 20 to 50 percent off your f***.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "male birth control, vasalgel, The Parsemus Foundation", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "outbrain": {"image": "http://media.vocativ.com/photos/2015/04/Male-Birth-Control-0051335435678.jpg", "title": "Male Birth Control Shot Could Hit the U.S. Market in Two Years"}, "twitter": {"description": "Male Birth Control Shot Could Hit the U.S. Market in Two Years", "creator": "@aekulze", "image": {"src": "https://media.vocativ.com/photos/2014/09/Male-Birth-Control-004340645491.jpg"}, "title": "Male Birth Control Shot Could Hit the U.S. Market in Two Years", "site": "@vocativ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.vocativ.com/underworld/sex/male-birth-control/", "image": {"width": 560, "secure_url": "https://media.vocativ.com/photos/2014/09/Male-Birth-Control-004340645491.jpg", "identifier": "http://media.vocativ.com/photos/2014/09/Male-Birth-Control-004340645491.jpg", "height": 292}, "type": "article", "description": "\"It's OK, I'm on Vasalgel.\" A sperm-blocking shot for men may soon liberate women from the pill", "title": "Male Birth Control Shot Could Hit the U.S. Market in Two Years"}, "fb": {"app_id": 685756558116580}, "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"It's OK, I'm on Vasalgel.\" A sperm-blocking shot for men may soon liberate women from the pill."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e6f\"", "article_summary": "But with Vasalgel, a non-hormonal form of male birth control, could hit the U.S. market as early as 2017, assuming the contraceptive passes muster with the FDA.\nThe contraceptive was inspired by work on a similar injectable, male birth control called RISUG, which is currently undergoing clinical trials in India.\nBest of all, Vasalgel\u2019s makers promise that it will cost less than a doctor\u2019s visit or an $800 IUD, the non-hormonal birth control option for women.\nIn light of the national debate over birth control under the Affordable Care Act, it could also have a huge cultural impact by turning the tables of public scrutiny onto the male body, as The Daily Beast points out.\nShareTweetShareSendLinkFor men who hate condoms and women who hate the side effects of the pill, there\u2019s very little middle ground."}
