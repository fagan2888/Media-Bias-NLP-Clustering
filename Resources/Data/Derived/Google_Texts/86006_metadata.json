Government involvement rarely helps. In many instances, in fact, it exacerbates the situation.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it happen in the financial sector. The Dodd-Frank legislation that was supposed to prevent another crisis is instead mandating regulations that simply make things more expensive for ordinary consumers \u2014 all while increasing the chances of a bailout. We\u2019ve seen it happen in health care, with Obamacare saddling the economy with costly requirements that aren\u2019t making anyone healthier.\n\nNow that the Federal Communications Commission has voted for the third time in the last decade to institute \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d it\u2019s fair to ask if we\u2019re about to see it online.\n\nMany people are under the mistaken impression that this change will mean a freer, fairer Internet. They take the phrase \u201cnet neutrality\u201d at face value. While it\u2019s alliterative and catchy, it\u2019s also dangerous. Ironically, it sets up a situation under which the online rules are anything but free, fair or neutral.\n\nTo understand why, consider how net neutrality would change things. For years, the broadband services provided by such companies as Verizon, AT&T and Comcast have been treated differently than traditional telephone and utility services. They haven\u2019t had to operate under \u201ccommon-carrier\u201d rules that prohibit them from varying rates and services for their broadband offerings.\n\nThey can offer \u2014 and charge \u2014 what they want. But this is good. As I explained in a previous column, consumers win under this scenario. Broadband providers have to compete for business, and they can\u2019t win and keep customers without offering better, faster service at lower rates.\n\nBut now? They\u2019re common carriers who provide \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d So the FCC is free to regulate them.\n\nIn answer to some of the criticism, the FCC has assured the public that it won\u2019t resort to regulating broadband providers as fully as the law would allow. They\u2019ll still have a large degree of autonomy, we\u2019re to believe. But you don\u2019t have to be as skeptical of government promises as I am to view this assurance with a heavy dose of suspicion.\n\nI\u2019m not saying the FCC is necessarily being disingenuous. But consider the government\u2019s track record. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, told us that the welfare system he signed into law in the 1960s would be a \u201chand up,\u201d not a handout. Yet until the 1996 reform, it was impossible to view as anything but a handout.\n\nMore recently, we have the cases I cited above, with Dodd-Frank and Obamacare. Policymakers can have all the good intentions in the world, but it doesn\u2019t change what can and does happen when their so-called solutions are put into practice.\n\nExpect the pace of innovation to slow. Think about how the Internet has changed our lives in the last few years alone. Would have been possible with the bureaucrats in Washington empowered to oversee what service providers can and cannot do?\n\nWe\u2019d be lucky to even have dial-up service today. It simply makes no sense to yoke the Internet of 2015 to any portion of the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe good news? This fight isn\u2019t over. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve been here twice before, once in 2006 and again in 2010. Both times, net neutrality didn\u2019t survive a court challenge, and that\u2019s where we look now. The FCC\u2019s latest version of net neutrality will have to weather review in the courts as well. We may also hear from Congress \u2014 which, regulation expert James Gattuso reminds us in a recent article, is the \u201cconstitutionally charged body for lawmaking.\u201d Some overeager policymakers seem to forget that.\n\nSorry, but net neutrality is like a virus or a bad line of code. It needs to be eradicated, not embraced. The government is here, all right, but not to help. Time to hit \u201cdelete.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ed Feulner is founder of the Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's a reason the words \"I'm from the government, and I'm here to help\" are a punchline.
