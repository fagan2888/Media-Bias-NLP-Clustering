However, the hearing itself was a consequence of both Republican and Democratic members of the panel agreeing to hear from the public about how \u2013 or even whether \u2013 to change campaign finance regulations.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that the FEC has done in the past, this is a historic event,\u201d FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel said in her opening statement.\n\nRounds of advocates for reform sat at the same table with proponents of a laissez-faire approach and spoke into the afternoon about the role of money in politics.\n\nLast year\u2019s Supreme Court decision in McCutcheon v. FEC eliminated barriers on the total a political donor could give to federal political action committees during an election cycle while still keeping the donation limits for each committee in place. Previously, a contributor could only give a maximum of $123,000 to political party and candidate committees every two years.\n\nThe plaintiffs of the suit, the Republican National Committee and conservative businessman Shaun McCutcheon, argued that donors\u2019 speech should not be stifled into only giving to a specific number of candidates each cycle.\n\nFederal campaign regulators are now in the midst of deciding if it\u2019s necessary to create rules that thwart money from being used to circumvent the base limit caps.\n\n\u201cIt is time for the FEC to step in and recognize that the fact that coordinated spending is occurring and must be regulated,\u201d said Elisabeth MacNamara, the president of the League of Women Voters.\n\nThe group was one of many that pointed to the rise of super-PACs that support a single candidate, which are often formed by former aides, and run alongside official campaigns without being allowed to officially coordinate.\n\nCandidates, however, routinely meet with the wealthy donors to these groups and solicit contributions to help run ads in their favor.\n\nAs written, coordination rules \u201care easily exploited in ways that do an end-run around contribution limits and otherwise violate the independence assumed by the Supreme Court,\u201d said Stephen Spaulding, a policy counsel at Common Cause.\n\n\u201cThere are limited but important steps that the commission can take and must take\u2026 to curb corruption and its appearance and shine a light on the money that influences voters\u2019 choices,\u201d he added.\n\nAside from philosophical differences, opponents also argue that the FEC does not have permission under current laws passed by Congress to tighten disclosure rules or further regulate the flow of funds that move through political fundraising committees.\n\n\u201cIn large part, these proposed rules appear to be predicated on the notion that money is somehow inherently evil,\u201d said Dan Backer, a lawyer who represented McCutcheon and spoke to the commission on behalf of the Conservative Action Fund.\n\nReform advocates, he said, believe money \u201ccorrupts everything it touches, seducing our elected representatives away from the path of righteousness into a life within dark, dingy crack-den-like call centers at National Party offices.\u201d\n\nHowever, as Fordham University Law professor Zephyr Teachout pointed out, there is a giant \u201celephant and donkey in the room\u201d at the FEC, and that gridlock makes it unlikely for the commission to make any large revisions to campaign finance regulations without action by Congress.\n\nTeachout, while running for governor against incumbent New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) last year, made campaign finance reform a key part of her platform.\n\nShould the FEC decide to break the stalemate and propose rules on super-PACs, coordination and earmarking, former Obama administration counsel Bob Bauer cautioned it ought to tread carefully.\n\n\u201cYou're not going to reach an agreement on these things,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do, you are likely to be sued and if you are sued, there is a good chance you are going to lose.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the marathon hearing, commissioners would not commit to asking counsel to draft an official proposal to tackle any of the issues discussed.\n\nCommissioner Lee Goodman, a Republican, told The Hill on Tuesday he would \u201ckeep an open mind\u201d regarding proposals about issues related to the McCutcheon ruling that address joint fundraising committees, the earmarking of funds, affiliation and disclosure.\n\nHowever, the hearing also veered into other areas, including discussions on requiring disclosure of the funding for some Internet speech and of donors to non-profit organizations that may engage in political activity, but are not required to report contributors.\n\nThe FEC \u201cdoesn\u2019t have authority to regulate speech on the Internet simply because it\u2019s a \u2018growing force in the political arena,\u2019\u201d said former FEC Commissioner Dave Mason, quoting Chairwoman Ravel\u2019s inquiry about whether more disclosure is needed. \u201cIt has no relevance to the kind of corruption which the rule is supposed to stop, which is quid pro quo corruption.\u201d\n\nSome panelists also addressed the rider attached to Congress's omnibus spending package at the end of 2014 that created new accounts for party committees for recounts, offices and other expenses.\n\nThe changes allow donors to give a total of more than $1 million to national party committees during an election cycle. Some at the hearing, including Craig Holman of Public Citizen, called for regulations to ensure that these accounts are not misused.\n\nRNC Chief Counsel John Phillippe Jr. refuted the need for any protections, noting that the accounts strengthen the party system.\n\n\u201cIf Congress was worried about large checks to party committees, it has a very odd way of showing it,\u201d he said, referring to the increase in amounts that can be given.\n\nMany of the conservative and GOP witnesses pushed back against any attempts to rein in spending in any way.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need less money in the political process, we need more money in the political process,\u201d Backer said.\n\nHe mentioned that the $7 billion spent in the last presidential election equated to about the same amount spent by consumer brands, like Oreo, in advertising each year.\n\n\u201cEvery one of those dollars spent is an idea that gives information to the voter who makes the decisions,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Federal Election Commission held a rare open meeting Wednesday on disclosure rules.", "description": "The Federal Election Commission held a rare open meeting Wednesday on disclosure rules.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
