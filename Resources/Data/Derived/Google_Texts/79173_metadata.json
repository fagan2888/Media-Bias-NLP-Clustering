The checkup cost more than $500.\n\nFive years after Texas became the first state to permit freestanding emergency rooms, more than 160 of the facilities have set up shop around the state \u2014 a presence that suburban commuters and health insurers alike are finding impossible to ignore.\n\nHealth care experts say the financial success of the freestanding facilities \u2014 and the growing bargaining power that comes with it \u2014 is leading health insurers to arrange for more of the emergency rooms to be in a patient\u2019s network. That could mean better deals for the Texans who rely on the facilities for quick access to emergency care, mostly in wealthier, suburban neighborhoods.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether freestanding emergency rooms \u2014 24-hour facilities that operate independently of hospitals \u2014 will thrive in other markets. Texans in the neighborhoods where freestanding ERs have opened earn 49 percent more income than the state average, according to an analysis of Census ZIP code data by The Texas Tribune.\n\nMany freestanding ERs are part of for-profit chains, owned by doctors and investors, which employ their own staffs and offer walk-in emergency care at free-market prices. Supporters of the business model say that with more of the facilities joining health plans\u2019 networks, and with the growing number of Texans who got insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the businesses are likely to show up in smaller towns and poorer neighborhoods where they can expand needed access to emergency care.\n\n\u201cI think it satisfies a certain need, and as the industry matures, you\u2019re going to see it broaden into more and more communities,\u201d said Daniel Sternthal, a Houston attorney who represents freestanding ERs at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced. Freestanding emergency rooms aren\u2019t recognized by the federal government, which means they cannot accept public insurance like Medicare or Medicaid. Unlike public hospitals, freestanding facilities are largely spared the flow of uninsured, poor patients who strain traditional emergency rooms \u2014 though representatives for the companies say they are bound by law to treat all patients, regardless of their ability to pay. Some critics say the facilities target wealthier neighborhoods where people are more likely to have private insurance and fewer serious medical complications.\n\n\u201cI think a lot would have to happen for them to go into those lower-income neighborhoods,\u201d said Vivian Ho, a health economist at Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy. \u201cFirst of all, those patients have to get insurance, and insurance where the freestanding location is in the network.\u201d\n\nThe growing clout of freestanding ERs, once considered a disruptive nuisance in the health care arena by hospitals and insurers, has transformed them into an established market force. Experts say that means the industries are increasingly playing ball with each other.\n\nTexas lawmakers this year struck a compromise between freestanding facilities and health insurers with a measure that requires freestanding ERs to prominently display information about their services and how much they cost. That, insurance companies say, will help keep patients out of the emergency room unless they really need it.\n\n\u201cWhen consumers are empowered with information, they are better able to care for themselves and their families without breaking their bank accounts,\u201d Jamie Dudensing, chief executive of the Texas Association of Health Plans, said in a statement.\n\nOthers see the willingness of health insurers to contract with the freestanding facilities as testament to their popularity. Owners of freestanding emergency rooms boast of shorter wait times compared to their traditional hospital counterparts, and an upscale, \u201cconcierge\u201d service model.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited about seeing health plans accept freestanding emergency rooms as an actual source and facility for emergency care,\u201d said Brad Shields, executive director of the Texas Association of Freestanding Emergency Centers. \u201cThat to me means that you\u2019ve got both sides of the table recognizing the level of care and the quality of care that\u2019s being provided.\"\n\nThe industry has experienced almost breathless growth in recent years. Adeptus Health, which owns more than 50 freestanding facilities in Texas, reported doubling its revenue, to $211 million, from 2013 to 2014. In July, the company said it had opened 15 more facilities around the country so far this year.\n\nOften marked along suburban thoroughfares by a red lit cross, the emergency rooms can be difficult to miss on the outskirts of big cities. But some consumers face confusion about the services provided \u2014 and how much they cost.\n\nEarlier this year, when Nancy Nicolas was woken by the cries of her 3-month-old baby Dori, she drove the child to the nearby Neighbors Emergency Center in Austin.\n\nThere, a doctor performed a brief exam on the child and told Nicolas her daughter had a cold. No medicine was prescribed. Weeks later, she got a bill for $522.\n\nNicolas did not attempt to challenge the expense. But she said she wouldn\u2019t have gone to Neighbors if she had known it was an emergency room \u2014 and charged at an emergency room's rate.\n\n\u201cI assumed it was an urgent care [clinic] because I didn\u2019t even realize that freestanding ERs existed,\u201d she said.\n\nNicolas said that in an actual emergency situation, she would likely choose to go to the emergency room at the nearby children\u2019s hospital.\n\nStill, policymakers say the popularity of freestanding ERs points to a larger change in the 21st century health care market. John Hawkins, senior vice president for advocacy and public policy at the Texas Hospital Association, said hospitals are increasingly opening their own freestanding locations.\n\n\"The reality is, certain hospitals are using the same facilities,\" he said. \"It is difficult when certain groups come in and try to niche off certain services.\"\n\nFor many consumers, the appeal of the freestanding ER is the prospect of a short wait at a convenient location.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a natural outgrowth of this phenomenon with retail health,\u201d said Tom Banning, chief executive of the Texas Academy of Family Physicians. \u201cIt\u2019s more about consumers\u2019 desire to access health care on their own terms, and when someone else is paying the bill, they don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Rice University and the Texas Association of Health Plans are corporate sponsors of The Texas Tribune.
