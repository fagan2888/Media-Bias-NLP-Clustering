The national chain confirmed it can\u2019t find \u201cany evidence\u201d Pace has ever worked there.\n\nShe said Sunday that she didn\u2019t know why she picked Home Depot. Just random, she said.\n\n\u201cSame reason it says I live in Jamaica, like, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Home Depot\u2019s getting plenty of phone calls and looking through their employee list looking for Patrice Pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m down for randomly killing white people, Rs,\u201d Pace had posted. (Rs is sometimes used as an abbreviation for \u201creal (excrement),\u201d to mean someone is serious.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll gladly walk into a pet store or Starbucks and just start bussin,\u201d she wrote, adding two smiley faces.\n\nPace said in a phone interview Sunday she didn\u2019t think anyone would take her seriously and she would never shoot anyone. She said she posted her comment in anger after hearing the judge in the Charleston case, James Gosnell Jr., emphasize that the shooter\u2019s relatives are also \u201cvictims.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just like, \u2018What is really going on in America? What\u2019s really happening to black people in America? Is it blatant disrespect that we have to continue to take?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI could\u2019ve worded it differently. I could\u2019ve worded it way better.\u201d\n\nPace, who described herself as a mother and a caterer, said she thought she was only telling \u201ca couple people based off my friends list,\u201d and \u201chalf the people are laughing with me because they know me personally. They know damn well I\u2019m not going to go shoot nobody.\u201d\n\nSomehow, the post she intended only for her friends got forwarded into the larger world, where it found an audience she had not imagined.\n\nConservative, black talk radio host Wayne Dupree on Saturday night posted a screenshot of Pace\u2019s comments on his Facebook page, which has 58,000 followers.\n\n\u201cHey The Home Depot, not sure I want to enter your place of business if Ms Pace is working for your stores,\u201d Dupree wrote, tagging the national chain.\n\nThe backlash on Home Depot\u2019s Facebook page was swift and dramatic, with many saying they would take their business elsewhere and calling for Pace to be fired.\n\n\u201cAre these the type of people you want working for you Home Depot?\u201d a man identified on Home Depot\u2019s Facebook page as John Griffin wrote.\n\n\u201cFire the racist pig, otherwise I might be worried about shopping in your store,\u201d wrote a man identified as Mike Pregon.\n\n\u201cMy family, my friends, and I will be boycotting your company until she has been released from employment with you,\u201d wrote a woman identified as Barbara Sue Brown. \u201cI would not feel safe being around someone who feels as she does towards white people.\u201d\n\nThe company is responding to commenters online, saying Pace has never worked there:\n\n@Daily_Dish Like you, we\u2019re appalled, but we\u2019ve investigated this and can\u2019t find any evidence that this person works for Home Depot. \u2014 The Home Depot (@HomeDepot) June 20, 2015\n\nPace said her phone, which had been linked to her Facebook page, was flooded with calls and text messages from angry strangers saying they would make sure she was unemployed.\n\n\u201cIt was crazy,\u201d she said. She deleted her posting and her Facebook profile.\n\nA police officer, who Pace said she knows on a \u201cfirst-name basis\u201d because she has lived in the same home for a decade, knocked on Pace\u2019s door and said someone had reported her.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018How serious are you?\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Not serious at all,\u2019\u201d she said. He asked her to delete the post, and she told him she already had. He left.\n\nPace said she is surprised by her statement going viral.\n\n\u201cEverything is at a tense moment,\u201d she acknowledged about her post. \u201cBut to me, it\u2019s only the white people that have taken it seriously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA2L2hvbWUtZGVwb3QtZmluZHMtaXRzZWxmLWluLWNvbnRyb3ZlcnN5LW92ZXItcmFuZG9tbHkta2lsbGluZy13aGl0ZS1wZW9wbGUtY29tbWVudC1ieS1lbXBsb3llZS1wb3Nlci5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naomi Martin", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Home Depot is being slammed\u00a0on social media because\u00a0a Dallas woman who claimed to be\u00a0an employee posted on Facebook that she was \u201cdown for randomly killing white people\u201d in response to\u2026", "title": "Dallas employee poser gets Home Depot slammed over \u2018randomly killing white people\u2019 comment", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/06/home-depot-finds-itself-in-controversy-over-randomly-killing-white-people-comment-by-employee-poser.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/06/screenshot.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-06-21T14:56:42Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a3a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Home Depot\u2019s getting plenty of phone calls and looking through their employee list looking for Patrice Pace.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m down for randomly killing white people, Rs,\u201d Pace had posted.\n\u201cAre these the type of people you want working for you Home Depot?\u201d a man identified on Home Depot\u2019s Facebook page as John Griffin wrote.\nConservative, black talk radio host Wayne Dupree on Saturday night posted a screenshot of Pace\u2019s comments on his Facebook page, which has 58,000 followers.\nThe backlash on Home Depot\u2019s Facebook page was swift and dramatic, with many saying they would take their business elsewhere and calling for Pace to be fired.\nHome Depot is being slammed on social media because a Dallas woman who claimed to be an employee posted on Facebook that she was \u201cdown for randomly killing white people\u201d in response to the massacre of blacks at a Charleston, SC, church."}
