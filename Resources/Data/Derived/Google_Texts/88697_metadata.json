Jim DeMint and often endorses underdog challengers rather than incumbents or establishment candidates. The group has been locked in a bitter feud with McConnell, who has criticized its strategy for fighting Obamacare, which led to a government shutdown. According to the National Review, Sasse was berated by the minority leader in November for working with SCF and for accusing Republicans of failing to lead in a campaign video, specifically calling out McConnell. McConnell has accused SCF of giving conservatives a bad name and being counterproductive.\n\nLast year, SCF spent $1.4 million on the Nebraska Senate race, supporting State Treasurer Don Stenberg, who finished third in the GOP primary race, losing to darkhorse state Sen. Deb Fischer.\n\nSasse is also benefitting from help from another outside group, the Legacy Foundation Action Fund, which reported spending about $24,000 on billboards (including one on 10th Street in downtown Lincoln) saying Sasse would bring conservative Nebraska values to Washington, according to FEC records.\n\nThe Iowa-based group says it educates the public on fiscal issues, the creation of an entrepreneurial environment, education, labor-management relations, citizenship, civil rights, and government transparency issues.\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
