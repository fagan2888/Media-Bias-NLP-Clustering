All warnings and advisories continue; please click here to see the alert latest map.\n\nSnow. Some people will continue to have heavy snow. Some people will get light snow. Some will continue to hardly have any. It is amazing to see the disparity in snow among the towns. Torrington, Simsbury, Enfield \u2013 all of northern Hartford and Litchfield Counties \u2013 have hardly seen any snow. The dry air surrounding the periphery of this storm has proved to be insurmountably stubborn. These towns are the \u201chave nots\u201d of the storm; there appear to be no forces that will bring much change to the lack of snow. Here we\u2019ll bet less than an inch of snow, if anything.\n\nThe Shoreline is the exact opposite. Hours and hours of heavy snow will bring a much deeper snow pack. We will have snow totals of 5\u201d-10\u201d in most places, with many locations at even a foot or higher. We\u2019ve already seen reports of close to 6\u201d in New Haven and 8\u201d in Darien with snow continuing at this time.\n\nIn between, 3\u201d-6\u201d is still likely. Hartford and points southeast, along the Interstate 84 Corridor, including Farmington and Waterbury, will receive that type of snowfall. Within that area, a few pockets may receive a little more.\n\nSnow will continue to come down moderately and heavily at times, with snow rates sometimes going to between one and two inches per hour. Snow this intense will easily cover roads just plowed and reduce visibility to a quarter mile, making driving a truly dangerous exercise and even more so at night.\n\nWind. Wind gusts will continue to be strong. Gusts could go to 40 MPH or higher, drifting snow and further lowering the visibility. Snow falling heavily during high wind can be disorienting. Blizzard conditions are still possible along I-95, where a Blizzard Warning still exists.\n\nCoastal Flooding. Round two of coastal flooding along the Shoreline will happen tonight. High tides are between 8:49 PM and 11:00 PM and will be unusually high again at one to one and a half feet above normal. Although this level of high tide will not be as high as this morning\u2019s and all advisories toward that end are expired, it could still be the cause of at least some minor flooding, especially along our western Shoreline.\n\nTimeline. The storm will continue through the evening, but slowly start to taper from west to east overnight. Steady snow will become showery after midnight. All snow will have tapered off completely by dawn Sunday and Anna tracks out to sea.\n\nMUCH QUIETER SUNDAY AND MONDAY\n\nSunday will prove to be the bright spot of the weekend. Partly to mostly sunny skies and a brisk northwesterly wind will greet us as we open the door with shovel in hand. High pressure will build into the region during the course of the day; it is this system that will give us a reprieve from the stormy weather. It will also help to bring temperatures up into the 30s. So, once you clear what little or lot of snow you have, the sun will finish the job.\n\nMonday will be nice and mild. Sunshine will rule the sky. After a cold morning with lows in the teens, highs will go into the upper-30s to near 40 degrees. There will be considerable snow melt, making roads glisten in the sun. Be careful in the evening as the sun sets and the air cools to freezing; ice may form where melt water refreezes.\n\nISOLATED SHOWER LATE TUESDAY\n\nTuesday will be a changeable day. It will start off sunny as high pressure is retreating. As the system continues to retreat and low pressure moves into the region from the Great Lakes during the afternoon, clouds will thicken up so that, by lunch time, skies will be cloudy. Very late in the day, this system will bring a few rain showers \u2013 yes, rain showers! The air ahead of the storm will be milder; by afternoon, highs will peak in the 40s.\n\nThe storm will clear Tuesday night so that the sunshine will rule again Wednesday. A westerly wind will help bring morning temperatures in the upper-20s and lower-30s to lower 40s during the afternoon. Very late in the day, a cold front will approach\u2026\n\nCOLDER LATE IN THE WEEK\n\nColder weather will be here Thursday and Friday. By Thursday, the cold front will have passed through the state and brought temperatures low to more normal levels. Instead of lows near 30, they\u2019ll go into the teens and instead of highs in the 40s, they will be in the lower-30s.\n\nCHANCE FOR SNOW SATURDAY\n\nWe may have a little snow Saturday, especially in the morning. A quick-moving, moisture-starved system will race from the Great Lakes and into Connecticut. Although it\u2019s far away in time, it does appear that this storm will be far, far weaker than Anna and, therefore, far less impactful on our weather.\n\nWINTER STORM NAMES\n\nThe theme this winter is \u201cFirst Ladies\u201d, since this is a presidential election year. The first name on the list is Anna, after Anna Harrison. The rest of the list goes as follows: Barbara (Bush), Caroline (Harrison), Dolley (Madison), Eleanor (Roosevelt), Florence (Harding), Grace (Coolidge), Helen (Taft), Ida (McKinley), Jacqueline (Kennedy Onassis).\n\nWFSB has been naming winter storms since 1971 and we continue to tradition today independent of the Weather Channel, which names winter storms that affect the entire country. The storms we name are the ones that only impact Connecticut with 6\u201d of snow or more for most of the state and/or \u00bd\u201d or more of ice. Both scenarios would severely impact the state.\n\nMeteorologist Mike Cameron and Chief Meteorologist Bruce DePrest\n\n\u201cCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).
