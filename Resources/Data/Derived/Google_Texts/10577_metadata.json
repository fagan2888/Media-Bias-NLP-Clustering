It was rather murky, but parsing it helps illuminate Todd\u2019s worldview.\n\nA few weeks ago, Politico\u2018s gossipy Playbook feature was first to suggest that Todd would be named as a replacement for David Gregory, noting that Todd was a \u201cpolitical obsessive\u201d who impressed some powerful figures at the network with \u201chis love of the game.\u201d The move was seen as a way for NBC to \u201crestore passion and insider cred\u201d to their Sunday morning show. To many critics, this is exactly the kind of thing that\u2019s wrong with Beltway journalis: insiders talking to other insiders who \u201clove the game.\u201d On the August 31 show, Todd gave viewers a sense what \u201cloving the game\u201d means\u2013and why he\u2019s not likely to do much to change the process-driven, Beltway-obsessed Meet the Press. Todd starts off by congratulating guest host Andrea Mitchell for hosting a totally conventional panel of foreign policy insiders to talk about Syria and Iraq. And that led Todd off onto this tangent:\n\nYou were doing a great job asking them some of the questions the American public is asking. And that\u2019s our job as political journalists. In many ways, we\u2019re the go-between. Which is why people sometimes get angry at us\u2013politicians get angry at us, the public gets angry at us\u2013because they want us to be that interpreter. And my issue these days, when people say, \u201cI hate politics,\u201d it\u2019s like, \u201cNo. No, you don\u2019t. What you hate is the politicians who don\u2019t know how to practice it.\u201d\n\nSetting aside the sanctimonious nonsense about people being wrong about their feeling for politics, these comments are difficult to parse\u2013journalists are paid to be go-betweens, but not interpreters, like people want them to be? But it seems like part of what Todd is saying is that critics of the media mistakenly project their anger at journalists instead of the politicians with whom they disagree. He\u2019s said this before to CJR (10/29/10):\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to me how little substance most elected officials will engage in. I think the unsatisfied partisan media critics would be wise to spend more time engaging policymakers than those charged with covering them.\n\nBut Todd is misunderstanding some of the criticism. Back in 2009, he debated Glenn Greenwald over the issue of legal accountability for Bush-era torture. Todd was against it, seeming to endorse the argument that it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cgood for our reputation around the world if we\u2019re essentially putting on trial the previous administration.\u201d More recently, Todd attracted considerable attention (FAIR Blog, 9/18/13) after an MSNBC discussion about right-wing Obamacare misinformation, where Todd argued that the real issue was \u201cmessaging\u201d\u2013it was not the media\u2019s failure to check those lies but \u201cthe president of the United States\u2019 fault for not selling it.\u201d In both cases, Todd\u2019s critics are upset by the failure of journalism to act as a check on government power\u2013in one case by taking the position that prosecuting criminal behavior would send the wrong message, and in the other by not challenging misinformation. To make a broader point, some critics object to process-style political journalism\u2013about \u201cthe game\u201d\u2013because it crowds out reporting on issues of actual substance. Todd makes it sound like a vapid political system is the fault of politicians, but that lets reporters off the hook\u2013which is nothing if not convenient.\n\nFor those who critiqued Todd for seeing politics as a game, he was pretty clear that it is one:\n\nYou know, it\u2019s like watching a game. You want to compare it to a game, it is like watching a game of people that don\u2019t play the game very well. You\u2019d stop watching the game because you\u2019re like, \u201cThose baseball players stink,\u201d or, \u201cThose football players, they don\u2019t respect it.\u201d If you have politicians that know how to practice the art of politics, the democracy gets stronger, the world gets safer. And then that\u2019s when you realize politics is a good thing.\n\nSo what do \u201cgood\u201d politics look like to Chuck Todd? We know what he thinks of as bad politics\u2013prosecuting the prior administration\u2019s torture, for starters. Earlier this year, Todd and former host David Gregory mused about whether Obama might want to support the Keystone XL pipeline in order to make nice with Republicans and help soothe partisan divisiveness (FAIR Blog, 2/3/14). And Todd expanded on his politics-as-sporting-event theory in the pages of the Washington Post (FAIR Blog, 8/7/12), where he compared the Obama/Romney campaign to Olympic gymnastics (because campaign coverage can never be too shallow and gimmicky). The upshot was that being in the middle is what wins, and that Obama has had trouble when he\u2019s leaned too far to the left. So that\u2019s good politics, then\u2013when Democrats move further to the right to meet Republicans in some mythical, pundit-approved \u201ccenter.\u201d But there\u2019s a real chance that some people aren\u2019t confused\u2013they actually don\u2019t like politics, or at least they don\u2019t care much for politicians. And some critics of political journalism actually think that it should hold powerful people to account. That is very much at odds with viewing politics as a sport where the athletes just aren\u2019t performing particularly well. That\u2019s where Chuck Todd is coming from.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://fair.org/network-tv/nbc-network-tv/chuck-todds-theory-of-politics/", "site_name": "FAIR", "type": "article", "description": "Todd's critics are upset by the failure of journalism act as a check on government power, and to process-style political journalism that crowds out reporting on issues of actual substance.", "title": "Chuck Todd\u2019s Theory of Politics"}, "article": {"tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-09-03", "modified_time": "2014-09-03", "author": "http://fair.org/author/peter/"}, "twitter": {"domain": "FAIR.org", "description": "The new host of Meet the Press shares his ideas about what journalism is supposed to do-- and why people who hate politics are all wrong.", "title": "Chuck Todd's Theory of Politics", "image": "http://www.fair.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chucktodd-ourjob-300x175.png", "creator": "@PeterFHart", "site": "@FAIRmediawatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Todd's critics are upset by the failure of journalism act as a check on government power, and to process-style political journalism that crowds out reporting on issues of actual substance.", "google-site-verification": "pCl34NejY1VEHc5CT-okaKYhVr4ZfSS3FkoYFM7aP7Q"}, "article_summary": "So what do \u201cgood\u201d politics look like to Chuck Todd?\nChuck Todd will take over as host of Meet the Press next week, and on this week\u2019s show he gave a brief explanation of how he views politics.\nThat is very much at odds with viewing politics as a sport where the athletes just aren\u2019t performing particularly well.\nSo that\u2019s good politics, then\u2013when Democrats move further to the right to meet Republicans in some mythical, pundit-approved \u201ccenter.\u201d But there\u2019s a real chance that some people aren\u2019t confused\u2013they actually don\u2019t like politics, or at least they don\u2019t care much for politicians.\nFor those who critiqued Todd for seeing politics as a game, he was pretty clear that it is one:You know, it\u2019s like watching a game."}
