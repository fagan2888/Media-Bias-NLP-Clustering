The NPR report noted that the lack of Medicaid expansion in Texas "is driving many in the state's business community bonkers."

"It's our money that we're sending to Washington, D.C., and we aren't getting it back," said Bill Hammond, CEO of the Texas Association of Business. "We pay for it with corporate income taxes, we pay for it with our personal income tax and we pay for it in the fact that our premiums are higher than they would be if everyone was insured."

Texas has the second-highest insurance premiums in the nation, after Florida, another non-Medicaid expansion state. And Texas has the third-highest property taxes in the U.S.

Also galling to the business community is research showing that for every $1 the state paid toward Medicaid expansion, it would earn back $1.30 in new economic activity, which would include the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs.

"You look at the numbers, and you say, this is a no-brainer," said Ray Perryman, a leading Texas economist, in an interview with NPR.

But no change is likely in the near future as the Texas Legislature isn't even debating the merits of expanding Medicaid.

Medicaid expansion is a key component of President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act and its goal of providing coverage to uninsured Americans. An estimated quarter of all low-income adults without health insurance in the U.S. live in Texas, more than 1 million people.

Traditional Medicaid is jointly run by the federal government and individual states, and enrollees do not pay premiums for their health coverage. States have the power to set restrictions on who can receive coverage, whose costs are split, more or less evenly, with the federal government.

In Texas, no childless adult can obtain Medicaid coverage. And adults with children who earn above 19 percent of the federal poverty level, or about $3,800 for a family of three, are also barred from coverage in Texas.
