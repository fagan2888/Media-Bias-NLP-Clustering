More than 102,000 people attended the Belmont Stakes on Saturday for a chance to witness history. But after California Chrome failed to win the first Triple Crown in 36 years, many of them had trouble leaving the race track.

Mayhem reportedly ensued after, and tweets from spectators and reporters indicated “an absence of lights, employees, security personnel and police officers in the parking lots outside the grounds as” spectators tried to unsuccessfully leave the track.

Sports Illustrated curated some Tweets and images of the aftermath. One spectator said the scene looked like a “dirt-covered refugee camp out of a zombie apocalypse” and she would “sleep here were I not afraid for my life.” Traffic had apparently not been moving for at least 30 minutes.

Worst part: no lights, no employees, no security, no police, no concrete. You’re on your own. Unacceptable for a major event. — Jim Baumbach (@jimbaumbach) June 8, 2014

Line to get to LIRR leaving Belmont Park. A cop just said the trains were closed. The best way out is on horseback.. pic.twitter.com/Vx65r5IfDG — Antoine Gara (@AntoineGara) June 8, 2014
