The panel includes two conservative-leaning members.\n\nThe Obama administration appealed after a federal judge in Texas declined last week to lift the stay, which he had issued in February to put the president\u2019s deferred action immigration programs on hold.\n\nU.S. District Judge Andrew S. Hanen had granted the preliminary injunction to Texas and 25 other states after they sued to stop the program, arguing the president had overstepped his constitutional authority. If the administration loses, it can appeal the closely watched case to the full 5th Circuit and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe attorneys\n\nThe administration will be represented by Benjamin C. Mizer, acting assistant U.S. attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Division, according to a department spokesman.\n\nMizer, 38, former Ohio solicitor general, joined the department four years ago as a senior advisor to U.S. Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. before starting his current job last month.\n\nMizer\u2019s work in Washington and Ohio \u201cput him in some of the most challenging and demanding positions a lawyer can encounter,\u201d Holder said in announcing the appointment. \u201cBut in every instance, Ben has repeatedly demonstrated that he is both a gifted lawyer and a capable leader.\u201d\n\nA graduate of the College of Wooster and University of Michigan Law School, Mizer worked as a clerk for Judge Judith W. Rogers of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals and later for Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens.\n\n\u201cThose were jobs working on high-profile cases with difficult legal issues,\u201d Mizer told his hometown newspaper in New Philadelphia, Ohio, adding: \u201cI developed an expertise in appellate work. It became my niche.\u201d\n\nArguing on behalf of Texas and the other states that have sued to stop Obama\u2019s executive action will be Texas Solicitor Gen. Scott Keller.\n\nKeller was previously chief counsel for another former state solicitor general, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). When Keller was appointed solicitor general in January, Cruz called him \u201cdedicated, tireless\u201d and a \u201ctremendous\u201d legal talent.\n\nKeller, 33, graduated from Purdue University and the University of Texas School of Law. He was a clerk at a federal appeals court like Mizer, working for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and at the Supreme Court for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.\n\nDays after he was appointed, Keller argued his first case before the high court: a suit brought by a Dallas-based nonprofit alleging that Texas had awarded tax credits in a way that illegally disadvantaged minorities.\n\n\u201cTexas stands strongly against intentional racial discrimination,\u201d Keller said afterward. The Supreme Court is not expected to rule on that case until June.\n\nThe judges\n\nThe 5th Circuit includes 15 judges responsible for appeals from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Friday's randomly selected panel includes Jennifer Walker Elrod, Stephen A. Higginson and Jerry E. Smith.\n\nTwo of the judges \u2014 Elrod and Smith \u2014 are viewed as conservative, which heartened some opponents of the deferred action programs.\n\n\u201cFor those who think Obama's actions are unconstitutional, there may be some reasons to be optimistic that this panel of the 5th Circuit is going to be sympathetic,\u201d said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative think tank based in Washington.\n\nSmith, 68, was appointed to the bench by President Reagan in 1987. A native of the border city of Del Rio, Texas, he graduated from Yale University and Yale Law School, where he was a classmate of George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. He served as Texas\u2019 special assistant attorney general and as Houston\u2019s city attorney.\n\nThree years ago, during oral arguments in a case involving the Affordable Care Act, Smith made headlines when he ordered the Justice Department to provide the court with a three-page, single-spaced report explaining Obama's views on judicial review. Smith's order was prompted by remarks Obama had made about a case pending before the Supreme Court, saying any ruling to overturn the Affordable Care Act would be \u201can unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress.\u201d\n\nElrod, 48, a native of Port Arthur, Texas, graduated from Baylor University and Harvard Law School. She was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2007.\n\nShe recently ruled to uphold Texas\u2019 restrictions on abortion access. Two years ago, Elrod dissented when the full court, in a case called Villas at Parkside Partners vs. City of Farmers Branch, struck down a Texas city\u2019s ordinance that effectively made it a crime for those who had immigrated illegally to rent homes. In her dissent, which was joined by Smith, Elrod said that the ordinance \u201cdoes not constitute a regulation of immigration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ordinance was passed during a period of intense national debate concerning the fate of millions of people present in this country who entered without passing official inspection or who overstayed visas or entry permits. A court does not have the luxury of entering into this debate, nor may we judge the wisdom of a local law,\u201d Elrod wrote.\n\nThe third judge is expected to be more friendly to the administration\u2019s case: Higginson, 53, is a Boston native appointed by Obama four years ago. A graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, he initially worked as a federal prosecutor, first in Massachusetts, then in Louisiana.\n\nHigginson wrote the majority opinion in the Farmers Branch case on immigrants renting homes, opening with a quote from President George H.W. Bush at the 100th anniversary of Ellis Island: \u201cAmerica's history has long been a story of immigrants.\u201d The judge went on to note: \u201cThat story, a complicated history of inclusion and exclusion, has unfolded according to law, but also contrary to law.\u201d\n\nThe activists\n\nAt least 200 people plan to protest outside the court ahead of the hearing, including many who qualify for deferred action. They plan to start with a prayer vigil outside the courthouse on Thursday, said Saket Soni, director of the New Orleans Workers Center.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The key players in Obama's appeal on deportation deferral program", "date": "2015-04-15", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "State and federal lawyers on opposite sides of the immigration divide are set to square off in federal appeals court Friday before three judges who will decide whether to lift a temporary stay on President Obama\u2019s executive action, which seeks to shield up to 5 million people from deportation.", "title": "The key players in Obama's appeal on deportation deferral program", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/immigration/la-na-immigration-court-profiles-20150415-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-552de367/turbine/la-na-immigration-court-profiles-20150415", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "immigration, President Obama, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83300786", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "immigration, President Obama, 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "State and federal lawyers on opposite sides of the immigration divide are set to square off in federal appeals court Friday before three judges who will decide whether to lift a temporary stay on President Obama\u2019s executive action, which seeks to shield up to 5 million people from deportation. ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde012\"", "article_summary": "A graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School, he initially worked as a federal prosecutor, first in Massachusetts, then in Louisiana.\nIf the administration loses, it can appeal the closely watched case to the full 5th Circuit and ultimately the U.S. Supreme Court.\nKeller, 33, graduated from Purdue University and the University of Texas School of Law.\nThe Supreme Court is not expected to rule on that case until June.\nHe was a clerk at a federal appeals court like Mizer, working for Judge Alex Kozinski of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, and at the Supreme Court for Justice Anthony M.
