It also comes at a time when negotiators of 12 Pacific Rim nations, including the U.S., are putting the finishing touches on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal that would encompass 40 percent of the world\u2019s gross domestic product and is meant to counterbalance China\u2019s economic influence.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, over strong objections from many Democrats, Congress passed fast-track authority granting Obama administration the ability to negotiate the trade deal, limiting itself to an up-or-down vote on the final agreement.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nReactions from Congress have been split on whether China\u2019s actions showed the TPP was more necessary than ever or revealed deep flaws in the deal as it currently stands.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday's news that China has yet again lowered the value of its currency is another harsh reminder that we cannot afford to sit idly by as China refuses to play by the rules,\" Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said in a statement. \"Any negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership must prioritize combating currency manipulation by our foreign competitors.\"\n\n\n\nOpponents to the TPP say provisions in the deal that would punish members that manipulate the values of their currencies need to be in place since China might eventually join the pact.\n\n\n\n\u201cGiven China\u2019s history of devaluing its currency to gain an unfair export advantage, today\u2019s actions by the Chinese government raise serious concerns,\u201d said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., one of the most outspoken House members against the TPP. \u201cWe need to use TPP as a key opportunity to write the rules of trade for the 21st Century, this action highlights the need to include a strong and effective obligation on currency manipulation in TPP.\u201d\n\nClinton Email Scandal Eclipses Benghazi Investigation\n\nClinton Email Scandal Eclipses Benghazi Investigation The Associated Press What Happened:\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s email is the political scandal that keeps on giving. This week, Clinton directed her private server be handed over to the Justice Department as part of an investigation into whether classified information was improperly sent or stored on the server or through her email account.\n\n\n\nThe State Department maintains that nothing marked as classified was sent to Clinton through her private email while she was serving as secretary of state. It\u2019s not uncommon for State and intelligence agencies to have disagreements over classifications, leading some to speculate that such a conflict may be at the heart of the latest round of questions.\n\n\n\nBut Republicans jumped on the news this week that classified information had been found among Clinton's emails, calling for thorough examination into whether laws were broken.\n\n\n\n\"Secretary Clinton's previous statements that she possessed no classified information were patently untrue,\" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. \"Her mishandling of classified information must be fully investigated.\"\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nThe House committee convened to investigate the 2012 attack in Benghazi has been criticized as a politically motivated attempt to drag down Clinton\u2019s presidential bid. But committee chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said recent revelations have lent credence to his panel\u2019s continued focus on Clinton\u2019s communications.\n\n\n\n\"The fact that Secretary Clinton finally surrendered her email server vindicates Speaker Boehner and Chairman Gowdy's efforts to compel her to do the right thing,\u201d Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Boehner, told the Washington Examiner.\n\n\n\nWith Clinton's presidential poll numbers plummeting amid concerns from Americans about her trustworthiness, what might have started as a fishing expedition potentially landed the big one.\n\nSouthwest Republican Slam EPA Response to Colorado Spill\n\nSouthwest Republican Slam EPA Response to Colorado Spill The Associated Press What Happened:\n\n\n\nAn attempt to clear buildup of wastewater near an old gold mine in Colorado led to a massive contamination of two rivers when an EPA team breached a dam last week while trying to install a drain pipe.\n\n\n\nThree million gallons of wastewater, tainted with heavy metals, arsenic and other contaminants turned portions of the ANimas River, north of the town of Durango, a cloudy orange and threatened drinking supply in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.\n\n\n\n\"It is really a tragic and very unfortunate incident,\" EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said, \"and EPA is taking responsibility to ensure that that spill is cleaned up. There are thousands of abandoned mines throughout the West, and EPA routinely works with states to clean up these spills.\"\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nWhile the unsightly chemical plume is dissipating, the trouble is likely only beginning for the EPA. A frequent target of attacks from Republicans opposed to regulations they say hurt businesses, the spill has given an opening to those who are already inclined to see the agency dismantled.\n\n\n\nLawmakers in the affected areas have excoriated the EPA for the accident, and for handling the cleanup too slowly.\n\n\n\n\u201cColoradans deserve to know the EPA\u2019s plan for cleaning up the mess they\u2019ve made and their plan for the long-term restoration of the river habitat impacted,\u201d said Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe community has expressed serious concerns about the speed and scope of the EPA\u2019s initial response,\u201d he, along with Rep. Scott Tipton, R-Colo., and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said in a letter to McCarthy. \u201cWe urge EPA to take full responsibility for this accident, including appropriate compensation to the communities that have been affected by the spill.\u201d\n\nKerry Reopens Ambassador-less Cuban Embassy\n\nKerry Reopens Ambassador-less Cuban Embassy Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images What Happened:\n\n\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry traveled to Havana on Friday to oversee the raising of the U.S. flag over the newly reopened embassy in Cuba, marking the restart of diplomatic relations that formally began last month.\n\n\n\nKerry said at the ceremony that it was time to put aside more than 50 years of contention between the U.S. and its island neighbor 90 miles off the coast of Florida, but he acknowledged the many issues that remain between the two nations. None of those issues is more pressing than the longstanding economic embargo the U.S. imposed on Cuba.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe time is now to reach out to one another as two peoples who are no longer enemies or rivals but neighbors,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cJust as we are doing our part, we urge the Cuban government to make it less difficult for their citizens to start businesses, to engage in trade, access information online,\u201d Kerry added. \u201cThe embargo has always been something of a two-way street. Both sides need to remove restrictions that have been holding Cubans back.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has taken significant steps to normalize relations between the U.S. and Cuba, but Congress holds the power to lift the embargo and appoint an ambassador \u2013 and it's uncertain when lawmakers will consider either of those issues.\n\n\n\nDespite polls showing strong support for re-establishing diplomatic relations and ending the embargo (Gallup in February found 2-1 support on both questions), Cuban-American lawmakers remain staunchly opposed.\n\n\n\n\"I will make sure that the embassy you are opening in Havana will not have a U.S. ambassador unless, at the very least, we see real political reforms and progress on human rights, the return to the U.S. of harbored terrorists and fugitives to face justice, and the resolution of outstanding American property claims and judgments against the Cuban government,\" wrote Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., in a letter to Kerry this week.\n\n\n\nIran Deal Tenuous as Democrats Take Sides", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Pulse", "title": "Planned Parenthood Ads Hit Vulnerable GOPers", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "With a new series of ads, the organization hopes to make moderate Republicans regret their opposition.", "title": "Planned Parenthood Ads Hit Vulnerable GOPers", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/08/19/planned-parenthood-ads-hit-vulnerable-gopers", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/70/73/e97c973245718c0d66efb6536801/150819-plannedparenthood-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With a new series of ads, the organization hopes to make moderate Republicans regret their opposition.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Planned Parenthood Ads Hit Vulnerable GOPers"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Aug. 19, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Gabrielle Levy,Planned Parenthood,Republican Party,Senate,picks,Pulse", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "With a new series of ads, the organization hopes to make moderate Republicans regret their opposition."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde0d\"", "article_summary": "\"Secretary Clinton's previous statements that she possessed no classified information were patently untrue,\" House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement.\n\"Her mishandling of classified information must be fully investigated.\"\nBut Republicans jumped on the news this week that classified information had been found among Clinton's emails, calling for thorough examination into whether laws were broken.\nThere are thousands of abandoned mines throughout the West, and EPA routinely works with states to clean up these spills.\"\nBut committee chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., said recent revelations have lent credence to his panel\u2019s continued focus on Clinton\u2019s communications."}
