Instead, I am keenly aware that the rule of law and my own security are inextricably bound together. As George Orwell might have said, a strongman that one holds in high regard is still a strongman.\n\nThe \u201cConstitution,\u201d John Adams wrote, \u201cwas made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\u201d To this maxim he might have added the warning that the charter could not possibly survive unless those who swear to uphold it elect to respect its boundaries and honor its purpose. As should by now be obvious, culture matters a great deal. Almost every time the American system has been tried in South America, the inevitable tension between executive and legislature has produced a coup, the \u201cgridlock\u201d that is the hallmark of our Madisonian system of separated of powers serving as a boon to the presidency and as the overture to military rule. For years now, progressives have pointed to these foreign failures, predicting gravely that such an outcome was the inescapable structural product of the constitutional system itself and that it would eventually happen in America, too. Aware of the indispensable role that national habits play in any political settlement, conservatives have tended to argue otherwise, noting that the maturity and experience of the American electorate guards against such usurpation. \u201cWhich president would want to break the system?\u201d we have inquired. And which lawmaker would be so lacking in jealousy that he would refrain from stopping him? We are presumably about to find out. It is time to gird our loins.\n\n\u2014 Charles C. W.
