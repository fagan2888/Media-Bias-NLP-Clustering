Catherine Howarth, a UK citizen with dark skin, of Nigerian heritage, shocked midwives and doctors at Milton Keynes Hospital in England when baby Jonah came out of his mother\u2019s womb: He was completely white. Catherine, along with her husband Richard, who is white, were equally astonished, after expecting their son to have darker skin. The odds are one in a million.\n\n\u201cHis complexion was very pale due to the umbilical cord being wrapped around his neck when he was being delivered,\u201d Richard told the Sunday Mirror. \u201cAfter a few hours, his color came to his cheeks. Catherine and I noticed his complexion was very similar to mine and were surprised it was as light. The midwives and doctors told us he\u2019ll most likely remain this color.\u201d\n\nAlthough some children are known to get darker after a few weeks of birth, showing the skin color they will have for life, parents and doctors can determine pigmentation by looking at the tips of their ears. However, the interracial couple could immediately tell Jonah was fully white and not albino. Doctors believe Catherine has been carrying a recessive gene, which may explain her newborn\u2019s unlikely pigmentation.\n\nJonah\u2019s skin color may be influenced by a process known as atavism. According to HowStuffworks, the unusual trait derives from a distant evolutionary ancestor that reappears in a modern-day organism, or in this case, a newborn. Catherine probably had a white ancestor in her family, which led to a recessive gene throughout generations. The gene possibly laid dormant until Richard\u2019s and Catherine\u2019s genes were thrown together to form Jonah\u2019s DNA.\n\nHow a white baby can be born to a black mother - the statistics of skin colour: http://t.co/fChopcmt7U pic.twitter.com/XOKXb14HlM \u00e2\u20ac\u201d Ampp3d (@ampp3d) September 1, 2014\n\n\u201cMy parents were from Nigeria and, for as far back as anyone can remember, my family have all been black,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cBut at some point there must have been a white gene in my family that has remained dormant for years and years \u2014 until now.\u201d There was one in 20 alleles, or roughly a million to one chance Catherine\u2019s recessive gene could actually impact Jonah\u2019s skin pigmentation.\n\nThe genes that control the amount of melanin, or the pigmentation in someone\u2019s skin usually operate under \u201cincomplete dominance.\u201d This means no specific trait will dominate the others as all the variant gene traits will be seen in the offspring. Children of interracial couples, like Jonah, will usually have a skin tone that reflects a mix of its parents.\n\nJonah\u2019s case follows the 2010 birth of Nmachi Ihegboro, a baby born with white skin despite having two Nigerian dark skin parents. Doctors suspect Nmachi is either the result of a gene mutation unique to her, the product of long-dormant white genes, or has some kind of mutated version of albino, which would lead to her skin darkening over time. Infidelity has been ruled out as a possibility for the Nigerian couple.\n\nDespite the initial shock of Jonah\u2019s skin color, Catherine and Richard admit they couldn\u2019t be happier, and adore their \u201cbeautiful, happy, and smiling son.\u201d \u201cThe color of his skin is of no concern \u2014 Jonah being a healthy and happy baby is what matters,\u201d Richard said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "black or white, black mom, white baby, skin color, skin pigmentation, skin tone, interracial couple, genes, recessive genes, atavism", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Catherine and Richard Howarth, an interracial couple who gave birth to a completely white baby, beat million-to-one odds, but how?", "title": "Black Mom Gives Birth To White Baby, Defying Million-To-One Odds [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/white-baby-born-black-mom-defies-million-one-odds-how-atavism-influences-skin-color-300968", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/interracial-couple-has-white-baby.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Catherine and Richard Howarth, an interracial couple who gave birth to a completely white baby, beat million-to-one odds, but how?", "title": "Black Mom Gives Birth To White Baby, Defying Million-To-One Odds [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/white-baby-born-black-mom-defies-million-one-odds-how-atavism-influences-skin-color-300968", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/interracial-couple-has-white-baby.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/interracial-couple-has-white-baby.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-03T12:40:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T12:40:50-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Catherine and Richard Howarth, an interracial couple who gave birth to a completely white baby, beat million-to-one odds, but how?"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd312\"", "article_summary": "Jonah\u2019s case follows the 2010 birth of Nmachi Ihegboro, a baby born with white skin despite having two Nigerian dark skin parents.\nJonah\u2019s skin color may be influenced by a process known as atavism.\nCatherine, along with her husband Richard, who is white, were equally astonished, after expecting their son to have darker skin.\nA Nigerian mom-to-be got an unexpected surprise in the delivery room when she gave birth to her newborn baby boy.\nChildren of interracial couples, like Jonah, will usually have a skin tone that reflects a mix of its parents."}
