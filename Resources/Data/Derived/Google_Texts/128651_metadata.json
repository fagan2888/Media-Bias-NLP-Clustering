And companies that analyze data for the collision industry say insurance rates will increase, probably 5 to 10 percent above the average premium of $590 a year that Erie Insurance Group tracks for the Pittsburgh area.\n\nFord will start production of the F-150 at its Dearborn, Mich., truck plant in the fourth quarter. The automaker hasn't given details on price, fuel mileage, repair and insurance costs \u2014 details that insurers and companies that trade on vehicle information are awaiting to better judge the impact of aluminum on consumers.\n\nFord spokesman Mike Levin said insurance costs for the F-150 will be \u201ccompetitive with other full-size trucks,\u201d noting that cost has been lower than other trucks. Overall, Levine said, \u201cthe cost of ownership will be similar or less than today's levels\u201d because of better fuel mileage and advanced materials.\n\nBut collision experts such as Rick Turri, vice president for AudaExplore in San Diego, predict repair shops will opt to replace, rather than repair, aluminum parts that are difficult to fit and finish.\n\n\u201cThis is the one getting everyone's attention,\u201d Turri said of the high-volume F-150.\n\nThe likelihood of replacing an aluminum hood is 44.1 percent, compared with 42.7 percent for steel, he said, citing 2012 industry figures. Though the difference is only 1.4 percent, \u201cwhen you're dealing with 11 million collision claims a year, that adds up for insurers,\u201d he said.\n\nFront fenders made of aluminum are replaced 55 percent of the time, compared with 52.3 percent for steel. Those differences will drive up repair costs.\n\n\u201cThe price of parts, that's when you can get into serious dollars,\u201d he said.\n\nFewer mechanics will be trained and equipped to repair the aluminum body; repairs will require training in techniques at Ford dealers and independent shops. By one estimate, fewer than 2 percent of the nation's 30,000 independent shops are certified to repair aluminum. Half as many body shops exist compared to 30 years ago, because of the cost of keeping up with technology and complexity of cars and trucks.\n\n\u201cWe've done a lot of information-gathering on this,\u201d said Greg Horn, vice president of industry relations for Mitchell International Inc. in San Diego, which provides hourly rates and times for repairs used by shops nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe labor increase, on average, was 12 percent. And for materials, it's a 35 to 40 percent increase for aluminum over previous standard models,\u201d Horn said data from aluminum Audis, Jaguars and BMWs show. He expects insurance costs to rise about 10 percent for the aluminum F-150, based on rate increases for those models.\n\n\u201cIt's sticker shock after the purchase,\u201d Horn said. \u201c... Consumers truly don't understand the cost increases until afterwards. Ford owners are loyal, and insurance costs usually don't go into the buying decision for most people.\u201d\n\nDavid Shaffer, owner of a 2013 F-150 in Aliquippa, said the added cost of aluminum parts on the upcoming model \u201cmakes me less likely to purchase one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a case of feel-good government (mileage) mandates that will force businesses that use trucks to pass the additional costs of transportation on to their customers. There is no free lunch here,\u201d Shaffer said.\n\nThe Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which crash-tests vehicles for insurers, expects to complete a study in mid-April, said spokesman Pini Calnite.\n\nThe F-150 will be the highest volume aluminum-structure vehicle in history, said Bill Visnic, auto analyst at Edmunds.com. He believes repair costs will be spread over a wider number of dealers and shops.\n\nFord sold 763,402 F-series trucks in 2013. It does not break out numbers for the F-150.\n\nAlec Gutierrez, senior market analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said accident repair costs will be \u201cmore expensive because the work is much more difficult. Where there's damage to aluminum, it's difficult to get the right fit and finish. The panels are more expensive, and consumers will pay more for labor costs to get the vehicle to factory specs.\u201d\n\nWith those challenges in mind, Ford designed the F-150 to be easier to repair, Brandt Coultas, an F-150 product marketing manager, said at the Pittsburgh International Auto Show last month. Sections of the F-150 modular frame can be replaced more easily, and its dashboard is designed for easier removal compared to past designs. \u201cBody panels are more ding- and dent-resistant,\u201d Coultas said.\n\nLevine said Ford is working to get dealers up to speed. \u201cWe estimate it will cost $30,000 to $50,000 to purchase equipment\u201d for repair work, he said. Ford is helping dealers with training costs.\n\nCoultas said Ford wants aluminum-capable repair shops to be located no more than 1.5 miles from dealers.\n\n\u201cMy fear is there won't be enough repair shops when the F-150 first comes to dealers,\u201d said Mark Miller, owner of Greater Pittsburgh Collision Works in Moon, the only area shop certified for aluminum work by Audi. \u201c... That will be the demise of the vehicle if they don't.\u201d\n\nMiller intends to become certified to fix the F-150 and thinks it will be a superior truck. Ford's $50,000 estimate to set up shop \u201cis not any more than other investments I've made,\u201d he said. Still, Ford requires specific tooling, some of it redundant. \u201cThey want a specific rivet gun. Why can't I use my Audi rivet gun that cost $10,000?\u201d\n\nJohn D.
