This is far worse than '64 and '76.\"This means, he continued, that there needs to be an understanding that Trump is named the nominee if he gets very close to the 1,237 delegates needed.Financier Steve Rattner, also on the show's panel, said that it is mathematically difficult for Trump to get that number of delegates, while for Kasich it would be mathematically impossible, and Cruz would need to win 87 percent of the remaining delegates.Ruddy said he\u2019s wrong, but that Cruz and Kasich would have to join forces early to defeat Trump.\"If you look at all the polls in a head-to-head contest, Ted Cruz beats Donald Trump 10 to 14 points in the most recent polls,\" Ruddy pointed out. \"And Kasich's people think that he's going to win in these blue states, beat Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. [Kasich] will go into a brokered convention and John is going to emerge as sort of the guy to bring the party together,\" Ruddy said. \"I think he's delusional.\"Ruddy said insiders are saying Kasich will decide after the Wisconsin primary on April 5 to see if he'll continue or end his bid. Wisconsin is a blue state, so if he succeeds there, the theory is that he could succeed in other blue states.\"He might do a deal with Ted Cruz and then you would have them winning [together],\" Ruddy said.Giridharadas pointed out that Ruddy and Trump are personal friends, and asked if he has faith that the real estate mogul will be less extreme as a nominee or as president than his has been so far.\"Look, there's two Donald Trumps,\" said Ruddy. One is \"incredibly generous, charismatic, smart, kindhearted \u2014 and then there's sort of that other Donald Trump we're seeing who is angry and petty and sometimes vindictive, and some people don't even recognize that, even his friends, to the degree he is going in that direction.\"Ruddy cited an example of Trump's real persona.Ruddy said he was speaking recently with former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik, who told him that after the 9/11 attacks, Trump called to say he was emptying out his buildings and his staffs, sending 500 to 1,000 of his people to Ground Zero to help. Trump even came to the site to help.Ruddy said when other business owners were thinking about evacuating the city, Trump took the opposite approach.\"There were no press conferences, no photo ops,\" said Ruddy. \"That's the sort of good Donald Trump that we all know. I've chatted with him and said, 'Hey, look, you've got to stop attacking all of the people that you're going to need in the general election.'\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ruddy, delusional, dangerous, trump, brokered, convention", "pubdate": "2016-03-18T14:50:32", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Donald Trump may be the likely nominee of the Republican Party, but his opponents have the \"definite ability\" to stop him from winning the nomination, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday morning.", "title": "Ruddy: 'Delusional, Dangerous' to Deny Trump Nomination in Brokered Convention", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/ruddy-delusional-dangerous-trump/2016/03/18/id/719812/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=0976b774-30ab-493e-8f14-67373f843b1d&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/ruddy-delusional-dangerous-trump/2016/03/18/id/719812/", "title": "Ruddy: 'Delusional, Dangerous' to Deny Trump Nomination in Brokered Convention", "description": "Donald Trump may be the likely nominee of the Republican Party, but his opponents have the \"definite ability\" to stop him from winning the nomination, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Friday morning.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1458312632, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "ruddy, delusional, dangerous, trump, brokered, convention", "article": {"section": "Headline", "published_time": "2016-03-18T14:50:32"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/ruddy-delusional-dangerous-trump/2016/03/18/id/719812/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Donald Trump may be the likely nominee of the Republican Party, but his opponents have the  definite ability  to stop him from winning the nomination, Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy told MSNBC's  Morning Joe  Friday morning."}, "article_summary": "\"That's the sort of good Donald Trump that we all know.\n\"And Kasich's people think that he's going to win in these blue states, beat Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.\n\"They have to either defeat Donald Trump on the first ballot, or basically coronate him, because the party is already extremely fractured,\" Ruddy said.\n\"I think if the institutional power of banks and corporations went against Donald Trump it would actually help him and make him stronger,\" said Ruddy.\n\"If you look at all the polls in a head-to-head contest, Ted Cruz beats Donald Trump 10 to 14 points in the most recent polls,\" Ruddy pointed out."}
