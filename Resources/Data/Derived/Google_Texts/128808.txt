Last week, Mercer released their annual National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans. According to they survey's findings, the cost of employer health benefits slowed to 2.1% growth in 2013 - with the average cost per employee averaging $10,779/year (including medical, dental, and other health coverage). However, employers expect the rate of growth to rebound next year, to 5.2%.

The national survey included responses from ~2,800 public and private US organizations with 10 or more employees. Here's a review of their findings.

Summary of Key Findings

Health benefits costs rose faster for very large employers (5,000+ employees) who saw average increases of 3.7% compared to ~1% for employers with less than 500 employees.

The rate of growth varied by US region. The South saw a 5.3% increase, Northeast a 3.3% increase, West a 1% increase, and Midwest only a 0.1% increase.

To reduce cost increases, small employers shifted more costs to employees via higher deductibles. Larger employers were more likely to use consumer-directed health plans or employee health management programs to control costs.

Looking to 2014, employers anticipate increase costs to cover more employees, as it's anticipated fewer employees and dependents will opt out of employer coverage because of the individual mandate.

From 2012 to 2013, consumer-directed health plans (CDHPs) rose from 16% to 18% of all covered employees, respectively. There are now as many CDHP enrollees as HMO enrollees nation-wide.

6% of larger employers say they will terminate their employee health plans in the next five years in favor of the public health insurance exchanges.

The number of small employers that say they are likely to terminate their health plans in the next five years increased from 22% in 2012 to 31% in 2013.
