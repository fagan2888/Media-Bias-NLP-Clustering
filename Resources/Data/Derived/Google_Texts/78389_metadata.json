Since then, worried motorists have been calling 911 to report that their windows, too, have been blown out mid-trip.\n\nOne theory among officials is that after the shooting, more people became worried they were also victims and began calling law enforcement.\n\n\u201cWe know we have the one confirmed shooting,\u201d said David Moore, spokesman for the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office, whose agency is investigating the shooting. \u201cThe other ones, as we\u2019ve said multiple times, there is no evidence to show the windows are being shattered by bullets.\u201d\n\nMoore said crime analysis is being completed on the cases to determine if there are any patterns. To date, however, he said there has been no connection.\n\nThe Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office has directed its patrol division to spend more time on the interstate when available as part of their investigation.\n\n\u201cAny time a window is shattered out, our guys respond to it,\u201d said Cpl. Sean Standridge, spokesman for the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cThey process the vehicle as a crime scene to look for anything inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo date, we haven\u2019t found a projectile inside any of the vehicles,\u201d Standridge said.\n\nTrooper Nate Reid of the Colorado State Patrol said the agency is monitoring the issue as well.\n\nMonday morning, two northbound lanes of I-25 were closed for about an hour while police investigated after the driver\u2019s side window of a moving semi-trailer shattered. Police determined the window was broken by road debris.\n\n\u201cWe have been asked whether we have changed anything from a materials area from the roadways,\u201d said Amy Ford, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation. \u201cWe have not.\u201d\n\nFord said there have been some tar sealant problems on I-25 just north of Denver, but that overall the highways are the same.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any way connected to the road conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing has changed for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Northern Colorado authorities: No link among shattered windows", "title": "Northern Colorado authorities: No link among shattered windows", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/11/northern-colorado-authorities-no-link-among-shattered-windows/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150511__broomfield-backupp1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150511__broomfield-backupp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T11:18:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T03:27:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office has directed its patrol division to spend more time on the interstate when available as part of their investigation.\n\u201cWe know we have the one confirmed shooting,\u201d said David Moore, spokesman for the Larimer County Sheriff\u2019s Office, whose agency is investigating the shooting.\nThe reports began pouring in after a 20-year-old Milliken woman was shot in the neck driving southbound on Interstate 25 through Larimer County late last month.\nSean Standridge, spokesman for the Weld County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nMany of the recent cases of shattered windows on moving vehicles from Broomfield to the Wyoming border can be traced to road debris \u2014 and not someone trying to do harm, authorities said Monday."}
