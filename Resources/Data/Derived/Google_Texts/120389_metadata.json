California Teachers Association in its next session.\n\nAs Harold Meyerson recently put it:\n\nin the term that will begin this fall, the court has a splendid opportunity to deliver the most partisan decision it has rendered since Bush v. Gore. When the court rules in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association , which will be argued in the coming months, the Republican-appointed justices will be able, if they so choose, to create a long-term advantage for their party over the Democrats.\n\nHow so? By following up their terrible decision in Harris v. Quinn, the conservative justices can overturn the 1977 Abood case where the court ruled that public sector workers could opt out of paying for political activities but they were still obliged to pay a portion of their union dues to go toward bargaining and administering contracts. Meyerson again explains:\n\nThat obligation, the court ruled in Abood, is essential if public employees are to have an effective right to collective bargaining. If employees can benefit from union representation without funding the union, the court reasoned, the union could be weakened to the point that it couldn\u2019t represent those employees adequately, if, indeed, at all.\n\nOf course the only reason pubic employees have unions in the first place is because the majority of those workers voted to join the union, which is obligated to represent and to negotiate for better pay and benefits for all employees whether they like the union or not.\n\nThus in the name of protecting the \u201cfreedom\u201d of those who don\u2019t want to pay dues while still receiving the benefits of union representation, the court is likely to take away the ability of unions to effectively represent those members who want a strong voice at the bargaining table.\n\nBut the consequences of this go well beyond the bargaining power of public sector unions. The political impact, which is what this case is really about, will be devastating for anyone who wants a society where ordinary people have a voice.\n\nIndeed, as Meyerson rightly notes:\n\nAs private-sector unions have dwindled in the face of four decades of employer opposition, public-sector unions have become the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful labor organizations, its leading advocates for a fairer economy and, come election time, a significant source of the legwork for get-out-the-vote operations for progressive Democratic candidates. Their concerns extend well beyond their members\u2019 immediate welfare.\n\nPublic sector unions have supported raising wages for non-union workers, protecting voting rights, expanding participation in our democracy, opening doors for new immigrants, fighting for a fair tax system, aiding community partners in social justice work, and so on. Even more importantly, they have lent a hand in voter mobilization campaigns for their own members and in communities of underrepresented voters.\n\nThat\u2019s why this pending decision on Friedrichs is the most important labor law case in decades. If successful, the right will have made America a \u201cright to work\u201d country in a way that will guarantee lower wages and more poverty for American workers.\n\nAnd if you think this is just a concern for unions or low-wage workers, think again. As The Daily Kos points out, the termination of agency fees and the subsequent gutting of the political power of the labor movement would mean the end of the Democratic Party as we know it: \u201cIf you think the Party is too cozy with Wall Street now, imagine what that would be like. Or if you want to enter the realm of the truly absurd, imagine a GOTV effort dependent upon the good graces of Hedge fund managers.\u201d\n\nThus the road toward an even more deeply entrenched plutocracy has been clearly marked, and we may be about to take yet another big step down that grave path. And with this court that only seems to see the rights of corporate \u201cpersons,\u201d our best hope lies with the possibility that Antonin Scalia will save us.\n\nYes, you read that right\u2013that guy.\n\nWhy? As Catherine Fisk has observed, Scalia was concerned that the unions\u2019 \u201cstatutory duty of fair representation creates the free rider problem\u201d in a 1991 case and this might indicate that he will have the same problem now with Friedrichs.\n\nMore recently, Fisk published a piece in Scotusblog convincingly arguing why Scalia and the rest of the high court should reject Friedrichs:\n\nThe Abood rule is a reasonable compromise among the First Amendment rights and responsibilities of unions, members, and nonmembers. The union has a legal duty to represent all employees fairly, and it can charge dissenting nonmembers only for the costs of discharging that duty. While contract negotiation and enforcement involve expressive activity, Abood allows unions to collect fees from dissenters only for their fair share of the services that the law requires the union to provide to all, and not for political activity not germane to its role as bargaining agent. That does not violate the First Amendment rights of nonmembers any more than does compelled contributions to pension and health insurance companies or utility companies or paying one\u2019s taxes.\n\nThis is sound reasoning but my money is on Scalia overcoming his previous qualms about free riders in order to take the opportunity to be the hero of the anti-union right and stack the deck against progressives for a long time to come.\n\nAs I wrote after the Harris decision, this high court is the refuge of the minority of the opulent guarding against the interests of the majority; it is a court that has made it clear they believe, along with the first justice of the Supreme Court, John Jay, that \u201cthose who own the country ought to govern it.\u201d\n\nOut of the Ashes of the Old: A New Union of \u201cInvisible\u201d Workers?\n\nBut maybe, despite all the odds stacked against unions, there is still hope. Indeed many of the most insightful observers of the trials and tribulations of the American Labor Movement concede the grim circumstances of contemporary workers inside and outside of unions, but they refuse to concede the game. In The Death and Life of American Labor: Toward a New Labor Movement, Stanley Aronowitz proposes transgressing \u201cthe rules of the current debate\u201d by calling for an overtly class-based unionism that moves beyond the old collective bargaining model that he claims is now largely hemmed in and imagines a different kind of unionism.\n\nAronowitz suggests that a new workers\u2019 movement \u201cmust be broader and more inclusive than unions . . . When unions form coalitions with community groups to fight for better educations, housing, and public transportation, or against the super-exploitation of the working poor, that shows a broader, grander conception of labor activism and suggests a basis for a new movement.\u201d\n\nAlong those lines, he argues that unions \u201cnew and old\u201d should \u201cdemand and provoke organization of the vast and growing population of precarious workers whether such unions are recognized by employers or not.\u201d Such work, according to Aronowitz, should include \u201cbuilding alliances\u201d with \u201cWorkers Centers and organizations, such as the Taxi Workers Alliances.\u201d\n\nIf this sounds like a utopian project, Aronowitz answers that, \u201c By demanding the impossible, we make it possible.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Only One Thing Can Save Us: Why America Needs a New Kind of Labor Movement, Thomas Geoghegan writes that, \u201cLabor is the only way to deal with the fault lines in our country\u2019s economy,\u201d but \u201cIn the long run, we need something fundamentally new. We need the kind of labor movement that will extend Dewey\u2019s vision of a democratic way of life: at school, in the workplace, in the ways we treat each other.\u201d\n\nAmong Geoghegan\u2019s many provocative suggestions, he joins Aronowitz in arguing that unions need to move beyond the current collective bargaining model and that a key goal should be to make the right to join a union a civil right. While Aronowitz calls for abandoning the old labor-Democratic alliance, Geoghegan thinks progressives need to \u201ccreate a crisis\u201d in the Democratic Party that forces it to shift in a more populist direction.\n\nWhat both Geoghegan\u2019s and Aronowitz\u2019s hopes are ultimately pinned on is the possibility that a new labor movement could find a way to breathe life into a broad-based struggle against economic inequality before the middle class is completely dead and American workers are left to be beggars in the neoliberal marketplace.\n\nFinally, toward the end of his brilliant study of The Age of Acquiescence, Steve Fraser, whose book contrasts the fierce resistance to plutocracy seen in \u201cthe long 19th century\u201d with today\u2019s far more passive acceptance of stark economic inequality, ponders whether, \u201cThe uprisings of the working poor at fast-food chains, at car washes, inside Fortress Walmart, and at dozens of other sites may die away\u2014or they may break through the ossified remains of the old trade union apparatus and seed the growth of wholly new organizations of the invisibles.\u201d\n\nWell, about a week ago, the National Labor Relations Board opened the door that might allow an army of workers long outside of the house of labor to fight for a right to join a union and improve their lot just as labor\u2019s friends had hoped. As the Huffington Post observed:\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, Burger King and every other company that relies on a franchise business model just suffered the legal setback they\u2019ve been fearing for years.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board ruled . . . that Browning Ferris Industries, a waste management company, qualifies as a \u201cjoint employer\u201d alongside one of its subcontractors. The decision effectively loosens the standards for who can be considered a worker\u2019s boss under labor law, and its impact will be felt in any industry that relies on franchising or outsourcing work. McDonald\u2019s, for instance, could now find itself forced to sit at the bargaining table with workers employed by a franchisee managing one of its restaurants.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal. In the case of McDonald\u2019s, roughly 90 percent of its locations are actually run by franchisees, who are typically considered the workers\u2019 employers. One of the main reasons companies choose to franchise or to outsource work to staffing agencies is to shift workplace responsibilities onto someone else. But if a fast-food brand or a hotel chain can be deemed a \u201cjoint employer\u201d along with the smaller company, it can be dragged into labor disputes and negotiations that it conveniently wouldn\u2019t have to worry about otherwise. In theory, such a precedent could even make it easier for workers to unionize as employees under the larger parent company.\n\nIndeed, as the Common Dreams headline put it, \u201cStriking Fear Into Corporate Hearts, Labor Board Hands Big Win to Workers.\u201d\n\nAnd those on the business side agree, with the New York Times reporting:\n\n\u201cThe decision today could be one of the more significant by the N.L.R.B. in the last 35 years,\u201d said Marshall Babson, a lawyer who helped write the brief for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the case and who was a Democratic appointee to the labor board in Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency. \u201cDepending on how the board applies its new \u2018indirect test,\u2019 it will likely ensnare an ever-widening circle of employers and bargaining relationships.\u201d\n\nSo just as many in the labor movement are dreading a deathblow from the Supreme Court, the NLRB may have breathed new life into the movement. Maybe, just maybe, the reports of the death of labor are premature. And that\u2019s good news because not only the state of labor, but the fate of our democracy, is at stake.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/thumbScale-626x466.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba52\"", "article_summary": "And that\u2019s good news because not only the state of labor, but the fate of our democracy, is at stake.\nAronowitz suggests that a new workers\u2019 movement \u201cmust be broader and more inclusive than unions .\nThat\u2019s why this pending decision on Friedrichs is the most important labor law case in decades.\nMeyerson again explains:That obligation, the court ruled in Abood, is essential if public employees are to have an effective right to collective bargaining.\nIn theory, such a precedent could even make it easier for workers to unionize as employees under the larger parent company."}
