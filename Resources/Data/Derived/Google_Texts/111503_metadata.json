The very word \u2014 \u201cnonfiction\u201d \u2014 somehow feels weightier, as if absorbing the book\u2019s contents is going to require more effort on their part.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in compiling this list, I\u2019ve headed straight for books that will make you forget that you\u2019re reading something serious enough to find a home in the non-fiction section of a library or bookstore. The characters in them are just as vibrant and alive as any you\u2019d find in a novel; indeed, in some cases, they are so astonishing that you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that their authors actually had invented them out of whole cloth. Their narratives are fast-paced, their stories compelling and engaging. (In a few cases, I actually found myself walking around the house with the book in front of my nose, unwilling to put it down long enough to do something mundane like pour myself a glass of lemonade, or move the clothes from the washer to the dryer.)\n\nRelated: 6 Unsung Novels You Should Read This Summer\n\nBest of all? By the time you\u2019ve finished, you\u2019ll have accumulated a vast repository of useful knowledge and interesting facts with which to baffle and impress everyone you know, about everything from pirate ships to the beacons that enable air travel; from the perils of technological innovation to those of well intentioned philanthropy; from the golden age of New York journalism to the \u201cgolden\u201d age of Wall Street investment banking.\n\n\u201cSkyfaring\u201d by Mark Vanhoenacker\n\nWhen we board a long-haul flight, we tend to give little thought to its pilot, beyond hoping that he\u2019ll get us to our destination safely. Vanhoenacker is one of those individuals piloting Boeing 747s worldwide, and he takes us not just into the cockpit, but into the interior life of a pilot \u2014 what it\u2019s like to experience not only jet lag but \u201cplace lag\u201d; how pilots swap routes (\u201cI\u2019ll give you my Johannesburg for your Los Angeles\u201d), sometimes because their bodies cope better with flying west than east; how flying through cumulus clouds, the kind featured in rococo paintings, is akin to \u201cwalking on air\u201d. Into this elegant narrative, Vanhoenacker weaves a mass of technical detail about flight today, and what\u2019s involved, from beacons marking the way to calculating the weight of the fuel his plane must carry. You\u2019ll never, ever think about air travel the same way again, and if you read this on a flight, the author\u2019s own fascination may just prove contagious enough to offset the irritation of the toddler in the seat behind you kicking you in the small of the back. (Knopf; June 2015; $25.95)\n\n\u201cMan in Profile: Joseph Mitchell of The New Yorker\u201d by Thomas Kunkel\n\nWhen he was still a child, North Carolina native Joseph Mitchell decided that New York was the right city for him \u2014 and the city, in its turn, opened its arms to him when he moved there on the eve of the Great Depression, in the autumn of 1929. Working like a demon, Mitchell began turning out the meticulously written and carefully observed profiles for which he would become so well known that his newspaper even used his byline to advertise on the sides of buses. Ultimately, it was The New Yorker with which Mitchell\u2019s fate would be most closely entwined. When people today think of a golden age of New York, it is Mitchell\u2019s New York \u2013 dirt, grime, war and economic woes notwithstanding. This is a biography worthy of Mitchell himself \u2014 and of his city.

But Canadian journalists McNish and Silcoff have gone several steps further, and produced a tragedy worthy of Shakespeare\u2019s attention. The story of what happened to BlackBerry isn\u2019t about a single company, however, as the authors wisely note: It\u2019s about how ambitious entrepreneurs deal with change and challenges to their ideas, and about how they respond to an evolving marketplace. So even as you read, with a kind of shiver of schadenfreude, about BlackBerry\u2019s vicissitudes, there\u2019s plenty of food for thought here about what this means on a much broader stage. (Flatiron Books; May 2015; $27.99)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Still Here Ya Bastards: How the People of New Orleans Rebuilt Their City\u201d by Roberta Brandes Gratz\n\nIn the wake of Hurricane Katrina, urban planners, philanthropists and politicians all had Big Ideas about what to do about New Orleans. Some were bizarre \u2014 like just tearing it down completely and scattering the city\u2019s population around the country, an idea made feasible since anti-blight funds were available for demolition but not for rebuilding. Others were aggressively ambitious: using the damage as a way to reinvent New Orleans as some kind of model 21st city. Roberta Brandes Gratz tells us what has actually worked: a kind of patchwork grassroots set of efforts that have evolved organically, with locals teaming up with volunteers who ended up making New Orleans their new home. While there are no rose-tinted spectacles here, Gratz has put firmly to one side the gloom and doom stories of Katrina itself to focus on the rebuilding, and how it is working. And while her book focuses squarely on New Orleans, there are plenty of lessons here, about urban development, about inner-city poverty, about racism, about education reform and even democracy itself, that we could all learn if we read carefully between the lines. (NationBooks; June 2015; $27.99)\n\n\u201cStraight to Hell: True Tales of Deviance, Debauchery and Billion-Dollar Deals\u201d by John LeFevre\n\nFor years, Goldman Sachs obsessively tried to find who on earth was behind the Twitter account @GSElevator, which tweeted overheard comments allegedly made by Wall Street bankers, such as, \u201cI never give money to homeless people. I can\u2019t reward failure in good conscience.\u201d When it turned out that John LeFevre, a former Citigroup bond markets exec in Asia, was behind the moniker \u2014 and that while he had once received a job offer from Goldman, he had never worked there \u2014 Simon & Schuster canceled the book\u2019s publication, leaving it to be picked up by Grove Atlantic. (It\u2019s dedicated to LeFevre\u2019s wife and children, \u201con the condition that you never read it.\u201d) True, the contents won\u2019t surprise or even shock anyone who has read other books about Wall Street\u2019s misdeeds, and the narrative stops dead just as the financial crisis gets going. And if you think that this is all there is to Wall Street, well, you\u2019ll need to stop and think again. But it\u2019s a fun summer read that offers a useful corrective to the pious platitudes uttered by Wall Street CEOs at their just-ended annual meetings.

In this fast-paced, artfully structured yarn, two ocean-going adventurers head off in search of the rarest of all possible underwater wrecks, something far harder to find than a galleon stuffed with pieces of eight: what is left of the flagship of a British pirate captain, sunk off the Dominican Republic more than three centuries ago. Time is racing \u2014 new laws may stop the treasure hunters in their tracks, while claim jumpers are watching their every move. And their sponsor has his own fixed idea about where the wreck is. They\u2019ll have to delve back into the documented history and above all, start to think like their mysterious pirate, who had suddenly abandoned his respectable career as a merchant ship\u2019s captain, in order to stand a chance of success.
