John Kasich\u2019s strategy for winning the Republican presidential nomination boils down to hanging around until the convention in July and hoping that the other two candidates, businessman Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, are just so unpalatable that the delegates turn to him instead.\n\nHowever, he has rarely said it as plainly as he did during a strange and rambling interview with The Washington Post editorial board on Wednesday.\n\nRelated: Cruz Says He Can Still Win, But His Campaign Sends a Different Message\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think at the end they\u2019re going to pick somebody who\u2019s going to pick somebody who\u2019s going to lose in November. I just don\u2019t believe it. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019ve been wrong before. But I just think it\u2019s very hard for them to pick somebody who they know is going down, because who\u2019s going to be there?\u201d\n\nBut for all his assurance on that question, the interview transcript suggests a candidate weirdly disengaged from the race he is running, and even the party he wants to represent.\n\nOf the convention he said, \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t know all this other delegate stuff because I don\u2019t spend time on it.\u201d He even claimed not to know the number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination -- 1,237 -- though the figure has been in virtually every news report about the race for weeks.\n\nHe criticized the Republican Party as a whole for its general negative outlook. \u201cSee, I am a fundamental believer in ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have ideas, you got nothing. And frankly, my Republican Party doesn\u2019t like ideas. They want to be negative against things.\n\nRelated: Another Super Tuesday? Trump and Clinton Lead ... for Now\n\n\u201cNow we got \u2013 we\u2019ve had a few who have been idea people. We had Reagan. Okay, Saint Ron. We had Kemp, he was an idea guy. We had, you know, I\u2019d say Paul. Paul is driven mostly by ideas, Paul Ryan. He likes ideas. But you talk about most of them, most of them \u2013 the party is kind of a knee jerk against. Maybe that\u2019s how they were created. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nDiscussing the coming nominating convention and the need for the party to rally behind a single candidate, he opined, \u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 and you know what, the party \u2013 like I one time looked behind the curtain and there was nobody there. There is no kind of party. The party is an amalgamation of all the people who\u2019ve raised money and been involved in politics and you know, like yesterday I was in Maryland. I think that\u2019s where I was. I was in Maryland. So Ehrlich was there. And then there\u2019s this guy there who\u2019s run like a bunch of campaigns. He\u2019s raised tons of money for Ehrlich and all. Just a regular old guy. I mean, he doesn\u2019t \u2013 I mean, he\u2019s the party.\u201d\n\nHe was also curtly dismissive when challenged on various things, such as his change of position on birthright citizenship between supporting a bill opposing it while in Congress and supporting it as a governor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just like, I mean, birthright citizenship, I probably signed onto some bill. It\u2019s like, who cares?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cYou\u2019re a congressman. Sometimes you sign on, you\u2019ve got all this stuff coming across your desk, let\u2019s not get over serious about this. It never passed.\u201d\n\nRelated: Does a Tamer Trump Risk Losing His Mojo?\n\nWhen he was asked about the lack of details in his tax and fiscal proposals -- something that the Tax Policy Center, the Tax Foundation, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget have all said makes analysis of his proposals impossible -- he seemed annoyed that anyone should even be questioning him on the topic.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s 28, 25, 10 with an earned income tax credit and fewer deductions. Deductions for state and local taxes and charity. That\u2019s what the plan is. Okay? It\u2019s not \u2013 I mean, what more do you need? I can tell you what the rates are. I mean, what\u2019s so difficult about this? That\u2019s the outline of it. What else do we need? It\u2019s like how are you going to balance the budget? What, I\u2019m going to send you a 30-page document here that shows all the little details of this? I mean, come on.\u201d\n\nThe interview went on in that vein at length, with Kasich arguing, in the end, that the board should take his word for it when he says he\u2019ll balance the federal budget and cut taxes because he\u2019s done it before.\n\nAt another point, Kasich flatly said that a carbon tax would not work to reduce pollution. When one of the members of the editorial board rightly pointed out that virtually all economists disagree with him on that point, his response was, \u201cYou know, look, I am not going to get into that. I don\u2019t think so, and you know, all economists, is that like all pollsters? Is that like all pundits? I mean who are these people, you know?\u201d\n\nRelated: Hey GOP -- Maybe It\u2019s Time to Really Rig This Election\n\nIn one of the odder moments, he even dismissed the idea that residents of the District of Columbia should have representation in Congress on purely partisan political grounds.\n\n\u201cWhat about voting rights in Congress, voting representatives?\u201d he was asked by Jo-Ann Armao, an associated editorial page editor.\n\n\u201cProbably not. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d have to, I mean, to me, that\u2019s just, I just don\u2019t see that we really need that, okay? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut you realize though that people in D.C. pay taxes, go to war and they have no vote in Congress,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: Donald Trump Has Reason to Cry Foul Over a \u2018Rigged\u2019 Election\n\n\u201cYeah, well look, I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 I am not, because you know what, what it really gets down to if you want to be honest is because they know that\u2019s just more votes in the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nKasich spent a portion of the interview complaining that he\u2019s not getting the sort of press attention that the other candidates are. Reading the transcript, that\u2019s easy to believe, because Kasich is speaking like a guy who thinks nobody\u2019s really paying attention to what he says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Kasich came across as the interview transcript suggests a candidate oddly disengaged from the race he is running, and even the party he wants to represent.", "title": "John Kasich Just Gave a Really Weird Interview to the Washington Post", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/21/John-Kasich-Just-Gave-Really-Weird-Interview-Washington-Post", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04212016_John_Kasich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/21/John-Kasich-Just-Gave-Really-Weird-Interview-Washington-Post", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04212016_John_Kasich.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kasich came across as the interview transcript suggests a candidate oddly disengaged from the race he is running, and even the party he wants to represent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "I don\u2019t know.\nRelated: Cruz Says He Can Still Win, But His Campaign Sends a Different Message\u201cI don\u2019t think at the end they\u2019re going to pick somebody who\u2019s going to pick somebody who\u2019s going to lose in November.\nI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said.\nI\u2019d have to, I mean, to me, that\u2019s just, I just don\u2019t see that we really need that, okay?\nI think that\u2019s where I was."}
