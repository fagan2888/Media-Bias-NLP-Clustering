And I consider that an opportunity\u2026\u201d\n\nMore than half a century ago, Don and Elvira met while teaching school in a little town in Kansas. They built their life together, moving to Colorado, raising two daughters, and now have two grandchildren. Today, their love story continues in a new way \u2014 with Don as Elvira\u2019s family caregiver.\n\n\u201cWe discovered she had dementia. I did not know what that was and how this would change our relationship,\u201d Don shares. Today Elvira cannot be alone; so Don is with her 24-7-365. He manages her medications, cooks her meals, drives her to medical appointments, and everything else along the way.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve lived with someone for 50-some years, it\u2019s only natural then, what happens to her and with her, I\u2019m a part of that.\u201d \u2014Don\n\nFor Don, this new role as caregiver is part of what it means to be married, but the experience can be overwhelming. \u201cI love Elvira very much, and I want to take care of her so she can stay in our home. Still, being a caregiver is challenging, and while I will continue to be there for my wife, in sickness and in health, I could use a little help.\u201d\n\nClick here to read more of Don\u2019s story or share your own.\n\nFighting for you\n\nThat\u2019s why AARP is fighting to make sure family caregivers, like Don, have access to the support they need as they help their spouses, parents and other loved ones live independently at home. Here are some of the ways:\n\n\n\nTo all the family caregivers out there, to everyone caring for someone they love,\n\nhappy Valentine\u2019s Day!\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nTo stay up to date or to get involved with AARP\u2019s caregiving advocacy in the states, sign up for the AARP Advocates e-newsletter or visit your state Web page.\n\nFor tools and resources, visit aarp.org/caregiving.\n\nTo share your story and connect with others, visit aarp.org/iheartcaregivers.\n\nTo find out how AARP is fighting for you, check out aarp.org/SupportCaregivers.\n\nElaine Ryan is the vice president of state advocacy and strategy integration (SASI) for AARP.
