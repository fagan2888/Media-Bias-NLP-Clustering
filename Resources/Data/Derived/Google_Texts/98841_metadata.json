We wait!\n\nIt is now a day or two later and apparently, he was correct. We see or hear of no repercussions from the liberal, far left media so can we suppose that the pendulum is swinging back, and it\u2019s once again okay to use the \u201cN\u201d word. Fat chance!\n\nThis dinner was a celebration of Obama\u2019s blackness, a tepid recognition, supposedly, of his accomplishments. Whatever he has done, will forever be cast in the light of the liberal mantra of \u2018doing good and meaning well.\u2019 One article I read said it was the start of Obama\u2019s canonization, where he will soon become sweet Jesus, then Saint Obama. Too bad he\u2019s not Catholic! Sad actually, because Islam has no Saints and he is no prophet! He has no where to go.\n\nLet\u2019s briefly examine his accomplishments: Obama touts, as his major achievements, the unenforceable and collapsing Iranian nuclear agreement. He brags about his Paris climate accord and his Asian nations trade deal (TPP). Nowhere does Obama, or his mouth pieces, make a clear case why these issues matter or how they advance our national well being.\n\nYet, he claim no responsibility, not even marginally, for the Libyan debacle, the Benghazi murders, Fast and Furious, the less than 3% annual GDP for eight years, the loss of America\u2019s work force, the importation of Islamic Jihadists, or the disaster that is Obamacare. Admittedly, Osama bin Ladin\u2019s death did occurred on his watch and somehow he has managed to get the GOP to fund all his schemes, soaring America\u2019s debt and deficits to near bankruptcy levels.\n\nObama\u2019s self image is that he is a wise, strong leader who stands courageously committed to his Progressive principles in enforcing unconstitutional domestic policies; his determination to stamp out the 2nd amendment, his regret that Americans refuse to embrace his global warming climate policies that is allegedly threatening the environment, and the desperate need that government must increase taxes on the producers and the wealthy, to fund his wild schemes.\n\nOne must certainly ask just who is this wonderful man and why isn\u2019t he doing things for the country instead of against it? Well, it\u2019s because Obama is clueless when it comes to governing. He practices a \u201clet\u2019s wait and see\u201d policy before rendering any decision, but only after collision with his Progressive brain trust.\n\nNo president has ever demonstrated such sheer incompetence in foreign affairs. His foreign policy has been a failure involving America in campaigns it can no longer afford to fix. His indecision, both militarily and diplomatically, failed to remove Bashar Assad from Syria, (remember his \u201cred line\u201d) thus encouraging the genocide that followed, the involvement of Russia and Iran in that country and the total loss of US influence, with friends and allies alike.\n\nThe Egyptians managed to repair his meddling in their affairs with the violent ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood. Obama\u2019s learned reaction: \u201cWe have determined that we don\u2019t need to make a determination.\u201d Maybe, but history will! Remember, freedom is the goal, the Constitution is the way. Now, go get \u2018em!
