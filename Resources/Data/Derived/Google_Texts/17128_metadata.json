The researchers provided state-by-state estimates of potential churning if all states expanded Medicaid under healthcare reform and identified predictors of rates within states.\n\nResearchers expect churning to prove costly for insurers and states, with consumers ending up with coverage gaps in their insurance or being forced to switch health plans or providers, as FierceHealthPayer previously reported.\n\nThe study concluded:\n\nApproximately half of adults who are likely to be eligible for Medicaid or subsidized marketplace coverage will experience changes in eligibility within 12 months.\n\nAlthough all states will likely see high churning rates, small differences in the rates occurred across states. Those with lower poverty rates and higher per capita incomes were likely to experience higher rates as individuals' eligibility shifts between Medicaid and premium subsidies.\n\nStates with more generous eligibility criteria for their Medicaid programs before adoption of the ACA had higher churning rates.\n\nDisruptions in care from churning will be more serious in states choosing not to expand their Medicaid programs in 2014, the researchers said. Those states will have large gaps in eligibility for many low-income adults whose incomes will be too high for Medicaid but too low for tax credits.\n\nThe researchers said transition issues will require attention in the future, with every state needing to address the problem. Policy options for states to reduce the frequency and impact of churning include adopting 12-month continuous eligibility for adults in Medicaid, creating a basic health program, using Medicaid funds to subsidize marketplace coverage for low-income adults, and encouraging health insurers to offer plans in Medicaid and the marketplaces.\n\nBased on its projections, the study found that across all states, an estimated 63 percent to 72 percent of adults did not experience changes in their eligibility during the first six months. In all but two states, 40 percent to 55 percent of adults did not experience any changes during a year's time.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the full Health Affairs study\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nExpect more ACA legislation coming down the pike\n\nHow can states, insurers prevent churning?\n\nWhy Congress must act to extend CHIP\n\nMedicaid enrollment soars under healthcare reform", "article_metadata": {"description": "So-called churning--where eligibility changes will occur between Medicaid and health insurance exchanges--is likely to be a major challenge in every state as Affordable Care Act implementation continues, a recent study finds.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "So-called churning--where eligibility changes will occur between Medicaid and health insurance exchanges--is likely to be a major challenge in every state as Affordable Care Act implementation continues, a recent study finds.", "title": "Medicaid, exchange churning to occur in all 50 states", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/medicaid-and-exchange-churning-occur-all-50-states/2014-03-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "churning,Eligibility Changes,health insurance exchange,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Medicaid,reform implementation", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ddf\"", "article_summary": "Although all states will likely see high churning rates, small differences in the rates occurred across states.\nThe researchers provided state-by-state estimates of potential churning if all states expanded Medicaid under healthcare reform and identified predictors of rates within states.\nStates with more generous eligibility criteria for their Medicaid programs before adoption of the ACA had higher churning rates.\nDisruptions in care from churning will be more serious in states choosing not to expand their Medicaid programs in 2014, the researchers said.\nTo learn more:- read the full Health Affairs studyRelated Articles:Expect more ACA legislation coming down the pikeHow can states, insurers prevent churning?"}
