Tom Cole, whose state would benefit from extension of Keystone XL, seemed to speak for many in his party when he told reporters: \u201cOpposing Keystone is economically, diplomatically and environmentally irresponsible. The president\u2019s final decision confirms that he\u2019s more interested in catering to radical environmental extremists than with creating jobs and encouraging energy independence.\u201d\n\n\n\nMany were left wondering if the issue could be raised with the next president.\n\n\n\nObama announced his rejection on Friday.\n\n\n\nHe complained of what he called \u201cthe overinflated role in our political discourse,\u201d and cited the environmental cause of climate change as the principal reason for permitting the pipeline to cross from Canada into the U.S. In his words, \u201cif we\u2019re going to prevent large parts of the earth from becoming inhospitable or uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we\u2019re going to have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground rather than burn them.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlmost to a person, Republicans in Congress denounced his decision. Cole summed it up when told reporters: \u201cStudies have shown that pipeline transport is cheaper, more efficient and more environmentally sound than any other means of moving oil.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe war of words over Keystone came less than two months after a nationwide survey conducted by the Neilsen Company for the American Petroleum Institute found American voters favoring Keystone XL by a margin of 68 percent to 21 percent.\n\n\n\nThe same survey found Keystone XL is supported across the political spectrum (Republicans 91 percent, independents 62 percent, Democrats 52 percent).\n\n\n\nAs to whether those figure will hold up on the campaign trail next year and have an impact, however, some Republicans were skeptical. \u201cKeystone will only be an issue if gas prices rise precipitously,\u201d veteran North Carolina GOP consultant Marc Rotterman told me.\n\n\n\nFormer Rep. John Linder, R.-Ga., a past chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that the president\u2019s decision \u201cwill serve to dampen union ardor in 2016, but otherwise, the issue will fade. We will have higher costs and more spills next year, but by then we will be used to it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother past NRCC head, former Rep. Tom Davis, R.-Va., was slightly more optimistic about the political punch packed by Keystone. \u201cIt\u2019s a good issue for which to resonate support in oil patch areas and coal country,\u201d Davis told me, \u201cPolling is good on this. However, academia and environmentalists also get fired up on the other way.\u201d\n\n\n\nMichael Barone, one of the co-authors of the \u201cAlmanac of American Politics,\u201d predicted the furor over Keystone would be a \u201cminor issue in \u201916 in that it was an example of how Democrats want to increase energy costs and decrease energy supply.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Frum, columnist for the Atlantic and a past White House speechwriter to George W. Bush, told me, \u201cThe alternative to Keystone is that Canadian oil moves unsafely by rail, not safely by pipeline. Railway oil has already caused one horribly lethal accident on Canadian soil, at Lac Magentic in Quebec in 2013.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe U.S. isn\u2019t immune. And when oil markets tighten again, as they always do, Americans will discover the true cost of the president\u2019s decision to cut access to America\u2019s most reliable and secure source of oil.\u201d\n\n\n\nNoting that Canadian\u2019s just-inaugurated Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced disappointment in the president\u2019s decision, Frum said that \u201cat this point, there aren\u2019t many world leaders with whom President Obama has a cordial relationship. I expect the Justin Trudeau people are very eagerly looking forward to a Hillary Clinton presidency.\u201d\n\n\n\nJohn Gizzi is chief political columnist and White House correspondent for Newsmax.\n\n\u00a9 2016 Newsmax.
