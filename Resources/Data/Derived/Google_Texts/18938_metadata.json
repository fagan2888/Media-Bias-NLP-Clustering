Then, drivers will receive a credit to offset the 30 cents per gallon gas taxes they pay at the pump.\n\nThe state is in the trial phases of this voluntary tax initiative and the transportation department has recruited 5,000 volunteer drivers to try the program.\n\nOregon aims to eventually replace gasoline gallon taxes with per-mile taxes.\n\n\u201cIf you look at your water, power and other utility bills, you pay by how much you use. Transportation funding should operate the same way,\u201d Art James, a volunteer in the program testified on the OReGO website.\n\nOregonians can use the OReGO calculator to discover if this new tax would save or cost them money. For example, a driver who drives 700 miles a month with a car that receives 25 miles per gallon would see a monthly increase of $2.10 with OReGO compared to the state gasoline tax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily designed to save people money,\u201d explained Michael Sargent, a research associate at The Heritage Foundation who specializes in transportation and infrastructure.\n\nRather, Oregon is trying out a new method to see if there is a better way to tax everybody who uses the road.\n\n\u201cEach state has their own unique needs and they should be able to experiment with ways to fund their own transportation systems free from burdensome federal mandates,\u201d Sargent said.\n\nWhile the new tax aims to implement a more equitable method of collecting taxpayer dollars for roads based on usage, it comes with some privacy and security concerns.\n\nTwo of the three devices that transportation department offers to drivers, made by Verizon and Azuga, are GPS systems and have the ability to track a car\u2019s location and a driver\u2019s exact movements. The third option, the ODOT Account Manager, only tracks miles driven and fuel consumed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oregon becomes the first state to implement a tax that charges drivers by the miles they drive instead of the gallons of gas they purchase.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Oregon becomes the first state to implement a tax that charges drivers by the miles they drive instead of the gallons of gas they purchase.", "title": "Oregon Tries Taxing Drivers By Miles They Drive", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Oregon-Tax-Feature-Edit.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-07T18:22:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1HLMzKW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Oregon becomes the first state to implement a tax that charges drivers by the miles they drive instead of the gallons of gas they purchase.", "title": "Oregon Tries Taxing Drivers By Miles They Drive", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Oregon-Tax-Feature-Edit.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2015-07-07T17:24:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-07T18:22:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Oregon, tax, driving, roads, gallon, mile, gasoline, ODOT, transportation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1548\"", "article_summary": "Under the new program, called OReGO, drivers will only pay for the miles they drive.\nUsing OReGO, drivers will pay one-and-a-half cents per mile they drive.\nRather, Oregon is trying out a new method to see if there is a better way to tax everybody who uses the road.\nThen, drivers will receive a credit to offset the 30 cents per gallon gas taxes they pay at the pump.\nLast week, Oregon became the first state in the U.S. to give drivers the option to be taxed by the mile instead of by the fuel they use."}
