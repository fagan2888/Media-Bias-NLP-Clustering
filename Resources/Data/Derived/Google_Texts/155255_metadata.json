Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) was developed in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn, an MIT-trained scientist. In her cover story for the February 3 issue of Time magazine, Kate Pickert quoted Kabat-Zinn: \u201cIt was always my intention that mindfulness move into the mainstream. This is something that people are now finding compelling in many countries and many cultures. The reason is the science.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was the annual World Economic Forum in Davos where, according to Otto Scharmer (another MIT man), writing for the Huffington Post, corporate mindfulness is at the \u201ctipping point.\u201d Scharmer writes, \u201cMindfulness practices like meditation are now used in technology companies such as Google and Twitter (amongst others), in traditional companies in the car and energy sectors, in state-owned enterprises in China, and in UN organizations, governments, and the World Bank.\u201d\n\nSo, the narrative conjunction of these two zeitgeist themes would seem to be this: In the future, \u201chigh earners\u201d will work with \u201cintelligent machines\u201d (aka robots); the robots will drive them crazy; but they will have happy, productive lives thanks to neuroscience-certified mindfulness.\n\nThis narrative leaves out what few people are commenting on: corporate economics and Buddhism are two very different ways of thinking. For all of their countercultural pretensions, mega-corporations like Google, Amazon and Apple are still corporations. They seek profits, they try to maximize their monopoly power, they externalize costs, and, of course, they exploit labor. Apple\u2019s dreadful labor practices in China are common knowledge, and those Amazon packages with the sunny smile issue forth from warehouses that are more like Blake\u2019s \u201cdark satanic mills\u201d than they are the new employment model for the Internet age.\n\nThe technology industry has manufactured images of the rebel hacker and hipster nerd, of products that empower individual and social change, of new ways of doing business, and now of a mindful capitalism. Whatever truth might attach to any of these, the fact is that these are impressions that are carefully managed to get us to keep buying their products. In that very basic sense, it is business as usual.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Business as usual: Rebel posturing and \"mindfulness training\" can't cover up tech world's awful labor standards", "author": "Curtis White and Andrew Cooper", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Business as usual: Rebel posturing and \"mindfulness training\" can't cover up tech world's awful labor standards", "title": "Apple and Amazon\u2019s big lie: The rebel hacker and hipster nerd is a capitalist stooge", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/08/apple_and_amazons_big_lie_the_rebel_hacker_and_hipster_nerd_is_a_capitalist_stooge/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bezos_cook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Business as usual: Rebel posturing and \"mindfulness training\" can't cover up tech world's awful labor standards", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bezos_cook.jpg", "title": "Apple and Amazon\u2019s big lie: The rebel hacker and hipster nerd is a capitalist stooge", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Apple and Amazon\u2019s big lie: The rebel hacker and hipster nerd is a capitalist stooge", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, Apple, Buddhism, Capitalism, Editor's Picks, Google, greed, Neuroscience", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7314\"", "article_summary": "For all of their countercultural pretensions, mega-corporations like Google, Amazon and Apple are still corporations.\nRobots and meditation wouldn\u2019t seem at first glance to have a lot to do with each other, but closer inspection reveals that they do.\nThis is so largely because the way in which the business world understands meditation (specifically forms derived from what Buddhists call \u201cmindfulness\u201d) is driven not by Buddhism but by science.\nThe technology industry has manufactured images of the rebel hacker and hipster nerd, of products that empower individual and social change, of new ways of doing business, and now of a mindful capitalism.\nThis narrative leaves out what few people are commenting on: corporate economics and Buddhism are two very different ways of thinking."}
