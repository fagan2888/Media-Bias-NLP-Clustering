(AP) \u2014 Mines built this company town. Could vines \u2014 the wine grapes growing on a former strip mine in the hills above \u2014 help to draw visitors here?\n\nJack and Sandra Looney sure hope so.\n\nTheir Highland Winery \u2014 housed in the lovingly restored, mustard-yellow \u201ccompany store\u201d \u2014 pays tribute to coal-mining\u2019s history here, as do their signature wines: Blood, Sweat and Tears.\n\n\u201cThe Coal Miner\u2019s Blood sells more than any of them,\u201d Jack Looney says of the sweet red.\n\nHe and his wife have converted the store\u2019s second and third floors into a bed and breakfast. They\u2019ve also bought and restored a couple dozen of the old coal company houses as rentals, and rooms fill up during their annual spring Miner\u2019s Memorial Festival.\n\nSeco, like so many Central Appalachian communities, owes its existence to coal \u2014 its very name an acronym for South East Coal Company. But as mining wanes, officials across the region are looking for something to replace the traditional jobs and revenues.\n\nIn some of the poorest, most remote counties, about the only alternative people can come up with is tourism \u2014 eco-, adventure, or, as with the Looneys, historical and cultural. There are mining museums, festivals, wilderness adventures. Sub-regions have been rechristened with alluring names like the Hatfield-McCoy Mountains or the PA Wilds.\n\nWill it work? Proponents point to the region\u2019s assets, its natural beauty, its distinctive mountain character \u2014 and characters (like the feuding Hatfields and McCoys). But others note the paradoxes: Environmental degradation alongside unspoiled areas, a history of poor education that for decades didn\u2019t preclude high-paying jobs, an away-from-it-all feel partly caused by a lack of good roads and other infrastructure.\n\nThere\u2019s a gap between desires and infrastructure in many areas hoping to develop tourism, says University of Tennessee researcher Tim Ezzell. \u201cWe have community colleges that will teach you to be an X-ray tech, but they don\u2019t have culinary arts,\u201d he said.\n\nFor all but a lucky few places with both assets and access, recent studies and spending data suggest, tourism may be a dubious savior.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of really odd that economic practitioners push tourism to be a propulsive industry when it has such low wages,\u201d says Suzanne Gallaway, an adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a panacea,\u201d adds tourism consultant Carole Morris. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be that cure-all.\u201d\n\nAppalachia covers 205,000 square miles, encompassing 420 counties in 13 states, from northeast Mississippi to southwest New York, according to the official definition offered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. West Virginia is the only state wholly included.\n\nThe region includes many cities and has a range of industries. But many areas in Central Appalachia are at an economic crossroads, as mining and logging give way to services jobs.\n\nSociologist Rebecca Scott, author of a book on mountaintop removal in her native West Virginia, says, \u201cIt\u2019s important to really point out the situation of the state being caught between the condition of being an extraction economy, a sacrifice zone, and yet having most of its sort of long-term successes in tourism being around nature-based tourism. I think that it\u2019s a really big contradiction.\u201d\n\nGallaway, who did her doctoral thesis on tourism development in the region, found that while tourism and hospitality accounted for 16 percent of all jobs in the region, those sectors produced just 7 percent of the wages.\n\n\u201cI think tourism can always be part of a diverse economy,\u201d says Gallaway, who teaches at UNCG\u2019s Bryan School for Sustainable Tourism and Hospitality. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t put all of my eggs in that basket, no matter who you are.\u201d\n\nA look at some tourism initiatives around the region shows challenges as well as successes.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA\n\nA 2012 report compiled for the Mountain State\u2019s Division of Tourism found that spending and hospitality employment have been slow to grow in many counties.\n\nA glaring exception was Harrison County, where direct tourism spending has more than doubled since 2004 \u2014 to $142 million \u2014 and hospitality employment has increased by more than 50 percent. But those numbers can be deceiving.\n\nMany rooms in the area\u2019s hotels are being occupied by workers drilling in the nearby Marcellus shale formation, as coal has been replaced by hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas, says county commission president Ron Watson.\n\nAccording to the economic report, tourism-related jobs in the Hatfield-McCoy Mountains \u2014 the marketing label for a cluster of coal-producing counties \u2014 actually dropped from 1,400 to 1,300 from 2004 to 2012.\n\nAnother area that includes the New River Gorge and the Greenbrier resort shed 700 tourism-related jobs during the period, the report shows.\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nMorris, who was head of cultural tourism for the state of Kentucky before opening her own consultancy, says there\u2019s a fine line between squashing initiative and encouraging pipe dreams.\n\n\u201cI have rarely been in a place where tourism was impossible,\u201d says Morris. \u201cThere\u2019s always something interesting, something in the history of a community that brings people.\u201d\n\nStill, in places where tourism seemed less viable, she saw her job as \u201cmanaging those expectations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mining for tourists?
