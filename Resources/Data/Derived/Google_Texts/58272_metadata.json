You have said that you knew nothing about it and I have to accept that out of respect. However, people with whom you work very closely somehow got the idea that that was okay. And, I'm worried about having a president who has people around him who think that that's okay. I feel like the people of Fort Lee were the sacrificial lambs. It reminds me of feudal times -- I'm furious. Feudal times when the king would say, 'Who cares about the peasants?\u2019\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s answer went on for several minutes. It was passionate and defensive. And as he went further on the topic than he has in public in more than a year, he dropped clues about how he will handle the controversy as he runs an expected campaign for president at the same time as criminal cases involving the three alleged Bridgegate conspirators wind their way through the courts.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, Bridgegate doesn\u2019t seem to matter to most New Hampshire Republicans. He wasn\u2019t asked about it in dozens of other conversations with voters this week, and those interviewed dismissed it as \u201cthe bridge thing.\u201d His potential competitors aren\u2019t bringing it up, either. I asked former Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Friday in New Hampshire if it was an issue, and he said no -- Christie, he said, handled the situation \u201cappropriately.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut the specter of scandal appears to have weighed down Christie\u2019s popularity. The latest New Hampshire poll had him as the choice of just 3 percent of GOP voters. That\u2019s why his answer -- which smoothed over some details but was described by one voter as \u201cabout as brilliant as I\u2019ve heard any politician deal with any scandal like that\u201d -- is so important to determining his path forward. Here are excerpts and annotations:\n\nFirst off, I appreciate, out of respect, whether you really believe it or not, that you believe me. Okay? Because I didn't know. And the reason you should believe I didn't know is that it was so monumentally stupid. You can think a lot of different things of me. People can think a lot of different things about me, people have called me a lot of different things over time -- stupid has never been one of them.\n\nChristie\u2019s first defense about the fundamental question behind the closures -- did he approve it? -- is that it was too dumb to have been directed from someone as smart as he is. But the other question is whether his administration created an environment in which this plan of political retaliation against the mayor of Fort Lee was allowed to take hold. Christie dismissed that idea as recently as this week when a reporter raised it. Yet the federal Bridgegate indictment points to an instance in which several meetings between Christie cabinet members and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop were suddenly cancelled after Fulop decided not to endorse the governor\u2019s reelection. Such a non-endorsement from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich is allegedly why the lanes were closed.\n\nThat day, the people who, based on the information I had, I believed were responsible for this, were fired.\n\nOnly one person whom Christie said was responsible for this -- Bridget Anne Kelly, his former deputy chief of staff -- was fired. The two others whom US Attorney Paul Fishman alleges are responsible -- the Port Authority\u2019s David Wildstein and Bill Baroni -- had actually resigned a month earlier, before the full scope of the scandal was clear. Christie edited the resignation statement about Wildstein to make it more laudatory. And at the time the governor said Baroni was planning to leave anyway. If they were pushed out due to Bridgegate, Christie has never acknowledged that.\n\n\n\nI went out and stood in front of the national press corps -- and New Jersey and New York and Philadelphia -- for an hour and 50 minutes. Five zero. And took every question. Less than 24 hours after I found out about this. And answered every question they had, and if any of you watched that, any part of it that day, it was no picnic. And I stood there and said I am not leaving here until I answer every question.\n\nThat\u2019s true. Later in his soliloquy Christie referred to other politicians who \u201cwhen they\u2019ve had problems, obfuscate, hide, dodge, bob, weave, don\u2019t take accountability.\u201d He may have been referring to Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi controversy. And that could be an effective argument should Christie win the nomination and face her in a general election. As New Hampshire State Representative Jack Balcom told reporters earlier that day at a diner after Christie visited: \u201cNobody died. No US Ambassador got dragged through the town. Okay? If it had been Hillary involved in that bridge scandal you would\u2019ve heard about it for a day. So let\u2019s be fair here. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\n\n\n\n\"Then, I said to everyone in my administration: \"Everyone must fully cooperate with every investigation into this matter.\" Myself included. I turned over my cell phone. I turned over my email, both professional and personal, to all of the investigators who asked for them. And said, \"Look at whatever you want to look at.\"\n\nChristie\u2019s cell phone and email records may have been turned over to Randy Mastro, the lawyer hired by his administration who has so far billed about $8 million in legal fees to taxpayers. But only one email from Christie related to Bridgegate has ever been publicly released -- Christie\u2019s edits of his official statement on Wildstein\u2019s resignation. Christie may have sent text messages as the scandal unfolded, but none have been released. In fact a dozen potentially key text messages that Christie sent to an aide during a December 2013 legislative testimony in which the traffic study explanation for the lane closures was being debunked were deleted by Christie. He later said he didn\u2019t recall the text exchange.\n\nAnd we've had three investigations: An internal investigation that I ordered, an investigation by a very partisan Democratic Legislature, an investigation by federal prosecutors. And 15 months later they have come up with the same thing that I came up with the day after, which was there were three people that they believe were responsible, and those people are now being held to account, and will have to go through the justice system and see what happens to them.\n\nChristie\u2019s internal investigation by Mastro and the federal investigation by Fishman did not, in fact, come to the \u201csame\u201d conclusion. First, Mastro never found Baroni culpable for the lane closures (perhaps because Mastro did not interview the same people that a federal grand jury did). But more significantly Mastro described the lane closures as a rogue operation conceived by a crazy person and woman upset over a broken relationship, while Fishman said it was a political revenge scheme orchestrated in order to retaliate against the mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie\u2019s reelection.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t believe that they thought this was okay by me, because if they did they would have told me. That\u2019s the greatest proof. If they thought they were doing something that I would have loved, why didn\u2019t they tell me? And they didn\u2019t.\n\nWildstein, however, has claimed he did talk to Christie about the lane closures during a September 11th ceremony at Ground Zero. Pictures from that day show Christie and Wildstein talking and laughing. This could become a key moment discussed at length in court proceedings.\n\n\n\nAnd it has been a painful process. Painful. And so I have previously said I was sorry for what happened because it happened on my watch, and I have to be accountable for it. But being accountable and being responsible are two different things...And so I\u2019m not proud or happy of what happened, but I\u2019m going to stop apologizing for it, too... We\u2019ve done everything that we can and I\u2019m moving on from it now. Because I\u2019ve lived through 15 months of three investigations that have now confirmed everything I\u2019ve said 15 months ago. So I\u2019m glad you raised it, I\u2019m glad you gave me the chance to answer it, and we\u2019re going to move on.\n\nAre these, then, Christie\u2019s final words on Bridgegate? Surely he will have to answer more questions from reporters and voters, particularly as the trials are covered in the news. But if he\u2019s really done talking about it, he may answer those questions by pointing to his long press conference, the three investigations, the apology he made to the mayor of Fort Lee and this very response Friday at the town hall meeting to say, essentially, enough, I\u2019ve said all I\u2019m going to say, and I\u2019m not apologizing any more. If that\u2019s the case, the veiled threat last week from Kelly\u2019s attorney to subpoena the governor is all the more interesting.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "At the very end of a politically successful two-day swing to New Hampshire -- the first-in-the-nation primary state that Chris Christie must win if he runs for president ...", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "Eileen Sahagian, originally of Teaneck, N.J. -- down the road from the George Washington Bridge -- said her father used to work in Fort Lee.\nIf they were pushed out due to Bridgegate, Christie has never acknowledged that.\nSuch a non-endorsement from Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich is allegedly why the lanes were closed.\nI feel like the people of Fort Lee were the sacrificial lambs.\n\u201cI still think about it and feel for the people of Fort Lee."}
