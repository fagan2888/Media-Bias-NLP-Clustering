Attracting millions of dollars in outside money, the issue has been making national headlines and inciting passion from both sides of the debate, so much so that several employees of Maine\u2019s Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, which opposes the referendum, are under protection due to credible death threats. What is it about bear hunting that provokes such strong emotions? The history of bear hunting is unusually complex, because the \u201cbear\u201d referred to in bear hunting is actually many species of bears, occupying a range of cultural categories from \u201cpredator\u201d to \u201cpet.\u201d From the twelfth century onward, for example, courtiers and kings in Europe refused to hunt brown bears, but it wasn\u2019t because they were too cute to kill: It was because they were ignoble beasts. This is why Moli\u00e8re\u2019s play from 1664, La princesse d\u2019Elide, included a scene where peasants ran after thieving bears while the princess hunted \u201cnoble game\u201d (in this case, red deer).\n\nOver time, the negative perception of bears shifted. Several bear species became endangered. Today, the polar bear, the panda, the koala, and the grizzly have become prominent symbols of habitat loss and accelerated rates of extinction. But to Americans, the most iconic bear of all isn\u2019t a species but a stuffed toy, the teddy bear. Famously, the teddy bear was the unexpected artifact of an actual bear hunt undertaken by president Theodore Roosevelt in the American South. Histories of the beloved toy typically foster a narrative that goes something like this: Chased by dogs, an injured black bear had been tied to a tree. When the president refused to shoot the sad creature, a charmed nation embraced \u201cTeddy\u2019s bear\u201d to acknowledge his compassion for helpless animals. When the president refused to shoot the sad black bear, a charmed nation embraced \"Teddy's bear\" and Roosevelt's compassion. Yet it wasn\u2019t compassion so much as a hunter\u2019s code that informed Roosevelt\u2019s seemingly noble actions. In 1887, before he became president, Roosevelt founded the Boone & Crockett Club to champion big-game hunting, which he resumed with gusto after he finished his second term in office. Perplexingly, the Boone & Crockett Club is also the country\u2019s oldest wildlife conservation organization, fighting to keep the wilderness wild because it supports hunting. Still, on the face of it, the idea of naming a toy bear after a big game hunter would seem perverse, were it not for the fact that in 1902, this presidential hunt was taking place under fraught political conditions, elevating an otherwise mundane activity to the level of national discourse. Roosevelt was touring Mississippi to resolve a border dispute. He decided to take a needed vacation, and accepted a longstanding invitation to hunt with Andrew Longino, the Democrat Governor of Mississippi. It was November and bear hunting season\u2014and also the scene of a vicious fight for the governorship. Up for reelection, Longino faced Mississippi senator James Vardaman, an ardent white supremacist who would go on to defeat Longino the following year. To Vardaman, African Americans were \u201clazy, lying, lustful animal[s], which no amount of training can transform into a tolerable citizen.\u201d His solution was lynching.\n\nAgainst a background of inflammatory rhetoric, the presidential bear hunt embarked with a former slave named Holt Collier leading the way. For Collier to guide the sitting president through the backwoods of Mississippi carried immense symbolic weight. Among other things, it affirmed a particularly American version of the hunt, which challenged the European, aristocratic version by infusing it with a form of meritocratic individualism. Whatever else they may have thought of Collier, historian Douglas Brinkley noted, plantation owners \u201cbragged\u201d that that this former slave, who had served as a Confederate scout during the Civil War, knew the local terrain better than any other man and was an exceptional bear hunter. The terrain was wide-ranging and dangerous, requiring fifty dogs to scent the quarry and give chase. After days of hard hunting, the pack cornered an adult black bear of 235 pounds. Collier successfully tied it to a tree, then blew the hunter\u2019s bugle to summon the president to his location. When Roosevelt refused to raise his rifle to deliver the fatal shot, the other men in the hunting party killed it, threw it on the back of a horse. They brought it to their base camp, where they undoubtedly ate it for supper, as bear meat was a culinary delicacy. On November 17, 1902, cartoonist Clifford Berryman created the now-famous image showing Roosevelt refusing to shoot a miniaturized black bear with a rope around its neck, captioned, \u201cDrawing the Line.\u201d The president\u2019s great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, stressed in a telephone conversation with me that the caption was understood to be a double entendre. As he explained, the president\u2019s refusal to shoot the bear not only reinforced the ethics of the hunt (which distinguishes itself from slaughter or extermination by requiring that the quarry has a chance to escape or fight), but drew a personal line against lynching, which at the time was a national problem and an especially acute one in the South. Clifford Berryman/Library of Congress In Berryman\u2019s subsequent sketches, the black bear became smaller, rounder, and cuter, turning into an anthropomorphic baby bear named \u201cBruin.\u201d The cartoon bear was so adorable that, as Roosevelt IV related to me, Brooklyn toymaker Rose Michtom had the idea to turn him into a stuffed toy and rechristen him \u201cTeddy\u201d after the president. (Roosevelt IV adds that the president didn\u2019t think an association with him would help these toys sell, but was nonetheless flattered by the idea.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Tuesday, the state&#39;s electorate will decide an issue first brought to prominence by Theodore Roosevelt nearly a century ago.", "author": "Paula Young Lee", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "On Tuesday, the state&#39;s electorate will decide an issue first brought to prominence by Theodore Roosevelt nearly a century ago.", "title": "Maine's Teddy-Bear Midterm Election", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/11/teddy_bear_roosevelt/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/11/maine-teddy-bear-midterm-election-roosevelt/382302/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe16c0\"", "article_summary": "Against a background of inflammatory rhetoric, the presidential bear hunt embarked with a former slave named Holt Collier leading the way.\nWhen the president refused to shoot the sad black bear, a charmed nation embraced \"Teddy's bear\" and Roosevelt's compassion.\nIt was November and bear hunting season\u2014and also the scene of a vicious fight for the governorship.\nWhat is it about bear hunting that provokes such strong emotions?\nFamously, the teddy bear was the unexpected artifact of an actual bear hunt undertaken by president Theodore Roosevelt in the American South."}
