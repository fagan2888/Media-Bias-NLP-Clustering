Words cannot express the love and pride I have for Twitter and Vine. \u2014 Sara Haider (@pandemona) March 21, 2014\n\nSecret, which lets people share messages anonymously with friends, took off after its buzzy launch earlier this year, though its position in the App Store rankings has fallen considerably since.\n\nThe app currently is only available on Apple\u2019s App Store, and Secret says on its site that it is currently hiring people with a background in Android development and analytics. Haider, who starts at Secret on April 7, was one of the early engineers to work on Android at Twitter. Chrys Bader, one of Secret\u2019s founders, welcomed Haider to the team. \u201cAndroid users rejoice,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman confirmed that Cayley Torgeson, Twitter\u2019s head of analytics, is also leaving the company. Torgeson was in charge of the company\u2019s internal analytics that tracked Twitter\u2019s performance such as engagement and user growth rates. It is not clear where he is headed. The tech site Re/code first reported news of Torgeson\u2019s departure.\n\nThe spokeswoman declined to comment further on both departures.\n\nTheir departures come several months after Twitter\u2019s closely watched initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. In its first earnings report as a publicly traded company, Twitter said its user growth was slowing.\n\n\u2013Yoree Koh contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Sara Haider, a top engineer at Twitter, said she is leaving the company to take a position at Secret, a Silicon Valley startup.", "title": "Twitter Loses an Android Engineer to Secret", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/03/21/twitters-lead-android-engineer-heads-to-secret/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/TU-AE573_twitte_E_20140321044516.jpg"}, "site": "WSJD", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Tech", "article.headline": "Twitter Loses an Android Engineer to Secret", "description": "Sara Haider, a top engineer at Twitter, said she is leaving the company to take a position at Secret, a Silicon Valley startup.", "article_section": "Tech", "author": "Brian R.
