Then, after everyone had gone home, Hancock would too. That\u2019s where he would be forgotten by all but his two young children and his parents.\n\nThat was until the students in Jamie Goodreau\u2019s U.S. history classes learned how Hancock had once gotten stuck in his modest mobile home for half a year\u2014\u201dlike being in prison,\u201d he recalls\u2014when his handicapped-accessible van broke down. Or how the hallways of his tiny house were so narrow he couldn\u2019t get his wheelchair through most of them.\n\nThey would fix that, Goodreau\u2019s students decided, by building Hancock a new home from the ground up. One that would be handicapped accessible. It would be their end-of-the-year project to honor veterans, something Goodreau\u2019s classes have chosen to do every year for the past 15 years, usually raising $25,000 or $30,000 for veterans charities and a celebratory dinner.\n\nThis time, however, the stakes would be much higher.\n\nIt\u2019s six months later now and the students have closed escrow on a $264,000 property. Blueprints have been drawn up for the new dwelling and the students plan to break ground next month.\n\n\u201cWe had no doubt that it could be done,\u201d Lancaster High School senior Joseph Mallyon says with a smile as he sits in Goodreau\u2019s classroom on a recent afternoon with several of his fellow students. \u201cNow there are some people in the community. You know, the older people, the people who have jobs, who go through life every day and know the harsh reality of things.\n\n\u201cThose people doubt us. But we just accept it and say, \u2018Watch what we can do.'\u201d\n\nAfter Goodreau\u2019s students shocked Lancaster and neighboring Palmdale by raising $80,000 in four months\u2014mainly by holding yard sales, pizza nights and peddling things like T-shirts and refrigerator magnets\u2014the whole community began to get involved.\n\nBig box stores are offering discounts on building supplies. A construction contractor has volunteered to pitch in when the building begins. An architectural firm provided the blueprints. The real estate agent waived her commission. The credit union at nearby Edwards Air Force Base is kicking in money from new loans it writes.\n\nEven the inmates at the local prison held a sale of their art work and donated the proceeds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just amazing,\u201d says J.D. Kennedy, a local field representative for Congressman Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon.\n\nAn Iraq war veteran himself, Kennedy met Hancock after he learned the former Army specialist had been stuck in his home when the oversized van that accommodates his wheelchair broke down and he couldn\u2019t get the 70 miles to the nearest Veterans Affairs hospital to see a dentist to fix his teeth, which were rotting from the effects of the painkillers he must swallow each day.\n\nKennedy\u2019s boss, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, pressed the VA to reimburse local doctors and dentists who agreed to treat Hancock whether they were paid or not. Then Goodreau, who met Hancock at the annual Pride of the Nation Day, invited him to tell his story to her students.\n\nHe recounted it again on a recent desert-hot fall afternoon as he sat shirtless in his living room, making no effort to hide the burns that still scar his body. A prosthetic arm sat unused on a counter because, Hancock says with a grin, it\u2019s heavy and hard to use\u2014and it looks even scarier than no arm at all.\n\nHancock was driving a tank through the streets of Baghdad on May 29, 2007, when the vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device that blew a hole through its armor and set it ablaze. A chunk of shrapnel lodged in his spine, paralyzing his legs so that he couldn\u2019t get out. It happened on his 21st birthday.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says the laconic former soldier who somehow never lost his sense of humor. \u201cThat part really sucked.\u201d\n\nDue to leave the military in a few months, he\u2019d bought a mobile home near his mother\u2019s place in Lancaster. It was small but a good first home for a young guy with a wife, two kids and a dog. But he hadn\u2019t planned on coming home in a wheelchair.\n\nAfter his wife left him and his 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter, his mother and stepfather became his caretakers.\n\nIn the Antelope Valley, he quickly became well known. The area, tucked into the farthest northeast corner of Los Angeles County and dotted by Joshua trees and sagebrush, is immensely proud of its ties to the military. The Air Force\u2019s B-1B bomber was built here and it was at Edwards Air Force Base that legendary test pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly faster than the speed of sound.\n\nThe area, Kennedy says, contains more veterans per capita than any other place in the country.\n\nThus Hancock was honored often at public events. But after the fist bumps of hello and goodbye (he can\u2019t quite use his hand to shake someone else\u2019s), people would go their own way. They assumed, some said, that anybody that badly hurt must have a huge support group behind him. Hancock admits he let them think that.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to complain,\u201d he says quietly, adding the recurring dreams of burning to death in a tank were bad enough without revisiting them while awake.\n\nThen Goodreau\u2019s students took up his cause. He\u2019d met her at several veterans events and trusted her enough to open up to them.\n\nSince then, he says, the nightmares have pretty much stopped as helping the students with their effort has given him a sense of purpose. He is stunned by the magnitude of their effort.\n\n\u201cThey gave up their last summer of high school for me,\u201d he says in a voice filled with awe.\n\nActually, they gave up even more. Goodreau\u2019s veteran projects normally end with the summer. This year\u2019s group, whose members have already collected their A grades, vowed to continue the project they call Operation All The Way Home until Hancock has a new roof over his head, hopefully by next summer.\n\nWhen asked why she\u2019s continuing, Nicole Skinner, 17, who graduated in June and is now a college freshman, laughs.\n\n\u201cJust look at him, man. Many people these days are complaining about their lives and you look at him and what he\u2019s been through, and he\u2019s still smiling and all. He\u2019s not complaining,\u201d she says, \u201cHe\u2019s just so motivating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7f5\"", "article_summary": "They would fix that, Goodreau\u2019s students decided, by building Hancock a new home from the ground up.\nThen Goodreau, who met Hancock at the annual Pride of the Nation Day, invited him to tell his story to her students.\nThen Goodreau\u2019s students took up his cause.\nBlueprints have been drawn up for the new dwelling and the students plan to break ground next month.\nOr how the hallways of his tiny house were so narrow he couldn\u2019t get his wheelchair through most of them."}
