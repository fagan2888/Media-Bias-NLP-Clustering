The dominant health care system in Eastern Carolina is forming a new company with two other health care systems in the state.

Vidant Health says it's forming the new company with Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem and WakeMed Health & Hospitals in Raleigh.

Vidant says the companies are not merging, and all will maintain their independence. The partnership, however, will help with shared services between the three systems.

"It's not a merger. It's not an acquisition. It's not a clever platform to negotiate contracts or manage care companies," says Vidant Medical Center President Steve Lawler. "It really is about using the collective talents of the organizations for first and foremost for patients."

Vidant says the new company will help with the challenges from dropping Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, and will also create a platform for innovation and enhanced clinical care for patients.

There is no name yet for the new company.
