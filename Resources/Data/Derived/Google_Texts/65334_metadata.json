Bob Corker Bob CorkerThe Trail 2016: Interleague play Top Republican urges Rubio to run for reelection Senate GOP ties Iran sanctions fight to defense bill MORE (R-Tenn.) on Sunday expressed concern that the U.S. was preparing to \u201cdeal away\u201d its leverage in negotiations over the Iranian nuclear program by easing sanctions on the country.\n\n\u201cThe [United Nations] Security Council resolutions call for a complete stoppage [of Iran\u2019s nuclear program]\u2026so you can imagine that Congress, that put these sanctions in place with the administration kicking and screaming all the way, pushing back against these sanctions, very concerned that we\u2019re going to deal away the leverage that we have where we finally have Iran willing to sit down and talk about these issues,\u201d Corker said on NBC\u2019s \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA partial agreement leads us down the same path we went down with North Korea, where just to get people to act right\u2026you continue to reduce sanctions,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cSo, again, a lot of concerns about the approach. A lot of us want to see it resolved diplomatically. We know the sanctions got us here, and we\u2019re worried we\u2019re dealing away our leverage.\u201d\n\nThe P5+1 negotiations in Geneva on the Iranian nuclear program fell apart over the weekend after the French said a proposal didn\u2019t sufficiently curb the country\u2019s nuclear capabilities.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said Sunday the U.S. was in no hurry to come to an agreement, arguing that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal.\u201d\n\nOpponents of a deal, including many Republicans and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, say easing the economic sanctions against Iran is too great of a concession for only a \u201cminor\u201d reduction in Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment.\n\n\u201cI think the president and I share the goal of making sure that Iran doesn\u2019t have nuclear weapons,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cWhere we might have a difference of opinion is on how to prevent it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"We know the sanctions got us here,\" the Tennessee Republican said.", "description": "\"We know the sanctions got us here,\" the Tennessee Republican said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jonathan Easley", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"We know the sanctions got us here,\" the Tennessee Republican said.", "title": "Corker: US could \u2018deal away\u2019 lran leverage", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/189800-corker-us-could-%E2%80%98deal-away%E2%80%99-lran-leverage", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/corkerbobrischjim_11082013getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-10T14:03:44-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/189800-corker-us-could-%E2%80%98deal-away%E2%80%99-lran-leverage", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"We know the sanctions got us here,\" the Tennessee Republican said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Corker: US could \u2018deal away\u2019 lran leverage"}, "dcterms.modified": "2013-11-10T14:03-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/189800-corker-us-could-%E2%80%98deal-away%E2%80%99-lran-leverage", "dcterms.date": "2013-11-10T13:34-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "nuclear program,Bob Corker,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-10T13:34:47-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T14:03:44-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Corker: US could \u2018deal away\u2019 lran leverage"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think the president and I share the goal of making sure that Iran doesn\u2019t have nuclear weapons,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\u201cWhere we might have a difference of opinion is on how to prevent it.\u201d\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economySen.
