The magazine gave it to the \u201cEbola Fighters\u201d instead. Good for them; they\u2019re doing God\u2019s work. Still, Gruber would have been better.\n\nTime\u2019s Person of the Year designation has lost a lot of its stature over recent years. Part of its decline can probably be attributed to the fact that it\u2019s come to be seen as an honorific. It was originally conceived to recognize the person who, \u201cfor better or for worse . . . has done the most to influence the events of the year.\u201d So Adolf Hitler (1938) and Josef Stalin (1939 and again in 1942) qualified. In 2001, however, the editors couldn\u2019t bring themselves to bestow the title on Osama bin Laden, even though he certainly deserved it. (New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani got it instead for his heroic response to the evil deeds of the person who influenced the events of the year most decidedly for the worse.)\n\nThe other conceit of the P.O.Y. is to capture some theme or trend that lends itself to end-of-the-year thumb-sucker columns (like this one). That\u2019s why the computer was hailed as the \u201cMachine of the Year\u201d in 1982 and our \u201cEndangered Earth\u201d was dubbed \u201cPlanet of the Year\u201d in 1988. In 2006, \u201cYou\u201d won the contest because of all the wonderful work you do in creating Web content. (Congrats, by the way.) And in 2011, \u201cthe Protester\u201d won in recognition of tea partiers and Wall Street occupiers alike.\n\nFor similar reasons, I think Time missed an opportunity in not putting Gruber on the cover. Tea partiers and Wall Street occupiers disagree on a great many things, but there\u2019s one place where the Venn diagrams overlap: the sense we\u2019re all being played for suckers, that the rules are being set up to benefit those who know how to manipulate the rules. The Left tends to focus on Wall Street types whose bottom line depends more on lobbying Washington than satisfying the consumer.\n\nBut Gruber is something special. He was supposed to be better, more pure than the fat cats. Touted by press and politicians alike as an objective and fair-minded arbiter of health-care reform, the MIT economist was in fact a warrior for the cause, invested emotionally, politically and, it turns out, financially through undisclosed consulting arrangements. The people who relied on his expertise never bothered to second-guess his conflicts of interest because they, too, were warriors in the same fight.\n\nIn speeches and interviews, Gruber admitted he helped the Obama administration craft the law in such a way that it would seem like it didn\u2019t tax the American people when it did. Using insights gleaned in part from his status as an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office, Gruber helped construct an actuarial Trojan horse that could smuggle a tax hike past the CBO bean counters \u2014 because if the individual mandate had been counted as a tax, it would\u2019ve been a big political liability for President Obama. (Fortunately for Obamacare, the Supreme Court saw through the subterfuge and called it a tax, rendering it constitutional.)\n\nGruber then mocked the \u201cstupidity of the American voter\u201d for not seeing through the camouflage he helped design.\n\nLast week, in a congressional hearing that came as close to an auto-da-f\u00e9 as our politics can manage, Gruber apologized for his \u201carrogance\u201d as a way to duplicitously deny his previous duplicity. It was a brilliant and cynical public-relations ploy. By making the issue his personality, he could avoid the tougher questions about the substance of what he said \u2014 and did.\n\nIt worked, in part, because Gruber really is arrogant. But Gruber\u2019s arrogance goes beyond the personal. He represents the arrogance of the expert class writ large. They create systems, terms, and rules that no normal person on the outside can possibly penetrate. They make life and living more complicated and then get rich and powerful off of their ability to navigate that complexity. Time and again they sell simplicity and security and deliver more complications and insecurity, which in turn creates demand for more experts promising simplicity and security the Gruberians never deliver.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Americans are stupid, it\u2019s that the experts have been geniuses at creating a system that makes normal people feel stupid.\n\n\u2014 Jonah Goldberg is a senior editor of National Review and a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.
