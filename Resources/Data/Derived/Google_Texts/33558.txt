A springtime tradition in Panama City continues to honor southern roots.

The Panama City Garden Club and the Panama City Women's Club sponsored the 47th year of the Azalea Trail.

Teenage girls wear antebellum dresses and compete to become the Queen of the Azalea Trail.

They go through an interviewing process and organizers narrow it down to the top 5.

At Sunday afternoon's ceremony, coordinators announced Ashley Sheffield as the Queen of the Azalea Trail.
