(AP) \u2014 When the final out was made on another improbable night, and the Kansas City Royals were headed back to the World Series, Ned Yost stood in the dugout and watched.\n\nHe watched as a bunch of young players he's nurtured for years celebrated. He watched as veterans and journeymen and baseball vagabonds piled onto the infield. And he watched as a fan base that has so often criticized him relished a moment 29 years in the making.\n\n\"These kids, from the minute you saw them, you knew they were going to be special,\" Yost said. \"Their goal was to get here and win a championship, and today they accomplished that.\"\n\nLed by a dynamic defense, an opportunistic offense and one of the best bullpens in the game, the Royals swept aside the Baltimore Orioles on Wednesday night. With another tight win, 2-1, the Royals captured their first the American League championship since 1985.\n\nThat was also the last time they were in the playoffs.\n\n\"It's hard to explain,\" said outfielder Lorenzo Cain, whose clutch hits and dramatic grabs earned him the series MVP award. \"We're clicking at the right moment right now.\"\n\nNow, the Royals will carry an 11-game playoff win streak into the World Series, one shy of the major league record. That includes their first eight this season, something that had never been done in postseason history. Kansas City beat Oakland in a 12-inning wild-card thriller to start things off, then swept the Los Angeles Angels in the Division Series.\n\nThe Fall Classic will begin Tuesday in Kansas City between the Royals and the winner of the NLCS between the Giants and Cardinals. Coincidentally, it was St. Louis that fell to the Royals in seven drama-filled games during the '85 World Series.\n\n\"I don't think we're done yet,\" designated hitter Billy Butler said.\n\nAfter the Royals held the Orioles to three hits in Game 3, Jason Vargas and their bullpen held them to four Wednesday night. Kelvin Herrera and Wade Davis got the game to Greg Holland, who matched Dennis Eckersley's record with his fourth save of the best-of-seven series.\n\nHolland got J.J. Hardy to ground out to third base for the final out, and the Royals spilled onto the infield in a wild celebration. Fireworks shot over the crown-shaped scoreboard in center field, and a blue-clad sellout crowd that included Royals greats George Brett and Brett Saberhagen let out a roar while cars on nearby Interstate 70 honked their horns.\n\n\"That's what you dream of as a kid,\" Holland said. \"Punch your ticket to the World Series, especially before your home crowd. These fans have been waiting a long time. They deserve it.\"\n\nThe Orioles, meanwhile, will limp into the offseason after a 96-win season having been swept for the first time in franchise history, a stretch of 21 postseason series.\n\n\"I think it's not what we didn't do. It's more what they did,\" said the Orioles' Ryan Flaherty, whose home run represented their lone run. \"We played good baseball.\"\n\nMaking his first start in nearly two weeks, Vargas shut down the vaunted Orioles lineup in Game 4. The only damage he allowed came in the third inning, when Flaherty went deep.\n\nBy that point, the Royals had already manufactured a pair of runs.\n\nAlcides Escobar singled off Orioles starter Miguel Gonzalez to open the game, and Nori Aoki was drilled on the right knee a couple pitches later. Yost then opted to bunt with Cain, one of his hottest hitters, to advance both of the runners.\n\nIt was a questionable decision so early in the game. But like almost every unorthodox move that Yost has made, it worked out perfectly \u2014 for Cain's first career sacrifice.\n\nEric Hosmer followed with a chopping grounder, and first baseman Steve Pearce went home with it. Escobar slid safely and the ball bounded away from catcher Caleb Joseph, allowing Aoki to follow his teammate home and giving the scrappy, small-ball Royals a 2-0 lead.\n\nAfter that, it was up to their defense and bullpen.\n\nEscobar turned a pair of double plays early in the game to help Vargas escape jams, and Gordon made a spectacular catch while crashing into the left-field wall to rob Hardy of extra bases leading off the fifth inning. In the sixth, second baseman Omar Infante was in perfect position to snag Nelson Cruz's line drive and leave runners on the corners.\n\nHerrera breezed through the seventh and Davis handled the eighth, just as they have all season, and Holland slammed the door on his fourth save of the series.\n\nAnd set off of a raucous celebration that had been 29 years in the making.\n\nIn the midst of it all was Yost, the often-criticized Royals manager who has guided a collection of budding young stars to baseball's grandest stage. In doing so, Yost became the first manager in major league history to win his first eight postseason games.\n\nNow, just four more wins stand in the way of an improbable World Series championship.\n\n\"These guys are willing to play selfless baseball where all they're concentrating on is winning the game,\" Yost said. \"Nobody is looking to be a hero right now, they're just looking to win a ballgame, and they've done a tremendous job.\"\n\nSTREAKS AND STATS\n\nThe Royals are the seventh team to record a best-of-seven sweep in a league championship series. ... The 1976 Reds and 2007 Rockies each won seven straight games to start a postseason. ... Hosmer has 13 hits this postseason, fifth-most by a Royals hitter. Willie Wilson had 20 in the 1985 postseason. ... Both games at Kauffman Stadium were played in less than 3 hours.\n\nSTACKING UP\n\nKansas City did well this season against both potential World Series opponents.\n\nThe Royals swept a three-game series from the visiting Giants in August, beating Madison Bumgarner, Tim Hudson and Tim Lincecum. KC hasn't played at San Francisco since 2005.\n\nThe Royals went 3-1 against St. Louis, sweeping two games at Busch Stadium and splitting back at Kauffman Stadium.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRoyals: The Royals are in the World Series for the third time in franchise history. \"It's been incredible to watch,\" said Saberhagen, one of the star pitchers on the '85 title team.\n\nOrioles: It's on to the offseason for a team that overcame a series of injuries (Matt Wieters, Manny Machado) and suspensions (Chris Davis) to reach the ALCS. Baltimore still has not made it back to the World Series since 1983.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Royals headed to World Series after ALCS sweep - AP News: KANSAS CITY, Mo.
