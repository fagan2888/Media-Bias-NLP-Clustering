But as several of the nation\u2019s largest health insurance companies consider potential mergers, the vision of a more competitive insurance market begins to seem overly optimistic.\n\nIs there a silver lining here? Richard Scheffler, Berkeley professor of health economics and public policy, thinks so. He and co-author Sherry Glied \u2014 dean and professor of public service at New York University \u2013 explore this topic in a recent New York Times op-ed. To do so, the two report on research comparing how the states of California and New York designed their healthcare marketplaces in response to the law.\n\n\u201cUnder the act, states have some flexibility in designing their marketplaces,\u201d they write. States could accept all insurers who seek to participate or they could select a limited number of companies approved to sell coverage. \u201cNew York chose the first course, permitting all willing insurers to join; California chose the second, selecting 12 of the 32 insurers that initially showed interest.\u201d\n\nSheffler and Glied report, in part, that in both states, \u201careas with more hospitals had lower premiums compared with areas with fewer hospitals. But in New York, areas with fewer insurers had higher premiums, suggesting that insurers kept the benefits of greater bargaining power for themselves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Berkeley News", "description": "Visit the post for more.", "title": "Here\u2019s how states can contain healthcare costs", "url": "http://news.berkeley.edu/story_jump/heres-how-states-can-contain-health-care-costs/", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://news.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/health_insurance750.jpg", "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-03T19:28:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-03T20:02:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Keeping health insurance costs down while improving the quality of healthcare was a goal of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 and the 2010 federal law has, in fact, succeeded in covering more Americans and containing many healthcare costs.\nBut as several of the nation\u2019s largest health insurance companies consider potential mergers, the vision of a more competitive insurance market begins to seem overly optimistic.\nBut in New York, areas with fewer insurers had higher premiums, suggesting that insurers kept the benefits of greater bargaining power for themselves.\u201d\nTo do so, the two report on research comparing how the states of California and New York designed their healthcare marketplaces in response to the law.\nStates could accept all insurers who seek to participate or they could select a limited number of companies approved to sell coverage."}
