Developers could either build the units \u2014 collecting a $5,500 per-unit subsidy \u2014 or opt out by paying 50 percent of the cost of the affordable units to Denver\u2019s housing fund.\n\nDenver\u2019s IHO has yielded 447 workforce residences since 2011.\n\nMore than a year ago, the city fixed two of the biggest flaws in the original ordinance. IHO buyers could not rent their units, and when the housing market collapsed (and it will again), buyers were stuck with properties they could not sell. In addition, IHO covenants were incompatible with FHA lending requirements, making a bad situation worse. The city rectified both issues. However, more fundamental problems with Denver\u2019s inclusionary policies will persist in any new ordinance, unless the developer subsidy equals the cost of building the unit; density and parking incentives are added; Colorado\u2019s construction defects law goes away; and multifamily rentals are included.\n\nDevelopers add the costs of producing IHO\u2019s to market-rate units, thereby increasing the price of market housing. As the demand for owner-occupied condominiums escalates, developers are finding ways to insure around Colorado\u2019s lopsided construction-defects law. Cost estimates are between $5,000 and $25,000 per unit, depending on size, location and market value.\n\nThanks to the 1980 Colorado Supreme Court decision Telluride vs. Lot 34 Venture, rent control cannot be imposed through local ordinance. Though the law was amended in 2010, allowing municipalities to negotiate \u2014 not require \u2014 rent-controlled set-asides, neither the old nor a new inclusionary ordinance can address Denver\u2019s dearth of affordable rentals.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s not fair for developers and condominium buyers to assume the full burden of supply. An investor who demolishes a small bungalow in Platt Park or Sloan Lake, replacing it with a duplex selling for $700,000 per unit, adds to Denver\u2019s shrinking inventory of affordable housing. Redevelopment and upgrading of obsolete property and condo conversions also contribute.\n\nThe benefits and responsibilities of assuring the city has a full range of housing options belongs to all of us.\n\nCouncilwoman Robin Kniech opened the door to assess the flawed policy. Instead of rushing to approve the wrong answer to more complex problem, the city should use the opportunity to have a bigger, more inclusive conversation. The goal must be to identify a stable, robust and equitable source of funding.\n\nConsider identifying an informed, neutral professional or organization to work with the city and a diverse group of stakeholders. Examine creative strategies to produce affordable, for-sale and for-rent housing.\n\n\u2022 Micro units, attached to existing building stock: the convention center; parking structures, diverse building types in mixed-use districts;\n\n\u2022 Accessory alley units;\n\n\u2022 Equity sharing subsidies \u2013 investors lend down-payment to buyer who selects property. At time of sale, appreciation shared between investor and Investor and homeowner, depending on percentage of down payment assistance. No deed restrictions, creates wealth and mobility.\n\n\u2022 Land trusts \u2014 Colorado Community Land Trust (formerly Lowry) and the Urban Land Conservancy both produce stable affordable stock using long-term ground leases and tax credits.\n\nMore carrots, more sticks and greater flexibility in an unsound and ineffective policy is not progress. It\u2019s Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\n\nSusan Barnes-Gelt (BarnesGelt@gmail.com) co-sponsored Denver\u2019s 2002 Inclusionary Housing Ordinance during her tenure on the Denver City Council.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Barnes-Gelt: Denver should revamp its inclusionary housing policy", "title": "Barnes-Gelt: Denver should revamp its inclusionary housing policy", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/25/barnes-gelt-denver-should-revamp-its-inclusionary-housing-policy/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__mayor-michael-hancockp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140725__mayor-michael-hancockp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-25T11:35:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:32:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcae59\"", "article_summary": "Susan Barnes-Gelt (BarnesGelt@gmail.com) co-sponsored Denver\u2019s 2002 Inclusionary Housing Ordinance during her tenure on the Denver City Council.\n\u201cDenver\u2019s Inclusionary Housing Ordinance has failed,\u201d announced Mayor Michael Hancock a year ago in his 2013 State of the City address.\nDenver\u2019s IHO has yielded 447 workforce residences since 2011.\nDevelopers could either build the units \u2014 collecting a $5,500 per-unit subsidy \u2014 or opt out by paying 50 percent of the cost of the affordable units to Denver\u2019s housing fund.\nThe benefits and responsibilities of assuring the city has a full range of housing options belongs to all of us."}
