On the air, the Brenau professor is all business.\n\nBy Candice Dyer\n\nDavid Miller, a Brenau faculty member who has a doctorate in clinical psychologist, often quotes Groucho Marx: \u201cA hospital bed is a parked taxi with the meter running.\u201d Who pays and how much have long been up for debate, notes Miller. \u201cSo many presidents have attempted to leave their mark on the provision of health care,\u201d he says, \u201cstarting at least with Teddy Roosevelt, who campaigned in 1912 for universal health care \u2013 and lost.\u201d\n\nThat is a topic that interests Miller greatly \u2013 and not because he believes, as some might suggest, that any politicians who tackle the national health care issue need to have their heads examined. Because of ever-increasing administrative responsibilities as a clinician earlier in his career, Miller gained enough experience to qualify him to be lead professor and director of Brenau University\u2019s highly acclaimed Master of Business Administration health care specialization.\n\nLike other health careers, health care administration is considered virtually recession-proof with enormous growth. Health services will approach 20 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product by 2017. With the implementation of \u201cObamacare,\u201d or the highly controversial Affordable Care Act, health care police and administration ranks right up there with domestic surveillance and illegal immigration as a key and divisive U.S. domestic policy issue. Asked which qualities make a good candidate in this field, Miller emphasizes the ever-changing nature of the health care landscape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for the faint of heart!\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou have to be inquisitive and really use your critical thinking skills and be willing to push the envelope. We can\u2019t keep doing what\u2019s always been done. For example, say a student has a business that has between 50 and 100 employees. That\u2019s right in the bubble where you can get in trouble with the feds for noncompliance with the ACA, so it\u2019s important to understand this law and all of its ramifications.\u201d\n\nHealth care administration is a cumbersome and tedious process, whether it involves overseeing the Veterans Administration hospital system or figuring out how to convince your employer\u2019s group health insurance provider that anesthesia for your colonoscopy is not really a frivolous elective procedure. That complexity is part of the reason Miller agreed to undertake Health Matters, a 9 a.m. program every Monday on Brenau\u2019s WBCX-FM radio station. The underlying premise of the program, says Miller, is that the health care landscape changes so rapidly these days that most people are not even sure of the issues they need to be watching out for.\n\nBRENAU\u2019S ACADEMIC SWEET SPOT\n\nPreparation for health care professions has become one of Brenau\u2019s academic sweet spots. Its three doctoral programs are in nursing, occupational therapy and physical therapy; the fastest-growing Women\u2019s College undergraduate segment has been in health sciences. Miller kicked off the program with interviews with Gale Starich, dean of the College of Health Sciences; Barbara Schell, soon-to-retire head of Brenau\u2019s highly vaunted occupational therapy school; Dina Hewitt, head of the School of Nursing; and, from the Department of Physical Therapy, professors James Lewis and Tracy Wright.\n\nHowever, he also has had representatives from the health insurance industry in both overviews of the industry. Future program plans involve tapping his extensive network to develop topics about drugs, patient empowerment and employee wellness programs, as well as to attract political and government leaders engaged in the issue. Georgia Sixth District U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a physician from North Georgia\u2019s Sixth District who chairs the House Budget Committee, for example, authored a bill proposing a drastic alternative plan to President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, like other Republicans around the country, refused to lead full implementation of ACA. Also, the entire Republican majority in the Georgia House of Representative delegation oppose Obamacare and many of them have voted along with their Republican colleagues in the House 55 times to repeal it. The state\u2019s two U.S. senators also oppose ACA, but the senate has only cast a scant three dozen votes against Obamacare.\n\nACA is a central issue in 2016 president politics with all the myriad Republican candidates vowing to repeal it. On the Democratic side, contenders do not see eye to eye: Vermont U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders wants to expand the concept to a single-payer system, like Medicare, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2013 who received a thorough political smackdown as first lady running a proposal for national health care for her husband during the first Bill Clinton administration \u2013 proposes refinements and expansion to the Obamacare program.\n\nSo, when you consider the nation\u2019s relationship with the idea of how health care should be provided for its citizens, as they say on Facebook, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\nBrenau has more than 600 students pursuing MBAs with more than 80 in health care management.\n\nHEALTH CARE RESET\n\nIn 2010, almost 100 years after the health care issue noisily cudgeled the Republican president who always wanted to speak softly and carry a big stick, President Obama signed into law the most revolutionary change since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s. Suddenly, Miller, the health care administration professor, had some tricky, new bureaucratic terrain to navigate. He started by conducting the equivalent of \u201cexit interviews\u201d with graduates of Brenau\u2019s program, such as Steve McNeilly, BU \u201912, executive director of Northeast Georgia Health Partners, who earned his degree the semester before Miller assumed his post in the fall of 2012.\n\n\u201cAll of my instructors were excellent, and the program was beneficial to me,\u201d McNeilly says, \u201cbut I was working on the front lines while I was in school, and things were just crazy. Everything we know about health care and insurance is changing daily at a very fast pace. David made it clear that he wanted Brenau to be up to speed with these changes. He also struck me as an out-of-the-box thinker with fresh ideas, so I was sure he was going to do interesting things.\u201d\n\nProf. Miller struck me as an out-of-the-box thinker with fresh ideas, so I was sure he was going to do interesting things. \u2013 Steve McNeilly, Northeast Georgia Health Partners\n\nMiller, who has a leonine mane of white hair and a fondness for bow ties, grew up in St. Louis, really has little academic background in business, finance or liberal arts. He studied psychology and philosophy at the University of Missouri at Columbia, and finished his doctorate at Stanford. He did his residency at the Veterans Administration in Palo Alto, California, where he specialized in post-traumatic stress disorder among former prisoners of war. Miller went on to run the VA\u2019s National Center for the Evaluation and Treatment of former POWs in Pittsburgh and then, in Atlanta, to oversee VA research for the Southeast. He also served as associate professor of psychiatry and cardiothoracic surgery at Emory University and the University of Pittsburgh medical schools. His wife, Sue, also has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, and she runs a private practice in Alpharetta specializing in autism.\n\n\u201cDelta Sky Miles knew me by name, I was traveling so much,\u201d he says.\n\nMiller is quick to note that the university \u201cgambled\u201d when it hired him, especially during a tumultuous time in the economy and the health care industry. What stacked the deck in his favor, however, is that substantial curriculum vita that testifies to his practical and studied expertise in health care delivery as both a clinician and an administrator at high levels of leadership in a variety of agencies.\n\nMiller currently stays active with the Hall County Chamber of Commerce, with whom he coordinates and emcees an annual symposium on health care. (\u201cIf you want to know what will happen in health care \u2013 in, like, the next four hours \u2013 you need to attend,\u201d he says wryly.) He occasionally does radio interviews and broadcast talk shows as a guest on other people\u2019s shows, and one of his more interesting personal appearance gigs occurred on stage at Pearce Auditorium last spring when he and Brenau President Ed Schrader conducted an interview before an audience of about 700 with GE Corporation\u2019s former CEO Jack Welch and his wife, Suzy.\n\nROBUST PROGRAM\n\nWith his interdisciplinary background, Miller has a penchant for Brenau\u2019s attempts to cross-pollinate the various academic silos. The M.B.A. program in health care ranks in the top 20 in the country, hovering close to Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania. Brenau has more than 600 students pursuing M.B.A.s with more than 80 in health care management \u2013 making Brenau\u2019s M.B.A. enrollment the second largest in the state, according to rankings in the Atlanta Business Chronicle.\n\n\u201cHealth care was already a robust program [before I came],\u201d Miller says, \u201cbut we completely overhauled the curriculum, moving it from an inpatient, fee-for-service model to one that takes into account prospective payment options under the ACA.\u201d To ensure up-to-the-moment proficiency for the M.B.A. students, Miller has added an \u201cadvanced topics\u201d course, which incorporates the research and positions of several diverse Washington, D.C.- based think tanks, including the Kaiser, Brookings, Heritage and Cato foundations and institutions.The program also is required for some graduate students in health care disciplines, such as occupational therapy.\n\n\u201cI try to draw from all over the political spectrum so they get a wide range of views, from liberal to conservative to libertarian,\u201d he says.\n\nHe also encourages students to learn by doing real things. For one class, four occupational therapy graduate students had to hone in on a real public policy issue, figure out a way to address it and pitch their solution to a couple of Georgia legislators who agreed to come to campus and, as a purely academic exercise, give students feedback on their idea. As it turned out, the lawmakers thought the idea had some legs. They introduced it as a real bill in the 2014 session of the General Assembly, working with the Brenau OT students to draft the bill. The idea was to extend state benefits equally to special-needs children of military families stationed in Georgia.\n\nThe bill passed and, last spring, Gov. Deal had three of the four OT students at his side when he signed the bill into law at a special ceremony Brenau hosted at the Atlanta Press Club.\n\n\u201cDr. Miller uses both the Socratic and the democratic method relative to today\u2019s issues,\u201d says student Henry Howington, who runs a lab at Emory and is on track for a dual M.B.A. in health care and project management. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of dry information in this field, but he is very affable and engaging \u2013 he knows how to use humor and levity to reach any student on any level.\u201d\n\nThe students in this M.B.A. program consist of a demographic mix of traditional and nontraditional types such as physicians, nurses and lab techs looking to advance to the next rung in their work. Some graduates are up to some exciting doings. One, Abe Prescher, BU \u201914, in San Diego, was recently selected from 100 applicants from around the country for the lone 2016 fellowship in hospital administration at the Yale University medical center in Connecticut. Two others serve currently as fleet surgeons in the U.S. Navy: Capt. Joel Roos, BU \u201909, the Sixth fleet\u2019s top medical officer and Capt. Chris Culp, BU \u201914, the Pacific Fleet\u2019s top doc (Brenau Window will profile Roos and Culp in the next issue).\n\n\u201cWe are lucky to have so many students who are already in the trenches and can share what they\u2019ve learned,\u201d Miller says.\n\nMcNeilly adds, \u201cI recently hired one of his graduates. He\u2019s producing graduates who are ready to hit the ground running.\u201d\n\nMiller\u2019s goals for the future include making Brenau\u2019s program more interdisciplinary, combining business with OT, and business with psychology. And, of course, Miller, an avid outdoorsman, intends to stay fit by hiking, camping and trail-running.\n\nHe likes to quote Mark Twain about behavior modification: \u201cThe only way to keep your health is to eat what you don\u2019t want, drink what you don\u2019t like, and do what you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\nBut does he practice what Twain preached?\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Miller says. \u201cNot in this life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The health care landscape changes so rapidly that most people aren't sure of the issues they need to watch out for.
