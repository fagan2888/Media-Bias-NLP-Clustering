I kind of loved it.\n\nHere's the opening to my review:\n\nIt\u2019s fitting that the international spy agency at the center of \u201cKingsman: The Secret Service\u201d operates out of a high-end tailor shop on Savile Row. The movie\u2019s characters are perfectly costumed, and the movie itself is impeccably stylish.\n\nDirector Matthew Vaughn\u2019s latest graphic novel adaptation has verve, wit and flair, against which it juxtaposes a joyously vulgar populism. It\u2019s a spectacular crowd pleaser, tailor-made for the masses \u2014 and the moment.\n\n\u201cKingsman\u201d is a movie for the 99 percent, and not just those encumbered with the academic leftism of the Occupy Wall Street crowd. The villain is Valentine (Samuel L. Jackson, in his most memorable role in years), a fashionable tech zillionaire with a comic lisp that, surprisingly, gets more funny than irritating. Valentine is a prototypical Davos-type, a devout liberal and dedicated climate change activist who has given billions of dollars to the cause, only to be defeated repeatedly. He decides that more drastic \u2014 and, one discovers, deadly \u2014 measures are needed, although the world\u2019s moneyed elite are, of course, exempt.\n\nThe movie\u2019s populism is distinctly conservative \u2014 there are explicit shout-outs to Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher \u2014 but it is neither preachy nor entirely predictable.\n\nInstead of earnest dogmatism, Mr. Vaughn opts for a mix of smirking satire and flippant wit. Spy movies are as much a target as any political agenda.\n\nIn particular, \u201cKingsman\u201d is a sendup of James Bond as well as an homage to his legacy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Matthew Vaughn's latest graphic novel adaptation is a rowdy, violent, populist, high-style spy fantasia.
