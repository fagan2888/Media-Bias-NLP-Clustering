The Seniors Decide 2016 forum on Wednesday, Feb. 17 \u2014 the nation\u2019s only presidential candidate forum focused on issues important to the nation\u2019s older adults \u2014 offered some answers.\n\nThe live-streamed forum held at George Mason University was run by the nonprofit Leadership Council of Aging Organizations (LCAO) \u2014a coalition including AARP, the Alzheimer\u2019s Foundation, the American Society on Aging, LeadingAge, National Alliance on Caregiving and Women\u2019s Institute for a Secure Retirement \u2014 with Next Avenue as media partner. Viewers at 202 watch parties in 141 cities in all 50 states tuned in.\n\nSanders and a Kasich Proxy Appeared\n\nAlthough all the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates were invited, only Democrat Sen. Bernie Sanders and a proxy for Republican Gov. John Kasich \u2014 former Virginia Congressman Tom Davis \u2014 appeared.\n\n\u201cOne of the disappointments in the campaign, for whatever reason, is that issues pertaining to seniors are not getting the attention they should,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cIt pains me that these are not issues we are discussing anywhere near the degree to which we should.\u201d\n\nOne of the disappointments in the campaign, for whatever reason, is that issues pertaining to seniors are not getting the attention they should.\n\n\u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders at Seniors Decide 2016\n\nMoreWhat Older Voters Care About Now\n\nEchoing that, Republican pollster Bob Carpenter of Chesapeake Beach Consulting noted that most of the candidates don\u2019t have a \u201csenior tab\u201d or an \u201colder Americans tab\u201d on their websites.\n\n\u201cThey have an obligation to tell you where they stand,\u201d said Carpenter. \u201cMedicare and Social Security reform or maintenance are important and need to be talked about.\u201d\n\nSaid LCAO chair and forum moderator Max Richtman: \u201cWhen they talk about Medicare or Social Security reform, they don\u2019t explain what that means. Is it about raising the retirement age? Reducing benefits to bring in more revenue?\u201d\n\nPolling Data on Older Voters\n\nNext Avenue\u2019s Managing Director Susan Donley, Carpenter and Democratic pollster Jonathan Voss of Lake Research Partners presented research about key election issues for older Americans.\n\nDonley cited a January 2016 online survey of 3,400 Next Avenue readers in which 98 percent said they plan to vote; 73 percent felt the candidates weren\u2019t paying enough attention to issues facing older Americans and 67 percent said issues of aging, caregiving and long-term care will be a factor in how they\u2019ll vote.\n\nVoss said that \u201cseniors are more tax-sensitive than other voters,\u201d since many are on fixed incomes, but don\u2019t perceive that Social Security was \u201cunder attack\u201d in the election. He also cited polling saying that seniors are more likely than other voters to want the Affordable Care Act either repealed or changed.\n\nSanders on Key Issues\n\nSanders presented his policy positions on an assortment of issues affecting older Americans:\n\nSocial Security \u201cWe have to be very aggressive not only about continuing the effort to stop Republicans from cutting Social Security, but to talk about expanding Social Security benefits,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders opposed the proposal to switch the Social Security cost-of-living formula to \u201cthe chained CPI,\u201d calling it \u201cthe most absurd idea I ever heard of\u201d because, he said, it would likely lower benefits.\n\nMoreThe Impact of Older Voters on the 2016 Election\n\nTo help keep Social Security solvent, Sanders called to lift the cap on taxable income subject to Social Security payroll taxes \u2014 from today\u2019s $118,000 to $250,000. That, he said, would extend the life of the Social Security trust fund (to pay full benefits) from the current 19 years to 58 years and would expand benefits by $1,300 a year for \u201cfolks trying to get by on $16,000 a year or less.\u201d\n\nMedicare \u201cI vigorously opposed Republican efforts to voucherize or privatize Medicare benefits,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cNot only should we not privatize Medicare, we should be expanding it and provide Medicare for all in a single-payer system.\u201d Sanders also favored adding vision, dental and hearing benefits to Medicare\u2019s coverage. And he said he wants Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, the way the Veterans Administration does, to lower costs for beneficiaries.\n\nCaregiving \u201cWe need to provide more protection and support to Alzheimer\u2019s caregivers,\u201d Sanders said, although he didn\u2019t offer specifics.\n\nAging in Place \u201cThis is a no-brainer. People would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than be forced to go to an institution,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cWe should respect that. It\u2019s a civil rights issue.\u201d Allowing more older Americans to age in place \u201ccan save substantial sums of Medicaid money,\u201d he added.\n\nAid in Dying Noting that his state, Vermont, has been \u201ca leader in end-of-life care,\u201d Sanders said: \u201cWe have to be extremely careful how these decisions are made. If a human is in a situation where the person is going to see life end in a short period of time and where they are suffering and choose no longer to be alive, they have the right to make that decision for themselves.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s Views on Key Issues\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Kasich, Davis discussed a few topics:\n\nMedicaid He noted that the Ohio governor took Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid money for the state and used it to, among other things, \u201copen nursing home beds for people who wouldn\u2019t otherwise qualify\u201d and toward long-term care for home care.\n\nMedicare Davis said: \u201cMedicare is going to have to change. It\u2019s not sustainable to continue growing by 7 percent a year. We\u2019re going to have to make some tough changes.\u201d\n\nSocial Security Solvency issues are \u201ceasily fixable if we act now,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe later we wait, the harder it gets.\u201d Davis said Kasich was not in favor of privatizing Social Security and opposed taxing Social Security benefits when he was in Congress.\n\nAlzheimer\u2019s Kasich \u201cfavors more money for Alzheimer\u2019s research,\u201d Davis noted.\n\n\u00a9 Twin Cities Public Television - 2016.
