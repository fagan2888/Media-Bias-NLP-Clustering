Shutterstock\n\nTo gauge the level of trouble state governments continue to have with the implementation of Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS), just do a Google News search on the topic. There is no shortage of recent local newspaper stories about cost overruns, critical audits, lawsuits and finger pointing between states and IT vendors.\n\nWhat led to this perfect storm? For one thing, Medicaid IT systems are complex, with thousands of business rules, and the federal and state requirements for what the systems must do keep changing. Because there are only 50 such systems in the country, only a handful of software vendors respond to procurements for new systems.\n\nThough the list of problems continues, there are some promising developments in the Medicaid IT world.\n\nMMIS Troubles\n\nWithin state government, there is management turnover in health and human services agencies almost every election cycle. \u201cIt is not just the Medicaid director or CIO who leaves,\u201d said Jim Joyce, general manager of health consulting services for Cognosante, which helps states with their MMIS implementations.\n\nOften, when those positions turn over, the new officials bring in their own trusted staff. So in the midst of a three-year implementation, the state goes through waves of change, not only at the policy level, but also at the personnel level. That is a lot of change for a large IT process to handle, Joyce said.\n\n\u201cWhen I was hired by the state of Oregon to work on its MMIS, I went through three different DHS [Department of Human Services] directors, four Medicaid directors and three CIOs. I was the only stable piece.\u201d\n\nNicole McNeal, a consultant with Federal Way, Wash.-based Public Knowledge, has done considerable research on the pain points of MMIS implementations across the country. One common issue she sees is that vendors customize the systems to meet the needs of one state and then try to transfer that system to another state.\n\n\u201cThe more customizations you make to a particular system, the less flexible it is,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think the states are sold systems that they expect to be flexible and configurable, but they end up having more spaghetti code than they actually realized.\u201d\n\nCognosante\u2019s Joyce agrees. When an MMIS developed for one state is ported over to another, the vendor has to modify 25 to 40 percent of the system to meet the new state\u2019s specific regulatory requirements.\n\n\u201cThat modification becomes the project,\u201d he said. And often, the vendor begins the work and finds the amount of change is larger than it had expected. Then during a three-year implementation process, new legislative changes are introduced that add more business rules and complexity. \u201cMany states get caught up in adding new changes, which adds more time to the project,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cIt can become a vicious circle.\u201d\n\nTony Rodgers, a principal with consulting firm Health Management Associates and former Medicaid director for the state of Arizona, said better project leadership could help mitigate the problems that often crop up with MMIS replacements.\n\n\u201cYou need to create a unit of analysts who understand the business processes and have a deep understanding of key functions of the MMIS,\u201d he said. Projects often run into difficulty because there is an organizational culture of people being afraid to bring up problems. In some cases, he said, agency leaders intentionally stay in the dark.\n\n\u201cThey perceive MMIS as very risky,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the project is going south, no one wants to take responsibility. People start backing away so that they have deniability.\u201d The project team has to be able to identify and bring to leadership what is happening and the key decisions that have to be made, he said. \u201cThey must harvest issues and translate them and escalate them to management to make decisions.\u201d\n\nRodgers said that when Arizona did an MMIS replacement, he acted as a super project manager. \u201cI felt I had to change the culture. If people know a change isn\u2019t going to work, I don\u2019t want them afraid to say so because the culture has been to shoot the messenger.\u201d\n\nJoyce said another challenge has been that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been a \u201cpeople drain\u201d for many states. \u201cThey have so many ACA-compliant projects to work on that they send a lot of their best people to work on those. When they try to replace or modernize their MMIS, they don\u2019t have the resources.\u201d\n\nBoth Joyce and Rodgers argue that more resources and better project management can make a huge difference.\n\nRodgers also said it was valuable to bring in a third-party evaluator on the project. \u201cI brought in Gartner to observe. They had no stake in the project,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could validate the risk factors and how we were addressing them.\u201d\n\nJoyce mentioned that Cognosante played a similar role on a successful MMIS implementation in New Mexico. But Jim Plane, McNeal\u2019s colleague at Public Knowledge, called the overall system of implementing state MMIS systems broken.\n\n\u201cState and federal executives continue to believe that better project management or more project management will fix the problems,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that that has proven not to be true. What is broken is that states no longer need to acquire these highly customized systems. For most of their computing needs around claims processing, states can get those services from commercial entities at a much lower cost and risk, and states should focus their efforts on acquiring analytical systems rather than transaction processing systems.\u201d\n\nTaking a Different Approach\n\nDespite all the problems, there are some positive developments in the Medicaid IT world. The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has urged states to create modular systems so that they can replace segments of their MMIS rather than the whole thing at once.\n\n\u201cThe analogy often used around modularity has to do with a car,\u201d Joyce said, explaining that some people buy a brand new car every eight years, but they may only need to replace the tires or transmission. The idea is that instead of replacing the whole MMIS system, states should just replace modules. \u201cBut the vendors have been reluctant to chop their systems up into parts because then states could go to an auto parts store and purchase segments,\u201d he added.\n\nNevertheless, some states are working on modules. For instance, in February, Arkansas implemented a data warehouse system and in March a pharmacy system. Now it is working on the core MMIS. \u201cThe idea is to do one at a time, and don\u2019t try to bite off the whole thing at once,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cMore states are doing that and that model is much more successful.\u201d\n\nAnother type of innovation is that states such as Michigan and Illinois have banded together on MMIS implementation. And Florida recently announced it would collaborate with Puerto Rico on MMIS. But the model isn\u2019t proven yet. \u201cIt does get pretty complicated when you have to do a memorandum of understanding with another state and don\u2019t have direct control of the system,\u201d McNeal said.\n\nSome states are starting to look at purchasing Medicaid claims processing as a service rather than building their own systems. \u201cI think this year you will see a state go through a procurement for MMIS services,\u201d Plane said. \u201cAnd once one state paves the way, you'll likely see other states follow suit.\u201d\n\nBut since each state is so different, how will vendors provide a generic service that matches up with each state\u2019s individual needs? \u201cThat is the challenge,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cI am not saying it can\u2019t be overcome, but it is a pretty large barrier.\u201d\n\nStates trying to get to that services model have to look closely at their policies and payment rules to simplify them, McNeal said. \u201cThe more you can streamline,\u201d she said, \u201cthe more you are able to take advantage of a services approach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Most state governments continue to have trouble with the implementation of Medicaid Management Information Systems, but some are starting to take different approaches.", "pubDate": "2015-04-7", "og": {"title": "Medicaid IT Systems: The Perfect Storm"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19be\"", "article_summary": "For one thing, Medicaid IT systems are complex, with thousands of business rules, and the federal and state requirements for what the systems must do keep changing.\nShutterstockTo gauge the level of trouble state governments continue to have with the implementation of Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMIS), just do a Google News search on the topic.\nSome states are starting to look at purchasing Medicaid claims processing as a service rather than building their own systems.\nBecause there are only 50 such systems in the country, only a handful of software vendors respond to procurements for new systems.\nBut Jim Plane, McNeal\u2019s colleague at Public Knowledge, called the overall system of implementing state MMIS systems broken."}
