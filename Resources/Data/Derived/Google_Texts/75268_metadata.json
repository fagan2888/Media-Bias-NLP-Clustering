McMorris, who won big air Friday night, has twice won two golds in a single X Games.\n\nSpinning a creative line through the rail section, McMorris was able to pass Norwegian rider Stale Sandbech, even though Sandbech\u2019s flipping tricks off the jumps were more technical.\n\nBoth riders hit switch backside 1260s off the first hit. Sandbech threw a 1440 double-cork off the middle air, compared to McMorris\u2019 1080-degree rotation in the same double-flipping trick. Both riders stomped huge triple-cork 1440s on the final jump. That mute-grabbed triple-cork 1440 has served McMorris well in slopestyle, delivering him two golds and a silver in the last three X Games slopestyle contests.\n\nMcMorris said the new switch 12 and his rail work contributed to his 96-point second run.\n\n\u201cI wanted to something different and I\u2019m glad I took the time and brought that switch 12 into the run because I think it played huge on my score,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the rails definitely set me apart too.\u201d\n\nSandbech earned his first X Games silver on Sunday, adding to his trio of bronze medals. Swedish rider Sven Thorgren collected his first X Games with bronze.\n\nAnderson, the California yoga-lover who won gold in her sport\u2019s Olympic debut last year in Russia, was the only American in the finals. Her airs were large, some of the largest of the competition, but her rail section work paled to Norendal\u2019s.\n\nWatch: Mark McMorris wins fifth X Games gold\n\nAnderson won her first X Games slopestyle medal with a bronze in 2006 and has medaled every year since, except for 2009. She earned her third X silver Sunday.\n\nCanada\u2019s Spencer O\u2019Brien threw the first-ever backside 900 in women\u2019s slopestyle competition but missed the podium, revealing the trajectory of progression in women\u2019s riding. New Zealand\u2019s Christy Prior, an X Games rookie who won bronze in last month\u2019s Dew Tour, snuck past O\u2019Brien on her final run of the best-of-three competition to win bronze.\n\nPodium run complete. Garrett Goodwin completed his methodical climb up the podium Sunday by winning gold in the adaptive snocross finals.\n\nThe 22-year-old Goodwin, who won bronze as an adaptive rookie in 2013 and claimed silver last year, held off a couple of charges by Doug Henry, who finished with his second X Games silver.\n\nGoodwin became paralyzed from the waistdown during a 2011 motorcross training accident and is one of the first to race with a rollcage protecting him.\n\nFour-time defending adaptive snocross champion Mike Schultz did not race Sunday after shattering his heel Friday in the adaptive snowboarder semifinals.\n\nHis to lose. Tucker Hibbert continued his dominance in the snocross, winning for the eighth consecutive X Games. The 30-year-old has nine total golds to go along with three silvers and a bronze.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mark McMorris, Silje Norendal add to X Games slopestyle gold count", "title": "Mark McMorris, Silje Norendal add to X Games slopestyle gold count", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/25/mark-mcmorris-silje-norendal-add-to-x-games-slopestyle-gold-count/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__mcmorrisp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150125__mcmorrisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-25T13:36:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:32:29+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Winter X Games"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf91\"", "article_summary": "Watch: Mark McMorris wins fifth X Games goldAnderson won her first X Games slopestyle medal with a bronze in 2006 and has medaled every year since, except for 2009.\nASPEN \u2014 Using the rail section at the top of the slopestyle course, riders Mark McMorris and Silje Norendal won gold Sunday in the Winter X Games finals.\nA few minutes later, the judges again rewarded the most technical rail riding, delivering McMorris, the contest\u2019s top qualifier, his fifth X Games gold.\nThat mute-grabbed triple-cork 1440 has served McMorris well in slopestyle, delivering him two golds and a silver in the last three X Games slopestyle contests.\nMcMorris, who won big air Friday night, has twice won two golds in a single X Games."}
