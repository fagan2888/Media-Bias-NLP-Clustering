The former would double Aetna\u2019s size in Georgia, while the latter would add to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia\u2019s big membership lead over other insurers in the state. Anthem is Blue Cross\u2019 parent company.\n\nIf both deals ultimately are approved by regulators and shareholders, the two combined companies, Aetna and Anthem, would be part of the new Big Three, with UnitedHealthcare being the other giant national player.\n\nOxendine, of Gwinnett County, served four elected terms as the state\u2019s insurance commissioner, from 1995 to 2011. In 2010 he declined to run for re-election and sought the governorship instead, but he lost in the Republican primary. Ralph Hudgens, also a Republican, succeeded him as insurance commissioner in 2011 and is now in his second term.\n\nOxendine says he believes commissioners in every state \u201cshould be extremely concerned\u201d about the two mergers. They should look at both deals in tandem, not separately, he added.\n\n\u201cPrices are already going up\u2019\u2019 under the Affordable Care Act, he said.\n\nInsurers have been pursuing such big deals in order to cut costs and increase their clout in negotiations with medical providers and for better pricing on pharmaceuticals.\n\nWhile in office, Oxendine approved WellPoint\u2019s acquisition of the parent firm of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia, which was completed in 2001, and Aetna\u2019s purchase of Prudential, finalized in 1999. But he says the current contemplated mergers are much different.\n\nThe WellPoint deal, Oxendine said, did not affect competition because WellPoint had no operations in Georgia at the time. And Prudential was a small health insurer in Georgia when Aetna bought it, he said.\n\nThe quest to diversify\n\nOxendine said he has not talked with Hudgens about the upcoming state reviews of the two deals.\n\nA spokeswoman for Hudgens, meanwhile, told Georgia Health News that he will have the same process for each merger \u2014 including a department review and public hearings \u2014 but that they will be done separately.\n\nThe leader of the Georgia Association of Health Plans defended the insurers\u2019 moves, saying that they will go through much tougher scrutiny than mergers between hospitals.\n\n\u201cHe [Oxendine] should have the same point of view with hospital mergers,\u2019\u2019 said Graham Thompson, executive director of the insurer trade group.\n\nAetna and Anthem are looking to diversify their portfolios of insurance offerings in their respective deals, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to become more well-rounded.\u201d\n\nOn the competition issue, Thompson noted that Georgia consumers had choices of four insurers in the health insurance exchange created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cYou may not have four choices of hospitals, or which imaging center or lab you go to,\u201d he said.\n\nHealth insurers are now under federal restrictions that they must spend at least 80 percent of their premium dollars on medical care and quality improvements. \u201cIt\u2019s a much different game,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe submit our rates well in advance. Hospitals can charge more, as can physician groups.\u201d\n\nThe consumer group Georgians for a Healthy Future says it wants to have input in the insurance merger reviews.\n\nConsolidation \u201cis happening really fast across the industry,\u2019\u2019 said Cindy Zeldin, executive director of the group. \u201cWe want to be engaged in this. It will have a big impact on consumers.\u201d\n\nOxendine, who returned to the practice of law after serving as commissioner, has been prominent in other health care news recently.\n\nOn behalf of a number of clients, he recently filed a lawsuit against Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia that argues the insurer fraudulently continued to charge high premiums to customers while at the same time cutting payments to out-of-network medical providers, according to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution article by James Salzer.\n\nOxendine said Blue Cross justified the higher premiums by telling customers they could be treated by higher-paid, out-of-network providers, the article stated.\n\nBlue Cross said the charges are unfounded and that providers were adequately compensated, the AJC reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ATLANTA | The giant health insurance mergers now on the table would reduce the number of major national insurers from five to three.John Oxendine, Georgia\u2019s former insurance commissioner, believes that a Big Three is not enough for a competitive balance.\u201cThree is not competitive,\u2019\u2019 Oxendine told Georgia Health News last week. \u201cMy personal opinion is that it would be very bad for consumers.\u201d", "application-name": "Jacksonville.com", "og": {"site_name": "jacksonville.com", "description": "The giant health insurance mergers now on the table would reduce the number of major national insurers from five to three.\nJohn Oxendine, Georgia's former insurance commissioner, believes that a Big Three is not enough for a competitive balance.\n\"Three is not competitive,'' Oxendine told Georgia Health News last week. \"My personal opinion is that it would be very bad for consumers.\"", "title": "Former Georgia insurance commissioner says health insurance mergers would be bad for consumers", "url": "http://jacksonville.com/news/georgia/2015-08-03/story/former-georgia-insurance-commissioner-says-health-insurance-mergers", "image": "http://jacksonville.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#426ab2", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon70x70tiny1.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8iconLarge1.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/wide310x150.png", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/Win8icon.png", "keywords": "Georgia, News", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://jacksonville.com/files/img/editorial/Win8Tiles/Win8icon150x150square1.png", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"articleid": 655487, "publishtime": "2015-08-03T21:03:36Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf4bd\"", "article_summary": "ATLANTA | The giant health insurance mergers now on the table would reduce the number of major national insurers from five to three.\n\u201cThree is not competitive,\u2019\u2019 Oxendine told Georgia Health News last week.\nBlue Cross said the charges are unfounded and that providers were adequately compensated, the AJC reported.\nHealth insurers are now under federal restrictions that they must spend at least 80 percent of their premium dollars on medical care and quality improvements.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to become more well-rounded.\u201dOn the competition issue, Thompson noted that Georgia consumers had choices of four insurers in the health insurance exchange created by the Affordable Care Act."}
