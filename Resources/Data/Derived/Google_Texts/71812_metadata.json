That is the most equitable solution that I could see while recognizing that we need to be seriously addressing the criteria for how these things are decided in the future.\n\nAccording to the Times, Muslim parents and the Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations also petitioned for school to be closed on Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr, the last day of the fasting month of Ramadan. School officials denied the petition because they say closures are not meant to \u201chonor\u201d a particular faith, but rather as a matter of practicality to close on days when many students and teachers would otherwise be absent.\n\nNorman Gordon, an associate pastor of Gaithersburg Presbyterian Church, who has three children in the school system, told the Associated Press \u201cthe decision sent a message to all students that their faith is not important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, in an effort to be politically correct, they\u2019ve kind of snubbed not just one particular faith tradition, but all three,\u201d Gordon said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Montgomery County Board of Education has voted to remove the names of Christian, Jewish and Muslim holidays from its school calendar.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Montgomery County Board of Education has voted to remove the names of Christian, Jewish and Muslim holidays from its school calendar.", "title": "Maryland School Removes Religious Holidays From Calendar", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/483288763.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-13T23:49:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xxdVOd"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Montgomery County Board of Education has voted to remove the names of Christian, Jewish and Muslim holidays from its school calendar.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/483288763.jpg"}, "title": "Maryland School Removes Religious Holidays From Calendar", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious liberty", "published_time": "2014-11-14T03:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-13T23:49:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "holidays, Schools, education, religious freedom, freedom of religion, Muslim, Muslim holidays, Christian, Jewish"}, "article_summary": "A school board in Maryland this week voted to remove the names of Christian, Jewish and Muslim holidays from its school calendar.\nAccording to the Times, Muslim parents and the Maryland chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations also petitioned for school to be closed on Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr, the last day of the fasting month of Ramadan.\nRebecca Smondrowski, the school board member who introduced the motion, told MyMCMedia that the decision was \u201cabout equality.\u201dI made the motion because if we are closing for operational reasons, then there should be no need to make reference to religion.\nThat is the most equitable solution that I could see while recognizing that we need to be seriously addressing the criteria for how these things are decided in the future.\nSchool officials denied the petition because they say closures are not meant to \u201chonor\u201d a particular faith, but rather as a matter of practicality to close on days when many students and teachers would otherwise be absent."}
