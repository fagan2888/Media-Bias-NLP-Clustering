Researchers in the study, published Monday in Health Affairs, also found that due to that same Obamacare provision, the number of mental-health visits the younger group had to pay for out-of-pocket declined by 12.4% compared with the older group.\n\n\n\nThis could be good news not only for young adults with mental-health issues, but also for their friends, families, neighbors, and parents, who often suffer most directly when their mentally ill or addicted loved ones are unable to access affordable treatment.\n\nThe findings are related to the fact that uninsured people, as well as those with bare-bones insurance plans, often rely on \u201ccommunity clinics and other safety net providers\u201d for emergency mental-health treatment. They therefore have trouble affording specialized or residential treatment, or accessing individualized psychotherapy. In contrast, young adults who are able to remain on their parents\u2019 plans often have access to a more generous range of treatment options, according to the study.\n\nThe research, which was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, comes with a few caveats, one of which is that the study period was relatively short and spanned the financial crisis, which hit young people disproportionately hard. It\u2019s possible that during that period, young people may have been more likely to seek mental-health treatment. The research was conducted by Brendan Saloner, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Schools of Public Health, as well as Benjamin Le Cook, a senior scientist and assistant professor of psychiatry at the Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A provision in Obamacare means that more mentally ill young people are getting medical treatment", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "A provision means more mentally ill young people are getting medical treatment", "title": "Obamacare Leads to Surge in Mental-Health Treatment", "url": "http://time.com/3080227/obamacare-mental-health-treatment/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/452984430.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/452984430.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Obamacare Leads to Surge in Mental-Health Treatment", "description": "A provision means more mentally ill young people are getting medical treatment", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act, mental health treatment", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "obamacare, aca, affordable care act, mental health treatment"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb8b\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s possible that during that period, young people may have been more likely to seek mental-health treatment.\nThe findings are related to the fact that uninsured people, as well as those with bare-bones insurance plans, often rely on \u201ccommunity clinics and other safety net providers\u201d for emergency mental-health treatment.\nIn contrast, young adults who are able to remain on their parents\u2019 plans often have access to a more generous range of treatment options, according to the study.\nA provision in the health care reform law allowing parents to keep their adult children on their health-insurance plans has led to millions more young people with mental-health and substance-abuse problems getting treatment, according to a new study.\nThis could be good news not only for young adults with mental-health issues, but also for their friends, families, neighbors, and parents, who often suffer most directly when their mentally ill or addicted loved ones are unable to access affordable treatment."}
