North Bay employers will have to make sure they are compliant with the next round of federal Affordable Care Act rules taking effect in 2016. And California laws becoming effective cover a higher minimum wage, employee leave and discrimination. The following were compiled from the California Chamber of Commerce and National Law Review (natlawreview.com/article/summary-key-new-california-laws-2016-what-employers-should-know; laboremploymentlawblog.com/articles/california-employment-legislation). New federal Affordable Care Act mandates At the national level, 14 changes have been made in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since it was signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010 — the most recent on Oct. 8, 2015 — preventing health insurance premiums for 3 million people from going up next year. This legislative work-in-progress will continue into 2016 with a redefinition of “small employer” on Jan. 1 from being a business with between one and 50 full-time-equivalent (FTE) employees to a business with between one to 100 FTE employees. (An FTE employee is defined as a person working at least 30 hours a week.) This means that employers with between 51 and 100 FTE employees will now have to meet ACA mandates for small group employers — unless the employer offers grandfathered plans, including those that cover essential health benefits and meet rating requirements. Is your business ready for Affordable Care Act requirements taking effect Jan. 1, 2016? Beginning Nov. 15, businesses with 51 to 100 employees started being able to use the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, online marketplace to purchase healthcare plans for employees. Prior to this SHOP was only available for firms with 50 or fewer employees. Also in 2016, the annual in-network, out-of-pocket maximum cost — including deductibles, copays and coinsurance — that employers can require employees to pay before health coverage starts is up to $6,850 for an individual and $13,700 for family coverage. The maximum out-of-pocket expense any individual with family coverage, be it an employee or covered dependent, is required to pay before family coverage starts is also $6,850. These amounts do not apply to grandfathered or transitional plans. Penalties imposed by the IRS for failure to meet the applicable large employer reporting requirements for 2015, which are due in 2016, or to provide individual statements to all full-time employees, will go up, as well as penalty caps. Dec. 15 is the last day to enroll in, or change, plans for new coverage to start Jan. 1, 2016. Jan. 15, 2016, is the last day to enroll in, or change plans for new coverage to start Feb. 1, 2016. On Jan. 31, 2016, open enrollment ends. Enrollments or changes Jan. 16–31 take effect March 1, 2016.

(page 2 of 5) Key California law changes Gov. Brown has signed several laws impacting California employers in 2016 as well as laws enacted in mid-2015 that will carry over into 2016 and beyond. A summary of some of the key new laws follows. Some new laws make important changes to existing state law. Others make small changes to different parts of existing law or may only affect certain employers, such as employers with piece-rate workers. Unless specified, all new legislation goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2016. MINIMUM WAGE The California minimum wage increases on Jan. 1, 2016, to $10 per hour. This is not a new law, it was signed in 2013, but this is the last mandatory increase from that law. LEAVES OF ABSENCE AND BENEFITS Mandatory paid sick leave amendments: Last year, the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act was signed into law and required employers to begin providing the mandatory paid sick leave (PSL) benefit beginning July 1, 2015. But after the law was already in effect, the Legislature passed AB 304 which made several substantial amendments to the law. The amendments became effective on July 13, 2015. Among other things, the amendments: Clarify who is a covered worker; provide alternative accrual methods other than one hour for every 30 hours worked; clarify protections for employers that already provided PSL or paid time off before Jan. 1, 2015 (a grandfather clause); and provide alternative methods for paying employees who use PSL. School activities leave: SB 579 expands the ability of employees to take protected time off from work for school or childcare related activities. It allows an employee protected time off to find a school or a licensed childcare provider and to enroll or re-enroll a child, and time off to address childcare provider or school emergencies. SB 579 also expands the categories of employees eligible to take time off for a child. It broadly defines “parent” and extends these protections to an employee who is a stepparent or foster parent or someone who stands in loco parentis to a child. This new law also allows employees to take up to 40 PSL hours of for the purpose of participating in school activities, subject to specified conditions.



Kin care: SB 579 makes technical amendments to California’s “kin care” law to conform to the mandatory PSL law. SB 579 allows employees to use kin care for the same purposes specified by the PSL law and defines “family member” under the kin care law the same as under PSL. Employers are required to allow employees to use one-half of their accrued sick leave to care for a “family member” (as defined) and prohibits an employer from denying an employee the right to use sick leave or taking specific discriminatory action against an employee for using, or attempting to exercise the right to use, sick leave for these purposes. In other words, employees may use paid sick leave for their own health condition or preventative care; a family member’s health condition or preventative care; if the employee is a victim of domestic assault, sexual violence, and/or stalking and needs to take time off.



National Guard leave and protections: AB 583 expands the list of employees eligible for California’s military leave protections, such as return rights and other job protections.



Unemployment insurance and electronic reporting: AB 1245 requires electronic reporting for unemployment insurance reports submitted to the Employment Development Department (EDD). It also requires employers to remit contributions for unemployment insurance premiums by electronic funds transfer. The requirements will apply to employers with 10 or more employees beginning January 1, 2017, and to all employers beginning January 1, 2018.



State disability insurance eligibility: Waiting Periods: SB 667 changes the eligibility waiting period requirements when an individual files a second disability claim for the same or related condition as his/her initial claim. SB 667 also extends the time between claims that will be considered one disability benefit period. This law becomes effective July 1, 2016.



Unemployment Insurance: Training Benefits: AB 1514 makes changes related to eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits during a period when the individual is taking specified training or retraining. DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION PROTECTION Gender wage equality: SB 358 (The California Fair Pay Act) revises Labor Code section 1197.5, which deals with gender pay inequality or disparity. Employers will now be subject to one of the strictest and most aggressive equal pay laws in the country. It clarifies exceptions to the rule, extends employer’s record retention requirement, and includes protections for employees inquiring about wages -- while also creating a new cause of action, and easing the burden on employees to establish a prima facie case, making it more difficult for an employer to demonstrate that wage differences are justified.

(page 3 of 5) The California Fair Pay Act is intended to increase requirements for wage equality and transparency. Under existing California law, employers cannot pay an employee less than the rate paid to an opposite-sex employee in the same establishment for equal work on jobs that require equal skill, effort and responsibility, and could face a lawsuit for such disparity. The Fair Pay Act revises and expands this prohibition. It eliminates the requirement that the pay difference be “within the same establishment” and eliminates use of the terms “equal work” for “equal skill, effort, and responsibility.” In effect, it lowers the standard from “equal work” to “substantially similar work” when viewed as a composite of skill, effort and responsibility. In addition, the legislation places specific requirements on employers to affirmatively show that any wage differential is not unlawful but is instead based entirely and reasonably upon one or more of the acceptable listed factors, including seniority and merit systems or other bona fide factors coupled with a showing of “business necessity,” as defined. The Fair Pay Act prohibits employers from terminating, discriminating or retaliating against an employee who exercises his/her rights under the Act or assists others in exercising their rights. Employers also can’t prohibit employees from disclosing their wages, discussing the wages of others or asking about another employee’s wages. The Act does not obligate anyone to disclose wages when asked. It’s important to remember that the ability of employees to discuss wages is already protected by other existing state and federal laws, even though the Fair Pay Act also includes this same protection. This law creates a private right of action for retaliation and discrimination. Whistle-blower and antiretaliation protections: AB 1509 expands whistle-blower and anti-retaliation protections to prohibit employers from retaliating against an employee when his/her family member engages in whistle-blowing or other described protected activity, such as complaining of wage theft or unsafe working conditions. AB 1509 also expands joint employer liability by changing the definition of employer under these anti-retaliation laws to include “client employers” — a specific definition related to companies who contract for labor. Reasonable accommodation and retaliation: AB 987 clarifies that an employer can’t retaliate or discriminate against an employee for requesting a reasonable accommodation for a disability or religion, regardless of whether the request was granted. The law clarifies that the mere act of making the request is protected conduct under the Fair Employment and Housing Act. WAGE AND HOUR Private Attorneys General Act: AB 1506 (effective Oct. 2 as urgency legislation) amends the Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) to allow employers a limited right to correct (or “cure”) two types of itemized wage statement violations before an employee may bring a civil action under PAGA. An employer will now be allowed to correct violations involving: (1) a failure to provide employees with an itemized wage statement that contains the inclusive dates of the pay period; or (2) a failure to provide employees with an itemized wage statement that contains the name and address of the legal entity. AB 1506 amends Labor Code Sections 2699, 2699.3, and 2699.5 which codify California’s Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (PAGA) that took effect Oct. 2. Piece rate workers: AB 1513 sets forth new rules for employers with piece-rate employees. The law requires employers to pay piece rate workers for rest and recovery periods and other non-productive time at specified minimum hourly rates, separate from the piece-rate compensation. AB 1513 mandates that specific information, such as the total hours of compensable rest and recovery periods, must now be included on a piece-rate employee’s itemized wage statement (pay stub). AB 1513 also contains a “safe harbor” provision for employers who, in the past, may not have properly paid piece- rate workers for rest and recovery periods. Employers who want to take advantage of the safe harbor provision will need to meet the statutory requirements by December 15, 2016. Meal periods (health care industry): SB 327 (became effective Oct. 5 as urgency legislation) reaffirms that the Wage Orders which allow for a specific meal period waiver in the health care industry are still in effect. Employers in the health care industry can continue to allow employees to voluntarily waive one of their two meal periods, even when an employee’s shift exceeds 12 hours (Wage Orders 4 and 5). Section 512 requires two meal periods for work periods of more than 10 hours. However, employees are allowed to waive their second meal period if the total hours worked in their shift is no more than 12 hours. Labor Commissioner Expanded Enforcement Powers: SB 588 In order to enforce a judgment for nonpayment of wages, SB 588 allows the Labor Commissioner to issue levies and liens on employer property and to issue “stop orders” — preventing the employer from continuing to conduct business in the state. SB 588 also specifies that an individual acting on behalf of the employer can be personally liable for violating certain provisions of the Labor Code. SB 588 further provides for joint and several liability for unpaid wages in the property-services and long-term care industries when judgments are not satisfied.

(page 4 of 5) Labor Commissioner Enforcement of Local Laws: AB 970 allows the Labor Commissioner to now investigate and enforce local overtime and minimum wage laws, such as the local minimum wage ordinances enacted by many cities. AB 970 also gives the Labor Commissioner new authority to issue citations and penalties when employers fail to reimburse employees for employer-required expenses. This bill amends Labor Code Section 558 (pertaining to overtime) and Sections 1197 and 1197.1 (pertaining to minimum wage). This bill also amends Labor Code Section 2802 pertaining to indemnification of employees by employers for expenses or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee’s duties, or as a result of obeying the employer’s directions. Wage Garnishment: SB 501 (effective July 1, 2016) reduces the prohibited amount of weekly disposable earnings that may be garnished pursuant to a withholding order. SB 501 amends, repeals, and adds Section 706.050 of the Code of Civil Procedure, relating to wage garnishment. The new law reduces the prohibited amount of an individual judgment debtor’s weekly disposable earnings subject to levy under an earnings withholding order from exceeding the lesser of 25% of the individual’s weekly disposable earnings or 50% of the amount by which the individual’s disposable earnings for the week exceed 40 times the state minimum hourly wage, or applicable local minimum hourly wage, if higher, in effect at the time the earnings are payable. Misclassification Amnesty for Motor Carrier Employers: AB 621 establishes the Motor Carrier Employer Amnesty Program for port transportation companies (also known as port drayage companies). The amnesty program allows motor carrier companies to avoid liability for misclassification of drivers as independent contractors if the companies voluntarily enter into settlement agreements with the Labor Commissioner by January 1, 2017. Public Works and Prevailing Wages: A number of bills signed this year relate to public works and prevailing wages. Employers who provide services or construction work on public works projects for the government or public-sector entities must pay the prevailing wage, which is usually significantly higher than the minimum wage. The bills include: AB 219, AB 327 and AB 852. HIRING Unlawful Use of E-Verify: AB 622 prohibits employers from using the federal E-Verify system at a time or in a manner not required by federal law to check the employment authorization status of an existing employee or of an applicant who has not received an offer of employment. Employers can still use E-Verify, in accordance with federal law, to check the employment authorization status of a person who has been offered employment. AB 622 also requires employers who use E-Verify to comply with specific employee notification requirements when they receive notice from a federal agency that the submitted E-Verify information does not match federal records. There is a penalty of $10,000 for each violation. Under U.S. law, companies are required to employ only individuals who may legally work in the United States – either U.S. citizens, or foreign citizens who have the necessary authorization. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that allows employers to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States. The E-Verify system is administered by: The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the United States Social Security Administration (SSA). Grocery Store Workers: Retention: AB 359 extends job protections to grocery store workers when a grocery store changes ownership — requiring the successor owner to retain grocery workers employed by the previous owner for a specific period of time. AB 897 defines a grocery establishment for purposes of this law. Professional Cheerleaders Are Employees: AB 202 requires that California-based professional sports teams classify cheerleaders as employees, not independent contractors, when the cheerleaders are used by the team during its exhibitions, events or games. WORKER’S COMPENSATION AB 1124: Requires the Division of Workers’ Compensation to establish a formulary for prescription medications in the workers’ compensation system by July 1, 2017. View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 Next

(page 5 of 5) SB 623: Ensures that all injured workers receive benefits by clarifying that workers cannot be denied benefits based on citizenship or immigration status. AB 438: Requires specified workers’ compensation forms, notices and fact sheets to be made available in additional languages by January 1, 2018. SB 542: Makes clarifications to medical provider network laws, including requirements about the information a medical provider network must post on its website. SB 560: Allows the Contractors State License Board to investigate and enforce the obligation of licensees to secure valid and current workers’ compensation insurance. Benefit Notices: The Division of Workers’ Compensation also recently finalized regulations revising certain benefit notices for January 1, 2016. Revisions were made to: The Claim Form and Notice of Potential Eligibility (DWC 1). The workers’ compensation “Notice to Employees” — a required posting for California. (NOTE: CalChamber’s 2016 California and Federal Employment Notices Poster and 2016 Required Notices Kit will contain the updated workers’ compensation notice.) MISCELLANEOUS Franchisor–franchisee relationships: AB 525 changes the definition of when a franchise agreement can be terminated for good cause and also makes other changes regarding obligations and rights when a franchise agreement is not renewed. Ride-sharing services: AB 1422 requires ride-sharing services, such as Uber and Lyft, to participate in the state Department of Motor Vehicles’ “pull-notice system” to regularly check the driving records of participating drivers, regardless of whether the driver is an employee or an independent contractor. The pull-notice system shows accidents, license revocations/suspensions, DUIs and other actions taken against a license holder. View as one page Prev 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5

North Bay employers will have to make sure they are compliant with the next round of federal Affordable Care Act rules taking effect in 2016. And California laws becoming effective cover a higher minimum wage, employee leave and discrimination.
