He\u2019s spelling out how his state crafted the nation\u2019s first universal health coverage law and is now tackling the even tougher challenge of rising medical costs. This is, to be clear, not a rapt throng of Apple fanatics hanging on every word from a stage-pacing CEO about the latest iPhone tweaks. This is a sober audience of buttoned-down insurance barons listening to a wonkish peer talk about Massachusetts policy. And he could not be more enthusiastic.\n\n\u201cWe forged an enduring agreement on some of the thorniest and most challenging issues in health care,\u201d he tells the gathering.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs this guy serious?\n\nWhile the US health care overhaul is under attack from critics who want it dismantled and his state is grappling with the highest health costs in the nation, Dreyfus is unfazed. He may just be the last health care reform optimist amid the partisan free-for-all. His message to colleagues in other states: We\u2019re making it work. You can, too. \u201cWe have a health care system in Massachusetts where nearly everyone is covered, and we\u2019re making significant progress on that Holy Grail of better care and lower cost,\u201d he says in an earnest tone.\n\nHe is not exactly an unbiased voice. But he is a confident one. Dreyfus is the 55-year-old chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, the largest health insurer in the state that paved the path to Obamacare. Dreyfus has honed his \u201chow we do it in the Bay State\u201d talk through repetition. He\u2019s given variations to congressional leaders on Capitol Hill, hospital and medical technology chiefs in Atlanta, directors of a renowned New York research foundation, and graduate students at Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania. At a time when President Obama\u2019s new health care law is still playing out and November\u2019s midterm elections may turn on its results, Dreyfus is out there like a brainy but fervent cheerleader for a team that\u2019s struggling to find its identity.\n\nHis audience for this talk in the nation\u2019s capital is a trade association of his fellow insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, and Dreyfus knows some in the room will be skeptical. So he ditches his standard opening line: \u201cMy name is Andrew Dreyfus, and I\u2019m from the future,\u201d a nod to the notion Massachusetts is leading the way. Instead, he goes for self-deprecating humor. \u201cYou may be thinking, \u2018Why should I be listening to yet another talk about Massachusetts?\u2019 \u201d he says, drawing knowing chuckles from some of his listeners.\n\nDreyfus concedes that Massachusetts is scrambling to fix its own glitch-riddled health insurance website. But his narrative soon turns upbeat. He talks about sharing responsibility for the greater good, citing the example set by Republican former governor Mitt Romney and the late Democratic senator Ted Kennedy, who worked together on the landmark 2006 Massachusetts law. Left unsaid is that such bipartisan cooperation can sound like a fantasy today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterward, Dreyfus fields a few polite questions before catching a flight back to Boston. Audience reaction is cautious. \u201cThe politics and the market in our state are very different from Massachusetts,\u201d deadpans Caroline Carlson Delgross, director of portfolio delivery at Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina. But Scott Kelly, chief operating officer of Aspire Health Plan in Monterey, California, says, \u201cElements of what he talked about would certainly work in our market.\u201d\n\nOn this day, that lukewarm assessment is the closest Dreyfus will get to an endorsement.\n\nPete Marovich Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s Andrew Dreyfus has been giving talks around the nation insisting health reform can work. Here, he makes his case to insurance execs in Washington, D.C., in March.\n\nWITH HIS SLIGHT FRAME, wire-rimmed glasses, and closely cropped beard, Dreyfus could be mistaken for a professor who\u2019s wandered off campus. But ask most anyone in Massachusetts health care, and they\u2019ll tell you that he is the definition of a power broker. Few people have shaped health policy in the state more than Dreyfus. And now his influence extends from Beacon Hill to Capitol Hill.\n\nGovernor Deval Patrick traces his own education in the arcane realm of health care legislation and regulation to a series of forums Dreyfus hosted in 2005 at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Patrick was weighing a gubernatorial bid at the time, and Dreyfus ran the newly formed Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation. Ever since those forums, Patrick says, Dreyfus has been \u201ca person I turn to\u201d for advice on health issues. \u201cWe probably amended health care reform a dozen times before we got to payment reform,\u201d Patrick says, referring to the state\u2019s more recent cost containment laws. \u201cAndrew was always at the table as a source of objective fact. He understands you have to adjust as you go along.\u201d\n\nDreyfus has proved adept at adapting, and it\u2019s paid off. Over his career, he has remade himself multiple times: from community journalist to state regulator to policy guru and, after leaving the Blue Cross foundation to work for its parent insurance company, to captain of commerce. Running Blue Cross \u2014 which is at once a nonprofit public charity and the state\u2019s largest health insurer, collecting more than $6 billion in annual premiums \u2014 earned him $1.3 million in total compensation last year.\n\nBut in some ways, Dreyfus seems an unlikely corporate bigwig. He gets far more animated talking about the mission of health policy than about the prosaic balance of claims and premiums. He feels a personal stake in the success of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. For better or worse, he knows, the law is a Massachusetts experiment gone national. \u201cThere\u2019s a social justice dimension\u201d to the health overhaul, Dreyfus says. \u201cPeople who have been left out of the health care system have faced great hardships, and that needs to be corrected.\u201d\n\nDreyfus, who is unwaveringly mild-mannered, admits to getting upset when he hears or reads something that characterizes what took place in Massachusetts as a government health care takeover. But don\u2019t expect an expletive-laced rant. \u201cI\u2019m not a kick-the-wall kind of guy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll sometimes throw a newspaper down in disgust.\u201d\n\nNot referenced in his national stump speeches \u2014 friends say it\u2019s because he\u2019s too modest \u2014 is the role Dreyfus personally played in the state\u2019s push for universal health insurance. Through a set of in-depth reports at the Blue Cross foundation, he helped lay the intellectual groundwork for the first-in-the-nation expansion of access to care. \u201cOf the people outside government, no one had more influence in setting the stage than Andrew,\u201d says Massachusetts Port Authority chief executive Thomas Glynn, a former chief operating officer at Partners HealthCare. Glynn, who has known Dreyfus since they both worked for Governor Michael Dukakis in the 1980s, says, \u201cAndrew created the library of data \u2014 how many people were insured, how many old, how many young \u2014 that policy makers used.\u201d\n\nFor legislators and hospital and insurance leaders, the foundation\u2019s Kennedy Library forums were the equivalent of a \u201cUniversity of Health Care with dean Andrew Dreyfus,\u201d Glynn recalls. He says Dreyfus wanted the Blue Cross foundation to build a consensus for universal coverage but to stop short of recommending specific provisions of a bill, so it wouldn\u2019t get mired in politics.\n\nCritics suggest Dreyfus and other health care industry leaders are too cozy with politicians at the expense of financially strained patients struggling to keep up with mounting medical bills. The insider status of leaders like Dreyfus, the perception goes, reflects a process that favors the interests of insurers and hospitals over the people paying the premiums, making it tougher to rein in costs. \u201cHe\u2019s a very political person, too close to the policy makers,\u201d says Josh Archambault, a senior fellow at the Pioneer Institute, a free-market research group in Boston. \u201cTo control costs, you need robust, diverse, and ongoing discussions about solutions. Instead, we have people working behind closed doors to come up with complex bills that don\u2019t engage consumers.\u201d\n\nDreyfus presents himself \u2014 and his experience in Massachusetts \u2014 as a resource to be tapped on a national scale. He talks to members of Congress who won\u2019t talk to each other. In recent weeks, he has huddled in Washington with lawmakers, ranging from Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, and Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, to Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat who oversees Medicare and Medicaid as chairman of the Finance Committee. The subject: controlling medical costs.\n\nIt\u2019s not the easiest sell for an emissary from a state where residents \u2014 and employers \u2014 pay more for health care than anywhere else in the country.\n\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe staff/file The CEO is credited with helping bring universal health coverage to the state, an achievement members of both parties celebrated in 2006.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS HEALTH COSTS have outpaced the nation\u2019s since long before the state\u2019s universal health coverage law was enacted in 2006. There are many theories why, ranging from the quality and complexity of specialty care here to the high use of academic medical centers for routine procedures to the simple fact that everything else costs more here, too. While recent state laws have attempted to slow the rate of price increases, much of the real wrestling with costs has been done in the private sector \u2014 and in the closed-door contract talks between insurers and the hospitals and doctors they reimburse.\n\nDreyfus drew national attention in 2009 for helping to launch a Blue Cross payment plan, the \u201calternative quality contract,\u201d that has become an industry template. It rewards doctors and hospitals that keep patients healthy and cut down on unnecessary medical procedures. The plan gives health care providers fixed budgets for treating patients rather than paying them for each office visit, test, or surgery. If the providers come in under budget, they make more money. \u201cA lot of plans are borrowing from that playbook,\u201d says Karen Ignagni, president of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans. Because of that, she says, Dreyfus has \u201cbecome an important go-to person throughout the industry.\u201d\n\nPrinceton professor Uwe Reinhardt, a top US health economist, says he was struck by the originality of the Blue Cross alternative payment concept when he heard Dreyfus break it down at a seminar. He later invited Dreyfus to speak to his class about creating incentives for constraining medical costs. \u201cI\u2019ve been to a thousand health care conferences,\u201d Reinhardt says. \u201cPeople talk about innovations when they\u2019re recycling ideas that didn\u2019t work before and they think they can make them work now. When I heard Andrew, I was electrified.\u201d\n\nIn the years since Blue Cross and its competitors began negotiating fixed-budget payments with health care providers rather than traditional \u201cfee-for-service\u201d contracts, annual percentage increases on Bay State premiums have fallen from double digits to single digits. But it\u2019s not clear whether the drop has been driven by the new contracts, the tough line Patrick\u2019s insurance regulators have taken with health plans, or the sluggish economy, which has forced many workers fearing the loss of jobs to postpone elective medical procedures.\n\nMany still balk at turning to Massachusetts for advice on health policy. \u201cMassachusetts doesn\u2019t look anything like the rest of the country,\u201d says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director who now leads the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank. \u201cThey have the highest health care costs in the country. So the idea you can export what they\u2019re doing to places like Texas or Arizona . . . it\u2019s just not a natural fit.\u201d\n\nDREYFUS GREW UP IN BROOKLINE as the middle son of divorced parents, a birth order and status that he believes shaped his talent for building consensus as well as his diplomatic skills. His passion for social justice may have been fueled during the times he would accompany his father, owner of a property-casualty insurance firm, to Boston, where he was one of the few white agents to do business with African-American merchants in Roxbury and Dorchester.\n\nAt Brookline High School, one of Dreyfus\u2019s best friends was John Dukakis, son of then-governor Michael Dukakis. Because there was sometimes security around the Dukakis home in those days, they hung out mostly at the Dreyfus home. \u201cThe Dreyfus household was the headquarters for after-school activity,\u201d says John Dukakis, who remembers Dreyfus as a teenager who showed wisdom and curiosity beyond his years. \u201cEven then, Andrew approached things as a policy wonk,\u201d Dukakis says. \u201cHe was interested in learning how things work and how to make them better. Throughout my life, Andrew has been the close friend I can turn to for advice. I\u2019m one of the few people outside his family who remembers him without a beard.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Connecticut College, Dreyfus had a two-year stint as an editor at Boston\u2019s South End News. Then he went to work for his friend\u2019s dad, Governor Dukakis, in a succession of jobs, eventually rising to undersecretary of consumer affairs and business regulation and director of operations in the Executive Office of Human Services. On the side, he wrote about dance, which he\u2019d studied in college, for the Boston Herald and some weekly newspapers.\n\nDreyfus met his wife, Lynn Modell, a dancer, choreographer, and dance teacher, through a mutual friend. She accompanied him to some of the dance shows he reviewed in the 1980s. They married in 1989 and have a 23-year-old musician son and a 15-year-old high school daughter who engages in Fitbit competitions with her sometimes obsessive father to see who can walk more steps each day.\n\nUpon leaving government, Dreyfus took a job at the Massachusetts Hospital Association, a trade group. From there he was recruited by then-Blue Cross chief executive William Van Faasen to run the insurer\u2019s new foundation, envisioned as a launching pad for health policy. Dreyfus\u2019s work rolling out the foundation\u2019s plan for universal coverage led to a promotion. He became executive vice president of health care services. Under Van Faasen\u2019s successor, Cleve Killingsworth, Dreyfus helped design the alternative quality contract as an antidote to the fee-for-service pacts blamed for driving up medical costs.\n\nPat Greenhouse/Globe Staff With step counter on his belt, Dreyfus holds a walking meeting with his general counsel, Stephanie Lovell, in Brookline.\n\nLIKE OTHER CORPORATE EXECUTIVES, insurance CEOs typically keep a laser-like focus on the bottom line. But when he took over as Blue Cross chief executive in the summer of 2010, Dreyfus identified affordable medical care \u2014 not higher profits \u2014 as his primary goal. \u201cSlowing the unacceptable rate of [premium] increases will be the top priority,\u201d he said in a Globe interview. If his pronouncement was surprising, it was also shrewd \u2014 and not entirely out of character for someone whose antenna is finely tuned to the sentiment of customers and the mood on Beacon Hill. Just four months earlier, the Patrick administration had denied Blue Cross and its rival health insurers hefty rate increases for small businesses and individuals at a time when everyone was complaining about years of double-digit hikes.\n\nDreyfus understands most people lump their dealings with health insurance into the same category as IRS audits or root canals. He also knows holding down premium increases will please his customers \u2014 Massachusetts businesses and other employers \u2014 and be crucial to the success of his enterprise. Cost pressures are putting an uncomfortable spotlight on health insurers. \u201cWith that is going to come a certain degree of skepticism, and I accept that,\u201d Dreyfus says, employing some rhetorical jujitsu. \u201cIt helps to drive change. When I confront some anger or cynicism in the public, I try to turn it to our advantage.\u201d\n\nEarly in 2011, four months after becoming chief executive, Dreyfus sent a letter to more than 400 leaders of hospitals and physicians\u2019 practices, pressuring them to switch to risk-sharing insurance contracts with fixed budgets. Dubbed the \u201cor else\u201d letter by some health care providers, it implied Blue Cross would take a hard line in negotiations with those that didn\u2019t get on board. \u201cFee-for-service payment rates can not continue to rise if we are to meet the community\u2019s goal of affordable care,\u2019\u2019 Dreyfus wrote.\n\nBut only weeks after the \u201cor else\u201d letter, the insurer\u2019s credibility was thrown into question when it disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had agreed to an $11 million payout for Killingsworth, who left the previous year. Blue Cross also was paying five-figure annual fees to 18 board members, most of whom were prominent business, labor, or education leaders, the filing showed, even as it demanded that health providers bring down spending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to reconcile those two messages,\u201d Dreyfus admitted at the time. Faced with the ensuing barrage of criticism, Dreyfus said Blue Cross would temporarily halt its board fees and open a \u201cconversation\u2019\u2019 with community and state government leaders about whether it made sense for a big business such as Blue Cross to be organized as a nonprofit public charity. Despite the suggestion it might become a for-profit corporation, which would be subject to certain taxes and answer to shareholders, few believed that would happen \u2014 and it didn\u2019t. Last year, the insurer reinstated payments for directors, though at lower levels and to fewer board members. Blue Cross officials said the fees were needed to recruit and retain qualified people to the board. Some state leaders, notably Attorney General Martha Coakley, disagreed and made their views known.\n\nCritics say that while Blue Cross made the right opening moves to defuse the board pay crisis, it acted no differently in the end than any other company that cites competitors\u2019 compensation to justify its own generous payouts. The Blue Cross position was \u201cthey\u2019re paying their directors, so we should pay ours,\u201d says consumer advocate Deirdre Cummings, legislative director for the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group. \u201cThat kind of attitude is why salaries are going through the roof.\u201d\n\nIn gauging success on the Dreyfus affordability goal, the results have been mixed. Blue Cross executives point to progress in reaching his stated target of limiting annual premium increases to 3 to 5 percent rather than the 8 to 10 percent of the last decade. Base rate increases for small businesses and individuals have fallen below 3 percent, though many pay more because of additional factors such as the age of their workforce. But the overall price increase trend for health insurance \u2014 based on the cost and volume of health services \u2014 remains above 6 percent.\n\nFor all the talk of lower costs, premiums continue to increase, though not as much as in the past. To Cummings, that amounts to \u201cbaby steps,\u201d not the groundbreaking progress that she and others had hoped for. \u201cRates had been going up for so long that we should be seeing a decrease,\u201d she says, reflecting the views of many employers and consumers. \u201cWhat they\u2019re actually doing is slowing the growth. The consumers are owed some savings.\u201d\n\nNearly four years into his tenure, Dreyfus can point to other victories. Today, about 85 percent of Blue Cross health maintenance organization members are treated by doctors and hospitals that work under the alternative contract, up from 32 percent in 2010. That has helped restrain the kind of premium surges seen in the previous decade. On the financial front, Blue Cross has also become profitable under Dreyfus\u2019s leadership after losing money under his predecessor. And last year it signed up more members than it lost for the first time in five years. But its profits, which climbed from $13 million when Dreyfus took over in 2010 to $164 million in 2012, fell to $69 million in 2013. The drop was attributed to new taxes and fees, technology outlays, and efforts to hold down premiums.\n\nIT\u2019S AN AFTERNOON SEMINAR at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Dreyfus is giving his familiar lecture \u2014 part history lesson, part pep talk, part Bay State boosterism \u2014 to business students and others. They know that in Washington, in state capitals, and at kitchen tables around the country, people continue to debate health insurance website fixes and enrollment numbers, whether Obamacare is working better, working at all, or can ever work. The students pepper Dreyfus with questions. Leaning on a lectern in front of a projection screen, he answers patiently. He is in his element.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act anticipated a national solution to health care,\u201d he says, but he admits that now it may take time \u2014 and experimentation \u2014 to reach any kind of nationwide consensus. \u201cWe might wind up with five variations, and that might not be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nHis talk soon veers back to Massachusetts and the example it offers. The state\u2019s \u201clessons are transferable,\u201d he insists. But for the nation as a whole, he says, \u201cit\u2019s going to take a decade, and we should give it a decade.\u201d\n\nHEALTH CHECK\n\n45%\n\nPercentage of Americans who have an unfavorable view of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare)\n\n39%\n\nPercentage who have a favorable view\n\nSource: Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, June 2014\n\n60%\n\nPercentage who say they haven\u2019t been affected by Obamacare\n\nSource: Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, May 2014\n\n63%\n\nPercentage of Massachusetts adults who say they support the state\u2019s universal health insurance law\n\n35%\n\nPercentage who believe the law did not affect health care costs\n\nSource: Boston Globe and Harvard School of Public Health, June 2014\n\n$9,278\n\nHealth care spending per capita in Massachusetts for 2009, making it the highest state in the nation\n\n$5,031\n\nPer capita spending in Utah, the lowest\n\nSource: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\n\nMore coverage:\n\n- The health care debate\n\nSection: The Massachusetts health care law", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.3.214749655", "eomportal-id": 92974, "description": "High health care costs: Why is Andrew Dreyfus optimistic about them?
