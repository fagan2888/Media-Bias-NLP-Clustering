I think we need to reform the system completely \u2014 make it truly fair, with liberty and justice for everybody.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson called for a \u201cproportional tax\u201d of somewhere between 10 percent and 15 percent on individual and corporate income, and for the elimination of all tax deductions, including the cherished mortgage-interest and charity-donation deductions.\n\nThe 63-year-old also came out against \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that refuse to cooperate with federal deportation efforts on immigration, following the slaying of a San Francisco woman, with which an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times has been charged.\n\nVoters in the early primary states are being pulled in various directions because of the sheer size of the GOP field.\n\nThat was a clear reminder of that Tuesday after Mr. Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina crossed paths on the streets of downtown Portsmouth. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana also traveled through the state on Tuesday.\n\nPolls show Mr. Carson, who has never held political office, is running third nationally behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. He is tied for second in Iowa, which kicks off the nomination race, and is running in the middle of the pack in New Hampshire.\n\nThe Carson campaign announced earlier this month that it had pulled in $8.3 million in its opening quarter and more than $10 million since he launched his exploratory committee in early March.\n\n\u201cWe have easily what we need to run our campaign,\u201d Mr. Carson said. \u201cThe pundits early on said it would be impossible for us to mount a national campaign since we weren\u2019t connected to the big money and we are doing just fine because they forgot about one very important thing \u2014 the people.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson and his wife, Candy, celebrated his 40th wedding anniversary in nearby Nashua on Monday and followed that up Tuesday with five separate stops across the state.\n\nMr. Carson cast himself as an Washington outsider and drove home the idea that he is taking the same fact-based approach to policy as he did in the operating room, where he became renowned for separating conjoined twins.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who have been in Washington for decades,\u201d he said \u201cI don\u2019t think you would really want them to tie your shoe.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson said he opposed Obamacare, and said that he would push for health savings accounts, as well as the ability for people to purchase insurance across state lines.\n\nAsked about Social Security, he advocated for gradually raising the retirement age over time and said that he would offer a tax credit in exchange for people choosing to opt out of the program.\n\nOn immigration, he said he would seal the border and provide guest-worker permits to illegal immigrants, as long as the paid back taxes.\n\nHe said Congress should pass laws protecting religious freedom in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\nGinny Hooker, 60, of Pittsfield, said she is open to voting for Mr. Carson.\n\n\u201cI would consider. It is still too early, but I think he will do well,\u201d Ms. Hooker said, adding that she likes how he comes across as a genuine person. \u201cPeople can relate to him. He feels like he is someone who is easy to approach.\u201d\n\nBarry Heller, 66, of Merrimack, said Mr. Carson has good ideas, but comes off flat on the stump.\n\n\u201cHis biggest shortcoming is he is not as dynamic a speaker as a lot of the others,\u201d Mr. Heller said. \u201cHe needs to be a better speaker to get the message across.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vowing to crack down on the free-spending ways of Washington, Ben Carson signed a \"no new tax\" pledge here Tuesday as part a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Vowing to crack down on the free-spending ways of Washington, Ben Carson signed a \u201cno new tax\u201d pledge here Tuesday as part a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.", "title": "Ben Carson signs \u2018no new tax\u2019 pledge, visits New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/7/ben-carson-pledges-no-new-tax-visits-new-hampshire/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/07/7_7_2015_ap-580722704928201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/07/7_7_2015_ap-580722704928201.jpg", "description": "Vowing to crack down on the free-spending ways of Washington, Ben Carson signed a \"no new tax\" pledge here Tuesday as part a two-day swing through the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshir", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Carson signs \u2018no new tax\u2019 pledge, visits New Hampshire"}, "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Ben Carson, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9769\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe tax pledge is the least I can do,\u201d Mr. Carson told The Washington Times.\n\u201cWe have easily what we need to run our campaign,\u201d Mr. Carson said.\nThat was a clear reminder of that Tuesday after Mr. Carson and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina crossed paths on the streets of downtown Portsmouth.\nGinny Hooker, 60, of Pittsfield, said she is open to voting for Mr. Carson.\nHe feels like he is someone who is easy to approach.\u201dBarry Heller, 66, of Merrimack, said Mr. Carson has good ideas, but comes off flat on the stump."}
