The hospital is where Ashoka Mukpo, a freelance cameraman who is the fifth American to contract Ebola in West Africa, arrived in the United States for treatment on Monday, officials said. REUTERS/Sait Serkan Gurbuz (UNITED STATES - Tags: HEALTH SOCIETY) - RTR495K6\n\n4347383\n\nThe Nebraska hospital at the center of U.S. medical efforts to fight Ebola recently laid off staff due to budget cuts caused by Obamacare, and its Ebola-fighting resources are now limited due to staff constraints.\n\nThe Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha recently treated journalist Ashoka Mukpo after the NBC News freelancer contracted Ebola. The center is one of the only hospitals in the country that can adequately treat Ebola patients in its biocontainment units. The center is used as an example by officials who favor the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s plan of having a dedicated Ebola hospital in every state.\n\nBut the center\u2019s Ebola-fighting capacity is limited due in part to staff constraints.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much the level of staffing that we have as well,\u201d said the center\u2019s biocontainment unit nursing director Shelly Schwedhelm, referring to the center\u2019s capability to hold only two or three Ebola patients at once.\n\nThe Nebraska Medical Center announced 38 layoffs, including those of top officials, in October 2012 with more possible layoffs to come. The center directly blamed the layoffs on decreased revenue from Obamacare\u2019s reduction of Medicare reimbursement rates.\n\n\u201cThe lay-offs at Nebraska Medical Center. Is this a sign of things to come under Obamacare?\u201d asked Nebraska radio station 1110 KFAB in December 2012.\n\nThe Daily Caller extensively reported on Obamacare\u2019s damage to the hospital industry and medical technology research and development before Ebola surfaced in the United States, and GlaxoSmithKline was tasked with coming up with an Ebola vaccine as quickly as possible after several years of not having it ready.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Nebraska Medical Center can only take two or three Ebola patients at a time", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Nebraska hospital at the center of U.S. medical efforts to fight Ebola recently laid off staff due to budget cuts caused by Obamacare, and its Ebola-fighting resources are now limited due to staff", "title": "US Ebola Hospital Laid Off Staff Due To Obamacare, Now Has Staff Constraints", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/15/us-ebola-hospital-laid-off-staff-due-to-obamacare-now-has-staff-constraints/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nebraskamedical.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ebola broke out less than 2 years later", "title": "US Ebola Hospital Laid Off Staff Due To Obamacare, Now Has Staff Constraints Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/15/us-ebola-hospital-laid-off-staff-due-to-obamacare-now-has-staff-constraints/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nebraskamedical.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-15 22:50:10", "sailthru.title": "US Ebola Hospital Laid Off Staff Due To Obamacare, Now Has Staff Constraints", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "ebola,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The Nebraska hospital at the center of U.S. medical efforts to fight Ebola recently laid off staff due to budget cuts caused by Obamacare, and its Ebola-fighting resources are now limited due to staff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Nebraskamedical.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1350\"", "article_summary": "Pedestrians walk by the intersection to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, October 6, 2014.\nThe Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha recently treated journalist Ashoka Mukpo after the NBC News freelancer contracted Ebola.\nREUTERS/Sait Serkan Gurbuz (UNITED STATES - Tags: HEALTH SOCIETY) - RTR495K64347383The Nebraska hospital at the center of U.S. medical efforts to fight Ebola recently laid off staff due to budget cuts caused by Obamacare, and its Ebola-fighting resources are now limited due to staff constraints.\nThe Nebraska Medical Center announced 38 layoffs, including those of top officials, in October 2012 with more possible layoffs to come.\n\u201cThe lay-offs at Nebraska Medical Center."}
