The bill is expected to be signed by Gov. Paul LePage, who thrust the issue of reforming welfare into the spotlight during his campaigns for governor.\n\nThe bill was sponsored by Sen. Nate Libby (D-Lewiston).\n\n\u201cThis bill finally gives Mainers what they\u2019ve wanted: Meaningful welfare reform the focuses assistance on helping families get out of poverty while ensuring accountability at the cash register,\u201d said Libby. \u201cTaxpayer dollars shouldn\u2019t be used to buy these sorts of products, and Mainers have been surprised to know these kinds of purchases weren\u2019t prohibited before. I want to thank my colleagues for committing to work past our differences and, finally, reach a compromise.\u201d House Republicans said they've been fighting to address the alleged abuse for the past six years while Senate Democrats said Friday's passage was the result of more than 16 months of negotiations between both chambers and Governor Paul LePage.\n\nTo echo Libby's words, it's absolutely insane that money that's intended to help struggling families could be spent on frivolous luxuries like alcohol, porn, and vacations. Maine taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for someone's trip to Disney. Kudos to Maine's legislators for coming to a compromise and helping to put a stop to this practice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Welfare abuse is being restricted..05/27/2016 8:15:01AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Welfare abuse is being restricted.", "title": "Maine Just Took a BIG Step in Reforming Welfare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/04/16/maine-bans-the-use-of-ebt-cash-purchases-for-alcohol-lottery-tickets-and-cigarettes-n2149647", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/106/2016-04-14T161636Z_1_LYNXNPEC3D151_RTROPTP_3_AUSTRALIA-GLUTENFREE-BARLEY.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Welfare abuse is being restricted.", "title": "Maine Just Took a BIG Step in Reforming Welfare", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/04/16/maine-bans-the-use-of-ebt-cash-purchases-for-alcohol-lottery-tickets-and-cigarettes-n2149647", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/106/2016-04-14T161636Z_1_LYNXNPEC3D151_RTROPTP_3_AUSTRALIA-GLUTENFREE-BARLEY.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Maine Legislators Unanimously Pass Bill Banning the Use of EBT Cash Purchases For Alcohol, Lottery Tickets, and Cigarettes, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Maine legislature has unanimously passed a bill that would prohibit the use of EBT cash funds for alcohol, tobacco, firearms, pornography, vacations, and lottery tickets, among other things.\nKudos to Maine's legislators for coming to a compromise and helping to put a stop to this practice.\nMaine taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for someone's trip to Disney.\nPaul LePage, who thrust the issue of reforming welfare into the spotlight during his campaigns for governor.\n\u201cThis bill finally gives Mainers what they\u2019ve wanted: Meaningful welfare reform the focuses assistance on helping families get out of poverty while ensuring accountability at the cash register,\u201d said Libby."}
