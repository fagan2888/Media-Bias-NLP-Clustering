The report estimates $51 million in subsidies are distributed each month to Hoosiers, averaging $320 per resident.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not could, it\u2019s will,\u201d Ketzenberger said. \u201cIf it comes in against the exchanges, it will have a negative effect on the insurance industry in the country.\u201d\n\nExperts say that would impact every American paying for health insurance.\n\nThe fear is that millions of Americans would quickly drop their coverage and that premiums for everyone else would then by default skyrocket. The Kaiser Family Foundation analysis estimated the average premium in Indiana would jump 271 percent.\n\n\u201cObviously we have to have a mechanism to pay for the claims that come in,\u201d Susan Rider said, the national media chair for the National Association of Health Underwriters, as well as an account executive with Gregory & Appel Insurance in Indianapolis.\n\n\"Concerns will increase over the coming months that we may see a large exodus from the insurance market that leaves the government marketplace with primarily the adverse selection cases that could lead to further rising costs,\" Rider wrote in an analysis.\n\nCongress and states like Indiana have yet to lay out a plan if the court rules against the subsidies, leaving even more uncertainty as the decision looms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d feel a lot better about things if the state said OK, if this is illegal as we argue it is, then there is some kind of backstop,\u201d Ketzenberger said. \u201cBecause absent that, the ramifications are pretty hard on individual Hoosiers, their families and possibly the economy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "INDIANAPOLIS (June 22, 2015) \u2013 All eyes are on the United States\u00a0Supreme Court as a major decision looms that could impact hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers.
