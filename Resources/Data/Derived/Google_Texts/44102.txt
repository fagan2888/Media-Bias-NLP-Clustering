In case 60 touchdown passes weren’t enough, the Broncos have received further assurance there is nothing wrong with Peyton Manning’s neck as he passed his physical examination Monday morning.

There is a provision in the five-year, $96 million contract Manning signed with the Broncos in March 2012 that requires his surgically repaired neck to pass medical inspection each year before the team guarantees his salary.

Manning missed the 2011 season with the Indianapolis Colts as he underwent four neck surgeries. The problem finally was corrected with a fusion.

Now that Manning’s fused neck checked out fine Monday, the Broncos and his agent Tom Condon can begin going through the paperwork formality of guaranteeing his $20 million salary for 2014.

Manning has thrown exactly 100 touchdown passes in his two seasons with the Broncos, counting five playoff games. He set an NFL regular-season record this past season with 55 touchdown passes and added five more in three postseason games.
