Former House Majority Leader, Tom DeLay, joined “Breitbart News Sunday” radio program to discuss the media scrutiny over the Indiana religious freedom law.

“They totally bought into the homosexual agenda,” DeLay said when addressing the fact that Bill Clinton had signed the federal RFRA in 1993, but now the Democratic Party seems to have departed from that support.

The Indiana law has been criticized by Democrats and the mainstream media for discriminating against homosexuals. “Most business people aren’t going to discriminate against their customers,” said DeLay. He added that the bill only says that the government can’t call on people to violate their faith.

DeLay gave examples in Texas where he says individual religious liberties have been trumped by the left’s homosexual agenda.

He mentioned a city ordinance in San Antonio, Texas, that said if you did not believe in sexual orientation and homosexuality, you couldn’t run for office.

DeLay also discussed Houston’s lesbian Mayor going after pastors that did not support her restroom bill, which was dubbed an “equal rights” ordinance. The restroom bill would have allowed men and women to use restrooms for the opposite sex, as long as they identify themselves.

When asked if religious liberty will be a big issue in the upcoming 2016 presidential election, DeLay said, “I think it’s going to be a very big issue, mainly because the bigger issue is the Constitution.”

DeLay added that President Obama has pushed conservatives to stand up for the Constitution.
