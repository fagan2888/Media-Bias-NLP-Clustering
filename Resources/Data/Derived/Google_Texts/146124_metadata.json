But there is no reason to presume that bombing Syria is not as idiotic as it appears.\n\nThus far, the Establishment media is largely playing a lapdog role. A Washington Post headline today proclaims: \u201cObama the reluctant warrior, cautiously selling a new fight.\u201d So we\u2019re supposed to think the president is a victim of cruel necessity, or what?\n\nA New York Times headline today announces: \u201cIn Airstrikes, U.S. Targets Militant Cell Said to Plot an Attack Against the West.\u201d \u201cSaid to\u201d is the perfect term \u2013 perhaps sufficient to alert non-braindead readers that something may be missing (i.e., evidence).\n\nThe Tom Toles cartoon to the left explains Obama\u2019s policy far better than anything that has yet come out of the White House.\n\nAs usual, Congress has thus far utterly disgraced itself on this carnage. Even though the vast majority of members have (unjustifiably) safe seats, they left town for vacations and maybe a little vote hustling.\n\nWhen will Americans learn the actual rationales that drove Obama\u2019s decision to bomb Syria? Lord knows we have not yet learned many of the sordid details behind George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq in 2003. And the Obama folks are as good at coverups as the Bush team. Unfortunately, the largely toothless Freedom of Information Act poses no threat to expose the war cabal. Leaks from inside sources are the best bet for the truth outing. But even if that occurs, it may be far too late to curb the damage.\n\nMore at www.jimbovard.com On Twitter @jimbovard", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "When will Americans learn the actual rationales that drove Obama\u2019s decision to bomb Syria?\nA New York Times headline today announces: \u201cIn Airstrikes, U.S.\nThe Tom Toles cartoon to the left explains Obama\u2019s policy far better than anything that has yet come out of the White House.\nBut there is no reason to presume that bombing Syria is not as idiotic as it appears.\nA Washington Post headline today proclaims: \u201cObama the reluctant warrior, cautiously selling a new fight.\u201d So we\u2019re supposed to think the president is a victim of cruel necessity, or what?"}
