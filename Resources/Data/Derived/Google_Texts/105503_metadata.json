It\u2019s time to hold the government of Recip Tayyip Erdo\u011fan up to the light and see it as it is.\n\nThe blunt, ugly truth is that Turkey is part of the problem in Syria, not the solution. It\u2019s urgent now that the powers attempting to defeat ISIS face this and force Erdo\u011fan to clean up his duplicitous act.\n\nRelated: Obama Paid a High Price to Get Turkey to Fight ISIS\n\nFor the Obama administration, it\u2019s also a question of \u2019fessing up. What is the U.S. doing in an alliance with a government whose active support for ISIS is now embarrassingly plain? Why, after nearly 18 months of bombing sorties against ISIS, has progress proven negligible at best?\n\nSigmar Gabriel, vice-chancellor in Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government, said as news of the air-to-air attack echoed around the world last Tuesday, \u201cThis incident shows for the first time that we are dealing with an actor who is unpredictable according to statements from various parts of the region. This is not Russia. This is Turkey.\u201d\n\nNATO appears to know this already. When it convened at Ankara\u2019s request last week, it declined to do so under Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Instead, the session was downgraded to a consultation as required under the milder Article 4. NATO, you may have noticed, has since stayed well clear of the mess other than urging Moscow and Ankara to de-escalate.\n\nThe Russians know the score, too. After meeting with French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande last Wednesday, President Putin described Turkey\u2019s act as \u201ca stab in the back by the accomplices of terrorists.\u201d It doesn\u2019t get any plainer.\n\nRelated: Is Turkey More Interested in Fighting Kurds Than ISIS?\n\nRussian Premier Dmitry Medvedev later alleged the most craven of motives, citing \u201cthe direct financial interest of some Turkish officials relating to the supply of oil products refined by plants controlled by ISIS.\u201d Russian jets had begun bombing truck convoys headed for Turkey from ISIS-controlled refineries and storage tanks in the days prior to the attack.\n\nIn his not-much-covered press conference with Putin after their talks at the Kremlin last Thursday, Hollande joined the Russian leader in calling for the Syrian-Turkish border to be sealed. In my read, a prominent Western leader just put his name on the allegations Russia has advanced since its fighter jet went down in Syrian territory. All such assertions deserve to be investigated.\n\nOn Saturday, Putin approved of an array of sanctions against Turkey, and more appear to be on the way. This is right, and while the air attack is a bilateral matter, the Western powers should take the cue at this point.\n\nThat\u2019s not happening, however. A well-placed source in Europe wrote Sunday and quoted \u201ca very senior European diplomat\u201d as complaining, \u201cEurope and U.S. are courting Turkey while they should ostracize it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening. And it\u2019s wrong.\n\nRelated: How Russia Is Responding to Turkey\u2019s Downing of Fighter Jet\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s recent alliance with Turkey, made official in August, was a crackpot\u2019s move from the first. Erdo\u011fan instantly took it as license to extend his animosities toward Kurds into Syria and Iraq. As Turkish jets bomb Kurdish militias in both countries\u2014leaving ISIS forces more or less to themselves\u2014they attack the most effective troops now active against the ISIS.\n\nObama\u2019s policy people have had virtually nothing to say about this. Nor have they said anything as Erdo\u011fan, a Sunni Muslim, proceeds apace to erase Turkey\u2019s honorable secular tradition in favor of a politically opportunistic Islamization project.\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s our guy? Disgraceful.\n\nIn another round of his usual catch-up, Obama announced Saturday that he would press Turkey to close a 60-mile stretch of its frontier with Syria through which weapons and extremist fighters pass routinely. It\u2019s weak, per usual. One, Obama is two days behind Hollande and Putin on this point. Two, the entire border needs to be shut, whatever the troop count has to be.\n\nRelated: Russia Seeks Economic Revenge Against Turkey Over Jet\n\nIt\u2019s obvious what unites Washington and Ankara is a shared obsession with ousting the Assad government in Damascus. Consequently, the view of ISIS is ambiguous at best. Wrong again.\n\nTulsi Gabbard, an Iraq veteran and a rising star on the Democratic side of the House, joined forces with a Republican colleague 10 days ago to table legislation defunding Pentagon and CIA arms and training to anti-Assad Islamic militias. This should be taken seriously. Obama\u2019s imperative now is to explain his alliance with the objectionable Erdo\u011fan and clarify just what his intentions are in Syria.\n\nTime\u2019s up, Mr. President. You\u2019re fighting the danger of terrorism or you\u2019re fighting for strategic advantage in the Middle East. Which, please?\n\nThe Europeans could use some intellectual discipline, too. Sigmar Gabriel\u2019s remark and NATO\u2019s lukewarm response to Turkey\u2019s presentation in Brussels last week are evidence enough they\u2019ve had their fill of Turkey\u2019s machinations.\n\nRelated: Stemming Migration Crisis Is Main Goal of Turkey Summit\n\nBut the immigration crisis has fogged their minds. Desperate to stem the flow, the E.U. signed a deal on Sunday wherein Ankara is to get $3.2 billion, in return for turning down the faucet. (Erdo\u011fan demanded an extortionate $6.4 billion, sources tell me, and the agreement therefore includes a clause providing for upward adjustments in the aid.)\n\nTurkey deserves assistance, but loyalty isn\u2019t quite loyalty if it comes with a price tag. Emphatically, the E.U. is wrong to recommence talks on Turkey\u2019s accession to the union\u2014another enticement included in the pact.\n\nBottom line: The fox is among the chickens, and between the Paris attacks and the downed Su-24, it\u2019s time to get him out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Turkey\u2019s stunningly rash decision last week to", "title": "Obama\u2019s Job Now: Fight ISIS All-In as Turkey Plays Both Sides", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/30/Obama-s-Job-Now-Fight-ISIS-All-Turkey-Plays-Both-Sides", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-turkey_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/11/30/Obama-s-Job-Now-Fight-ISIS-All-Turkey-Plays-Both-Sides", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-turkey_1.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Turkey\u2019s stunningly rash decision last week to", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceefe\"", "article_summary": "Related: Obama Paid a High Price to Get Turkey to Fight ISISFor the Obama administration, it\u2019s also a question of \u2019fessing up.\nWhat is the U.S. doing in an alliance with a government whose active support for ISIS is now embarrassingly plain?\nIt\u2019s urgent now that the powers attempting to defeat ISIS face this and force Erdo\u011fan to clean up his duplicitous act.\nThe blunt, ugly truth is that Turkey is part of the problem in Syria, not the solution.\nOn Saturday, Putin approved of an array of sanctions against Turkey, and more appear to be on the way."}
