On “The Kelly File” Thursday evening, Megyn Kelly discussed the upcoming trials of the six police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray with Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, Fox News’ go-to interviewee for all racially inflected police brutality stories.

Kelly began by noting that Circuit Judge Barry Williams ruled on Thursday that lawyers for the six officers hadn’t established that they’d be unable to receive a fair trial in Baltimore City, “despite days of rioting, protesting, and a week-long curfew in the wake of Freddie Gray’s death.” She asked Clarke what he thought law enforcement would make of that and whether he believed these officers could receive a fair trial, and he replied with…words.

“They’re watching this closely,” he said, “because a powerful institution in the government, the prosecutor’s office, has been weaponized to go after political adversaries and go after judicial, I’m sorry, political activism.”

Kelly was perplexed by the sheriff’s canned answer, so she repeated her question more slowly. “Do you believe these cops can receive a fair trial in this city?” she asked, to which he replied in the negative.
