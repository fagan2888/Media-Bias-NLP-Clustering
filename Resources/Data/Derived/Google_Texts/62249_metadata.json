A veteran with a service connected disability, for example, would get 10 points.\n\n\"It's a good thing,\" Korb said, \"but I do think if I've got two people to choose from and one is a veteran and one is not a veteran, and if I hire the non-vet I'm affected by the Affordable Care Act, then I'm going to hire the veteran.\"\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the Hire More Heroes Act would cost the government more than $850 million in lost revenue over the next 10 years by reducing the number of employers who would have to pay the mandate.\n\nStill, Haislmaier expects the law, if it is passed as is, to have only a marginal impact on the Affordable Care Act because the number of people it would affect is so small, and it only relates to those small businesses with between 10 and 50 employees.\n\nBut by extending the benefit to businesses that hire eligible veterans getting VA care, he said, Congress could be opening the door to other, non-veterans on federal health programs, including federal service civilian retirees who retire and receive healthcare under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, or people who receive care under the Indian Health Service.\n\nThat is not in the bill, but what is there sets a precedent, he said.\n\n\"It's one more example of when you keep trying to fix something in the construct that was poor to begin with you may be creating more problems,\" Haislmaier said.\n\n-- Bryant Jordan can be reached at bryant.jordan@military.com", "article_metadata": {"dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Sean OMelveny", "keywords": "Veteran Jobs,Hiring Veterans,Legislation,Congress,Bryant Jordan", "dc.description": "The Hire More Heroes Act would boost veteran employment and give an edge to military retirees and disabled vets over other vets.", "dc.identifier": "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/08/hire-more-heroes-offers-veterans-boost-for-small-business-jobs.html", "dc.contributor": "Sean OMelveny", "viewport": "width=980", "dc.datesubmitted": "2015-01-08T13:48:37Z", "dc.date.created": "2015-01-08T13:48:37Z", "dc.subject": "Veteran Jobs,Hiring Veterans,Legislation,Congress,Bryant Jordan", "description": "The Hire More Heroes Act would boost veteran employment and give an edge to military retirees and disabled vets over other vets.", "dc.source": "Military.com", "msvalidate.01": "025B9B5D734615E165952EE006CF8C36", "article": {"tag": "Bryant Jordan"}, "dc.date.modified": "2015-01-08T13:48:37Z", "dc.language": "en", "dc.title": "'Hire More Heroes' Offers Veterans Boost for Small Business Jobs", "ma": {"source": "orig", "image": "http://images.military.com/media/veteran-jobs/job-search/job-interview-600x400-ts90.jpg", "contenttype": "maNews", "id": 1199454394047, "name": "Hire More Heroes Offers Veterans Boost for Small Business Jobs"}, "og": {"site_name": "Military.com", "description": "The Hire More Heroes Act would boost veteran employment and give an edge to military retirees and disabled vets over other vets.", "title": "'Hire More Heroes' Offers Veterans Boost for Small Business Jobs", "url": "http://www.military.com/daily-news/2015/01/08/hire-more-heroes-offers-veterans-boost-for-small-business-jobs.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://images.military.com/media/veteran-jobs/job-search/job-interview-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text", "p": {"domain_verify": "d63ea8dea5c5b3636abbfd1d1f15fd56"}, "dc.creator": "Sean OMelveny"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd0f6\"", "article_summary": "Under the Hire More Heroes Act, a small business not offering a health plan could hire someone covered by Tricare or receiving care from the Department of Veterans Affairs and not have to pay the employer mandate stipulated in the Affordable Care Act.\nLegislation to boost veteran employment and offer a financial break to small businesses will give military retirees, reservists and some disabled veterans an advantage in hiring \u2013against civilians and other fellow veterans.\n\"There is a symbolic dimension to it [helping veterans], which is why it passed overwhelmingly,\" he said.\nTypically, 5 points are added to a score of a veteran who served during wartime or during specified dates.\nA veteran with a service connected disability, for example, would get 10 points."}
