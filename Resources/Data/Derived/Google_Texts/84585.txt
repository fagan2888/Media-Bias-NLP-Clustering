LOS ANGELES — It was ugly, but the Nuggets will take it.

Denver outlasted the Los Angeles Lakers, 101-94, in overtime here Sunday night in game where both teams could not find a rhythm at the offensive end.

With the Nuggets desperate for anyone to make a basket, Danilo Gallinari drained a three-pointer with 1:28 left for a 94-90 lead that the Nuggets rode to victory.

“I like to take that shot,” Gallinari said.

Gallo started the possession by driving to the hoop. He was fouled and made the first free throw. He missed his second attempt but Timofey Mosgov got the rebound.

With the Nuggets leading 98-94 with 18.7 seconds left, the Lakers worked the ball to Kobe Bryant, who attempted an off-balance three-pointer from well beyond the arc. He missed, Mosgov rebounded and the Nuggets were home free.

Gallinari finished with 10 points and seven rebounds. Wilson Chandler, who shadowed Bryant for much of the game, led the Nuggets with 19 points, Ty Lawson contributed 18 points and 16 assists, Arron Afflalo scored 15 points and Mozgov had 13 points and 13 rebounds.

“We felt we could get anything we wanted against this team. Some of those threes that we got, I thought we could have just shown a little pump fake, driven it in and gotten something else. A lot of them were wide-open looks,” said Shaw.

Bryant finished with a game-high 27 points but missed several shots in the fourth quarter that could have given the Lakers a cushion. He was just 4 of 14 after the third quarter.

The Lakers, who were coming off a 140-106 drubbing at Dallas, began a four-game homestand with their seventh consecutive loss to the Nuggets. The losing streak against Denver matches the Lakers’ longest against any team since an eight-game drought against Portland from Feb. 18, 1993, through Jan. 9, 1995.

Los Angeles held an 86-83 lead with 1:43 left in regulation. Afflalo’s jumper in the lane narrowed the deficit to 86-85 with 1:22 remaining. Gallinari made a free throw with 16.3 seconds left to tie the score, but missed his second attempt.

Bryant, under heavy pressure from Chandler, missed a 20-footer from the left wing with less than a second left. After a timeout, Gallinari traveled while trying to inbound the ball with 0.5 remaining in regulation. The Lakers got off a desperation shot that missed at the buzzer.

“I thought Wilson did a great job on Kobe. We knew the ball was going to go to him but we didn’t want to double-team him so he could kick it out, get other guys involved and get threes. Wilson just really, really made him work for everything he got,” said Shaw.

The Nuggets used an 8-0 spree to move ahead, 38-31, with 3:31 before halftime. Afflalo’s 3-point shot ignited the spurt. But Los Angeles gave the Nuggets a case of Linsanity in the third quarter.

Jeremy Lin scored 11 points in the period to give the Lakers a 56-51 lead with 7:24 left in the quarter. Lin amassed five of his points during a 9-0 surge that gave the hosts their five-point advantage.

The Nuggets regained a 67-66 lead with 3:33 remaining in the third quarter. But Nate Robinson twice committed charging fouls that nullified his baskets in the final 1:10 of the period, and Los Angeles began the final quarter with a 75-72 lead after making nine of 10 free throws in the final 3:14.
