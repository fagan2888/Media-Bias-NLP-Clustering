They have until March 31 to purchase it through the federal government\u2019s insurance marketplace at HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody has any idea how many people have signed up here. That\u2019s patient choice,\u201d said Phillips, the hospital\u2019s interim chief operating officer for ambulatory care.\n\nThe sign-up campaign has been constant at many local hospitals, where uninsured patients seek care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified patients daily, who are uninsured, and talked to them about their options,\u201d said Leslie Pierce, who is overseeing the enrollment effort at Methodist Health System Dallas. About 300 patients went through the process since last fall, with the help of hospital employees.\n\nAn outside vendor was hired by Baylor Scott & White Health North Texas to handle enrollment in its various hospitals. The effort involves multiple phone calls to uninsured patients and even home visits, according to a statement from Baylor.\n\n\u201cPatients can walk in and receive assistance with purchasing a plan on the exchange,\u201d it said. \u201cAcross the system, approximately 30 uninsured inpatients are assisted every day.\u201d\n\nThe sign-up effort will shift into high gear in the next two weeks.\n\nStarting Monday, Parkland\u2019s business office will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends to assist the enrollment effort. Applicants can use hospital computers to file applications.\n\nBlue Cross-Blue Shield of Texas will hold a Countdown to Coverage event from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at Fair Park\u2019s Food and Fiber Pavilion. It will offer free bags of fresh produce, health screenings and the guidance of 25 enrollment counselors.\n\n\u201cWe understand that health insurance can be confusing,\u201d said Dr. Dan McCoy, the company\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to raise awareness of the deadline and show people how to sign up.\u201d\n\nHis company is marketing 18 of the 38 insurance plans available in North Texas under the new law.\n\nThe message driving these efforts is clear: If you earn even a dollar more than the 2014 federal poverty levels, you must have private health insurance coverage in Texas.\n\nThat means any uninsured individual who earned more than $11,670 in 2013 must buy a plan before the end of March or face a penalty. A family of four earning above $23,850 would have to buy coverage, too.\n\nPeople with the lowest incomes qualify for a federal subsidy to help cover their monthly premiums and other costs. The subsidy size depends on income and family size.\n\nAbout 87,500 Texans picked a health plan offered through the online insurance exchange in February, bringing the number who selected a plan statewide to 295,000 by March 1, Obama administration officials announced this week.\n\nBy the administration\u2019s reckoning, about 40 percent of the 758,500 Texans eligible to buy an exchange, or marketplace, plan have done so.\n\nOther groups, however, have estimated a larger number of Texans are potential marketplace customers. According to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s latest numbers, the state had the highest share of residents lacking health insurance \u2014 24.6 percent in 2012.\n\nWhile that translates to more than 6.4 million people who lacked coverage in 2012, comparisons to the administration\u2019s numbers are tricky. Undocumented immigrants, for example, are not eligible to buy coverage through state-based marketplaces.\n\nIn Dallas, the exclusion could have the largest impact on Parkland, where the patient population is predominately Hispanic. In recent years, about 70 percent of the babies born annually at Parkland had undocumented mothers.\n\nLast fall, the hospital estimated that 50,000 of its patients probably qualified to buy their own insurance. They are among the 140,000 enrolled in Parkland Health-plus, a program the covers uninsured county residents earning below 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nA more careful review cut the estimate in half, Phillips said.\n\n\u201cWe found that many, many more of our people on Parkland Health-plus are below the federal poverty level and will continue on the plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t qualify under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThat included \u201ca group of undocumented folks and others, who don\u2019t qualify,\u201d said Bob Reed, vice president for patient access.\n\nIf the federal law works as promised, charity care at Parkland should decline and the amount of local tax support would fall. Currently, county taxpayers contribute about $420 million annually or about a third of the hospital\u2019s operating costs.\n\n\u201cParkland and the community will spend less direct dollars on these individuals because they will have health insurance,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say how much.\u201d\n\nParkland and other safety-net hospitals in the state were adversely affected when Texas leaders declined to expand Medicaid, which would have picked up many of Parkland\u2019s poverty-level patients. Gov. Rick Perry said the state could not afford the program\u2019s matching funds.\n\nSo far, it\u2019s been difficult to discern how many Parkland patients are signing up.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a major surge of people moving away from charity care,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe won\u2019t know until they start coming back with their [insurance] cards.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Robert Garrett contributed to this report.\n\nSIGN-UP EVENTS AND HELP\n\nLocal opportunities to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act:\n\n3-4 p.m. Friday, Southwest Center Mall, Dallas.
