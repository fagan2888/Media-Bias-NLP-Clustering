Molly has been popping up more frequently not just at the clubs, but in pop culture, especially in songs, like Miley Cyrus\u2019s \u201cWe Can\u2019t Stop,\u201d which references the drug. Despite its innocent-sounding name, Molly can be fatal even in moderate doses taken in hot temperatures, according to a recent study to be published in the Journal of Neuroscience.\n\n\u201cWe know that high doses of MDMA can sharply increase body temperature to potentially lead to organ failure or even death,\u201d said Dr. Nora D. Volkow, director at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), in the news release. \u201cHowever, this current study opens the possibility that even moderate doses could be deadly in certain conditions.\u201d Researchers at the NIDA\u2019s Intramural Research Program (IRP) believe while previous studies on moderate doses of Molly have been inconsistent when it comes to adverse effects, it can still be harmful if taken in moderation.\n\nTo investigate the effects of Molly on the body and brain in moderate doses, the team of researchers conducted a study using rats in a lab and administered low to moderate doses of the drug. Previously, these doses have been shown not to be fatal. The rats were monitored to observe whether any drug-induced changes occurred in the brain and body temperature environment. The body\u2019s ability to cool itself through blood vessel dilation was also observed.\n\nIn high doses, Molly can interfere with the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature, according to the NIDA. In rare and unpredictable occasions, this can lead to a spike in body temperature \u2014 hyperthermia \u2014 and result in liver, kidney, or heart system failure, or even death. In the brain, Molly increases neurotransmitter activity in at least three neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.\n\nThe findings revealed when the rats were alone and in a room-temperature environment, a moderate dose of Molly increased brain and body temperature and diminished the rats\u2019 ability to eliminate excessive heat. However, when the researchers administered the same dose in rats that were either in a warmer environment or in the presence of another rat in the cage, brain temperature increased, leading to death in some rats. These fatal temperature increases were the result of the drug interfering with the body\u2019s ability to eliminate heat.\n\n\u201cThese results demonstrate that the use of MDMA in certain warm, social settings could be more dangerous than commonly believed,\u201d said Dr. Eugene Kiyatkin, first author on the study and NIDA IRP scientist, in the news release. \u201cEven with moderate doses, we saw drug-induced, fatal brain hyperthermia during conditions of social interaction and in warm environments.\u201d\n\nIt has been well recognized that the drug greatly increases body temperature. Therefore, it is essential to control body temperature to prevent severe reactions to Molly. The possibility of hyperthermia can be avoided by providing the body with enough fluid, although drinking excessive water could lower salt concentration of body fluids and cause tissues to swell up in the brain, according to ecstasy.org. This may lead to death.\n\nThis study further warrants medical research on increasing the effectiveness of whole-body cooling by targeting blood vessel constriction in the skin, possibly counteracting MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The effects of Molly are of particular concern since most users of the drug are between the ages of 18 to 25, closely followed by those ages 12 or older.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "popping molly, molly the drug, ecstasy, mdma, brain temperature, body temperature, hyperthermia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "MDMA, or \"Molly,\" in moderate doses can increase your brain and body temperature, causing hyperthermia in hot, crowded social settings.", "title": "Popping Molly This Summer May Actually Kill You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mdma-may-raise-brain-and-body-temperature-leading-death-hot-environments-286376", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/04/young-woman-looking-camera-while-dancing-nightclub-among-her-friends.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MDMA, or \"Molly,\" in moderate doses can increase your brain and body temperature, causing hyperthermia in hot, crowded social settings.", "title": "Popping Molly This Summer May Actually Kill You", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mdma-may-raise-brain-and-body-temperature-leading-death-hot-environments-286376", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/04/young-woman-looking-camera-while-dancing-nightclub-among-her-friends.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/04/young-woman-looking-camera-while-dancing-nightclub-among-her-friends.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-06-04T11:52:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-04T13:03:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "MDMA, or \"Molly,\" in moderate doses can increase your brain and body temperature, causing hyperthermia in hot, crowded social settings."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2af\"", "article_summary": "In rare and unpredictable occasions, this can lead to a spike in body temperature \u2014 hyperthermia \u2014 and result in liver, kidney, or heart system failure, or even death.\nThe rats were monitored to observe whether any drug-induced changes occurred in the brain and body temperature environment.\nIn the brain, Molly increases neurotransmitter activity in at least three neurotransmitters: serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine.\nTherefore, it is essential to control body temperature to prevent severe reactions to Molly.\nIn high doses, Molly can interfere with the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature, according to the NIDA."}
