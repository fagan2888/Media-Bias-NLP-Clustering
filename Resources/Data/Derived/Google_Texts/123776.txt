NASHVILLE — Tennessee lawmakers are back at the state capitol for the second session of the two-year 109th General Assembly.

With all 99 house seats and 16 of 33 senators up for re-election this fall, most lawmakers will be looking to wrap up their business quickly so they can concentrate on their campaigns.

Although Tuesday’s business was mostly routine, state representatives say they quickly will begin work on education and other topics.

“It was just kind of a routine day for the legislature, but we’ll be dealing with educational issues, as you can see, Insure Tennessee,” said Rep. Johnny Shaw of District 80.

Hundreds of Insure Tennessee supporters lined up outside the capitol to draw attention to legislators. Representatives say they’re not sure if the topic will be brought up again in this session.
