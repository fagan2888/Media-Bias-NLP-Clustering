CORALVILLE, Iowa (AP) — A woman shot and killed in an eastern Iowa shopping mall was a 20-year-old employee of a children’s museum inside the mall and knew the man who shot her, authorities said Saturday.

Coralville police said during a news conference that Andrea Farrington, of Cedar Rapids, was shot multiple times in her torso, and that a handgun and three 9mm casings were found at the scene. Witnesses have said she was shot in the back, and several people came to her aid to try to staunch her bleeding and perform CPR. Farrington died at an Iowa City hospital.

Officials have charged Alexander Matthew Kozak, 22, of North Liberty, with first-degree murder in the shooting that occurred Friday evening inside Coral Ridge Mall near its food court. No one else was injured.

Kozak was arrested a short time after the shooting. He is being held on $10 million bond.

Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness said police believe Farrington was targeted, saying Kozak told an investigator that he had left the mall, retrieved a gun from his home and returned to shoot Farrington. Authorities declined to discuss a motive, saying only that the two knew each other from working at the mall.

Officials confirmed that Kozak was a security guard at the mall. Authorities do not believe there were any other suspects.
