That makes it difficult to figure out whether donor dollars are well spent.\n\nThe Red Cross did give some information about Sandy spending to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who had been investigating the charity. But the Red Cross declined our request to disclose the details.\n\nSo we filed a public records request for the information the Red Cross provided to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nThat\u2019s where the law firm Gibson Dunn comes in.\n\nAn attorney from the firm\u2019s New York office appealed to the attorney general to block disclosure of some of the Sandy information, citing the state Freedom of Information Law\u2019s trade secret exemption.\n\nThe documents include \u201cinternal and proprietary methodology and procedures for fundraising, confidential information about its internal operations, and confidential financial information,\u201d wrote Gabrielle Levin of Gibson Dunn in a letter to the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nIf those details were disclosed, \u201cthe American Red Cross would suffer competitive harm because its competitors would be able to mimic the American Red Cross\u2019s business model for an increased competitive advantage,\u201d Levin wrote.\n\nThe letter doesn\u2019t specify who the Red Cross\u2019 \u201ccompetitors\u201d are.\n\nThe Red Cross is a public charity and occupies a unique place responding to disasters alongside the federal government.\n\nAmong the sections of the documents the Red Cross wanted redacted was \u201ca two-line title\u201d at the top of a page, one line of which was \u201cAmerican Red Cross.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office denied that redaction, writing that it \u201ccan not find disclosure of this two line title will cause the Red Cross any economic injury.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The charity is fighting a public records request for information on how it distributed money after the superstorm", "title": "Red Cross: How we spent Sandy money is a \u201ctrade secret\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The charity is fighting a public records request for information on how it distributed money after the superstorm", "title": "Red Cross: How we spent Sandy money is a \u201ctrade secret\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/28/red_cross_how_we_spent_sandy_money_is_a_trade_secret_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sandy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The charity is fighting a public records request for information on how it distributed money after the superstorm", "title": "Red Cross: How we spent Sandy money is a \u201ctrade secret\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/sandy.jpg", "creator": "@elliottjustin", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Justin Elliott", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey, ProPublica, Red Cross, Superstorm Sandy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3518\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Hurricane Sandy, New Jersey, ProPublica, Red Cross, Superstorm SandyThis originally appeared on ProPublicaJust how badly does the American Red Cross want to keep secret how it raised and spent over $300 million after Hurricane Sandy?\nIf those details were disclosed, \u201cthe American Red Cross would suffer competitive harm because its competitors would be able to mimic the American Red Cross\u2019s business model for an increased competitive advantage,\u201d Levin wrote.\nAs we\u2019ve reported, the Red Cross releases few details about how it spends money after big disasters.\nThe Red Cross is a public charity and occupies a unique place responding to disasters alongside the federal government.\nThe Red Cross did give some information about Sandy spending to New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who had been investigating the charity."}
