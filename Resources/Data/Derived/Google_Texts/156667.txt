Ken McIntyre, a veteran reporter and editor with more than 30 years in journalism, is taking on a new role as chief political correspondent for The Daily Signal.

As news director, McIntyre concentrated on building and developing The Daily Signal’s news team before and after its launch in June 2014. Now, as The Heritage Foundation’s multimedia news organization gears up for the 2016 presidential race, he will assume the newly created role to focus on the biggest political stories of the next two years.

In his new position, McIntyre will leverage his decades of experience covering international, national and local news to produce unique and original reporting about the candidates and policy issues that will shape the 2016 debate.

Josh Siegel, McIntyre’s first hire on The Daily Signal news team, assumes the duties of news editor. Siegel leads a team dedicated to investigative and feature reporting and coverage of the most important political news.

Before joining The Daily Signal, McIntyre spent seven years as special projects editor at The Heritage Foundation. He will continue as Heritage’s Marilyn and Fred Guardabassi fellow in media and public policy studies.

McIntyre worked for 17 years at The Washington Times, winning awards during his stints as assistant managing editor for special projects, metropolitan editor and features editor. Before joining The Times, he reported and edited for the Montgomery Journal and Gazette newspapers in Maryland and was editor and chief editorial writer of the Montgomery County Sentinel.
