That\u2019s because they would, if implemented, squeeze federal funding for civilian research over the long term. But they are also hoping any final plan\u2014if lawmakers can agree on one\u2014will retain some language they like, including provisions that promote a funding boost for biomedical research and call on officials to respond to the threat of climate change.\n\nThe budget plan\u2014technically known as a budget resolution\u2014is intended to be Congress\u2019s overall spending blueprint for the coming decade, starting with the 2016 fiscal year that begins 1 October. The two bodies are supposed to agree on a final version by 15 April. But the resolution is nonbinding, and there is no penalty for failing to meet the deadline. Indeed, Congress has essentially skipped writing a budget resolution in recent years, as partisan gridlock took hold.\n\nAfter Republicans took over leadership of both the House and Senate in the 2014 elections, however, they made returning to \u201cregular order\u201d a priority\u2014and that meant trying to produce a budget for the first time since 2010. Besides setting target spending levels for the relatively more powerful appropriations committees, the resolution serves as a parade banner that lawmakers can use to highlight their spending and policy priorities for the public and to draw contrasts with political opponents.\n\nThis year, both of those goals were on full display as Republicans and Democrats skirmished over the resolutions and offered amendments aimed at forcing lawmakers to take votes that might later show up in election campaign ads. In the end, the Republican majorities in the House and Senate succeeded in pushing through bills (H. Con. Res. 27 and S. Con. Res 11) designed to highlight their commitment to a strong national defense, curbing federal nondefense spending, and slashing deficits over the next decade.\n\nBoth bills, for example, technically adhere to strict caps on 2016 discretionary spending that were established by a 2011 law called the Budget Control Act (BCA). But they find ways to push up defense spending while limiting nondefense spending to roughly $493 billion in 2016. In addition, both bills call for future cuts to nondefense spending, in the years after 2017, to levels even lower than those envisioned by the BCA. \u201cIf enacted, these reductions would undoubtedly have ripple effects on science agency budgets,\u201d noted Matt Hourihan, director of the R&D Budget and Policy Program at AAAS (publisher of ScienceInsider), in an 18 March blog post.\n\nLuckily, Hourihan notes, such threats are often hollow. Budget resolution plans for \u201cfuture years don\u2019t matter all that much,\u201d he writes, because appropriators can ignore them\u2014in this case, putting off any real pain while claiming credit for being tough on spending. Such a strategy \u201clets the budget resolutions do their job as political documents, without requiring the difficult votes to actually enact them,\u201d Hourihan writes.\n\nA climate vote-a-rama\n\nSpending and defense hawks weren\u2019t the only one trying to use the budget resolutions to their political advantage\u2014advocates for science funding, action on climate change, and a host of other research-related issues made a push, too.\n\nIn the Senate, for instance, lawmakers offered more than 40 amendments during a marathon, 15-hour voting session on the budget resolution (dubbed a vote-a-rama by Washington insiders). Many of the votes held on 26 and 27 March featured hot-button issues such as gay marriage, Obamacare, and minimum-wage rates. One way to view these votes, Bloomberg Government\u2019s Brian Failer wrote in a 22 March preview to the vote-a-rama is \u201cas a dare\u2014one party forcing the other to go on record.\u201d\n\nIn that spirit, Senators reprised earlier battles over climate science. Several amendments from senators concerned about climate change failed. But lawmakers approved, 53 to 47, Senator Michael Bennet's (D\u2013CO) amendment asking the government to respond to the \"economic and national security threats posed by human-induced climate change.\"\n\nOpponents to government action on climate change also got in on the action. An amendment from Senator Roy Blunt (R\u2013MO) that would bar a carbon tax passed on a 58 to 42 vote, with all Republicans and four coal- and oil-state Democrats voting in favor.\n\nA push for NIH\n\nAlso making some noise were biomedical research advocates. Senator Jerry Moran (R\u2013KS) successfully offered an amendment that would allow Congress to steer more funding to disease research\u2014if the extra spending doesn\u2019t add to the deficit. These so-called deficit- or spending-neutral reserve funds have become a popular way for lawmakers to show support for a cause\u2014without immediately having to find new money. Overall, the House and Senate resolutions contain nearly 200 such funding statements, according to analysts.\n\nBut Moran\u2019s deficit-neutral provision includes a phrase that pleased advocates, calling for \u201cincreasing funding to account for inflation.\u201d In essence, that is code for restoring the billions of dollars in buying power that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has lost since 2003 as a result of the rising costs of biomedical research.\n\nNIH advocates were particularly were happy to see Moran\u2019s move draw heavily bipartisan support. \u201cWhatever else happens, to have these Senate leaders speaking up and supporting NIH means a great deal and we hope it will further strengthen arguments for restoring NIH funding as the FY16 budget and appropriations process continues,\u201d says Pat White of ACT for NIH, a Washington, D.C.\u2013based advocacy group.\n\nThe House version of the budget resolution also contains a long policy statement describing the importance of funding U.S. biomedical research, but it does not mention an increase in funding. NIH supporters see that as weaker and are hoping the Senate wording prevails in any final resolution.\n\nTough negotiations\n\nIt\u2019s not clear, however, that House and Senate Republicans will be able to agree on a final product. The two head negotiators\u2014Senator Mike Enzi (R\u2013WY) and Representative Tom Price (R\u2013GA), the leaders of the Senate and House budget panels respectively\u2014have said they want to meet the 15 April deadline.\n\nBut the two bills have key differences that could prove insurmountable, including how they pay for the extra defense spending, deal with efforts to overturn Obamacare, fund politically sensitive health programs, and deal with nondefense cuts. One option, many Congress watchers say, is for negotiators to simply strip the budget plan of all of its controversial details and for both bodies to pass a simplified version that mostly sets the overall spending target\u2014$1.12 trillion\u2014and a few other bottom-line numbers. That would tell the 12 spending bills that fund the government learn exactly how much money they have to play with, so they can start writing specific budget plans.\n\nThat is where the process has largely stalled in recent years, however, with or without a budget resolution. One reason: Appropriators often find they have too little money to satisfy all parties, so decline to produce a bill they know is doomed to failure. When that happens, lawmakers tend to end up combining most of the bills in massive spending measures rushed to passage late in the game\u2014often with spending levels that bear little relation to those included in any budget resolution.\n\nWith reporting by Jocelyn Kaiser and Puneet Kollipara.", "article_metadata": {"news_authors": "David Malakoff", "description": "Largely symbolic legislation still carries political weight", "og": {"site_name": "Science | AAAS", "description": "Largely symbolic legislation still carries political weight", "title": "Research advocates watch, warily, as Congress tries to finish its budget outline", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/research-advocates-watch-warily-congress-tries-finish-its-budget-outline", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-capdome.jpg?itok=FSQH7iDt", "type": "image/jpeg", "identifier": "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-capdome.jpg?itok=FSQH7iDt", "height": 720}, "updated_time": "2016-02-03T01:06:33-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Largely symbolic legislation still carries political weight", "title": "Research advocates watch, warily, as Congress tries to finish its budget outline", "url": "http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/research-advocates-watch-warily-congress-tries-finish-its-budget-outline", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/images/si-capdome.jpg?itok=FSQH7iDt", "height": 720}, "creator": {"identifier": "@NewsfromScience", "id": 17089636}, "site": {"identifier": "@newsfromscience", "id": 17089636}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, index, noodp", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "news_doi": "10.1126/science.aab2476", "MobileOptimized": "width", "news_section": "ScienceInsider", "keywords": "science", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ScienceNOW", "published_time": "2015-04-13T07:51:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-03T01:06:33-05:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 1400521805, "app_id": 1478542162442556}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no", "news_key_words": "Funding, Policy Budget 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb78f\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, Congress has essentially skipped writing a budget resolution in recent years, as partisan gridlock took hold.\nThat is where the process has largely stalled in recent years, however, with or without a budget resolution.\nThat would tell the 12 spending bills that fund the government learn exactly how much money they have to play with, so they can start writing specific budget plans.\nIn the Senate, for instance, lawmakers offered more than 40 amendments during a marathon, 15-hour voting session on the budget resolution (dubbed a vote-a-rama by Washington insiders).\nThe two head negotiators\u2014Senator Mike Enzi (R\u2013WY) and Representative Tom Price (R\u2013GA), the leaders of the Senate and House budget panels respectively\u2014have said they want to meet the 15 April deadline."}
