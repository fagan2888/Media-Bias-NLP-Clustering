They surrendered a long-held industry monopoly and put Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX on track to win its first military contract.\n\nRelated: From the F-35 to Sonar, Foreign Arms Makers Seek Pentagon Profits\n\nULA officials cited language in the fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that restricted the company from purchasing only four Russian-made RD-180 engines that power its Atlas V rocket. The restriction was imposed in reaction to Moscow\u2019s aggression toward Ukraine.\n\nCompany leaders also complained that President Obama, who vetoed an earlier draft of the NDAA because it ignored a then-existing spending cap, has yet to sign a reworked policy bill into law and therefore they couldn\u2019t offer a bid in time to meet last Monday\u2019s deadline.\n\nA ULA spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) and several other top lawmakers are convinced that proceeds from the engine sales \u2013 each unit costs $25 million \u2013 are being funneled to Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cand his cronies.\u201d They included text in the fiscal 2015 NDAA to ban its use after 2019.\n\nRelated: Can ISIS Save the Russian Economy for Putin?\n\nBut on Thursday, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), a senior member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, signaled that he plans to insert language into the enormous government-funding bill known as \u201comnibus\u201d that would somehow ease the RD-180 prohibitions.\n\nShelby is \u201cevaluating how the omnibus appropriations bill could ensure that, until an American-made rocket engine to replace the RD-180 is developed, the Air Force has access to the RD-180 to guarantee America\u2019s access to space, eliminate a possible national security risk, and secure approximately 800 jobs in Alabama,\u201d spokesperson Torrie Matous said in a statement.\n\nULA has a massive rocket factory in Shelby\u2019s home state of Alabama.\n\nIn July, Shelby sent the Air Force a letter asking how many RD-180 engines it needed to avoid any interruptions to the service\u2019s launch schedule. In a letter provided by the senator\u2019s office, a top Air Force official replied the service needed 18 more engines through 2022 for \u201cassured access to space and to enable competition.\u201d\n\nRelated: Has Putin Gained the Upper Hand in Syria?\n\nMatous said Shelby agrees the Russian-made engine should be phased out over time, noting he worked $143.6 million into the fiscal 2016 defense spending bill to develop a domestic alternative engine, in addition to the $220 million already included in fiscal 2015.\n\nCapitol Hill lawmakers have spent the last few weeks doing the nitty-gritty business of writing a must-pass omnibus spending bill to keep the government running past December 11, when the current short-term continuing resolution is set to expire.\n\nWhile a few hundred million dollars may not sound like much \u2013 or make much of a difference for Moscow\u2019s economy, which has been shellacked by international economic sanctions \u2013 an intra-party squabble over rocket engines would be another hurdle for Congress to overcome before the crucial funding deadline.\n\nRelated: Putin Revives a Cold War Dance as Russian Bombers Buzz US Carrier\n\nThe debate is already threatening to balloon into something more. McCain, a staunch advocate on defense issues who was put on a Russian sanctions list last year because of his repeated criticisms of Putin\u2019s regime, fired off a letter to Appropriations Committee chair Thad Cochran (R-MS) urging him to block any attempt by Shelby to fund the RD-180 effort.\n\n\u201cI know you share my concerns about our continued use of Russian rockets in connection with military space launch and I ask you to respect the well-informed work my committee took in crafting our legislation,\u201d he wrote in a November 19 missive.\n\nHe said ULA\u2019s attempts to \u201cmanufacture a crisis by prematurely diminishing its stockpile of engines purchased prior to the Russian invasion of Crimea should be viewed with skepticism and scrutinized heavily\u201d and aren\u2019t a compelling enough reason to undermine sanctions against Moscow.\n\nMcCain, who commands the loyalty of the upper chamber\u2019s defense hawks, added, \u201cAvoiding year-over-year re-litigation of this matter between our authorizing and appropriations committees is in our best interest\u201d because such a tit-for-tat would only delay eradicating Russian technology from the space- launch supply chain.\n\nThe Air Force isn\u2019t expected to award the contract for the GPS satellite until March.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Weeks before a critical deadline to fund the federal government, a fight is brewing on Capitol Hill over the kind of rocket engine the Defense Department can use to send its military satellites into space.", "title": "Why the Pentagon Might Fund Putin\u2019s Russia with Rocket Engine Buys", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/23/Why-Pentagon-Might-Fund-Putin-s-Russia-Rocket-Engine-Buys", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RD-180_Rocket_Engine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/23/Why-Pentagon-Might-Fund-Putin-s-Russia-Rocket-Engine-Buys", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RD-180_Rocket_Engine.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Weeks before a critical deadline to fund the federal government, a fight is brewing on Capitol Hill over the kind of rocket engine the Defense Department can use to send its military satellites into space.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "With just weeks before a critical deadline to fund the federal government looms, a fight is brewing on Capitol Hill over the kind of rocket engine the Defense Department can use to send its military satellites into space.\nIn July, Shelby sent the Air Force a letter asking how many RD-180 engines it needed to avoid any interruptions to the service\u2019s launch schedule.\nThey surrendered a long-held industry monopoly and put Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX on track to win its first military contract.\nRelated: From the F-35 to Sonar, Foreign Arms Makers Seek Pentagon ProfitsULA officials cited language in the fiscal 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that restricted the company from purchasing only four Russian-made RD-180 engines that power its Atlas V rocket.\nRelated: Putin Revives a Cold War Dance as Russian Bombers Buzz US CarrierThe debate is already threatening to balloon into something more."}
