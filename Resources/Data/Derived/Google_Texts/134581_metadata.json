(AP) - James Summers accounted for three touchdowns, two coming on the ground in a huge rushing performance, to help East Carolina beat Virginia Tech 35-28 on Saturday.\n\nThe backup quarterback ran for 169 yards in a bigger-than-expected role amid rainy conditions, going from the change-of-pace option behind Blake Kemp to the guy powering the Pirates (2-2) to their first home win against the Hokies (2-2) in 23 years.\n\nTrevon Brown and Isaiah Jones each had touchdown catches for East Carolina, which ditched its pass-heavy ways and kept the ball on the ground. Summers carried the ball on 21 of ECU's 43 run plays, more than double their pass attempts in an unusual look under Ruffin McNeill.\n\nBrenden Motley ran and threw for a score for the Hokies, who jumped to a 14-0 lead by capitalizing on two early turnovers only to squander that lead by the end of the opening quarter.\n\n\n\nPrevious Story:\n\nThe East Carolina Pirates host the Virginia Tech Hokies Saturday afternoon at Dowdy Ficklen Stadium.\n\nThe Pirates come into this game with a 1-2 record, while the Hokies are 2-1. The Pirates won the most recent game between the two last season in Blacksburg, VA.\n\nThe game begins at 3:30 p.m. and will be shown by ABC/ESPN2 or the WatchESPN streaming service.\n\nBookmark this article for live scores and post-game coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "James Summers accounted for three touchdowns, two coming on the ground in a huge rushing performance, to help East Carolina beat Virginia Tech 35-28 on Saturday.", "language": "english", "author": "WITN", "og": {"url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/329650231.html?ref=231", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/james+summers+v.+va+tech+september+2015.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "James Summers accounted for three touchdowns, two coming on the ground in a huge rushing performance, to help East Carolina beat Virginia Tech 35-28 on Saturday.", "title": "VIDEO: ECU tops Virginia Tech 35-28"}, "twitter": {"description": "James Summers accounted for three touchdowns, two coming on the ground in a huge rushing performance, to help East Carolina beat Virginia Tech 35-28 on Saturday.", "title": "VIDEO: ECU tops Virginia Tech 35-28", "url": "http://www.witn.com/home/headlines/329650231.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/james+summers+v.+va+tech+september+2015.jpg", "creator": "@WITN", "site": "@WITN", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "VIDEO: ECU tops Virginia Tech 35-28", "fb": {"app_id": 100653909772, "pages": 45809529741}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "SAIlGc4W5cz6VdYh4YTfTRgDO0fVlzEwt0FUQF1Qp3g", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "VIDEO ECU tops Virginia Tech"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7332\"", "article_summary": "Previous Story:The East Carolina Pirates host the Virginia Tech Hokies Saturday afternoon at Dowdy Ficklen Stadium.\nGREENVILLE, N.C.
