Photo: Getty Images\n\nJames Graham is not everyone's favourite player, but on the open market coaches would go to any length to sign him.\n\nHis passion is only matched by his honesty. By his own admission he is a bad liar. He tried to dance around the truth when it came to two issues this week: the Dogs' decision to roll over and cop a ban for his attempted charge down and the ban for his subsequent referee abuse.\n\nI sat down and interviewed him for 20 minutes this week and those were the things he was still coming to terms with in the lead-up to his comeback match on Friday night, where he had more bad luck, suffering a head knock that kept him off the park for the second half, and a knee injury.\n\nWhat annoys Canterbury insiders was the instant diagnosis that Adam Reynolds was to miss five months of football because of the Graham contact. He was back a week before Graham's suspension ended.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe instant Reynolds diagnosis put heat on the match review committee. Whether it was a ploy by Souths to pour fuel on the bonfire burning at ANZ Stadium that day is something only the Rabbits know. I put it to Graham and he clearly struggled to give an answer that wouldn't result in a backlash. \"I don't really want to get drawn in on that,\" he said. When pressed he simply said: \"I'm not a doctor, so it's hard for me to say. I can't read a scan. Whether I felt it was right or wrong, it's academic. We made a decision so I have to be happy.\"\n\nTo this observer, it was a clear tactic by Souths and it made Graham out to be a bigger villain.\n\nGraham was cranky with himself for the actual play. \"I'm really disappointed,\" he said. \"I read the play wrong. I don't know if I needed to put on as much pressure, 45 metres out on a wet day. As good as Adam Reynolds is, maybe a bit of pressure was all I needed to apply. I'm disappointed not to have read it better.\n\n\"The frustration I showed and lack of knowledge of the rules I showed is disappointing. I can't change what I am, but I know I can't behave like that. I've got to learn about my approach. I'm the voice of the club, the voice of the club on the pitch, the voice of the fans. I don't want to be in that position again. I never thought about quitting as captain. That was generated by the media.\"\n\nGraham admitted he had a heart-to-heart with those who matter at the club.\n\n\"The weekend after the game I sat down with Des [Hasler] and Raelene [Castle] and they said they were 100per cent behind me,\" Graham said. \"The last thing I wanted to do is jump ship. It's easy to be a leader in the good times, but if I was to quit at the first sign of trouble or the first real hurdle it wouldn't say much about me as a person.\"\n\nAs far as advice goes, Graham has been careful who he listens to. \"I've got to be careful whose opinions I buy because there were a lot of people trying to help me out,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it comes down to me and my actions and my decisions. At the end of the day, it's me who is out there. I don't have a Des or a Raelene out there with me. Des has been really great, really supportive and he always supported me through difficult times. He is very much a players' coach. He keeps his cards close to his chest and he keeps his players closer. He's been really good to me.\n\n\"Never once have I felt outcast from the group. He was very encouraging of me, especially the first week or so. No matter what support I get I've got to handle it better ... I won't say it will never happen again, but I need to learn from what I did.\"\n\nNo dramas\n\nThe most talked about tackle of the week belongs to Willie Mason. And the reaction of Big Willie to the grab is what has left everyone who has seen it stunned. He didn't flinch or even blink when Korbin Sims grabbed him. Mason opened up about it and, even a week after the incident, can't understand what the fuss is about.\n\n\"It's not the politically correct thing to say, but the reason I didn't flinch is because this has happened before,\" he said. \"It's not a one-off. I don't see what the fuss is about. I am confident in my sexuality. It didn't worry me in the slightest.\n\n\"Korbin is a good kid. I kind of took him under my wing when I was up there [in Newcastle] playing and we are close. He is 23, but he has the head of a 30-year-old. I like his company.\n\n\"As I was getting up to play the ball I could hear him coming up shouting at me saying 'Big Willie' and then he did what he did. Of course I felt it, but I didn't care one bit. I thought it was the funniest thing. We had a laugh about it straight after and I said a few things to him.\n\n\"It only became a drama when someone put a photo up. People are so worried about the silliest stuff these days. I think I showed how worried about it I was with the way I reacted.\"\n\nO'Neill hits back\n\nOur piece last week about the feud between Julian O'Neill and Jack Elsegood has spilled over and O'Neill and his family have gone on social media to attack the piece we wrote. O'Neill called Elsegood a dog because he forwarded a Facebook post to O'Neill's former wife. In it, O'Neill was critical of the decision by his son Ethan to opt for Queensland selection because he was following the \"father-son\" rule and wanted to follow his dad into the Maroons.\n\nSince then, Ethan, who is 15 and a Roosters player, has ditched Queensland and is in the Blues 26-man squad. That hasn't stopped O'Neill and some of his feral mates going on the attack. O'Neill didn't like my description of him as the \"original and best\" bad boy. \"Oh, please,\" he wrote. \"Im Simba compared to the best in todays game.\" His wife, Nicole, chimed in, saying I'd defamed her husband. \"trouble on the drink? Where and when have you seen him trouble on the drink. Ive been married tto him for 8years and not once has he been in trouble on the drink. He is a family man who is a loving father to all of his children.\"\n\nWithout listing all of his misdemeanours, I clearly remember the \"I've just shat in Scholssy's shoe\" incident at a Dubbo motel. O'Neill uttered those words to describe his act regarding what happened to Jeremy Schloss' shoe after a big night out. His behaviour was out of control. Then there was the time he set fire to a mascot called Danny the Dolphin. There are others. Stacks.\n\nHe described my piece as a \"bullshit story\", and said Elsegood's parents didn't take care of him. \"They never looked after me at all,\" he said. Elsegood confirmed his parents did take care of the young Julian. And Elsegood has been mentoring Ethan in the absence of O'Neill.\n\nIf O'Neill wants facts, we have plenty. His former wife, whose name is also Nicole, has raised her three boys largely on her own. She works two jobs. O'Neill has spent minimal time with his kids. We know how he funds the kids. We know about the emails he has sent to the Queensland coach that are unacceptable. And we know that Ethan is not encouraged by his dad to speak about football with him. The best thing Ethan has going for him outside of the support of his mum is that he is with a professional club, the Roosters, who are already taking care of him and are aware of his situation.\n\nBunny switch\n\nPlenty of sons of top-line players have featured in the all-conquering Sharks juniors. One who got away from the Bunnies is Darren Brown's son Jaiden. Brown was a top-liner with the Rabbits and Jaiden played a leading roll in the record-breaking Cronulla SG Ball team that defeated his former club, South Sydney. Jaiden was a Souths junior all his life, playing in their grand final Harold Matthews Cup team and their finals-making SG Ball team last year. Craig Coleman's boy Liam only moved to the Sharks this year. Jaiden broke his jaw in the first round against Parramatta, only to return in the final round of a do-or-die game, again against the Rabbitohs at Redfern. They won that game and sneaked into eighth spot. From there they went on to win the title, beating all the favourites.\n\nGlobal rookie\n\nDue to the high levels of interest in the program, the NRL has decided to extend the application period for NRL Rookie. Applications will now close at midnight on Sunday, May 24. To date, players have applied to take part in NRL Rookie from Bosnia, Canada, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Russia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, the Philippines, Turkey, Jamaica, Lebanon, Syria, Britain, United Arab Emirates and the US, as well as Australia. Go to nrlrookie.com to apply.\n\nAny DCE backflip a slap in the face for NRL\n\nThe Daly Cherry-Evans backflip will have to be a contortion by the time he performs it, given the shoddy way it has been handled. We know he gave the denial statement \u2013 without taking questions \u2013 but what has been largely ignored is the giant slap it would be to the NRL if he does stay at the Eagles. The NRL are the owners of the Titans and they need the club to succeed \u2014 and without DCE there, the chances of that are far less.\n\nAnd DCE is poised to be become an Australian captain in the not too distant future \u2013 at least that is the opinion of Cam Smith. How comfortable the NRL would be with that remains to be seen if he offers a polite thanks-but-no-thanks to the Titans. A rare sight in the change rooms after the Eagles' victory last week was Gavin Orr, one of Cherry-Evans' managers. Keen observers had not spotted an Orr (his brother Chris is his other agent) in the sheds all year. By signing Nate Myles and trying to keep DCE, the Eagles are putting themselves at the mercy of the Orrs, and if you ask the Titans, who carry plenty of Orr clients, it's a dangerous game to play. Straight after Myles signed with Manly there was contact between the Orrs and the Titans \u2013 not to seek assurance that the backflip wasn't on, rather to let them know that there would be intense speculation that Myles' move would start the DCE stories again. The Orrs are of the view that they are separate deals and one signing doesn't affect the other in the slightest. To say that the Orrs are being treated differently under the new management at the Titans is an understatement andit could be a rocky road for the Titans as more of the Orrs' clients come off contract \u2013 but they are prepared for the bumpiest of rides.\n\nAs for DCE, he made the decision because the Eagles low-balled him and then withdrew their original offer. He said it was for his family. He is a massive family man so it makes it hard for him to justify any kind of change of mind.\n\nDanny Weidler is a Channel Nine reporter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "League News, Canterbury Bulldogs", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "&#8203;James Graham is not everyone's favourite player, but on the open market coaches would go to any length to sign him.", "title": "Canterbury Bulldogs' hard man James Graham takes a long look in the mirror", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/canterbury-bulldogs-hard-man-james-graham-takes-a-long-look-in-the-mirror-20150516-gh38ma.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/h/0/4/1/y/image.related.socialLead.620x349.gh38ma.png/1441966320509.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/h/0/4/1/y/image.related.socialLead.620x349.gh38ma.png/1441966320509.jpg"}, "description": "\u200bJames Graham is not everyone's favourite player, but on the open market coaches would go to any length to sign him.", "site": "@smh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Canterbury Bulldogs' hard man James Graham takes a long look in the mirror"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "\u200bJames Graham is not everyone's favourite player, but on the open market coaches would go to any length to sign him."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21cb\"", "article_summary": "O'Neill didn't like my description of him as the \"original and best\" bad boy.\nTo this observer, it was a clear tactic by Souths and it made Graham out to be a bigger villain.\nHe is a massive family man so it makes it hard for him to justify any kind of change of mind.\nDes has been really great, really supportive and he always supported me through difficult times.\nWhat annoys Canterbury insiders was the instant diagnosis that Adam Reynolds was to miss five months of football because of the Graham contact."}
