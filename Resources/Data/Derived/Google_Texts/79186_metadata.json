Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) was scrutinized in a federal probe of a company allegedly tied to Dominican drug cartels, according to new FBI documents.\n\nInformants alleged to federal investigators in 1995 that Lautenberg accepted campaign money from Seacrest Trading Co., which had been investigated on suspicion of illegal activities and possible connections with Dominican mobsters. No charges were ever filed against the company.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe FBI also opened a \u201cpreliminary investigation\u201d into \u201callegations of possible corruption concerning a member of Senator Lautenberg\u2019s staff,\u201d according to a November 1995 memo. No one in his office was ever charged.\n\nThe 130 pages detailing the investigation, obtained by The Hill through a Freedom of Information Act request, are heavily redacted and omit many details from depositions conducted by the FBI. It is unclear how many different people were interviewed in the case.\n\nIn a summary of one of the interviews with federal investigators, an informant said Seacrest Trading was involved in money laundering, food stamp fraud and providing loans to New York bodega owners at \u201cusurious\u201d rates.\n\nFollowing those allegations, and a long redaction in the document, the informant said someone in Lautenberg\u2019s office contacted them, sometime in \u201clate July 1995,\u201d and the two met. All the details of that meeting and a subsequent second meeting were redacted in the documents.\n\n\u201cAfter the meeting with [redacted] Senator Lautenberg\u2019s campaign contributions through \u2018freedom of information\u2019 and discovered that STC [Seacrest Trading Co.] had made contributions to Lautenberg,\u201d the account says. \u201c[Redacted] does not know the number or amounts of these contributions.\u201d\n\nThat same informant met with a Lautenberg aide again in January 1996, and \"discussed his belief that various politicians had received money from the Dominican cartel,\" among other things, documents say. While the aide \"seemed to be very interested in this information,\" the informant \"did not provide her with actual names of politicians who he maintains accepted money from the cartel.\u201d\n\nThe FBI searched Federal Election Commission records in January 1996, seeking political donations from top officials at Seacrest to candidates. The search for donations to \u201cmet with negative results,\u201d documents say.\n\nJust more than two months later, investigators closed the investigation of Lautenberg and an aide for \u201ccorruption of federal officials \u2014 legislative branch; obstruction of justice.\u201d\n\nA Lautenberg aide during this time period told The Hill he knew nothing about the investigation.\n\nThe heavily redacted documents from Lautenberg\u2019s FBI file include interviews with investigators, memos, copies of pages from the Congressional Record, and newspaper articles and public records that questioned why federal agencies did not prosecute Seacrest in spite of a lengthy investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and other agencies.\n\nMedia reports from the time quoted Seacrest Trading\u2019s owner defending his business and dismissing the claims of criminal activity.\n\nPeople who spoke with the FBI, whose names are redacted, appear to have urged Lautenberg to push for a full congressional inquiry into Seacrest, but the senator apparently never took that step.\n\nSeacrest Trading Co. did receive some congressional attention, however, after a federal agent in New York, Joseph Occhipinti, was convicted of civil rights violations during \u201cProject Bodega\u201d in 1991, a crackdown on New York City bodegas that relied on intelligence that Dominican drug cartels were involved in the bodega-financing industry. (President George H. W. Bush pardoned Occhipinti in 1993, after he had served eight months of a 37-month sentence.)\n\nFormer Rep. James Traficant (D-Ohio) made several speeches on the House floor throughout the early-to-mid 90s and submitted documents and affidavits to the Congressional Record to \u201cbring to light all the facts in the case\u201d to back up Occhipinti\u2019s claims that he was set up by the cartel. He highlighted the alleged ties between the cartel and Seacrest Trading Co. in his statements.\n\nLautenberg\u2019s FBI file includes depositions from Occhipinti \u2014 who is not specifically named \u2014 though his deposition includes the organization he founded, the National Police Defense Foundation, and articles about him appear in the file.\n\nOcchipinti told The Hill in a telephone interview that he had an interview with the FBI about Seacrest Trading Co. and that he had pushed lawmakers for more action and oversight into the company.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The late Sen.
