But in California there\u2019s a little known provision that allows certain immigrants to obtain full-scope Medi-Cal benefits even if they aren\u2019t here legally.\n\nListen to the story here.\n\nUntil last December, if you were an undocumented resident in Fresno you could get health care through a county program known as MISP. That stopped when the county changed the rules and kicked at least 5,000 undocumented residents out of the program late last year.\n\n\"We've seen an increase number of people showing up in our clinic who are uninsured and now are on our sliding scale.\" Kevin Hamilton, CEO of Clinica Sierra Vista.\n\nThis left people searching for ways to get health insurance. Undocumented residents aren\u2019t eligible for health care under the Affordable Care Act, like the state\u2019s health insurance exchange and federally funded Medi-Cal.\n\nBut in California a little known legal provision in California law allows some undocumented residents to receive full scope Medi-Cal benefits including some who were left out of the county\u2019s old program.\n\nIt\u2019s called PRUCOL- which stands for permanently residing under color of law. It\u2019s a category that applies to immigrants who can prove that immigration officials know they are here and don\u2019t plan to deport them. It includes being granted a stay of deportation, deferred action, and asylum.\n\nIlse Gallardo with Centro La Familia in Fresno says more and more of her clients are taking advantage of this option.\n\n\u201cWe probably do a PRUCOL form five to ten a day depending on how many people come in.\u201d\n\nShe says many undocumented people don\u2019t know about PRUCOL or that it might make them eligible for state funded health insurance for low income residents. California and New York are the only states that offer this benefit.\n\nFresno County health officials say they\u2019re seeing a big increase of people enrolling for Medi-Cal under PRUCOL.\n\n\u201cMost recently with some of the changes in the MISP program it became more sought after in the Hispanic community,\u201d says Oralia Gomez, with the county\u2019s department of social services. \u201cSpecifically those individuals that have different type of criteria stay of deportations or just different aspects that they qualify to continue living here.\u201d\n\nGomez says the uptick is a direct result of the county\u2019s vote to change the old safety net program. Since the changes in December, the county has received roughly 1,800 PRUCOL forms. As of April, it granted full scope Medi-Cal to 1,200 of them. That\u2019s in comparison to the 5,000 people in the old program. But getting Medi-Cal benefits through Prucol is not new.\n\n\u201cThis has been in effect since 2009 it wasn\u2019t as widely known but with MISP going away it kind of left a category of individuals seeking,\u201d Gomez says. \u201cNot only that but remember the president approved the DACA program, even at that point the numbers started to increase as well.\u201d\n\n\"We've done more PRUCOL forms than we had done in the previous four years combined.\" -Kevin Hamilton.\n\nWhen the county excluded undocumented immigrants from the program in December, local health centers felt the impact right away.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an increase number of people showing up in our clinic who are uninsured and now are on our sliding scale,\u201d says Kevin Hamilton, the CEO of Clinica Sierra Vista. \u201cWe\u2019ve done more PRUCOL forms than we had done in the previous four years combined.\u201d\n\nClinica Sierra Vista partnered up with Community Regional Medical Center to help immigrants who were left behind.\n\n\u201cCommunity ended up with hundreds of patients who were on MISP and had chronic illnesses who were going to be dropped from coverage,\u201d Hamilton says. \"So our conjoined goal was to get as many of these people back in, rerun their Medi-Cal applications and making sure that we ran the PRUCOL statement.\u201d\n\nThere are 16 PRUCOL categories that people can fall under in order to get full scope Medi-Cal. The first fifteen require some type of proof and verification, like DACA status or proof of asylum.\n\nBut the last category, is a bit different. Hamilton says if a person can indicate that the Immigration and Naturalization Service knows they are here \u201cand has chosen not to deport you or take any other legal actions against you and then that\u2019s what you would say. You say yes and that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no paper requirement at that point.\u201d\n\nHamilton says this option is controversial because it may open the door for people to commit fraud who are desperate for health insurance.\n\n\u201cThe county did clarify that they did not want anybody to make statements that would be leading and in fact were not supposed to suggest to individuals who are trying to enroll what would qualify them to check that box.\u201d\n\nBack at Centro la Familia, Ilse Gallardo says they\u2019re still a lot of work to do to get more people into coverage.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of my friend or my comadre told me that she signed this form. I want to see if I\u2019m eligible. So I mean it\u2019s growing but there\u2019s still a lot of individuals that might be eligible for it.\u201d\n\nFor those who do not qualify, Fresno County recently approved a short-term program offering limited specialty care for unauthorized immigrants.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Most undocumented immigrants throughout the country aren\u2019t eligible for Medicaid or Medi-Cal because of their immigration status.
