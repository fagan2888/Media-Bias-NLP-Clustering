EMC had some enterprise products, but not the complete package.\"\n\nThe deal valued EMC at $33.15 a share as of the end of trading Friday. Dell will pay $24.05 per share in cash and will also give EMC shareholders a special stock that tracks the share price in VMWare Inc, the virtual software provider majority-owned by EMC.\n\nEMC shares rose 1 percent to $28.15 after earlier jumping more than 2.5 percent. VMware shares plunged nearly 10 percent to $70.96, decreasing the value of Dell's offer.\n\nRelated: Will Health Insurer Mega-Mergers Cost You More?\n\nVMware will remain an independent, publicly traded company.\n\nEMC's board has approved the merger and will recommend that shareholders do so as well.\n\n'GO SHOP'\n\nThe merger agreement includes a 60-day 'go-shop' provision that allows EMC to solicit bids from other parties and pay a discounted breakup fee to Dell if a deal is made with another company, as Reuters first reported on Sunday.\n\nWhile IBM, Cisco, Oracle Corp and Hewlett-Packard could potentially be suitors for EMC, the chances of them challenging Dell with a rival offer are slim, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\n\nRelated: How Amazon, Apple and Google are Stomping Out Competition in the U.S. Economy\n\n\"We view this as a good outcome for EMC shareholders after a nightmarish few years of slowing growth and an antiquated federated strategy,\" said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nActivist hedge fund Elliott Management, which has a 2.2 percent stake in EMC and had been calling for a break-up of the company, welcomed the deal with Dell and said it was the best outcome for EMC shareholders.\n\n\"Elliott is pleased to participate in VMware`s ongoing upside through the tracking stock, which will benefit from both meaningful synergies as part of Dell's organization as well as far greater liquidity than VMware shares have today,\" Jesse Cohn, senior portfolio manager at Elliott, said in a statement.\n\nThe deal will be financed through a combination of new equity from Dell's owners - founder and Chief Executive Michael Dell, its investment firm MSD Partners, private equity firm Silver Lake and Singapore state-owned investor Temasek Holdings - as well as the issuance of the tracking stock, new debt and cash on hand.\n\nRelated: 18 Companies Americans Hate Dealing With the Most\n\nThe debt package put together for the transaction exceeds $40 billion, while Dell's owners will invest more than $3 billion as new equity in the deal, said a person familiar with matter who asked not to be identified as the information was not public.\n\nMorgan Stanley, Evercore Partners Inc, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP advised EMC.\n\nJP Morgan Chase & Co advised Dell and Silver Lake and provided financing alongside Credit Suisse Group AG, Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and RBC Capital Markets\n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP offered legal advice to Dell and Silver Lake.
