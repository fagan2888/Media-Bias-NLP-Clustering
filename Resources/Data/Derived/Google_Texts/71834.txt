If enrollees in PPACA plans don’t change their plans during next year’s enrollment season and find cheaper coverage, then federal health officials might do it for them.

That’s one big takeaway from a 324-page regulation released by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services late Friday regarding how the exchanges will work in 2016. Other big changes proposed include a shorter open enrollment season and more transparency among carriers, as well as a slew of reminders and clarifications for carriers.
