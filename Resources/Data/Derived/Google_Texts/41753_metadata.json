My husband is working a lot more hours just to pay for these new increases\u2026.Obamacare is a vote that\u2019s destroying the middle class.\u201d\n\n\u2013Michigan resident Shannon Wendt, in a new Americans for Prosperity ad attacking Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.)\n\nThis column had been updated with a Pinocchio rating\n\nThe Fact Checker can barely keep up with the torrent of ads attacking the Affordable Care Act from the limited-government group Americans for Prosperity. Just as we fact check one, and another, and another, and another, yet one more pops up.\n\nThis new ad is part of a reported $5-million buy in the competitive race for the open Senate seat in Michigan. As the Fact Checker has raised questions\u2013and awarded Pinocchios\u2013about some of the claims made in these ads, we find that the more recent ads have increasingly fewer details that are easy to check.\n\nThe Facts\n\nWendt, a mother of five, is a resident of Grand Rapids who sells jewelry on Esty. She first appeared in news reports around the New Year complaining about how difficult it was to get a plan on healthcare.gov, after her old Blue Cross Blue Shield plan was deemed not in compliance with the new law. She told interviewers that she spent hours trying to get answers and that at one point her children were declared ineligible for health insurance, in what she said a supervisor called \u201cone of the worst cases of a glitch\u201d he\u2019d ever seen.\n\nPreviously, the family had opted for a plan that had low premiums but high out-of-pocket maximums, on the theory that the family would pay for minor scrapes and fevers out of pocket but be protected if a major accident happened. She said that the savings from the premiums was put in a fund to pay for everyday expenses.\n\n\u201cFor us, that has made financial sense,\u201d Wendt told Fox and Friends. \u201cWe\u2019ve technically, according to Obama, been underinsured, but we\u2019ve been that way on purpose. To us, it doesn\u2019t feel underinsured. We feel it makes financial sense for us to have a higher deductible plan and just pay these little things out of pocket.\u201d\n\nAs for costs under the new plan, her story was slightly different depending on the interview. She told Fox News that her old plan cost $260 a month with a $5,000 deductible, but the new plan will be $400 with a \u201chigh deductible. But she also told MLive.com that the premiums \u201cwill be close to what they paid last year for health insurance.\u201d (The old plan, she told MLive.com, had $10,000 in out-of-pocket costs.)\n\nSo how did the plan now become so unaffordable that her husband Zach has to work extra hours? What is the new out-of-pocket maximum? We tried to reach Wendt, but her husband said she was unavailable.\n\nLevi Russell, an AFP spokesman, said \u201cthe biggest change since those comments in January was that Shannon and her husband did more research, and realized that the available plans with costs comparable to their older plan that was canceled did not meet the healthcare needs of their family. The plan that does meet their needs is much more expensive. This is primarily due to the narrower provider networks on plans available on the exchange.\u201d\n\nRussell did not respond to a request for more details on the actual costs. We will update this column if we learn more from Wendt herself.\n\n[Update, March 27: The Fact Checker reviewed a series of Facebook posts that Wendt wrote about her experience earlier in March, including some of the financial choices involved. A key issue is that the family qualified for Medicaid, but she was opposed for philosophical issues; she did not think a family making as much money as hers should qualify for Medicaid. She also thought the level of care was poor. So the family opted for a more expensive plan.\n\n\u201cWhile researching plans available on the exchange, Shannon and her husband realized it would mean enrolling their children in Michigan\u2019s CHIP plan, MIChild,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey had MICHild for a short time years ago, and had a very bad experience with it. In addition, after more research, they determined that going that route would mean losing access to their doctor, which was not an option for them.\u201d]\n\n[Update, April 1: Wendt published an opinion article in which she provided additional details about her options and confirmed that she choose not to select a plan on healthcare.gov that could have saved her thousands of dollars a year. Our colleagues at FactCheck.org ran the numbers and found several options that \u201cwould provide better benefits at less cost than the plan\" Wendt currently has.]\n\nWendt, incidentally, is a Republican precinct delegate for Michigan\u2019s 2nd congressional district. In June, she signed a toughly worded petition warning GOP lawmakers in the Michigan House of Representatives not to accept expansion of Medicaid or the creation of a health care exchange permitted under the Affordable Care Act\u2014or face a suspension of \u201call monetary and logistical support.\u201d The petition sought to bind the Republicans to the themes of the party\u2019s 2012 platform that declared the law was an \u201cattack on our Constitution\u201d and an \u201cattempt to impose upon Americans a euro-style bureaucracy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wendts\u2019 political leanings do nothing to diminish their experience under Obamacare and I hope those beliefs will not be held against them,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThe facts remain the same: they had a plan they liked, they were told they could keep it by President Obama, Rep. Peters and others and that plan was canceled. Now they are stuck with a plan they don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe Fact Checker leaves it to readers to decide if Wendt\u2019s active participation in GOP politics undermines her credibility as an Obamacare victim. But at this point, we do not have enough information to determine whether and how her insurance costs have become unaffordable, as claimed in the ad. So, for now, we have to leave this as verdict pending.\n\nUpdate, March 27: In light of the fact that the family had an option to choose a less expensive plan, we are changing the rating to Two Pinocchios. Clearly the family may not have been happy with the children going on Medicaid, and it is their right to choose a more expensive plan. But it makes her claim of \u201cunaffordable\u201d harder to swallow.\n\nTwo Pinocchios\n\n\n\n\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "The new ad from Americans for Prosperity makes sweeping charges with little back-up or detail", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The new ad from Americans for Prosperity makes sweeping charges with little back-up or detail", "title": "Big claims, few details in anti-Obamacare ad alleging soaring costs", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/26/big-claims-few-details-in-anti-obamacare-ad-alleging-soaring-costs/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CB551_AFP_E_20140324223356.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/03/26/big-claims-few-details-in-anti-obamacare-ad-alleging-soaring-costs/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, affordable care act, koch brothers, americans prosperity, health care law, shannon wendt, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare, repeal obamacare, affordable care act, koch brothers, americans prosperity, health care law, shannon wendt, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb223\"", "article_summary": "As the Fact Checker has raised questions\u2013and awarded Pinocchios\u2013about some of the claims made in these ads, we find that the more recent ads have increasingly fewer details that are easy to check.\n\u201cFor us, that has made financial sense,\u201d Wendt told Fox and Friends.\nOur colleagues at FactCheck.org ran the numbers and found several options that \u201cwould provide better benefits at less cost than the plan\" Wendt currently has.]\nTwo Pinocchios(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook\nClearly the family may not have been happy with the children going on Medicaid, and it is their right to choose a more expensive plan."}
