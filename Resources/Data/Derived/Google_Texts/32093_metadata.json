Actually, yes, said Gupta, a practicing neurosurgeon.\n\nGupta, who turns 44 on Oct. 23, is instantly recognizable as CNN\u2019s globe-trotting chief medical correspondent. He regularly reports from far-flung hot spots, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. \u201cSanjay\u2019s all in!\u201d says Cooper, who\u2019s been with Gupta covering the aftermaths of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, the earthquake in Haiti, tsunamis in southeast Asia and Japan, and more. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly committed to seeing things for himself and informing people.\u201d\n\nWhat most viewers don\u2019t know is that when he\u2019s home in Atlanta, Gupta operates on patients\u2019 brains and spines at least one day a week at Grady Memorial Hospital, where he is associate chief of neurosurgery. \u201cYou can have immediate healing through operations, and it\u2019s gratifying,\u201d he says. On a recent Monday, having returned only days before from the Middle East, he did four surgeries between 6:30 a.m. and 11:30 p.m. \u201cThere were breaks,\u201d says Gupta, whose OR playlists include hip-hop and the Red Hot Chili Peppers for opening and closing spinal surgeries, when something \u201ca little raucous\u201d is called for, and music that\u2019s \u201cmore chill,\u201d like Coldplay, during operations.\n\nSanjay Gupta says that in trips to trouble spots like \u00adAfghanistan he\u2019s learned to \u201cduct-tape my passport and cash to my body at night and never sit with my back to the street.\u201d (Danielle Dellorto/CNN/Time Warner)\n\nThe whip-smart and friendly Dr. Gupta you see on TV is the same man you meet in person. He credits his wife, family law attorney Rebecca Olson Gupta, with helping him adapt to being on camera. \u201cEarly on, she told me, \u2018You should just pretend you\u2019re talking to your patients,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI was comfortable in that role, and it set the right level of language and empathy.\u201d\n\nGupta only speaks his mind on an issue once he has thoroughly researched and weighed it. In August, he made headlines by endorsing medical marijuana after previously taking a stand against it. \u201cNot only can it work, but it can work when nothing else does,\u201d he says. A White House fellow during the Clinton administration and a candidate in 2009 to become surgeon general (Gupta withdrew his name largely because he learned that the job would, ironically, mean giving up surgery), he applauds the Affordable Care Act, calling it \u201can important step.\u201d But he cautions that offering most Americans access to insurance is not a cure-all. \u201cIf you don\u2019t make America healthier, you\u2019re not going to control costs,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd ultimately that\u2019s what we have to do.\u201d\n\nHe has always been an overachiever, enrolling at age 16 in an accelerated joint college and medical school program at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he was president of the Indian American Student Association and sang baritone in the glee club. Today, in addition to his work at Grady and CNN (the latter includes a weekly show, Sanjay Gupta, MD), he\u2019s an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University; contributes pieces to CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes; does videos and blog posts for EverydayHealth.com; and has published three books, including a novel, Monday Mornings, that briefly became a TV series last winter. \u201cHe has a deep-seated need to be busy,\u201d says his mother, Damyanti Gupta.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more: Gupta competes in triathlons (he mastered swimming via YouTube videos), writes poetry (he proposed to Rebecca with a poem), is scribbling away at a new novel (he has written 400 pages but says \u201cthe majority will never get used\u201d), and is an involved parent to three daughters, ages 8, 6, and 4 (\u201cHe sings a song to the girls every night and will actually practice the song so he does a good job,\u201d says his wife). How does he do it all? \u201cI get by on five or six hours of sleep,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cAnd I get up early, by five.\u201d\n\nA first-generation Indian-American, Gupta grew up with a younger brother in Novi, Mich., where his immigrant parents were engineers at Ford Motor Company. (A loyalist, Gupta drives a Ford Lincoln Navigator and a Jaguar bought when the British carmaker was owned by Ford.) He encountered prejudice and bullying in his small community. \u201cIt was tough being a kid who looked different and had a different-sounding name,\u201d he says. Wanting to fit in, young Sanjay proposed changing his name to Steve (inspired by Steve Austin of TV\u2019s The Six Million Dollar Man). His mother talked him out of it. \u201cI told him to be proud of his name, that one day everyone would know it because of the wonderful things he was going to do,\u201d she recalls.\n\nMom was right. Nowadays, people hail Gupta by name in airports and on the street, eager to discuss a story he\u2019s done or tell him their medical woes. He listens with real interest, often despite nudges from colleagues in a hurry. \u201cI enjoy those conversations,\u201d says Gupta. \u201cIt\u2019s why I do this.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nHow to Build a Good Relationship with Your Doctor: Sanjay Gupta\u2019s Top Tips\n\nThe Sneezin\u2019 Season: How to Avoid Getting Sick This Winter\n\n12 Ways to Keep You and Your Family Healthy\n\n6 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Dr. Sanjay Gupta", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "doctor, health, Parade cover story, Sanjay Gupta, Video", "author": "Leah Rozen", "og": {"site_name": "Community Table", "description": "A surgeon, a triathlete, and a proud family man, as well as one of TV\u2019s most respected medical correspondents, Sanjay Gupta says he juggles so many jobs because \u201cthere are really important stories to tell.\u201dGo behind the scenes of Dr. Gupta\u2019s\u00a0photo shoot\u00a0in the video below, and get even more of the good doctor\u2019s stay-healthy tips\u00a0here.[onescreen [...]", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta Will See You Now", "url": "http://communitytable.parade.com/200078/leahrozen/dr-sanjay-gupta-will-see-you-now/", "image": "http://static.communitytable.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sanjay-gupta-inside-ftr.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A surgeon, a triathlete, and a proud family man, as well as one of TV\u2019s most respected medical correspondents, Sanjay Gupta says he juggles so many jobs because \u201cthere are really important stories to tell.\u201dGo behind the scenes of Dr. Gupta\u2019s\u00a0photo shoot\u00a0in the video below, and get even more of the good doctor\u2019s stay-healthy tips\u00a0here.[onescreen [...]", "creator": "@ParadeMagazine", "image": "http://communitytable.parade.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sanjay-gupta-inside-ftr-1024x640.jpg", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta Will See You Now", "site": "@acommunitytable", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#d82027", "p": {"domain_verify": "c3df3a277b0aa56b93896ae7c6c033fc"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1465014807105538}, "orginal-source": "http://communitytable.parade.com/200078/leahrozen/dr-sanjay-gupta-will-see-you-now/", "msapplication-TileImage": "/wp-content/themes/wp-theme/img/ico/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#d82027", "google-site-verification": "cZtKSm3I5mibnoc3d2oqG--Vcv8UgT44zkEdqLwdf7A", "keywords": "doctor, health, Parade cover story, Sanjay Gupta, Video", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-12T05:00:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-02T16:58:17-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A surgeon, a triathlete, and a proud family man, as well as one of TV\u2019s most respected medical correspondents, Sanjay Gupta says he juggles so many jobs because \u201cthere are really important stories to tell.\u201dGo behind the scenes of Dr. Gupta\u2019s\u00a0photo shoot\u00a0in the video below, and get even more of the good doctor\u2019s stay-healthy tips\u00a0here.[onescreen [...]"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbafd\"", "article_summary": "[onescreen item=\u201d5146690\u2033 playerFill=\u201dwidth\u201d]Anchorman Anderson Cooper recalls with embarrassment the first time he met his CNN colleague Dr. Sanjay Gupta, in 2001.\n\u201cIt\u2019s why I do this.\u201dRelatedHow to Build a Good Relationship with Your Doctor: Sanjay Gupta\u2019s Top TipsThe Sneezin\u2019 Season: How to Avoid Getting Sick This Winter12 Ways to Keep You and Your Family Healthy6 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Dr. Sanjay Gupta\nSanjay Gupta says that in trips to trouble spots like \u00adAfghanistan he\u2019s learned to \u201cduct-tape my passport and cash to my body at night and never sit with my back to the street.\u201d (Danielle Dellorto/CNN/Time Warner)The whip-smart and friendly Dr. Gupta you see on TV is the same man you meet in person.\nGupta, who turns 44 on Oct. 23, is instantly recognizable as CNN\u2019s globe-trotting chief medical correspondent.\n(A loyalist, Gupta drives a Ford Lincoln Navigator and a Jaguar bought when the British carmaker was owned by Ford.)"}
