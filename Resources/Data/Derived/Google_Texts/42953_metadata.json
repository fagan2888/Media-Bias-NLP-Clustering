Another unknown is pension payment responsibility, as legislation to curb pension costs was recently shot down in the courts.\n\nWilson said the state finance department is suggesting an 89 percent proration of fund projections, but she has heard rumors from various sources that said they could go as low as 70 percent.\n\n\u201cThat would be catastrophic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really no one knows.\u201d\n\nThe current budget projection has the number at 89 percent, which would mean a loss of $189,000 in fiscal year 2016.\n\nIn regard to the $1.1 million five-year shortfall, Wilson said that it\u2019s the students that are affected.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money. That\u2019s a lot of teaching, that\u2019s a lot of programs for our kids,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2008, the district received $1,914,197 in general state aid, and that number decreased to $739,677 in 2014. The enrollment did drop by about 60 in that time but is trending upward in the past year.\n\nLocal EAV land value growth is anticipated at 2 percent in the current projection, Wilson said.\n\nFund balances in all of the district\u2019s funds are expected to decrease drastically by 2018, and Wilson said if the trend continues, the district could move from \u201crecognition\u201d financial status to \u201creview\u201d for FY15 and forward.\n\nA working class balance sits at about $673,000, and is expected to grow to about $881,400 by 2018. The money is untouched right now and can be transferred into education, operations and maintenance, and transportation funds if necessary down the road.\n\nWilson said they will ideally not be spent until the district is in dire straits, as they protect the district from other state funding unknowns.\n\n\u201cEven though that seems like a big number, when you take a $10 million budget you\u2019re not even talking 10 percent,\u201d Board President Justin Otto said.\n\nWilson said in many months expenditures reach $800,000.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really looking at is a savings account balance of a little over a month of expenditures,\u201d she said.\n\nPeculiarly, transportation fund revenues are expected to spike on the year, and Wilson said she would investigate that increase further. She noted average daily attendance and other factors could mean the increase.\n\nOther Business\n\n-First Mid State Bank in Mansfield donated $500 to the district and the money was used to buy an IPad for kindergarten classrooms. IPads would be necessary for an upcoming state assessment offered only on the IPad platform. Blue Ridge PIE then donated another two IPads, making one for each educator at the Kindergarten level.\n\n-Wilson said an estimate for power washing of the outer walls at Schneider\n\nElementary and Mansfield BRIJHS would be $2,274 and $3,907 respectively.\n\nShe said the money would be put in the budget tentatively and taken out if\n\nnecessary.\n\n-The board hired the following for the 2015-2016 school year: Kimberly Mangano as a special education teacher at Schneider Elementary School; Amber Lytel as a special education teacher at BRHS; Karisa Yeagle as a fifth and sixth grade literary coach at BRIJHS.\n\n-Pam Houser and Harmony Bray were hired as 2015 summer school teachers.\n\n-Lindi Balazi, Tonya Evans, Cory Jayne, Justin Marshall, Mary Russell and Chris Winstead were hired as 2015 summer maintenance help.\n\n-The board approved Don Anton, Kirsten Blackford, Lois Dowling, Gena Lagle, Justin Marshall, Aimee Thacker, Leslie Whitehouse and Sara Wieber as 2015 summer Bridge teachers.\n\n-The board approved the position of bus aide.\n\n-BRIJHS Principal Rob Wilkinson said the honor roll percentage has gone up every quarter to a total of 38 this quarter, noting an honor roll field trip has been a great motivator.\n\n-High school students Gabby LeBaube, Taylor Builta and Katrina Medernach recently received state FFA degrees.\n\n-Next year\u2019s football homecoming game at Farmer City will take place Sept. 18.\n\n-The board accepted the resignation of Ethan Hanson as assistant boys basketball coach at BRIJHS, later naming him head coach.\n\n-The board reviewed for approval the letting of bids for milk for the district, an annual procedure.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Champaign,Urbana,Danville,Paxton,Rantoul,Mahomet,Monticello,Tuscola,East Central Illinois,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,News", "description": "FARMER CITY \u2013 The Blue Ridge school district has lost $1.1 million in general state aid funding from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014, and more losses are expected.&nbsp;\u201cIn the best of years budget projections are a wild guess,\u201d Superintendent Susan Wilson said. \u201cThis year it is fairly close to fiction.\u201d&nbsp;", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2015 The News-Gazette, Inc."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccae9\"", "article_summary": "FARMER CITY \u2013 The Blue Ridge school district has lost $1.1 million in general state aid funding from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2014, and more losses are expected.\n-Pam Houser and Harmony Bray were hired as 2015 summer school teachers.\nIn 2008, the district received $1,914,197 in general state aid, and that number decreased to $739,677 in 2014.\nBlue Ridge PIE then donated another two IPads, making one for each educator at the Kindergarten level.\nOther Business-First Mid State Bank in Mansfield donated $500 to the district and the money was used to buy an IPad for kindergarten classrooms."}
