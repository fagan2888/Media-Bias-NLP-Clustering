The report, released by the advocacy group Mental Health America, was paid for by Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. and Lundbeck U.S.A., a pharmaceutical company that specializes in neurology and psychiatric treatments.\n\nThe report listed the states with the lowest prevalence of mental illness and the highest rates of access to care as Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, North Dakota and Delaware. Those with the highest prevalence of mental illness and most limited access are Arizona, Mississippi, Nevada, Washington and Louisiana.\n\nAmong its other findings:\n\n\u25cf 42.5 million adults in America, 18.19 percent, suffer from a mental health issue.\n\n\u25cf 19.7 million, or 8.46 percent, have a substance abuse problem.\n\n\u25cf 8.8 million, or 3.77 percent of Americans, have reported serious thoughts of suicide.\n\n\u25cf The highest rates of emotional, behavioral or developmental issues among young people occur just west of the Appalachian Mountains, where poverty and social inequality are pervasive.\n\nThe group found that, while information provided through plans\u2019 \u201cexplanation of benefits\u201d might show that there aren\u2019t limits on mental health coverage, limitations including treatment caps and other barriers may exist.\n\n\u201cParity is in its infancy. Most plans know the numerical requirements around cost-sharing, but few have taken seriously the requirements around equity, around access through networks and barriers to care through prior authorization,\u201d said Mike Thompson, health-care practice leader at Pricewaterhouse\u00adCoopers. \u201cAnd, in practice, we have a history of imposing much more stringent medical-necessity standards on mental health care than other health care.\u201d\n\nThe report doesn\u2019t reflect the fact that many health plans have rolling renewals, meaning they had until Jan. 1 to fully comply with the parity law. America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said insurers are following the law.\n\n\u201cOur members are committed to mental health parity, and we\u2019re supportive of legislation, and what isn\u2019t apparent is that benchmark plans represented a snapshot in time . . . so that doesn\u2019t give us the full picture,\u201d said Susan Pisano, AHIP\u2019s vice president of communications. \u201cOur plans have really been working to get in compliance.\u201d\n\nChuck Ingoglia, senior vice president of public policy at the National Council for Behavioral Health, a Washington-based trade group for community mental health and substance-use-treatment organizations, said the report\u2019s findings aren\u2019t surprising, though they are troubling. Implementation of the parity law remains a work in progress, he said.\n\n\u201cThe law is based on a sound policy premise \u2014 that addiction and mental health treatment decisions and management should be comparable to physical health conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this also creates a tremendous barrier to proving violations, as it requires a consumer to obtain access to plan documents for both types of care, which is frequently handled by different plans,\u201d Ingoglia said.\n\nIn addition, the report found that some plans weren\u2019t clear about which services were covered. That means consumers would find out a treatment wouldn\u2019t be paid for by their insurer only after they\u2019d received care.\n\nAmericans with mental disorders have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage, so obtaining insurance is a good first step, according to Al Guida, a Washington-based lobbyist who works on mental health issues with Guide Consulting Services. But the only way a denial can be reversed is through an appeal, which can be a long and arduous process.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of insurance plans offered on Affordable Care Act federal and state exchanges have close to no transparency, which could lead to abrupt changes in both mental health providers and psychotropic drug regimens, with the potential for serious clinical consequences,\u201d Guida said.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a shortage of professionals offering mental health care \u2014 nationally there is only one provider for every 790 people, according to the report.\n\nAll of these factors can cause minor mental illnesses to grow more severe, according to Mental Health America\u2019s chief executive, Paul Gionfriddo.\n\nHe suggested that mental illness should be screened for and covered in the same way that cancer, kidney disease and other illnesses are.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re trapped in a stage where we wait for a crisis, when they\u2019re in advanced stages, and then we treat it, and we wonder why it\u2019s so hard to treat it more cheaply,\u201d Gionfriddo said.\n\nThis article was produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent news service that is a program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, health insurance, mental health coverage, insurance parity, affordable care act, mental health issues.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Expanded coverage was meant to create parity with benefits for physical ills, but access is uneven, report says.", "title": "Law was supposed to make mental health benefits as available as physical coverage.
