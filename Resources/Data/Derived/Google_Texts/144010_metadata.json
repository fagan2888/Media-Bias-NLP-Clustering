Sanders was visibly hobbled and limited by his ankle injury for much of the game against the Chiefs on Sunday. He was targeted four times, including on Peyton Manning\u2019s second interception, and had no catches. On his last target, Sanders was hit hard by two Chiefs\u2019 defenders before being removed from the game with a concussion.\n\nNo sympathy from Smith\n\nManning struggled so mightily against the Chiefs on Sunday, it would make any quarterback wince. But Kansas City\u2019s Alex Smith did not feel sorry for him.\n\n\u201cNot much,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith wasn\u2019t about to offer condolences.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s hands down one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, maybe the greatest,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut they\u2019re the Denver Broncos. I\u2019m not feeling sorry for them by any means. Any one of them.\u201d\n\nParis tribute\n\nKickoff for Sunday\u2019s game was pushed back four minutes to allow for a moment of silence in honor of the victims of Friday\u2019s terrorist attack in Paris. Broncos safety Darian Stewart ran out of the tunnel with the French flag during pregame introductions. The flag also was shown on the videoboard at Sports Authority Field as fans, players, coaches and media paid their respects to the victims and their families.\n\nBroncos firsts\n\nEarlier in the week, Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Cody Latimer\u2019s time was coming. The second-year receiver had yet to see much playing time in backing up Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas.\n\nThat time came Sunday when Latimer caught three passes on six targets for 30 yards, second on the team.\n\nTight end Vernon Davis, who played only nine snaps in his debut at Indianapolis, caught two of four targets for 19 yards.\n\nWard could face suspension\n\nBroncos safety T.J. Ward groused last week about his $5,700 fine for having his jersey untucked against the Indianapolis Colts. Part of the issue was the inconsistent enforcement.\n\n\u201cI have worn it the same way for six years,\u201d said Ward, who toiled in anonymity for five seasons in Cleveland.\n\nWard should avoid any fine for Sunday\u2019s garb. Rather than sport a short jersey, Ward donned a longer fit with an orange undershirt to avoid the ire of the NFL\u2019s fashion police.\n\nHowever, he faces a possible suspension after punching Jeremy Maclin in the fourth quarter, leading to an ejection.\n\nMarshall hurting\n\nBroncos linebacker Brandon Marshall re-injured his knee. Marshall left the game briefly, but returned. He said his is worried about it being a long-term issue.\n\n\u201cIt keeps lingering around. It\u2019s something I got to fix, since game three or four,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sprain. It\u2019ll hurt, but then two plays I\u2019ll be able to come back and I\u2019m good and I won\u2019t even feel it.\u201d\n\nMarshall said it\u2019s an \u201cin the moment injury,\u201d but he doesn\u2019t want it to get worse.\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe Broncos attempted an onside kick on the opening kickoff of the second half. Kansas City recovered\u2026 Safety T.J. Ward (defense), receiver Demaryius Thomas (offense) and inside linebacker Todd Davis (special teams) were the Broncos\u2019 gameday captains. \u2026 The game was the 100th regular-season game in the careers of both safety David Bruton and receiver Andre Caldwell\u2026 As bad as Manning was, the offensive line shared blame. Left tackle Ryan Harris struggled in the first half. At one point on Twitter former Broncos Pro Bowl guard Mark Schlereth said he would cut him at halftime. \u2026 Max Garcia replaced right guard Louis Vasquez on the first drive in the second half. He was called for holding. Officials flagged him for two penalties in the Broncos\u2019 last home game as he spelled Evan Mathis.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Emmanuel Sanders limited against Chiefs, suffered hard hits", "title": "Emmanuel Sanders limited against Chiefs, suffered hard hits", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/15/emmanuel-sanders-limited-against-chiefs-suffered-hard-hits/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115_093656_emmanuel-sanders-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151115_093656_emmanuel-sanders-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-15T21:40:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T03:49:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders did enough to convince trainers he could play, but maybe he shouldn\u2019t have.\n\u2026 Max Garcia replaced right guard Louis Vasquez on the first drive in the second half.\nBroncos safety Darian Stewart ran out of the tunnel with the French flag during pregame introductions.\nOn his last target, Sanders was hit hard by two Chiefs\u2019 defenders before being removed from the game with a concussion.\nSanders was visibly hobbled and limited by his ankle injury for much of the game against the Chiefs on Sunday."}
