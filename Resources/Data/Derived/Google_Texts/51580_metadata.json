Imagine the flexibility.\"\n\nCarson says he would require Medicaid funds to be used for empowerment accounts and premium payments, \"not wasteful state bureaucracies.\" He also wants to increase the eligibility age of Medicare by two months annually, until it reaches age 70. The current age at which most Americans become eligible is 65.\n\nCarson addressed the Syrian refugee crisis, saying allowing people to come to the U.S. would open the door to ISIS. Instead he says the U.S. should support Syria refugees resettle in the country\u2019s northeast, an ethnically diverse region under Kurdish control.\n\n\"What an incredible place to resettle the refugees, in their own country. They don't have to learn a new culture,\" he says, \"Look at how many Syrian men there are in Saudi Arabia, and throughout the Syrian peninsula, and in the Jordanian camps. Those young men need to be recruited and trained as a fighting force to fight ISIS and keep their people safe. \"\n\nCarson says the refugees would be protected through the presence of \u201cinternational, protective\u201d forces.\n\nCarson plans to hold several more events in Iowa this week, before stumping in South Carolina on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "2016 Elections", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says he plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and replace it with what he calls, \u201chealth empowerment", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://iowapublicradio.org/post/carson-wants-replace-obamacare-health-empowerment-accounts", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/ipr/files/styles/medium/public/201601/IMG_20160106_111522.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson says he plans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and replace it with what he calls, \u201chealth empowerment", "title": "Carson Wants To Replace Obamacare With \"Health Empowerment Accounts\""}, "story_id": 462195561, "twitter": {"site": "@IowaPublicRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@IowaPublicRadio"}, "author": "Sarah Boden", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Carson Wants To Replace Obamacare With &quot;Health Empowerment Accounts&quot;"}, "nid": 68744, "datePublished": "2016-01-06", "keywords": "Ben Carson, 2016 Caucuses, news", "wordCount": 324, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Carson says he would require Medicaid funds to be used for empowerment accounts and premium payments, \"not wasteful state bureaucracies.\"\nCarson plans to hold several more events in Iowa this week, before stumping in South Carolina on Saturday.\nInstead he says the U.S. should support Syria refugees resettle in the country\u2019s northeast, an ethnically diverse region under Kurdish control.\nCarson addressed the Syrian refugee crisis, saying allowing people to come to the U.S. would open the door to ISIS.\nThey don't have to learn a new culture,\" he says, \"Look at how many Syrian men there are in Saudi Arabia, and throughout the Syrian peninsula, and in the Jordanian camps."}
