She said health plans have been forced to limit spending on fraud prevention in recent years due to the ACA's medical loss ratio requirements.\n\nHealth plans have been forced to limit spending on fraud prevention in recent years due to the ACA's medical loss ratio requirements, Medical Identify Fraud Alliance's Ann Patterson said.\n\nThe ACA requires insurers to submit data to the HHS on the proportion of premium revenues they spend on clinical services and quality improvement compared with other spending such as administrative overhead, which includes fraud prevention programs.\n\nThe ACA requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of the money they receive from premiums on clinical care.\n\nHowever, Patterson said fraud can interfere with clinical care, causing misdiagnoses and delays in care, and therefore should be considered a contribution to clinical care under medical loss ratio requirements.\n\nPatterson said the HHS could also be doing a better job of educating Americans on how to prevent their health information from being stolen in the first place. She said the HHS should also better coordinator information sharing about cyberthreats and fraud issues among health-care organizations.\n\n\u201cThis isn't just a private sector problem because identity fraud is flowing through the Medicare and Medicaid systems as well,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nHHS Response\n\nThe HHS Office for Civil Rights and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services work closely with federal and private sector organizations to share cybersecurity threat information and combat fraud, the heads of the agencies said in their letter to Senate lawmakers.\n\nThe CMS works with law enforcement to determine if any Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries' identities have been stolen, the letter said.\n\nThe agency also offers materials about medical identity fraud on its website.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Alex Ruoff in Washington at aruoff@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Kendra Casey Plank at kcasey@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/senators-unhappy-hhs-n57982066907/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration doesn't have a clear strategy for combating medical identity theft, a Senate HELP Committee staffer said...", "title": "Senators Unhappy With HHS Answers on Medical Identity Theft"}, "csrf-token": "RqNqrUyK3_fSOxTSXc1dV3I_JgDpKTx0b7ll3ci1hCgBBpWe7oZ1aR2wdpzF44opC7kzcu9mwaOMkfIeFkC9b-KKfLgN0Zah6vPXZiAaFBA1:SaLaUZE1nXyfSes-2bMK7kQmTO4CGHpv2iVRPJS_hZkBnAtTenTyTFtpJYhz-3Y262eK7htq8VQVsUS7htsHOwV8H42wyo7tjHmCvxF7wnU1", "description": "The Obama administration doesn't have a clear strategy for combating medical identity theft, a Senate HELP Committee staffer said", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "Medical Loss RatioPatterson told Bloomberg BNA she's met with Senate lawmakers to discuss how the HHS could better reduce instances of medical identity theft.\nBy Alex RuoffFeb. 1 \u2014 The Obama administration doesn't have a clear strategy for combating medical identity theft, a Senate HELP Committee staffer said Feb. 1.\nThe agency also offers materials about medical identity fraud on its website.\nThe Department of Health and Human Services explained its efforts to combat medical identity theft in a Jan. 20 letter to the Senate HELP Committee.\n\u201cThe government has a role to play in incentivizing private industry to do the right things,\u201d Ann Patterson, senior vice president and program director for the Medical Identity Fraud Alliance, said."}
