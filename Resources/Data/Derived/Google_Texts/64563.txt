Never one to shy away from saying exactly what he thinks, whenever he can, Donald Trump has just made his debut on Twitter’s video streaming app Periscope.

Trump, who is the front-runner for the Republican Party nomination despite possessing a distinctly marmite-like quality, spent the first of his live, weekly appearances covering areas as diverse as immigration, Obamacare, the presidential race and his book ‘Crippled America.’

“We need borders, I’m going to build a big wall,” he said, on the platform he deems a “new method of communication.” Not new exactly… But new to him.

The 10-minute stream was also supposed to go live on Facebook and although the connection failed, Trump assured them “we have big love for Facebook.”

As well as using the opportunity to preach from the pulpit, Trump answered questions from the audience, although the ones he took did not appear to come from the Periscope feed.

Rather unilluminating in his answers, he would not reveal who he would pick for his cabinet, or even his Veep, because he said he wants to win.

Helpful supporters got in touch with messages ranging from ‘Nobama’, to ‘Trump for President’ and ‘Your (sic) so popular we’re losing connection.’

He already has more than 170,000 followers on the platform, currently dwarfed by the 5.7 million people who tune into his Twitter rants.
