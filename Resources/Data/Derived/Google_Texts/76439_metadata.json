Doctors who graduate medical school can\u2019t immediately see patients; rather, they must then do residency and fellowship programs after graduation.\n\nPublic funding for residency programs hasn\u2019t kept up with the number of new doctors graduated each year. This deal between UCF and Hospital Corporation of America (HCA) will address that bottleneck.\n\nCities that will get new residencies include Orlando, Gainesville and Ocala. If successful, the new deal could also mean more doctors trained in Florida practice medicine in Florida.\n\nStatistics show doctors tend to practice medicine in the cities where they did their residencies.
