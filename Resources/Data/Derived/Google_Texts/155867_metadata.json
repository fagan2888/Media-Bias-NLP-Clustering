A budget that the city can't afford. What's driving the costs? Illegal aliens and ObamaCare.\n\nCloser to home, de Blasio said the growth in tax revenue that has swelled city coffers is starting to slow \u2014 with projected growth of 3.6% in 2016 and 1.9% in 2017, compared to an average of 7% in the last five years. The executive budget would bring city spending on Health and Hospitals to $2 billion, up by $700 million since the mayor took office. Health and Hospitals, which runs 11 hospitals around the city, has been reeling from financial troubles that officials say threaten its survival, necessitating last-minute injections of cash to keep it afloat. The trouble comes in part because Obamacare included funding cuts assuming more people would have insurance, but the public hospitals still have to care for large numbers of undocumented immigrants who aren't eligible.\n\nNew York has 375,000 illegals and they tend to use public hospitals.\n\nTo make things even tougher for Health + Hospitals, New York has a staggering 375,000 undocumented non-citizens who lack health insurance, according to the Mayor\u2019s Task Force on Immigrant Health Care Access. Under the federal Affordable Care Act, they are specifically barred from getting government-subsidized private health insurance \u2014 so they end up using public hospital facilities for even routine health needs, putting more strain on the system. \u201cThey\u2019re our fellow New Yorkers. We believe in supporting them,\u201d de Blasio said at his budget briefing of the undocumented who don\u2019t have insurance. That\u2019s in keeping with the liberal New York assumption that any and all city services, no matter the cost, should be provided to undocumented immigrants. A 2014 report by the Citizens Budget Commission flagged the problem with having so many people use hospitals for normal health needs, noting that nearly a quarter of admissions to H+H facilities are \u201cpreventable\u201d \u2014 not medically necessary. It\u2019s an expensive proposition. Another budget-buster is the administration\u2019s position, announced in its new report on H+H, that \u201cunlike what has happened in other cities, Health & Hospitals will remain a vibrant public system \u2014 it is not for sale and the city will not abandon it.\u201d\n\nUntil it does. New York City hospitals are frantically consolidating or being sold off due to ObamaCare. Catholic acute care hospitals in New York City vanished in a puff of smoke. Which puts yet more strain on city hospitals. On top of that, city hospitals are basically giant urgent care clinics for illegal aliens. Which no one wants to pay for.\n\nAnd New York isn't alone in this boat. California is trying to get ObamaCare for illegal aliens.\n\nIn a potentially precedent-setting maneuver, legislators are attempting to clear the way for undocumented immigrants to buy health insurance through Covered California, the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\nThe math remains quite simple and quite impossible.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "ObamaCare, Illegal Aliens Pushing New York to Bankruptcy", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262739/obamacare-illegal-aliens-pushing-new-york-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/05/obamacare-cartoon.jpg?itok=9XEQynXn", "updated_time": "2016-05-05T11:32:28-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262739/obamacare-illegal-aliens-pushing-new-york-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/05/obamacare-cartoon.jpg?itok=9XEQynXn", "card": "summary", "title": "ObamaCare, Illegal Aliens Pushing New York to Bankruptcy"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-05T11:32:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T11:32:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "New York City hospitals are frantically consolidating or being sold off due to ObamaCare.\nOn top of that, city hospitals are basically giant urgent care clinics for illegal aliens.\nCatholic acute care hospitals in New York City vanished in a puff of smoke.\nUndocumented illegal aliens are having a documented effect on New York City's finances.\nNew York has 375,000 illegals and they tend to use public hospitals."}
