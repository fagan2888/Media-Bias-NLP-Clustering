Not so fast. Read the fine print. Most of the money will be going to Africa, but not just to treat Ebola patients or for Ebola research.\n\nIt\u2019s a typical Obama administration spread-the-wealth scheme kicked up a notch to redistribute American resources to poor countries.\n\nOn Aug. 28, the World Health Organization presented a plan to stop Ebola with a $1 billion price tag.\n\nThe Obama proposal costs more because it would pay for a permanent health-care infrastructure in African countries \u2014 constructing hospitals and laboratories and training health-care workers and public-health officials. That\u2019s a massive transfer of wealth \u2014 literally twice the GDP of Liberia.\n\nIt is also a radical shift in foreign-aid priorities that demands scrutiny: $6.2 billion is twice what we give Israel.\n\nSpeaking of priorities, \u00adEbolaCare would cost more than what the United States spends on all cancer research, even though cancer kills 360,000 Americans a year.\n\nEbolaCare would also cost six times what the president allocated to fight superbugs like Staph and C. diff that rage through US hospitals, killing 23,000 patients a year.\n\nHow about the mysterious spread of Enterovirus D 68 to 29 states, where it has killed 11 people, mostly children, and paralyzed another 70.

Obama wants to spend as much on Ebola as on HIV, even though HIV currently kills over 1.5 million people a year in poor countries, 300 times the Ebola toll.\n\nLabeling the request an \u201cemergency\u201d also weasels around Congress\u2019 rule that any spending additions have to be offset elsewhere in the federal budget. Taxpayers get clobbered.\n\nThey also have every reason to worry their money will disappear down the rat hole of corruption.\n\nLiberian officials say that tens of millions of dollars and supplies of medical equipment and food donated by relief organizations routinely go missing.\n\nLiberian officials say they often have to buy protective medical gear on the black market at inflated prices after it\u2019s been stolen.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to hear these concerns at today\u2019s hearing. So far, 56 interest groups representing hospitals, EMS responders, local public-health officials, even the National Governors Association, have submitted testimony asking for a piece of the pie. And no wonder.\n\nThe Obama administration has told state and local governments and health facilities to prepare for Ebola.\n\nHospitals such as SUNY Upstate at Syracuse University in New York are spending roughly $500,000 each to get ready for Ebola, purchasing personal protective suits at $2,000 a piece, refitting laboratories, training staff and conducting Ebola drills.\n\nAcross the nation, hundreds of hospitals are incurring these costs and wondering where they are going to get the money from.\n\nThey shouldn\u2019t count on much. New York state, where numerous hospitals are undertaking expensive preparations, has already been told that it will get less than $15 million.
