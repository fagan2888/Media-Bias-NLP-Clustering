(Photo: Rodney White/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nMike Huckabee stood in the middle of the moving RV and pointed to the 23 photos of his five grandchildren stuck onto the walls around the inside of the vehicle.\n\nThe photos \u201cremind me about why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d the former Arkansas governor and Fox News talk show host said as he rattled off the children's names and ages, their likes and dislikes.\n\nHe sees the photos each time he gets onto the RV and each time he disembarks to talk with Iowans about why they should support him in the Feb. 1 Republican caucuses.\n\nNone of Huckabee\u2019s grandchildren had been born eight years ago when he made his first run for president. He often tells Iowa crowds he could have stayed at Fox News \u2014 \u201cThe easiest job I ever had in my life ... just talking about the people who run for office and who hold office\u201d \u2014 but didn\u2019t because he worries about his grandchildren's future.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced that the America they are growing up in is one that is going to give them the same level of opportunity and freedom that I have been so blessed in this country to have grown up with,\u201d he told a group at the Ogden senior citizens center in January.\n\nHe left his job at Fox News a year ago and in May announced he was running for president. The day after his announcement, Huckabee was in Iowa. Since then, he\u2019s spent 65 days in the state, stopping in all 99 counties.\n\nBuy Photo Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee works on his computer between Harlan and Carroll, Iowa Wednesday Jan 20, 2016, on his RV. (Photo: Rodney White/The Register)\n\nThe time spent in Iowa, though, hasn\u2019t sparked high poll numbers for Huckabee.\n\nThe most recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll showed Huckabee tied for seventh place at 3 percent. What gives Huckabee hope is that the poll also showed that 56 percent of likely caucusgoers could either change their minds about their first-place choice or had not settled on a first choice.\n\n\u201cHe surprised us all in 2008; it could happen again,\u201d said Jayme Neiman, assistant professor of political science at the University of Northern Iowa. Huckabee was trailing in the polls until a month before the 2008 Iowa caucuses but pulled out a win, garnering nearly 41,000 votes, the most ever for a Republican.\n\nNeiman, though, isn\u2019t convinced it will happen a second time, mostly because of the emergence of the Tea Party, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an angrier, more discontented voter who (is) fed up with politics and politicians,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely different landscape\u201d compared with 2008.\n\nHuckabee remains optimistic.\n\n\u201cMy sense is, folks haven\u2019t nailed it down yet,\u201d he told The Des Moines Register. \u201cSome of them won\u2019t until the night they go to the caucuses.\u201d\n\nThat's why at each town hall, he tells audiences to go the caucuses regardless of the weather.\n\n\u201cBut, if you\u2019re not going to caucus for me,\u201d he says, only half-jokingly, \u201cstay home and watch it on TV because it will be cold outside\u2026.\u201d\n\nWHERE IN IOWA?: Track presidential campaign visits across the state\n\nUsing humor to make points\n\nHuckabee\u2019s town halls are informal events, held in a variety of settings from Pizza Ranch meeting rooms or American Legion Halls to the floor of a mattress manufacturing plant or fellowship area of a church. Regardless of the location, each gathering starts the same: The candidate thanks each person in the audience for taking the time to attend the event as he shakes everyone\u2019s hand, poses for photos and autographs books or fliers.\n\nHe generally speaks for 20 or so minutes \u2014 always without notes \u2014 tailoring his talks to his audience. To groups heavy with people at or near retirement age, Huckabee emphasizes his belief that Social Security is an obligation, not an entitlement, and pokes at candidates who want to raise the retirement age or phase out the federal program. When there are veterans in audience, he deplores cuts made to military spending and the country\u2019s aging aircraft and ships. At factories, he laments the 5 million manufacturing jobs lost since 2000 and how he believes implementation of the Fair Tax, a national sales tax that would eliminate the income tax, will help bring those jobs back to the U.S.\n\nHumor is sprinkled throughout his talks, usually as a way to make a point.\n\nDuring a discussion this week in Carroll about the Affordable Care Act Huckabee railed against the inability of consumers to select the type of health-care coverage they needed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a 60-year-old male and \u2014 I know this is going to come to a shock to you \u2014 but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not going to get pregnant,\u201d he said to chuckles. \u201cHowever, if I do, I have paternity coverage because with Obamacare, we all have it\u2026\n\n\u201dAnd folks, if I do become pregnant, I don\u2019t need Obamacare. I\u2019ll have a reality show and I\u2019ll make more money than I need to provide for that baby\u2026. We laugh about it, but it\u2019s ludicrous that we\u2019re paying for things we don\u2019t need and can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nQuestion-and-answer sessions, a staple of Huckabee\u2019s meet-and-greets, can last up to 30 minutes, with the candidate fielding five to 10 questions a stop. He addresses those asking questions by \u201cma\u2019am\u201d or \u201csir\u201d and always thanks them for their question.\n\nMany address the candidate by his first name.\n\n\u201cSorry we came in late, Mike,\u201d Steve Anthofer of Carroll told Huckabee this week before asking about the Fair Tax.\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s OK,\u201d the candidate replied before spending more than 6 minutes explaining his support for the plan that would tax consumption rather than corporate or individual income. The explanation prompted a follow-up question from Anthofer, which Huckabee again spent several minutes answering.\n\nAfter Huckabee was done with his speech, the men resumed their conversation, chatting for another five minutes or so.\n\nLater, Anthofer, a registered independent, said he appreciated the time Huckabee took to explain the Fair Tax. Still, Anthofer said he remained undecided on whom to support in the caucuses.\n\nLOVE IOWA CAUCUS HISTORY?: Find historic galleries, recaps of the caucuses\n\nHuckabee is 'not an angry guy'\n\nThat so many people remain undecided on whether to support Huckabee baffles Janis MacDonald of Scranton. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it. There\u2019s got to be something else that we\u2019re just not seeing,\u201d said MacDonald, who, with his wife, Stacy, supported Huckabee in 2008.\n\nCharles Parkhurst of Harlan and a Shelby County supervisor shared his theory about why Huckabee hasn't garnered more support.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of the media,\u201d Parkhurst said. \u201cPeople are listening too much to all the stuff the media is saying. They\u2019re listening to all that rhetoric and they\u2019re not listening to how people like Mike say they\u2019ll solve things in a civilized manner.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s down-home, folksy air isn\u2019t necessarily what voters are looking for this election cycle, UNI\u2019s Neiman said.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have that anger in him that seems to be resonating with people who were Huckabee supporters in 2008 and are now (Texas Sen. Ted) Cruz supporters\u2026. He\u2019s not an angry guy.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s calm demeanor was apparent this month during an exchange in Washington, Ia., with Joseph Brown, a local pastor who supports Cruz. Brown asked Huckabee why he has said Cruz tailors his comments about same-sex marriage to the audiences he addresses.\n\nRather than lashing out at Brown, ignoring the question or bashing Cruz, Huckabee engaged the minister in a lengthy, but polite discussion that continued after the town hall was over.\n\nCruz has said he would let states decide the marriage issue, Huckabee told Brown. \u201cHe knows, like good lawyers do, how to say things that sound almost the same as something else.\u201d\n\nHuckabee told the Register that he won\u2019t change who he is or how he campaigns just to get votes.\n\nIowans know \u201cHuckabee is the same guy he was eight years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nMORE: Find all #iacaucus results by county, candidate since 1976.\n\nBacker hopes 'we're surprised' on Feb. 1\n\nBrad Sherman, pastor of Solid Rock Church in Coralville, backed Huckabee in 2008 but didn\u2019t automatically throw his support behind the candidate this campaign cycle. Instead, he said he studied other candidates\u2019 positions on issues he feels are important.\n\n\u201cEarly on, I thought there wasn\u2019t a nickel\u2019s worth of differences between them,\u201d Sherman said of the 17-plus candidates who entered the Republican race for president. \u201cBut, boy, as I got to know them\u2026\"\n\nSherman said he\u2019s been surprised more Iowans \u2014 particularly those from the conservative wing of the Republican Party \u2014 don\u2019t share his opinion. He said he thinks many Iowans who say they\u2019ve made up their minds are influenced by polling data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that we\u2019re surprised on caucus night,\u201d he said.\n\nHuckabee, too, remains hopeful. Instead of heeding calls by some for him to drop out of the race, Huckabee stepped up his campaign schedule by planning 150 events in Iowa in January. Between Jan. 2 and Friday, he had traveled around 2,215 miles crisscrossing the state to events in 53 communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still holding out that we can see the upset,\u201d Huckabee said as he traveled between Harlan and Carroll this week. \u201cHonestly, if I didn\u2019t, we\u2019d curtail this schedule back a lot. We wouldn\u2019t be driving over the icy roads and doing 150 events this month.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has \u201cthousands\u201d of volunteers and \u201chundreds\u201d of people signed up to caucus for Huckabee, said J. Hogan Gidley, Huckabee\u2019s spokesman. \u201cWe\u2019ve picked up Iowans coming on with us in droves.\u201d\n\nThe rigorous schedule is taxing, said Huckabee, who typically gets about 5 hours of sleep a night after attending up to six campaign events a day and sitting for TV and radio interviews with local and national media.\n\nThough the schedule is grinding, Huckabee says he finds time to connect with his family daily, either via telephone calls or text messages.\n\n\"FaceTime is a fantastic tool, because I can talk to my grandkids every day,\" he said.\n\nCOMPARE CANDIDATES: See issue and stances for the presidential candidates\n\nABOUT MIKE HUCKABEE\n\nAge: 60\n\nEducation: Huckabee graduated in 1975 from Ouachita Baptist University, completing his bachelor\u2019s degree in religion in two years. He also attended Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary for one year.\n\nFamily: Wife, Janet Huckabee; three adult children and five grandchildren.\n\nCurrent home: Santa Rosa Beach, Fla.\n\nElected office: Huckabee was Arkansas\u2019 lieutenant governor from 1993-96. He became governor in 1996 after then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker was convicted on felony fraud charges and resigned. Huckabee was re-elected to full terms in 1998 and 2002.\n\nOther career highlights: Huckabee hosted a weekly TV show, \"Huckabee,\" on the Fox News Channel, until stepping down in January 2015 to pursue another presidential bid. He is a best-selling author and has published 11 books.\n\nTRADEMARK JOKES\n\nMike Huckabee sprinkles his speeches with witty comments and amusing stories. In Harlan this week, he talked about the 12 years he spent as a Baptist minister, serving two churches six years each.\n\n\u201cI left both churches because of illness \u2014 people got sick of me and I had to leave,\u201d he quipped, eliciting chuckles from the room.\n\nAt the end of most speeches, the candidate holds up a campaign bumper sticker and asks people to put them on their vehicles. \u201cI know a lot of people hate things on their car,\u201d he told an audience in Ogden recently. \u201cThis however should be an exception, because even though it promotes my candidacy, there\u2019s something in it for you. We\u2019re getting reports from all over the country \u2014 when people put these on their cars, they\u2019re getting better gas mileage in their vehicles!\u201d\n\nTOP THREE ISSUES\n\nTAX REFORM: Huckabee supports implementation of the Fair Tax. The Internal Revenue Service would be abolished under the Fair Tax. The merchant and state level would be responsible for collecting the tax that would be turned into the Treasury Department. He believes that the more than $30 trillion in off-shore investments would return to the U.S. as would the thousands of manufacturing jobs that companies have moved to foreign countries. An improved economy would shore up Medicare and Social Security, he says. The Fair Tax would stop the incentive for illegal immigration and is a progressive tax that helps the poor more than the rich, he says.\n\nNATIONAL SECURITY: Huckabee wants to rebuild the country\u2019s military so that no country or terrorist group would want to tangle with the U.S. He has called ISIS a \u201ccancer\u201d and said it must be eradicated by doing such things as cutting of its access to money and supplies and bombing its holdouts.\n\nMORAL CLARITY: Huckabee, who believes life begins at conception, would use the Fifth and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution to protect the unborn. He has said that he'd likely face lawsuits, something he relishes, because it would be up to abortion supporters to prove that what is in a mother\u2019s womb is not a baby. He also supports a constitutional amendment that defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman.\n\nCOMPARE THE CANDIDATES: See Huckabee's stances on the issues\n\nBuy Photo Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee talks to a reporter on his RV between Harlan and Carroll, Iowa Wednesday Jan 20, 2016.
