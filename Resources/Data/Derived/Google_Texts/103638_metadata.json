Offering this alternative allowed Arkansas to bring billions of federal dollars into the state economy, while expanding coverage to some of the state\u2019s sickest individuals and saving hospitals millions in uncompensated care costs.\n\nNearly 100,000 people have enrolled so far; about 250,000 are eligible throughout the state.\n\nArkansas devised the plan last spring and received a waiver from the federal government to use Medicaid money to pay for it, with Washington paying 100 percent of the costs for the program in the first three years and the state eventually picking up 10 percent of the tab thereafter.\n\nBut just as the idea began picking up steam in other states \u2014 Iowa passed a version of the private option and Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Utah and Virginia are considering plans of their own \u2014 the law in Arkansas faced a near-fatal blow.\n\nWatch the NewsHour\u2019s full report:\n\n63347 63311 63311 Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion alternative faces crucial vote In Arkansas, an alternative to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion uses federal dollars to purchase private health plans for low-income residents who fall in a coverage gap. But now, as other states consider following suit, the Arkansas law, known as the \u201cprivate option,\u201d could end unless it is renewed by state lawmakers. Hari Sreenivasan reports. disabled 2365181276 dvAMoOKTV5c\n\nUnder state law, funds for the private option must be re-authorized each year by a three-fourths majority in the 100-member House and 35-member Senate. Meeting that threshold seemed unclear this winter \u2013 especially after the disastrous rollout of the Affordable Care Act caused several lawmakers to reconsider their votes this time around.\n\nBut the plan narrowly passed the Senate in late February. And now that it\u2019s made its way through the House, reauthorization is expected to be signed by Gov. Mike Beebe, a democrat and big supporter of the plan.\n\nIn an interview with the PBS NewsHour in February, Beebe said the private option plan is not only a model for other conservative states who don\u2019t want to expand traditional Medicaid, but a case of good governance.\n\n\u201cThis was a great example of good bipartisan working relations, because Republican leaders in the state legislature \u2014 both the House and the Senate \u2014 helped fashion and craft this private option, and they worked with Democrats, and they worked with our office, and they worked with our Human Services Department to craft what ultimately was done. It\u2019s a shining example of how Republicans and Democrats can work together in a bipartisan fashion to solve problems,\u201d Beebe said. \u201cWashington could take a lesson from that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Arkansas experiment to use federal Medicaid dollars to help low-income people buy private health insurance plans will survive another year.", "pubdate": 20140305, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The Arkansas experiment to use federal Medicaid dollars to help low-income people buy private health insurance plans will survive another year.", "title": "\u2018Private option' Medicaid expansion to continue in Arkansas", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/170462514.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/private-option-medicaid-expansion-continue-arkansas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "The Arkansas experiment to use federal Medicaid dollars to help low-income people buy private health insurance plans will survive another year.", "title": "\u2018Private option' Medicaid expansion to continue in Arkansas", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/170462514.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "health reform"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "health reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbf3\"", "article_summary": "The Arkansas experiment to use federal Medicaid dollars to help low-income people buy private health insurance plans will survive another year.\nWatch the NewsHour\u2019s full report:63347 63311 63311 Arkansas\u2019 Medicaid expansion alternative faces crucial vote In Arkansas, an alternative to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion uses federal dollars to purchase private health plans for low-income residents who fall in a coverage gap.\nBut now, as other states consider following suit, the Arkansas law, known as the \u201cprivate option,\u201d could end unless it is renewed by state lawmakers.\ndisabled 2365181276 dvAMoOKTV5cUnder state law, funds for the private option must be re-authorized each year by a three-fourths majority in the 100-member House and 35-member Senate.\nIn an interview with the PBS NewsHour in February, Beebe said the private option plan is not only a model for other conservative states who don\u2019t want to expand traditional Medicaid, but a case of good governance."}
