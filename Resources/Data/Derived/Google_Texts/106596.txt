Connecticut's Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection will accept and process several hundred applications to register assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines that were not received by the January 1 deadline.

Some gun owners complained they dropped their applications in the mail on December 31, but missed the deadline.

In a letter on Friday, DESPP Commissioner Dora B. Schriro said that the agency will accept applications that were signed and notarized on or before January 1 and postmarked by January 4.

The state expects to accept 160 late assault weapon certificate applications, and 398 large-capacity magazine declarations, as required by the gun control legislation passed in the wake of the Newtown school shooting.

Some gun owners complained they dropped their applications in the mail on December 31, but missed the deadline, because their letters were postmarked on or after January 1 due to the New Year's Day holiday.

As for those who missed the deadline, but don't qualify for this round of acceptances: in a statement, Governor Dannel Malloy's office said that DESPP will contact people "who submitted applications and declarations that were signed and notarized after the January 1, 2014 deadline to advise them of the four means by which the weapons and ammunition should be disposed."
