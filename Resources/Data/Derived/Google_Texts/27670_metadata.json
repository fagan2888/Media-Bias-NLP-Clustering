In it, he argued that by not paying enough attention to the interests of the working class, the Democratic Party allowed Republicans to win over voters by exploiting social issues. His new book, Listen, Liberal: Or, What Ever Happened to the Party of the People?, is another attack on the party for its elitism and coziness with corporate America. The party\u2019s message to Americans is, Frank writes, \u201cyou get what you deserve, and what you deserve is defined by how you did in school.\u201d\n\nIsaac Chotiner Isaac Chotiner is a Slate contributor.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have continued to exploit Democratic tone-deafness, however disingenuously. Earlier this year, Frank wrote a piece about Donald Trump\u2019s appeal to voters who had been undermined by America\u2019s trade policy. Amidst fears that Hillary Clinton could lose working-class votes to Trump, and at a time when Bernie Sanders\u2019s progressive populism has succeeded beyond most people\u2019s expectations, it seemed like a good time to talk to Frank. Over the phone, we discussed Trump\u2019s rise, liberalism\u2019s obsession with technocracy, and the prospect of voting for Clinton. The conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIsaac Chotiner: What sticks out to you about Obama\u2019s presidency, which you have been very critical of, as he reaches the end of his term?\n\nThomas Frank: It\u2019s funny. Whenever I see a picture of Obama, I still like him. I think he\u2019s a very likable guy, and I was a big Obama supporter. I voted for him many times.\n\nDon\u2019t say \u201cmany times\u201d or everyone is going to think voter fraud.\n\nNo, you\u2019re going to be surprised, but I say that because I lived in his state Senate district back in Chicago, so I voted for him when he ran against Bobby Rush. I\u2019ve been a fan of his for a long time. Yes, I am, of course, disappointed with how things have worked out. I don\u2019t really have the final explanation for why things didn\u2019t work out the way I thought they should or hoped that they would. I think that\u2019s going to be up to Obama himself one day writing his memoirs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDo you blame Obama for his failure to enact the agenda you wanted, or do you think other forces kept him from achieving it, and he got as much done as he could\u2014given the circumstances?\n\nI think there\u2019s truth to those things, except that last part. I don\u2019t think he accomplished as much as anybody could have given the circumstances. Of course, he had obstacles. The Republicans did everything they could to stop them, and they\u2019re quite effective, but, ultimately, the buck stops with Obama himself. When you wonder why he chose to react to the financial crisis and to Wall Street and the recession in the way that he did, ultimately the responsibility has to go back to him. He is the president. You could say he was badly advised. I think that\u2019s probably true to a certain degree, but, ultimately, he is the president.\n\nBeing the president doesn\u2019t make you dictator. Or at least until Trump wins.\n\nI\u2019m taking all of that into account, of course. I know that. There\u2019s Congress, there\u2019s the courts, I\u2019m aware of that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHow much of your new book was sparked by your feelings about Obama and the Democratic Party in these last few years?\n\nA lot of it. One of the contrasts between Obama and Bush that was so striking was that Bush filled his administration with hacks and cronies and they proceeded to screw everything up. Obama did the opposite, and brought in the best and the brightest, and in some really important ways, the differences with Bush were really small. That really bothered me.\n\nIn what ways do you think the differences were really small?\n\nThe one that really matters is how they dealt with Wall Street. And the bailout policies of the Bush administration were essentially just carried over. That was the episode that made me wonder what\u2019s wrong with government by all of these brilliant people. Hoover set up a bailout agency, and it went about doing things very similar to the way the bailout agencies worked this time around. It was accused of all the same things, cronyism and this kind of thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThen, Roosevelt came in, and Roosevelt was highly critical of the bailout procedure when he was running for president. When he came in, he changed it around completely, and they started doing very different things. For example, putting banks out of business, firing bank management. If they didn\u2019t like the way a bank had been managed, they would get rid of the management. They would fire these guys. It was quite amazing. They went to a city that they thought had been poorly served by its bank, and they would start a new one. This actually happened\u2014banks that were launched by the federal government.\n\nWhat we did this time around is bail these guys out. Nobody got fired. Actually, the Bush people did fire the management of AIG, but Obama did not. He did get tough with General Motors. I approved of that. I thought that bailout was played very well, the bailout of GM. The bank bailout, I thought was a real disappointment.\n\nYou wrote a piece a little while ago about data journalism and technocracy and the so-called expert consensus. You attacked people like Ezra Klein and the focus on political science in journalism. Can you explain how that critique connects with your broader thinking about the Democratic Party?\n\nI would say that it reflects the culture of liberalism in the same way that there is a lot of scientific sounding stuff that liberals really eat up. They love it when something is explained to them by someone who appears to be a great authority figure. This is the culture of liberalism. A great example is to look at the New York Times op-ed page and how many of the contributors are academics. This is also a problem with journalism, generally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOK, but is your problem that the people who are consulted as being experts are not actually experts, or that the idea of going to experts is itself problematic?\n\nBoth of those are true to some degree. It\u2019s not, obviously, that experts are wrong across the board, but that it\u2019s easy to conceal an agenda by covering it with expertise. It\u2019s really easy. It\u2019s easy to do it with numbers. There are all sorts of ways to do things like that.\n\nI think the latter is true as well. The way I try to get at truth is more through cultural history. That\u2019s what I sort of naturally gravitate back to all the time. I think when you try to understand everything with numbers it is obviously going to leave a lot of things unspoken and unanalyzed.\n\nRight but when you\u2019re writing a book where you\u2019re trying to analyze why working class white people in Kansas change their voting patterns or whatever, it seems like data has to be a big part of any argument you can make.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, absolutely.\n\nWhat have you made of the Sanders campaign?\n\nI voted for Sanders here in Maryland. I like Sanders. I agree with him on a lot of things, probably on most things. I think what he did was very intriguing. I also think he never had a chance. The Democratic Party machinery has been behind Hillary all along.\n\nOK, but so have a very high percentage of nonwhite voters, which means he can\u2019t actually win a majority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLook, if he wanted to win, he would have had to start earlier and do things differently, and he would have to win a lot of those voters over. He didn\u2019t do it.\n\nYou wrote a piece for the Guardian about the rise of Trump, and this was several months ago. Now, it looks like he\u2019s going to be the nominee.\n\nI \u2026\n\nGo on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWe are living in a crazy world. [Laughs.] Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for president.\n\nI think that a lot of the liberal or progressive commentary about Trump has fallen into one of two categories. One is trying to explain where this guy is coming from, and arguing that there are legitimate underlying currents that are explaining his success. The other group of people wants to say, \u201cNo, this guy is a deranged fascist, we must mock him and do nothing but criticize him.\u201d You seem more in the former category.\n\nAgain, there\u2019s a little of both here. Donald Trump is someone that I can\u2019t stand. I dislike nearly everything about him, you know, everything, like his taste is bad, his views are ridiculous, the way he talks, everything about him. The reason I wrote that story is because I was reading all of this newspaper coverage and they were focusing on the kind of outrageous and racist remarks he was making, and I\u2019m not trying to get him off the hook for that stuff, he deserves every bit of scorn and criticism that he\u2019s gotten.\n\nI was reading all of that, and thinking there\u2019s got to be something that he\u2019s saying that\u2019s winning these people over. I sat down and watched a bunch of his speeches, and I was surprised. Nobody is surprised anymore, but I was surprised at the time to discover that he was obsessively concerned with the issue of trade, and the he goes back to it all the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that you made that leap though. I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong. You could say the racist remarks are why he\u2019s winning people over.\n\nIt could be. There are always racist candidates around.\n\nNot like this.\n\nI\u2019m not saying that I know the answer to the Trump phenomenon or that I\u2019ve got it all figured out, but there is this other part of his appeal. You look at where he\u2019s doing really well, and they\u2019re all of these kind of de-industrialized disaster zones, you know, and that\u2019s very strange for a Republican to be doing well in those places.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nYou say it\u2019s weird for Republicans, but wasn\u2019t it part of your thesis in What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas? that Republicans were starting to win over these voters more naturally?\n\nThat\u2019s right, and Trump sort of represents another step in that phenomenon. The wheel has turned several times since then. That was all written before the recession started, before the floor got pulled out from these people. Trump is kind of the latest iteration of it.\n\nWhat\u2019s fascinating about Trump is that he talks about economic issues, and I think that\u2019s one of the reasons that the mainstream Republican Party hates him so much. I think what drives them crazy is he is just abandoning them on free trade issues. He\u2019s got his protectionist message. And there are several other things where there\u2019s a whole bunch of areas where he\u2019s completely breaking with the sort of traditional Republican free-market script.\n\nHe\u2019s also proposing a massive, regressive tax cut.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s only a handful of ways. You can argue that all of them are hypocritical, too. He\u2019s constantly talking about all of these bad trade deals, well, he takes advantage of them, as we all know. His line of clothing is made in wherever. It\u2019s not made in the US. He\u2019s a brazen hypocrite on all of this stuff.\n\nI just wonder how much of the trade message would be getting through if he didn\u2019t have the sort of racist nationalism that goes with it.\n\nOr the sort of braggadocio style. When he talks about trade, he does it in this kind of swaggering tough guy way where he boasts about how he would threaten the CEO of a company, and this is very popular. Why does that appeal? Because, that\u2019s so much more visceral than say, talking about it in policy terms.\n\nWe wonder about Trump\u2019s appeal, but I wonder sometimes if it isn\u2019t that simple. When Democrats talk about this, they always tend back towards this technocratic style that we\u2019ve been talking about, and Trump goes for this much more visceral emotional way of describing it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRight, I guess my concern would be that if Democrats start using that style, there will be consequences down the road, and that populism has a fundamentally illiberal character to it.\n\nDemocrats used to always talk that way. Bill Clinton, you know, go back and look at him in the early 1990s, this guy talked that way all the time. You think of Franklin Roosevelt. He didn\u2019t talk like Bill Clinton, he was this very erudite polished man, but he was still able to put things in a way that resonated for average people. You don\u2019t have to talk like Huey Long in order to communicate with average people.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that your critique of Obama is partially about his communication style, because that is the one thing he always criticizes himself for.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem of technocracy generally. Look at something like the stimulus package, which I was really in favor of. I was saying, how are you going to present this in a way that\u2019s really memorable so that people say, \u201cYes, the American Recovery Act built this bridge.\u201d By the way, the elementary school I went to in Kansas City was built by the WPA. Everybody that went there knew it. How are they going to do something like that, make this program visible, make it really meaningful to people? They just sent the money off to the states. It was just math.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo should decisions on economic stimulus not be made on math?\n\nOf course it should be based on math. You can\u2019t just do it for fun. It has to be based in reality. At the same time, this is an enormous opportunity to make the basic democratic point, that this is how government can help average citizens, this is how government helps society, this is the role that government plays. That opportunity was completely missed. There\u2019s another point that we aren\u2019t getting to here, which is the love of complexity with these guys, which is a really striking thing.\n\nWhen you look at Obama\u2019s two big legislative achievements, Dodd/Frank and Obamacare, the thing that they have in common, that everybody will look back on and say, \u201cthese are artifacts of an era,\u201d is the complexity of them. Nobody understands them. I don\u2019t even think the people who wrote them really understand them.\n\nIs that ideological, or is that just what it took to get them through Congress?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the question, isn\u2019t it? Why would they choose that? Why would they choose to go that route? I have friends who said it would have been so much easier, with Dodd/Frank, for example, you could have made it so much easier just by repealing the deregulations of the \u201980s and \u201990s. As it stands now, Dodd/Frank is so big, it\u2019s something like 20,000 pages now, and it grows all the time. They aren\u2019t done with it. They aren\u2019t done writing all the rules. It\u2019s not just for the love of complexity in itself, it\u2019s to achieve something else, and\u2014\n\nGetting the bill through a Congress full of crazy Republicans?\n\nThere\u2019s that, too. You could have done that much easier. If it\u2019s just Republicans that you\u2019re worried about, at the time, they could have taken away the filibuster, and then, boom. The filibuster is undemocratic anyway. Or, change it so that you can filibuster, but you actually have to show up and physically do it. Something like that, they could have done that, but that\u2019s not what they did. This is something that they chose to do on their own for reasons of their own, and I thought about it, and my hypothesis is that these bills were crafted in order to achieve more than one end.\n\nWith Obamacare, they want to achieve affordable care, and they want to get a national healthcare system, but they also don\u2019t want to hurt the insurance industry. The only way you\u2019re going to do that is a system with a thousand moving parts, and, it\u2019s very, very complicated. The same is true with Dodd/Frank. They\u2019re going to regulate Wall Street, they\u2019re going to make Wall Street safe, but at the same time, they\u2019re not going to hurt any of these institutions.\n\nAgain, I think there\u2019s a pragmatic aspect, too, which is they thought they needed the insurance companies to help them get the bill passed. Anyway, I gather you\u2019re not going to vote for Hillary with a ton of enthusiasm in November.\n\nI\u2019m going to vote for her. If Trump is the Republican nominee, of course I\u2019m going to vote for her. Whether it\u2019s enthusiastic, I don\u2019t know. She\u2019ll be all right. She won\u2019t be great.\n\nShe seems like the complete manifestation of everything about the Democratic Party that you hate.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "A conversation with Thomas Frank about the perilous state of American politics.", "sailthru.author": "Isaac Chotiner", "description": "Twelve years ago, Thomas Frank wrote one of this generation\u2019s most influential (and debated) books about American politics, What\u2019s The Matter With Kans ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Twelve years ago, Thomas Frank wrote one of this generation\u2019s most influential (and debated) books about American politics, What\u2019s The Matter With Kans ...", "title": "Thomas Frank on His Disappointments With Obama and the Failures of Liberalism", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/05/thomas_frank_on_the_failures_of_liberalism.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/05/160505_INT_thomas-frank.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twelve years ago, Thomas Frank wrote one of this generation\u2019s most influential (and debated) books about American politics, What\u2019s The Matter With Kans ...", "title": "Thomas Frank on His Disappointments With Obama and the Failures of Liberalism", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/05/thomas_frank_on_the_failures_of_liberalism.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/interrogation/2016/05/160505_INT_thomas-frank.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-05T14:22:08Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Thomas Frank on His Disappointments With Obama and the Failures of Liberalism", "sailthru.headline": "What\u2019s the Matter With Kansas?
