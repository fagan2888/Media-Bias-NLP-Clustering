That\u2019s much higher than what a minimum-wage worker earns a year.\n\nThe calculator shows how much money a family needs for a \u201cmodest\u201d living in 618 cities across the country. It also lets you compare your city to others or see what the costs are in a place you\u2019d like to live.\n\nEPI says that even after adjusting for higher state and city minimum wages, there is nowhere in the country where any minimum-wage worker earns enough to meet their needs.\n\nIn the Dallas area, EPI\u2019s calculator shows that a two-parent, two-child family must earn $61,152 a year, or $29.40 an hour for a person working 40-hours a week. Nationally, the median amount for is $63,744.\n\n\n\n\u201cWage growth has been stagnant for most workers for decades and, as a result, there is a mismatch between what workers are paid and what it takes to live and support a family,\u201d said EPI senior economist Elise Gould. \u201cWe need a variety of policies to boost wage growth, which includes a higher minimum wage, stronger overtime rules, collective bargaining rights, and enforcement of labor standards as well as the pursuit of a full-employment economy.\u201d\n\nTexas follows the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which translates to just over $15,000 a year for employees working 40 hours a week.\n\nLast year, 361,000 Texas workers earned minimum wage or less, representing 5.7 percent of the nearly 6.4 million hourly workers in Texas, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationwide, that figure was 3.9 percent in 2014.\n\nWhile Texas\u2019 share of workers earning minimum wage or less declined from 2010 through 2014, it still ranks No. 6 after Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana and West Virginia.\n\nFor Dallas-area families, housing is the largest largest expense, accounting for about 18 percent of total family costs, according to EPI. Housing costs range from $602 for a single person with no children to $1,218 for a two-parent family with three children.\n\nChild care costs also take up a big chunk of a family\u2019s monthly budget, with costs ranging from $565 for a family with one child to $879 for a family with three kids, EPI said.\n\nThe Family Budget Calculator takes into account the cost of housing, food, transportation, child care, health care and other basic necessities such as clothing and household supplies. Among the changes in the updated version are: adding budgets for four new family types, including adults without children for the first time; factoring in geographic differences in cost of living and a broader range of expenses into federal poverty thresholds; and adding health care premiums available in the health insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act to health cost calculations.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2JpemJlYXRibG9nLmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMTUvMDgvaG93LW11Y2gtbXVzdC1hLWRhbGxhcy1hcmVhLWZhbWlseS1lYXJuLWZvci1hLW1vZGVzdC1zdGFuZGFyZC1vZi1saXZpbmctZXBpcy11cGRhdGVkLWZhbWlseS1idWRnZXQtY2FsY3VsYXRvci10ZWxscy5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Sheryl Jean", "og": {"site_name": "Biz Beat Blog", "description": "Many workers in the Dallas area do not make enough money to support themselves or their families in a \"secure yet modest standard of living,\" according to the liberal\u00a0Economic Policy\u2026", "title": "This is how much a Dallas-area family must earn for a \u201cmodest\u201d standard of living", "url": "http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2015/08/how-much-must-a-dallas-area-family-earn-for-a-modest-standard-of-living-epis-updated-family-budget-calculator-tells.html/", "image": "http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/08/NM_31SUN2_45257788.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-08-27T08:52:19Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "jTekCA_uXnGm9Z2Lrjq_KcgQ6RoxQOg9cAyQxnvyx-Y", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"}}}, "article_summary": "For Dallas-area families, housing is the largest largest expense, accounting for about 18 percent of total family costs, according to EPI.\nThe Family Budget Calculator takes into account the cost of housing, food, transportation, child care, health care and other basic necessities such as clothing and household supplies.\nThe calculator shows how much money a family needs for a \u201cmodest\u201d living in 618 cities across the country.\nWhile Texas\u2019 share of workers earning minimum wage or less declined from 2010 through 2014, it still ranks No.\nLast year, 361,000 Texas workers earned minimum wage or less, representing 5.7 percent of the nearly 6.4 million hourly workers in Texas, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."}
