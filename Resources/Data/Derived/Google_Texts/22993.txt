A bipartisan group in the U.S. Senate is pushing for the repeal of one of the least popular provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Sens. Dean Heller (R-NV) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) introduced a bill this week that would repeal the so-called Cadillac tax, which levies a 40 percent excise tax on expensive health plans — ones that cost more than $10,200 for an individual plan or $27,450 for family plans. The tax would go into effect in 2018.

“My hope is that reasonable members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will join us in this important, bipartisan endeavor to protect middle-class Americans,” Heller said in a statement.
