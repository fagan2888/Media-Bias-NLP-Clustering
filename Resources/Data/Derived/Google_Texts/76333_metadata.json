Typical Obamacare, that they would insure your dog by mistake,\" Smith said.\n\nSmith says he was able to call and correct the mistake fairly quickly.\n\n\"They fixed it ... I think they fixed it,\" he said.\n\nAfter having his original policy cancelled, followed by this, Smith says he won't believe it until he sees it.\n\n\"There's been a lot of headaches that's come from all of this. All the phone calls. All the nonsense. They ended up giving me good coverage I think, but who knows if they're going to take it away,\" Smith said. \"As long as Baxter's covered that's all the counts.\"\n\nConnect for Health Colorado couldn't comment on the specific letter sent to Baxter, but a spokesperson did release this statement:\n\n\"In general, our letters to customers are generated according to information that is provided by the customer into the system either online or over the phone. In other words, our system does not make up a name when generating a letter. As with any new system, mistakes are possible and when notified by customers, we work quickly to resolve the situation.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- The Colorado healthcare exchange has processed applications for thousands of people ... and one dog.
