Scott Rigell (R-VA). The Daily Show\u2019s Samantha Bee sat down with Congressman Rigell to try to get inside the mind of the man who betrayed his own party to try to stop the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cMeet Representative Scott Rigell, traitor,\u201d Bee began by saying in her report. When he explained that he dislikes the \u201cUnaffordable Care Act\u201d as much as his fellow Republicans but did not believe Congress needed to shut down the government to prove that point, Bee asked him, \u201cAre you just experimenting with reason to see if you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was important for me to represent sane budgeting in Washington,\u201d Rigell replied, drawing utter disbelief out of his interviewer. He proceeded to reject the notion that Democrats in Congress are his \u201csworn enemies\u201d and refused to accept that this makes him a \u201cchicken.\u201d\n\nAs reasonable as Rigell has been during the budget debate, he was equally game to play along with The Daily Show\u2019s antics, urging Bee to \u201cbreathe\u201d as she held her breath in order to make him do as she told and suggesting she go to the hospital when she revealed the \u201cblood\u201d pouring from her head.\n\nRigell not only stood up against the shutdown before it happened, but was also one of the most outspoken Republicans for ending it once it began. On Tuesday he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, \u201cI don\u2019t think the continued shutdown advances our conservative agenda.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via Comedy Central:\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Daily Show's Samantha Bee sat down with Congressman Rigell to try to get inside the mind of the man who betrayed his own party to try to stop the government", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-04-at-1.04.33-PM.png", "title": "Daily Show\u2019s Samantha Bee Grills GOP \u2018Traitor\u2019 Who Voted Against Shutdown"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Daily Show's Samantha Bee sat down with Congressman Rigell to try to get inside the mind of the man who betrayed his own party to try to stop the government shutdown.", "creator": "@themattwilstein", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-04-at-1.04.33-PM.png", "title": "Daily Show's Samantha Bee Grills GOP 'Traitor' Who Voted Against Shutdown", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "keywords": "tv", "date": "2013-10-04T16:11:36+00:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd538d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cMeet Representative Scott Rigell, traitor,\u201d Bee began by saying in her report.\nThe Daily Show\u2019s Samantha Bee sat down with Congressman Rigell to try to get inside the mind of the man who betrayed his own party to try to stop the government shutdown.\nWhen the House of Representatives first voted to fund the entire government except for President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, only one Republican voted against the measure: Rep.
