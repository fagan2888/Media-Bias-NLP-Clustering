â€” Nine people, including several teenagers, were injured in a two-car crash on Norwood Road in north Raleigh Thursday evening, according to state Highway Patrol troopers.

According to investigators, an Acura filled with five teenagers crossed the center line and crashed head on into a Toyota SUV carrying four people shortly after 8:30 p.m.

Troopers said the 16-year-old driver was going around a curve on Norwood Road when he went off the side of the road and over corrected. Speed was a factor in the wreck, and troopers said the road was wet.

The names of those injured have not been released, but authorities said all of the injuries were non-life-threatening. The five teenagers are all students at Leesville Road High School.

Three girls, ages 14 and 15, were thrown from the vehicle in the wreck and landed in a yard across the street. Troopers said none of the girls were wearing seat belts.

"Two boys were in the front seat. They got out. They were alert but a little confused, and they were saying, 'Where are the girls? Where are the girls?'" said witness Lisa Sroka. "There were three girls in the backseat who got ejected out of the back window at some point across the street."

The 16-year-old driver and 17-year-old front-seat passenger were both wearing seat belts. The driver was ticketed for speeding and transporting a passenger under age 16 that wasn't wearing a seat belt.

Four people inside the Toyota SUV were also taken to local hospitals. Their injuries were also non-life-threatening.
