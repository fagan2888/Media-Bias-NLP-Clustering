Three justices \u2014 the liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg; conservative Antonin Scalia; and Anthony Kennedy, often a swing vote on key social issues \u2014 will be 80 or older by Election Day.\n\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz has often cited the importance of the court in his speeches, as he appeals to conservatives who might be unhappy with recent rulings on Obamacare and same-sex marriage. \u201cYou know, we have a Supreme Court right now that is an activist, fundamentally illegitimate court,\u201d he told an audience in Rock Rapids, Iowa, on Wednesday.\n\nCruz believes that the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts by President George W. Bush was a mistake, especially after Roberts voted in favor of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cA handful of judges rewrote Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said, \u201cin order to force that failed law on millions of Americans.\u201d\n\nThis term also highlights the difference just one justice can make on the bench.\n\nWhen it considers the cases on affirmative action and abortion, for instance, it will be discussing court precedent crafted in part by Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. She retired from the bench in 2006 and was ultimately replaced by Justice Samuel Alito, who could vote to chip away at those precedents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating moment because we are entering 2016, and the court has the potential to place itself in the heart of the political debate that we are having in the country,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. The court is poised to rule on cases this term that are the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of the progressive movement, she said.\n\nHere are the cases the court is considering that could play a big role in the presidential race:\n\nAbortion\n\nIn March, the court will hear the first major case on abortion rights since 2007.\n\nAt issue are key parts of Texas\u2019 2013 abortion law that requires that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and mandates that clinics upgrade their facilities to hospital-like standards.\n\nAbortion rights supporters say the law is one of the strictest in the nation and that if the Supreme Court agrees with a lower court\u2019s decision and allows two provisions of the law to go into effect, the number of available clinics in the state is expected to fall to about 10. Supporters of the law argue it\u2019s meant to protect women\u2019s health. Other states have similar legislation percolating through the lower courts.\n\nAbortion is always an issue that can fire up base voters on both sides, and a ruling would likely come in late June, just as the general election battle heats up.\n\nContraceptive mandate\n\nFor the fourth time, the court will hear a challenge targeting the Affordable Care Act. The latest case concerns a challenge from religious nonprofit groups, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, to the so-called contraceptive mandate.\n\nThat\u2019s the requirement that demands group health plans provide a full range of contraceptive coverage to women at no cost. It\u2019s a follow-on to the Hobby Lobby case, where in 2014, the court sided with closely held for-profit companies that objected to providing certain contraceptives.\n\nIt\u2019s another ruling that could come in late June.\n\nImmigration\n\nThis month, the court is expected to announce whether it will wade into the dispute concerning President Barack Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\n\nTexas and 25 other states are challenging the programs that would allow millions of undocumented immigrants to apply for programs that could make them eligible for work authorization and some associated benefits. Lower courts have so far sided with Texas and temporarily frozen the programs from going into effect.\n\nThe Obama administration hopes the court will take up the issue this term and reverse the lower court to green light the programs before the next election, but the timing, should the court agree, will be very tight.\n\nAffirmative action\n\nIn December, the court seemed divided on a major affirmative action case challenging the race-conscious admissions plan at the University of Texas, with supporters of the school fearful that the the justices are poised to curtail the use of race as one factor in admissions.\n\nAll eyes will be on Kennedy, the Ronald Reagan nominee who is often the deciding vote in tight cases. He has supported a government interest in diversity but has yet to rule in favor of an affirmative action plan.\n\nScalia\u2019s comments at oral arguments, however, have grabbed most of the attention. Scalia, referencing friend-of -the court briefs that argued that affirmative action in higher education could do more harm than good for some minority applicants, started a political storm when he said, \u201cThere are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school.\u201d\n\nVoting rights\n\nThe court heard another big case in December challenging the \u201cone person, one vote\u201d doctrine in a dispute that could change the way that states draw their legislative lines. The principle dates back to the Earl Warren court when the justices held that legislative districts must be drawn so they are equal in population.\n\nThe court, however, never defined whether the doctrine applies to the general population or the voting population. The plaintiffs in the case, supported by the conservative group Project on Fair Representation, argue that their vote is being diluted in relation to voters in other districts that have similar numbers of people but fewer eligible voters.\n\nCivil rights groups are watching the case carefully, fearful that if the court rules with the plaintiffs, it could shift power from urban areas \u2014 and from districts that tend to vote Democratic and include a higher percentage of individuals not eligible to vote such as noncitizens, released felons and children \u2014 to rural areas that tend to vote Republican.\n\nLabor unions\n\nThis month, justices will hear arguments in a case that could weaken the coffers of public sector unions and threaten thousands of contracts between unions and governments across the country.\n\nThe challenge is brought by a group of public school teachers in California who argue that the court should rule that compelling so-called \u201cagency fees\u201d from nonmembers violates the First Amendment.\n\nCourt precedent holds that while a public sector union can\u2019t demand money from nonunion members for political or ideological spending, it can require those employees to pay for workplace bargaining such as wages, grievance processing and workplace conditions.\n\nIn the past, Alito has hinted it\u2019s time to overturn precedent, but Justice Elena Kagan and others have strenuously defended it.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "38.890506;-77.004654", "description": "As much as the Supreme Court justices dislike political labels, its rulings will undoubtedly thrust it into the center of the presidential race with decisions coming up on abortion, contraceptive coverage, affirmative action, organized labor, voting rights and possibly immigration.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "KTLA", "description": "As much as the Supreme Court justices dislike political labels, its rulings will undoubtedly thrust it into the center of the presidential race with decisions coming up on abortion, contraceptive c\u2026", "title": "How the Supreme Court Could Affect the 2016 Presidential Election", "url": "http://ktla.com/2016/01/08/how-the-supreme-court-could-affect-the-2016-presidential-election/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribktla.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/scotus.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribktla.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/scotus.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@ktla", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ktla"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Los Angeles News and Video for Southern California", "google-site-verification": "EXN882aQNl1yOuacaH9250MsLveDh1nhf0vkGkYDz_k", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=587590968", "fb": {"pages": 72391084613}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "KTLA", "ICBM": "38.890506, -77.004654", "keywords": "nation/world, supreme court of the united states", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/ktla5", "published_time": "2016-01-08T12:24:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-08T12:24:44+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/ktla5"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://ktla.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/77bb48cc2507c6a01607fe346372a8be?s=16"}, "article_summary": "\u00d7 How the Supreme Court Could Affect the 2016 Presidential ElectionAs much as the Supreme Court justices dislike political labels, its rulings will undoubtedly thrust it into the center of the presidential race with decisions coming up on abortion, contraceptive coverage, affirmative action, organized labor, voting rights and possibly immigration.\n\u201cYou know, we have a Supreme Court right now that is an activist, fundamentally illegitimate court,\u201d he told an audience in Rock Rapids, Iowa, on Wednesday.\nHe has supported a government interest in diversity but has yet to rule in favor of an affirmative action plan.\nWhen it considers the cases on affirmative action and abortion, for instance, it will be discussing court precedent crafted in part by Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.\nThe court is poised to rule on cases this term that are the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of the progressive movement, she said."}
