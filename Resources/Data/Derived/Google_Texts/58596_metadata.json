The goal is to produce new and additional collaborative approaches to regional healthcare while improving access to such care at the same time.\n\nThis comes in response to an increasing number of people seeking medical treatment under provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA). Implemented to increase access to and quality of healthcare, while improving patient satisfaction, and reducing overall costs, issues are now coming up pertaining to allotment of finite state- and local- healthcare resources.\n\n\u201cInterprofessional education is a team-based approach to health care,\u201d explained Keith Monosky, a CWU professor of nutrition, exercise, and health sciences. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly important in rural areas, which can struggle to attract health care professionals.\u201d\n\nSuch training allows students from two, or more, health care areas to learn together during a portion of\u2014or throughout\u2014their professional training so that they may become familiar and accustomed to providing coordinated and comprehensive medical experiences. Monosky represents CWU, along with Ethan Bergman, associate dean of the College of Education and Professional Studies, on the YVIPEC\u2019s steering committee.\n\n\u201cOur focus is to create collaborative approaches to improve patient health outcomes through developing a program structure and function, such as curriculum and faculty development,\u201d he said.\n\nThe results of a committee-produced white paper found that health care in medically underserved areas is often worsened by a scarcity of trained health care professionals. Patient factors\u2014age, chronic illness, and socio-economic status\u2014also contribute to health care challenges.\n\n\u201cCentral\u2019s involvement will help establish a more uniform delivery of healthcare in Washington State with a markedly improved access as well,\u201d noted Monosky, who also serves on the National Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Advisory Council and directs the university\u2019s EMS paramedicine program.\n\nAlong with CWU and PNWU, the collaborative includes representatives from Heritage University, Washington State University, and Yakima Valley Community College.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rewarding that there is so much interest\u2014and commitment\u2014to this effort,\u201d stated Monosky, who pointed out that the YVIPEC may be the first join venture involving more than one institution, as most of the nation\u2019s interprofessional collaboratives are contained within a single college or university.\n\nEMS paramedicine is one of several CWU-offered health care-related majors, which also include community, school, and public health; exercise science; food science and nutrition; pre-chiropractic; pre-dentistry; pre-medicine; pre-nursing; and pre-pharmacy. In addition, the university confers master\u2019s degrees in health and physical education, and nutrition.\n\nMedia contact: Robert Lowery, director of radio services and integrated communications, 509-963-1487, loweryr@cwu.edu.\n\nApril 6, 2016", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "central washington university, ellensburg, eburg, primary, cwu, college, colleges, state, four year", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "CWU Joins Collaborative to Educate More Regional Healthcare Professionals - Central Washington University News and Events", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Along with CWU and PNWU, the collaborative includes representatives from Heritage University, Washington State University, and Yakima Valley Community College.\nThe results of a committee-produced white paper found that health care in medically underserved areas is often worsened by a scarcity of trained health care professionals.\n\u201cInterprofessional education is a team-based approach to health care,\u201d explained Keith Monosky, a CWU professor of nutrition, exercise, and health sciences.\n\u201cOur focus is to create collaborative approaches to improve patient health outcomes through developing a program structure and function, such as curriculum and faculty development,\u201d he said.\nThe goal is to produce new and additional collaborative approaches to regional healthcare while improving access to such care at the same time."}
