A 35-year-old man and his young son died after they plummeted from a Midtown building Sunday, a law-enforcement official said.

The incident occurred about noon at 124 W. 60th St. in Manhattan when the man and the child, believed to be 3 or 4 years old, entered the high-rise, South Park Tower, the official said.

At least one of the victims landed on the roof of an adjacent John Jay College of Criminal Justice building, according to the school. The man was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. The child was pronounced dead at Roosevelt Hospital.

South Park Tower is owned by the Brodsky Organization. Phone calls for comment were not returned.

The man’s connection to the building was unclear, the official said. Police could be seen Sunday afternoon peering from apartment balconies.

Neighbors described the building as friendly with a lot of dogs and children. Manoj Notani, 36 years old, walked outside with his 9-month-old daughter.

“I’m just kind of shocked, but stuff like this happens all the time in the city,” he said. “It’s hard to believe when it happens in your own building.”
