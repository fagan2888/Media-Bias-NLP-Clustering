The Dutch master painted himself repeatedly throughout his career.\n\nFour large self-portraits gaze at visitors entering a mammoth new Rembrandt show at the National Gallery in London. He looks by turns quizzical, stoic and defiant, and the exhibition seeks to show that even this best-known of artists was a man of surprising facets.\n\n\u201cRembrandt: The Late Works\u201d covers the 20 years before Rembrandt\u2019s death in 1669, aged 63. It was a time of personal upheaval. Despite his renown as an artist, he struggled with debt and faced bankruptcy. His common-law wife, Hendrickje Stoffels, and his son, Titus, both predeceased him.\n\nAnd yet, said curator Betsy Wieseman, it was a period of intense creativity.\n\n\u201cI think he was very good at compartmentalizing,\u201d Wieseman said Tuesday at a preview for the show. \u201cHis art was certainly affected by these dramatic events in his life, but I think the art was also an escape for him, and a therapy in a way.\u201d\n\nOrganized with Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum - it travels there in February after its London run - the exhibition includes more than 90 paintings, drawings and prints from collections around the world.\n\nOne key painting almost didn\u2019t make it.\n\n\u201cThe Conspiracy of the Batavians Under Claudius Civilis\u201d belongs to Sweden\u2019s Royal Academy of Fine Arts and has not left Sweden in 45 years.\n\n\u201cThe loan was only secured a couple of weeks ago,\u201d Wieseman said. \u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely crucial to the show and it really, really was a dramatic, last-minute Hail Mary pass.\u201d\n\nThe painting is a survivor of a mysterious episode in Rembrandt\u2019s career. It\u2019s part of a huge work depicting a tribal uprising against the Romans. For the 17th-century Dutch, the episode symbolized their liberation from Spanish rule.\n\nThe work was commissioned for Amsterdam\u2019s grand new Town Hall, but was displayed for only a few months before being removed. The reason is unknown; it\u2019s possible the work\u2019s intensity was too much for the burghers of Amsterdam.\n\nAs the exhibition illustrates, Rembrandt could be unflinching - there\u2019s blood and brains galore in \u201cThe Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Joan Deyman\u201d - but also tenderness, in delicate nudes and quiet, intimate portraits of the artist\u2019s son.\n\nThe works on show embrace a vast array of techniques and moods. There are experiments with light and shadow; delicate drawings of Dutch forests and farms; large portraits of society worthies; scenes from mythology and the Bible.\n\nBut it\u2019s the faces that linger in the memory.\n\nElderly merchant\u2019s wife Magaretha de Geer looks like a woman not to be trifled with in Rembrandt\u2019s portrait of her. Vanity, seriousness and detached amusement seem to flit across the faces of \u201cThe Sampling Officials of the Amsterdam Drapers\u2019 Guild.\u201d\n\nFashion designer Zandra Rhodes - subject of a Rembrandt-style portrait by photographer Rankin for a project that accompanies the exhibition - said it was the depth of Rembrandt\u2019s images that set him apart.\n\n\u201cIn his early life he\u2019s like all the other Dutch painters,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then his work gets very, very intense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit serious for me to own,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a Rubens.\u201d\n\n\u201cRembrandt: The Late Works\u201d is at the National Gallery from Wednesday to Jan. 18, and at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam from Feb. 12 to May 17, 2015.\n\nFollow Jill Lawless on Twitter at http://Twitter.com/JillLawless", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are few artists with a more famous face than Rembrandt.
