Sioux Falls, SD

35 of the best bull riders in the world are stopping in Sioux Falls as part of their national tour.

It's part of the 2015 PBR Built Ford Tough Series, the premier bull riding circuit known around the world.

One of the riders is Stetson Lawrence. He has family from the White Horse and Eagle Butte area who traveled to Sioux Falls to watch him ride.

Despite the extra voices in the crowd, he doesn't feel any extra pressure.

"Just happy to see them. Life on the road, don't get to spend too much time with family so when they can come and hang out here and do it all at once where I can ride bulls and hang out. It's awesome," Lawrence said.

This is the first time this high level of bull riding has been in South Dakota's largest city. Assistant General Manager of the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center Chris Semrau says the event is a success.

"The demand is overwhelming. We're going to have two sold out nights of PBR this weekend which is the biggest strategy we have to bring events like this back to Sioux Falls. It's a big deal that they're here and we're glad that the community has supported the event," Semrau said.

Immediately after the Summit League Tournament was over, events center staff worked to take out the hardwood and replace it with dirt.

The riders will wrap up in Sioux Falls Saturday night before heading to Albuquerque for a competition on March 20th.
