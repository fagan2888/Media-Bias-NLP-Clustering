Here's what employers and consumers need to know about grandfathered health plans in 2014.\n\nTwo Types of Grandfathered Health Plans\n\nThere are two types of grandfathered health plans: job-based plans and individual plans.\n\nJob-based grandfathered plans can enroll people after March 23, 2010 and still maintain their grandfathered status. They can do this as long as the plans haven\u2019t been changed in ways that substantially cut benefits or increase costs for consumers - and have continuously covered at least one person since March 23, 2010.\n\nIndividual grandfathered plans cannot newly enroll people after March 23, 2010 and have that new enrollment be considered a grandfathered policy. But insurance companies can continue to offer the grandfathered plans to people who were enrolled before that date. An insurance company can also decide to stop offering a grandfathered plan. If it does, it must provide notice 90 days before the plan ends and offer enrollees other available coverage options.\n\nWhat's the Difference Between Grandfathered and Non-Grandfathered Health Plans?\n\nGrandfathered health plans do not need to meet all of the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAll health plans (grandfathered and non-grandfathered) must:\n\nEnd lifetime limits on coverage\n\nEnd arbitrary cancellations of health coverage\n\nCover adult children up to age 26\n\nProvide a Summary of Benefits and Coverage (SBC)\n\nHave a minimum amount of the premium they collect go toward medical claims and clinical expenses (aka their Medical Loss Ratio)\n\nGrandfathered plans do not have to:\n\nCover preventive care for free\n\nGuarantee your right to appeal\n\nProtect your choice of doctors and access to emergency care\n\nBe held accountable through rate review for excessive premium increases\n\nIn addition to the above, grandfathered individual health plans (the kind you buy yourself, not the kind you get from an employer) do not have to:\n\nEnd yearly limits on coverage\n\nCover individuals with a pre-existing health condition\n\nDo I Have a Grandfathered Plan?\n\nCheck your health plan materials: Health plans must disclose if they are grandfathered in all materials describing plan benefits.\n\nCheck with your employer or your health plan's benefits administrator.\n\nClick here to read the fact sheet from healthcare.gov.\n\nWhat questions do you have about grandfathered health plans in 2014?
