A customer shot a man who was attempting to rob a North Charleston Waffle House on Saturday, according to police.

The would-be robber of a North Charleston Waffle House was armed Saturday when a customer intervened and fatally shot him, according to North Charleston police.

There were no other customers at the restaurant, located at 6907 Dorchester Road, at the time, said Lt. Angela Johnson. She did not say what the attempted robber was armed with.

Shortly after 5 a.m., police responded to reports of an armed robbery and shots being fired at the North Charleston eatery. When officers arrived, they found the suspect had been shot.

The Charleston County Coronerâ€™s Office identified the suspect early Sunday as 19-year-old Joshua Jermaine Davis. He died at Medical University Hospital.

It is unknown where Davis resided, but the family believes he lived with a friend in downtown Charleston, according to Johnson. She said police are not pressing any charges against the customer at this time and that a report on the shooting would be released Monday.
