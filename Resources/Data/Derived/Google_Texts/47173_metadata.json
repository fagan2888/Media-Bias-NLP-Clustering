His character is all for immediate romance; hers is a bit more reluctant at first.\n\nLeaning back in his chair in the Miami Beach Convention Center\u2019s celebrity \u201cgreen room\u201d before the post-screening Q&A, Elliott said his on-set relationship with Danner somewhat paralleled the script\u2019s trajectory for the two main characters.\n\n\u201cBlythe and I had never crossed paths before this,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cI\u2019d just been a fan, like a lot of other people, from afar.\n\n\u201cAt first I sensed a sort or nervousness from her. Of course we jumped right into it; we did one of the kissing scenes that first day. Blythe was whispering to me, \u2018I\u2019ve never kissed a man with a mustache before.\u2019\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Well, you\u2019re about to!\u2019 \u201d\n\nI\u2019ll See You in My Dreams was co-written and directed by Brett Haley. Haley is just 31, but he has a remarkable ear for the cadences of grownup conversation and for the special kinds of insecurities that can accompany late-life love. Is it possible that somewhere in his creative mind there\u2019s an older person trying to get out?\n\nSign up for the AARP Leisure Newsletter \u00bb\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a storyteller \u2014 I think I have a lot of people in me trying to get out,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn about the world and about people, and I think directing a film about people that you previously didn\u2019t understand is a good way to do that.\u201d\n\nBesides Danner, the film features an all-star cast of famous women, including Oscar nominee June Squibb (Nebraska), six-time Golden Globe nominee Rhea Perlman (Cheers) and Emmy winner Mary Kay Place (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman). It\u2019s an unusual environment for Elliott, who\u2019s known mostly for man\u2019s-man roles (see The Big Lebowski or FX TV\u2019s Justified).\n\n\u201cIt was a change, and I liked it,\u201d he said. \u201cMary Kay referred to me as \u2018the Male Ingenue.\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed all that masculine stuff I\u2019ve done in the past, whether it\u2019s military or westerns or bikers or whatever. But the opportunity to play a real gentleman around a really incredible woman was a real pleasure, particularly when it\u2019s this kind of intelligent dialogue. It just seemed so real.\u201d\n\nHe leaned forward. The guy in I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams, he confessed, is a lot closer to the real Sam Elliott than the tough guys that made him famous.\n\n\u201cI think those other parts are total fantasies on some level. I mean a bouncer in a bar? That\u2019s not my game. Nor is a general in the military. There\u2019s some of my father in those roles, although I never got to know my father well; he died when I was 19.\u201d\n\nIn the early years of AARP\u2019s Movies for Grownups Awards, given each February in Los Angeles, true contenders for the \u201cBest Grownup Love Story\u201d category were hard to come by. This year the competition already is fierce \u2014 and both Elliott and Haley could not be happier about that.\n\n\u201cLate-life romance is real,\u201d said Haley. \u201cIt happens every day. People don\u2019t close themselves in their houses and wait to die. People are living their lives, and they have a desire to love and be loved.\u201d\n\nGet entertainment and dining discounts with your AARP Member Advantages. \u00bb\n\nAdded Elliott, who has been married more than 30 years to actress Katharine Ross (The Graduate): \u201cI just look at this picture as every man\u2019s tale. It\u2019s where all of us are headed. My mom lived to be a week less than 96. She had a full life. She had relationships, she danced, she had a career as a schoolteacher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that this hasn\u2019t really been addressed before in the movies. But I\u2019m happy to be a part of something that is addressing it in a real honest fashion.\u201d\n\nPhotos: Bill Newcott\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Sam Elliott\u00a0got a standing ovation from a full house when he took the stage following the screening of his new film, I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams, at the Movies for Grownups Film Festival in Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to play a role like this,\u201d the star, whose distinctive rumbling voice has made him one of the busiest commercial voiceover artists in America, told the moderator, AARP\u2019s Meg Grant. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s mostly selling trucks and beer.\u201d In a year that \u2026", "creator": "@aarp", "url": "http://blog.aarp.org/2015/05/15/sam-elliott-blythe-danner-hadnt-kissed-a-moustache/", "title": "Sam Elliott: Blythe Danner Had Never Kissed a Mustache", "site": "@aarp", "card": "summary"}, "estimated_publish_date": "2015-05-15", "Last-Modified": "2015-05-18EDT16:50:17", "keywords": "entertainment, aarp movies for grownups, bill newcott, blythe danner, brett haley, efg, film festival, i'll see you in my dreams, katharine ross, life@50, meg grant, sam elliott", "houseAds": "commercial", "paywallStatus": "off", "isArticle": "false", "livefyreId": "350138:http://blog.aarp.org/2015/05/15/sam-elliott-blythe-danner-hadnt-kissed-a-moustache", "title": "Sam Elliott: Blythe Danner Had Never Kissed a Mustache", "comments": "on", "sponsorship": "on", "source": "aarp_washington_office", "description": "The veteran actor is on hand to discuss his new film, 'I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams', a romantic comedy also starring Blythe Danner.", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "Division:AARP.org", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "aarpAdUnit": "Entertainment", "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/AARP"}, "pluckId": "http://www.aarp.org/vendor/blog/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "Sam Elliott\u00a0got a standing ovation from a full house when he took the stage following the screening of his new film, I\u2019ll See You in My Dreams, at the Movies for Grownups Film Festival in Miami. \u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to play a role like this,\u201d the star, whose distinctive rumbling voice has made him one of the busiest commercial voiceover artists in America, told the moderator, AARP\u2019s Meg Grant. \u201cOtherwise it\u2019s mostly selling trucks and beer.\u201d In a year that \u2026", "title": "Sam Elliott: \u201cIt\u2019s Very Gratifying to Play a Role Like This\u201d", "url": "http://blog.aarp.org/2015/05/15/sam-elliott-blythe-danner-hadnt-kissed-a-moustache/", "image": "http://blog.aarp.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Sam-e1431722903391-185x185.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarpe/en/home/vendor/blog", "Subject2": "Resources and Tools:Blogs", "aarpeContent": "true", "IALevel1": "vendor", "IALevel2": "blog", "s43": "13.Volunteerism|MyPersonalTime", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016/05/26"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb01c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s very gratifying to play a role like this,\u201d the star, whose distinctive rumbling voice has made him one of the busiest commercial voiceover artists in America, told the moderator, AARP\u2019s Meg Grant.\nBut the opportunity to play a real gentleman around a really incredible woman was a real pleasure, particularly when it\u2019s this kind of intelligent dialogue.\nThis year the competition already is fierce \u2014 and both Elliott and Haley could not be happier about that.\nPeople are living their lives, and they have a desire to love and be loved.\u201dGet entertainment and dining discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\nSign up for the AARP Leisure Newsletter \u00bb\u201cI\u2019m a storyteller \u2014 I think I have a lot of people in me trying to get out,\u201d he told the crowd."}
