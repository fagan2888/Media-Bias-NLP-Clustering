That\u2019s why I said yesterday I was very frustrated. I have to find a way to make our guys accountable. How I\u2019m going to do it, I guess I\u2019m going to have to figure out. Is it by showing them on the clip night after night. Is it by taking them out of the power play. Is it by benching the guys. . .\n\n\u201cBut we have to find a way. I mean, we had way too many turnovers. I\u2019m not going to give you the numbers we came up with, but I\u2019d say probably half of their shots are coming after turnovers.\u201d\n\nI asked: \u201cTwenty-two?\u201d\n\nRoy replied: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more than 22. I\u2019m not going to go into the number, I\u2019m going to let you watch the game and tell me the next day how many you had. But it\u2019s too many. It\u2019s impossible, when you play against top teams like this, their counterattack is outstanding, their transition game is good. If you turn over the puck, they\u2019re gone. Breakaways, 2-on-1s, 3-on-2s. They\u2019re going to possess the puck in the O-zone. There are moments in the game where we had the puck two times, if not three times, and we could not get it out of our zone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watching and saying, \u2018You\u2019ve been in your zone for a minute thirty,\u2019 yeah, because we have (up) the puck three times. We know we have to be better there and that\u2019s the cause of our problems, our main problem. Are we going to fix this to zero? No. There\u2019s always going to be some. But we have to cut down on those numbers big time.\u201d\n\nRoy noted, \u201cThere are different ways to see it. Is it a lack of talent, is it a lack of concentration, is it a lack of options? These are things we might have another conversation on.\u201d\n\nAt that point, I asked if it was too late to fix it after 77 games.\n\n\u201cWell, you know what,\u201d Roy said, \u201cmy values are respect and trust. Should I have shown those clips before? I didn\u2019t do it because I didn\u2019t want to affect the confidence. Sometimes if you watch this too many times, you\u2019re like, \u2018OK is it going to help?\u2019 What\u2019s the good strategy? \u2026 And is it too late to fix? We\u2019ll see. All I can say to you is we talked about it for a while and we know we need to be better at it. You hear me saying that many, many times. It\u2019s not just in hockey, it\u2019s not just in basketball, it\u2019s not just in football. It is something we need to be better at.\u201d\n\nOn another subject, Roy said he believed the un-penalized hit leveled on the Avalanche\u2019s Nikita Zadorov by Washington\u2019s Tom Wilson was a head shot. At the game Friday, the Avalanche said Zadorov \u2014 who was done for the night \u2014 had suffered a head injury, and Roy Saturday confirmed it was a concussion.\n\n\u201cI did\u2019t like the hit because to me it was a blind-side hit,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI think it was a head shot, should have been penalized. That\u2019s how I see it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve seen the replays and even the frozen-frame breakdowns, and the most honest thing I can say is I\u2019m not sure if Wilson, who had just come off the bench and skated straight to the contact with Zadorov behind the net, got him in the head or not. If you are certain, either way, good for you. Zadorov had his head down, that\u2019s undeniable, but it gets tiresome when that\u2019s used as an excuse for a cavalier hit.\n\nSo I\u2019m not taking a stand either way.\n\nBut I will add this: I\u2019d ask that anyone reacting vehemently, either way, apply the skate-on-the-other foot standard. In many years of covering hockey, I\u2019ve always been a bit amused by the 180 degree swings, so predictable depending on whose ox was gored.\n\nWhat would all be saying if it played out exactly the same, but it was a Cody McLeod hit on Matt Niskanen?\n\nMany of the same Caps fans dismissing the Wilson hit today \u2014 and note, I didn\u2019t say all \u2014 would be screaming about how irresponsible McLeod\u2019s hit was, how it should have been penalized, and how McLeod should be pleading his case with the Department of Player Safety today.\n\nAnd many of the Avs fans decrying the Wilson hit today \u2014 and note, I didn\u2019t say all \u2014 would be saying, geez, Niskanen had his head down, the Zapruder Film proves that it wasn\u2019t a head hit, and what do you want to do, put these guys in skirts?\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Avalanche", "description": "Patrick", "title": "Patrick Roy unloads -- a bit -- after Saturday practice", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2016/04/02/patrick-roy-unloads-bit-saturday-practice/23332/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/01/DucheneRoy-495x344.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Patrick", "title": "Patrick Roy unloads \u2014 a bit \u2014 after Saturday practice", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/2016/04/02/patrick-roy-unloads-bit-saturday-practice/23332/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/avs/files/2015/01/DucheneRoy-495x344.jpg", "creator": "@TFrei", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado Avalanche,Nikita Zadorov,Patriick Roy"}, "article_summary": "How I\u2019m going to do it, I guess I\u2019m going to have to figure out.\n\u201cI did\u2019t like the hit because to me it was a blind-side hit,\u201d Roy said.\nI\u2019m not going to go into the number, I\u2019m going to let you watch the game and tell me the next day how many you had.\n\u201cHe took the time to praise their players for what they\u2019ve been doing for 54 games,\u201d Roy said.\nZadorov had his head down, that\u2019s undeniable, but it gets tiresome when that\u2019s used as an excuse for a cavalier hit."}
