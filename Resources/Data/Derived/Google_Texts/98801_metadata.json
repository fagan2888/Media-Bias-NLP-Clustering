But he defended the law overall, and pointed to a big increase in enrollment in the exchanges this month as evidence of his efforts to turn things around.\n\nHis remarks came after the administration responded last night to the problem of canceled insurance policies with a special exception. Those affected can buy cheaper, bare-bones catastrophic coverage if new plans are more expensive.\n\nMary Agnes Carey watching all this for Kaiser Health News, an independent news organization.\n\n57546 56796 56796 Health coverage deadlines changed to prevent insurance gaps The Obama administration announced some changes to the health care law implementation. Payment extensions have been offered, as well as special temporary coverage for seriously ill people with pre-existing conditions. Jeffrey Brown talks to Alex Wayne of Bloomberg News about efforts to prevent coverage gaps and spur enrollment. disabled hide Related Video\n\nWelcome back to the program.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY, Kaiser Health News: Thank you.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So what exactly did the administration announce last night?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: What they said is for these folks in the individual market who may have had their policies canceled \u2014 we\u2019re not sure exactly how many have had that. The estimates are maybe three to four million.\n\nIf they have not been able to find a policy that they think is affordable, they can qualify for something called the hardship exemption in the health law. Typically, this is for some sort of event, like you\u2019re homeless or you have been evicted in the last six months, that sort of hardship. But they\u2019re saying that by qualifying for the hardship exemption, there\u2019s two things.\n\nNumber one, they won\u2019t face the individual mandate penalty in 2014, and they would be allowed to buy something called a catastrophic health care policy, which is usually just open to people under the age of 30.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So they have made some significant changes. Why did they do this?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: They received a letter from a handful of lawmakers and senators that were \u2014 the letter was written by Mark Warner and signed by some other senators. And he\u2019s a Democrat of Virginia. And they were saying that, in their states, some of the people that had had their policies canceled were having a hard time finding coverage that was affordable to them.\n\nAnd they looked at this catastrophic issue and they looked at the hardship exemption and said, perhaps that could help their constituents. They wrote to Kathleen Sebelius, who is head of the Department of Health and Human Services. And she wrote back and agreed with them.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, how many people, Mary Agnes, are affected by this?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, the individual market overall \u2014 now, here, we\u2019re talking about people who buy their own health insurance coverage. That\u2019s about 5 percent of the covered market, about 15 million people.\n\nThe estimates are that between three to four million had their policies canceled. Now, many of those people have purchased other coverage on the market. So the question is how many people apply? How many people does this particular announcement cover? The administration has said it\u2019s about 500,000 people that they estimate haven\u2019t been able to find affordable coverage, and that\u2019s who they are thinking about in this particular action.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So is that a number everyone generally accepts then?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: No, it is not.\n\nAnd it\u2019s unclear. As we saw throughout the implementation of health care, there\u2019s all sorts of sets of numbers. This is an estimate, but others have questioned it, have wondered what the true number is. I don\u2019t think we actually really know.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the insurance companies, this was a surprise to them, right?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: It was a surprise to them.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: How do they respond? What are they saying?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: They think it\u2019s going to add further problems to the health insurance market, could in their words it cause significant instability in the marketplace, and lead to further disruption and confusion for customers.\n\nYou have to remember that as the insurance companies price their products for 2014, they assumed these in the individual market would go into the marketplace, they would buy a range of plans. That\u2019s how \u2014 what we call the risk pool. And so this may have some impact there. And they have been generally upset with some of these last-minute announcements from the administration\u2019s implementation of the law.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: So do they just accept this, or do they change their policies? What happens? I mean, do they just automatically go along with what the administration says?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, the administration has said that people can qualify for the catastrophic plans.\n\nBut people could still decide \u2014 they might look at a catastrophic plan and decide, this isn\u2019t really the coverage I want. And they might decide to try to qualify for a subsidy. They might go in \u2014 they may or may not qualify for the Medicaid expansion. So there are other options for individuals. And it is unclear exactly what they\u2019re going to do.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Mary Agnes, if you step back and look at the whole health care, the structure of health care reform, does this affect that? Does it \u2014 do the marketplaces work? Do the economics of it work with \u2014 when you take this change and all the other changes the administration has made?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, talk about this change.\n\nIf, in fact, it is a group of people around 500,000, how much of an impact would that make when the expectation is that seven million people would get coverage in the exchanges, and another separate group, I think around seven million, get coverage in Medicaid?\n\nSo it\u2019s sort of unclear exactly to know how this particular change will affect them. But delays in the employer mandate, for example, this requirement that most employers 50 \u2014 who have 50 or more workers provide coverage for their workers, that was delayed a year. There are other delays that have changed. So we have to watch and see how it shapes the market.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: And what about what insurance companies do in terms of pricing policy? Can they still rates their prices to get more if they think they\u2019re not going to make as much?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, they have made bids currently for the year of 2014, but the question, how does all this affect coverage in 2015? Who signs up for coverage? What is the mix, how many healthy people, how many sick people? What are the other demographics? And those will all affect pricing for 2015.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right, another bigger-picture question, the president was repeatedly asked today about health care, the problems, he acknowledged big problems with the rollout, he said \u2014 in essence, he acknowledged the biggest mistake of the past year.\n\nBut he kept coming back to what he said was the fact that many people are being helped. I think he said most people are going to be better off as a result of health care reform. Is there a way to measure that?\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: I think that people will ultimately measure it for themselves.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re not part of the individual market. He talked about the 85 percent of us that get our health insurance through work. We have preventive services at no out-of-pocket costs. Seniors are getting help with prescription drugs and Medicare. The cost of prescription drugs\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned that.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Yes, adult children up to 26 being covered by their parent\u2019s plan until they turn 26. How do you judge that individually as the consumer? Does it matter to you, for example?\n\nI think that people have to have an experience with this health law to make their own decision.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Because the squawking is clearly coming from the people who lost their policies, people who are \u2014 don\u2019t like the idea of having to pay a penalty. Some of these other so-called benefits that the president was citing may be things people aren\u2019t even aware of.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Well, that\u2019s the other thing.\n\nAnd there are people that say this is great that you are adding all these mandatory services to be covered, but I don\u2019t want them and I don\u2019t want to pay for them, and it\u2019s not affordable to me. I liked my old plan. I wanted to keep it. You in fact said, President, that I could keep it.\n\nBut, as we know, the president has apologized for that. And, again, the experiences will vary for people.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Mary Agnes Carey joining us once again, thank you.\n\nMARY AGNES CAREY: Sure.
