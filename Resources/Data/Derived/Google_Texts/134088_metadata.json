The women are among thousands across the country who have sued Takeda.\n\nTestimony resumed Monday after a two-week break. Cipriano\u2019s attorney, Robert Eglet, has said he plans to seek a multibillion-dollar verdict, the largest ever awarded in Nevada.\n\nMeanwhile, a federal trial involving hundreds of cases is being heard in Louisiana. A jury on Monday awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages, according to Bloomberg. The jury will also consider a request for punitive damages.\n\nWhat the drug company mentioned about carcinogenics in Actos essentially amounted to an \u201canti-warning,\u201d Cunitz said.\n\nCunitz read through a series of Actos package insert warnings dating back to 1999, when the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, and found \u201cthere was no warning provided, matching any of the criteria we have. It wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nCunitz testified under the assumption that prolonged use of Actos could lead to bladder cancer, and said \u201cyou don\u2019t have to have perfectly established science to provide a warning about a potential risk.\u201d\n\nHe said a drug company should issue warnings as soon as there is \u201ca suspicion of harm.\u201d\n\nIn a 2003 email read in court, Takeda executives acknowledged that altering its warning sheet could have \u201can impact on sales\u201d and it \u201cwould be relatively easy for the competition to establish seeds of doubt. Takeda representatives would have difficulty managing these safety concerns.\u201d\n\nThe FDA announced in 2011 that taking the diabetes drug for more than one year could be linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. In July of that year, Takeda altered its warning labels to reflect the cancer danger.\n\nTriana took Actos for two years, between 2005 and 2007, and Cipriano took it for 14 months before the drug maker mentioned the cancer risk in package warnings.\n\nThey were both diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2012, and both have had multiple surgeries to remove bladder tumors, according to their attorneys.\n\nCunitz said the women could not have protected themselves from the risks of the drug because \u201cinformation about bladder cancer was not presented in a way to attract attention to itself.\u201d\n\nCunitz told jurors that drug label warnings should attract attention to themselves, be delivered in a timely manner and provide an instruction to avoid harm.\n\n\u201cThese warnings were not presented and information about bladder cancer was not presented in a way to attract attention to itself,\u201d Cunitz said. \u201cThere was no adequate and effective warning.\u201d\n\nOn cross examination, Cunitz acknowledged that he had never spoken to doctors who prescribed Actos to the women.\n\nCunitz has not worked for a pharmaceutical company or written a drug-label warning himself.\n\nDefense attorneys earlier in the day filed a motion for a mistrial based on a Review-Journal weekend story about judiciary races that referred to Eglet and Earley and mentioned the Actos trial.\n\nEarley said she had not read the article and planned to rule on the motion Wednesday.\n\nThe trial is slated to resume at 11 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nContact reporter David Ferrara at dferrara@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5290.
