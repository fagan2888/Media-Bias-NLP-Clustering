Subjects were asked either to exercise, listen to music or do both.

Making sure you get enough magnesium in your diet could help protect against stroke and fatal coronary heart disease, researchers wrote.

The study, published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, followed 201 African American men and women who had been diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Half were taught to meditate and half attended diet and exercise classes.
