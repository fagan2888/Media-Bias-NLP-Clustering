A federal judge has ended the legal fight over a silicon metal plant being built in northeast Mississippi.

Plaintiffs argued that Mississippi Silicon's air pollution permit is faulty because Mississippi didn't allow a full 30 days for comment and didn't hold a public hearing. They argue there were 29 days at best to comment, and less time actually, because documents didn't arrive at the Burnsville library until later.

They also argue those materials didn't state the true level of Mississippi Silicon's pollution is expanding.

The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports U.S. District Judge Debra M. Brown dismissed the lawsuit Thursday and denied a request for an injunction to stop the project. Brown says plaintiffs failed to prove that Mississippi Silicon's permit to build the plant is invalid.
