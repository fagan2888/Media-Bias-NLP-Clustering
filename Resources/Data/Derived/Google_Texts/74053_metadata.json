Pro-lifers know it sometimes takes many repeated attempts to pass life-saving legislation. Recently, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) reminded Americans from the floor of the Senate just how many times it took to pass the landmark Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n\nBut the lives that law saved made it worth everything we did!\n\nThe same holds true for our work to defund Planned Parenthood. The scandals of this summer have exposed their abuses to the nation \u2013 and millions of Americans are saying they don\u2019t want their tax dollars to go to this abortion behemoth!\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\n\nDemocrats in the U.S. Senate, to their shame, have repeatedly filibustered and blocked us from even getting votes to end Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding and to end the anti-life abuses in Obamacare, but we haven\u2019t given up.\n\nAnd we never will!\n\nSo National Right to Life is strongly supporting and working to pass a new effort to cut about $400 million in Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding and repeal several odious provisions of Obamacare in H.R.3762 \u2013 the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n\nBudget reconciliation is a process Congress can use only on certain kinds of legislation. But the genius of this approach is that budget reconciliation is one of the few procedures where senators in opposition cannot filibuster to block a bill. They have to allow a vote!\n\nThat means a bill can be passed with the support of a majority of senators \u2013 51votes \u2013 instead of the 60 votes needed to stop a bill-killing filibuster.\n\nAnd that would make it much harder for pro-abortion Democrats in the Senate to kill our efforts to pass legislation to cut funding to Planned Parenthood!\n\nThe budget reconciliation process is not a slam-dunk, but getting the bill through Congress is doable! We\u2019re working hard to make our support known to members of Congress and to win their votes.\n\nBut we need to do more!\n\nFirst, we need all pro-lifers to contact their representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives to urge them to vote for H.R. 3762, as this bill would save many, many lives if enacted. You can email your representative and senators by clicking here \u2013 then you just enter your address, and in a minute or less you can send an appropriate email to your representative in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIf we pass this bill in the House, that\u2019s just our first step, though. We also need to pass it in the Senate, with the 51-vote threshold.\n\nSo we need your help to communicate with grassroots pro-lifers all across America, to get them to flood their senators\u2019 and House members\u2019 offices with calls, letters, and emails demanding we pass a budget reconciliation bill that cuts Planned Parenthood\u2019s funds and significantly rolls back Obamacare!\n\nLifeNews Note: Carol Tobias is the president of the National Right to Life Committee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ACTION: Contact the House to Vote Tomorrow to De-Fund Planned Parenthood", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "We never quit!
