On Thursday night\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d Stephen Colbert noted that the crisis is all anyone is talking about.\n\n\u201cWhether or not to let Syrian refugees into this country has become the new political issue, completely overshadowing the old political issue, whether to let Mexicans into this country,\u201d Colbert said, a little too on the nose.\n\nBut Donald Trump says that Syrians are not going to want to come here anyway. Right now the United States is entering winter while Syrian refugees are probably more accustomed to higher temperatures. Trump wants to know why the hell they\u2019d come to Minnesota where it\u2019s under 40 degrees.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough call for refugees,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cDo I want to stay in a war zone where my family faces almost certain death or do I want to go somewhere where I have to put on a jacket before I go to the mall? I mean you\u2019re walkin\u2019 around, you\u2019re carrying your coat. You get all sweaty. You go outside and forget to put it on and then you get a cold. I\u2019ll take my chances with ISIS.\u201d\n\nColbert played the clip of President Obama mocking GOP candidates for president who he said was first afraid of debate moderators and now are afraid of women and orphans. He might make a good point, but \u201cwhy shouldn\u2019t we be scared of three-year-olds? You think you can\u2019t negotiate with terrorists? Try negotiating with a three-year-old.\u201d\n\nBut there are a few candidates (Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush) who think that allowing Christian refugees into the country is fine. Cruz went on to say \u201cthere is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After all, the Statue of Liberty says \"Give us your tired, your poor, your mostly Christians...\" VIDEO", "title": "Stephen Colbert just nailed the GOP\u2019s Christian hypocrisy on Syrian refugees with one Bible verse", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "After all, the Statue of Liberty says \"Give us your tired, your poor, your mostly Christians...\" VIDEO", "title": "Stephen Colbert just nailed the GOP\u2019s Christian hypocrisy on Syrian refugees with one Bible verse", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/20/stephen_colbert_just_nailed_the_gops_christian_hypocrisy_on_syrian_refugees_with_one_bible_verse/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/colbert1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After all, the Statue of Liberty says \"Give us your tired, your poor, your mostly Christians...\" VIDEO", "title": "Stephen Colbert just nailed the GOP\u2019s Christian hypocrisy on Syrian refugees with one Bible verse", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/colbert1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Burris", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, christian faith, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, isis, KKK, late show with stephen colbert, Stephen Colbert, syrian refugee crisis, Syrian refugees, Ted Cruz, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Thursday night\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d Stephen Colbert noted that the crisis is all anyone is talking about.\nRight now the United States is entering winter while Syrian refugees are probably more accustomed to higher temperatures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough call for refugees,\u201d Colbert said.\nTopics: aol_on, christian faith, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, isis, KKK, late show with stephen colbert, Stephen Colbert, syrian refugee crisis, Syrian refugees, Ted Cruz, Video, Elections News, News, Politics NewsThe object of terrorism is to provoke fear and that\u2019s exactly what ISIS has successfully done to leaders across the United States who now are denying humanitarian assistance to Syrian refugees.\n\u201cWhether or not to let Syrian refugees into this country has become the new political issue, completely overshadowing the old political issue, whether to let Mexicans into this country,\u201d Colbert said, a little too on the nose."}
