We need to have a common understanding of where we are and what we can do better.\u201d\n\nIn fact, hospitals in Iowa and across the country are working to improve the quality of care patients receive, cutting down on hospital-associated conditions, such as surgical-site infections, and improving readmission rates.\n\nAbout 50,000 fewer patients nationwide died in hospitals and about $12 billion in health care costs were saved as a result of a reduction in hospital-acquired conditions from 2010 to 2013, according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report released last week.\n\nIn 2013 alone, almost 35,000 fewer patients died in hospitals, and there were about 800,000 fewer incidents of harm having occurred \u2014 saving $8 billion \u2014 the report found.\n\nHospital-acquired conditions can include adverse drug events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associated bloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and surgical-site infections, among others.\n\nHospitals throughout the country are working to reduce these adverse events, in part due the Affordable Care Act, which created Medicare payment incentives to improve the quality of care, and through the Partnership for Patients initiative.\n\nThe Health Department began the Partnership for Patients initiative in 2012 to make health care safer and less costly through reducing preventable injuries and complications. It set a goal of reducing readmissions by 20 percent and bringing down preventable harm by 40 percent by 2014.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services then created a nationwide public-private collaboration, awarding 27 contracts to these partnerships \u2014 called Hospital Engagement Networks \u2014 to identify improvements and solutions.\n\nBest practices in Iowa\n\nIowa\u2019s Hospital Engagement Network, the Iowa Healthcare Collaborative, has 100 percent hospitals participation.\n\nThe 128 participating Iowa hospitals prevented harm to more than 4,300 patients in 2013 and reduced health care costs by more than $51 million, according to health care collaborative.\n\n\u201cWe asked every hospital to build a work plan and develop their own strategy,\u201d said Evans, its CEO. \u201cThey then had to measure how they\u2019re doing on a monthly basis.\u201d\n\nEvans said the state\u2019s hospitals have worked to reduce adverse drug events by 99.9 percent, early elective baby deliveries by 95 percent, and pressure ulcers by 85 percent.\n\nCorridor hospitals have worked diligently over the past few years to improve metrics, administrators said, mainly by studying and implementing best practices.\n\n\u201cWe look at what\u2019s been tried and what\u2019s been successful,\u201d said Dr. Mark Valliere, Mercy Medical Center\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cThen we see what\u2019s doable and what has a favorable outcome.\u201d\n\nVentilator-associated pneumonia rates have dropped over the years at both Mercy and UnityPoint Health-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. Ventilator-associated pneumonia, a lung infection, develops in someone who is on a ventilator for breathing assistance.\n\nMercy\u2019s rate has fallen from 6.51 per 1,000 ventilator days in 2010 to 1.250 per 1,000 days in 2012. It had a rate of zero through September 2013. St. Luke\u2019s has had a rate of zero for the past three years.\n\nMary Ann Osborn, St. Luke\u2019s regional senior vice president chief care coordination officer said the hospital has implemented strategies from the Institute of Healthcare Improvement, which include elevating patients\u2019 heads, improving their oral care, and making sure they are digesting food properly.\n\nOsborn said while these tasks seem simple, they are easily missed because health care professionals caring for a patient have \u201cmultiple priorities\u201d at once.\n\nTo deal with this, the hospital has built these practices into order sets and established multidisciplinary rounds, which are physician led but include the patient\u2019s health care team \u2014 nurses, social workers, pharmacists, and therapists.\n\n\u201cThey do their rounds every morning, a lot of times the family is present,\u201d Osborn said. \u201cThey find it hugely satisfying because they can ask questions and know what the plan is.\u201d\n\nBoth hospitals also have worked to improve readmissions rates. Mercy met national benchmarks for readmissions in all categories, and performed better than the national average of readmissions after hip or knee surgery, according to the hospital\u2019s 2014 quality report.\n\nMeanwhile, St. Luke\u2019s has a readmissions rate of 10.1 percent, compared with a national rate of 17.7 percent, Osborne said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one silver bullet to improve readmissions rates,\u201d she said, attributing its success to post-acute care, the hospital\u2019s home-care team, and new intervention practices put into place, including its teach-back program that involves patients repeating treatment and information back to their physicians.\n\nMercy\u2019s Valliere agreed, saying the hospital continues to implement new practices over time.\n\n\u201cWe keep scanning the literature,\u201d he said, \u201cand we keep driving it down, getting it lower and lower and lower.\u201d\n\nThis helps the hospital save but more importantly, it ensures that patients don\u2019t leave sicker than when they arrived.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re coming into the hospital for a knee or hip replacement, you\u2019re not planning of getting an infection and being in the hospital for 10 days instead of two days,\u201d Valliere said.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | Bad things can happen at hospitals, admits Tom Evans, chief executive officer of the Iowa Healthcare Collaborative.", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "Bad things can happen at hospitals, admits Tom Evans, chief executive officer of the Iowa Healthcare Collaborative.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/the-partnership-for-patients-began-initiative-in-2012-to-help-reduce-preventable-injuries-and-complications-20141209", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20141209/ARTICLE/141209688/EP/1/3/EP-141209688.jpg", "article": {"section": "News"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/the-partnership-for-patients-began-initiative-in-2012-to-help-reduce-preventable-injuries-and-complications-20141209", "description": "Bad things can happen at hospitals, admits Tom Evans, chief executive officer of the Iowa Healthcare Collaborative.", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Corridor hospitals part of statewide initiative to boost quality of care"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2014-12-09T08:21:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_news", "pubDate": "2014-12-09T00:01:00-05:00", "title": "Corridor hospitals part of statewide initiative to boost quality of care"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca336\"", "article_summary": "The 128 participating Iowa hospitals prevented harm to more than 4,300 patients in 2013 and reduced health care costs by more than $51 million, according to health care collaborative.\nThe Health Department began the Partnership for Patients initiative in 2012 to make health care safer and less costly through reducing preventable injuries and complications.\nOsborn said while these tasks seem simple, they are easily missed because health care professionals caring for a patient have \u201cmultiple priorities\u201d at once.\nMeanwhile, St. Luke\u2019s has a readmissions rate of 10.1 percent, compared with a national rate of 17.7 percent, Osborne said.\n\u201cThey find it hugely satisfying because they can ask questions and know what the plan is.\u201dBoth hospitals also have worked to improve readmissions rates."}
