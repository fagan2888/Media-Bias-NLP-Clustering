Three people have been charged in an illegal hash oil production that caused an explosion in April.

Matthew Ackerman, 24, Danielle Cordova, 20, and Paul Mannaioni, 24, are each charged with processing or manufacturing marijuana concentrate, the Denver district attorney’s office announced Thursday.

The three are accused of extracting hash oil April 23 in a warehouse on the 1200 block of Lipan Street, the DA’s office said in a news release. The extraction process caused an explosion. All three have been released from custody on bail, and are due in July in Denver County Court to be advised of the charges. Colorado authorities have reported a rise in hash oil explosions this year.
