Hamilton.\n\nThe gift, to be formally announced Monday, will triple DAM\u2019s holdings from the era and give the museum its first pieces by Vincent van Gogh, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Gustave Caillebotte and other crucial late 19th century figures late 19th century art.\n\nThe donation, which has not been formally appraised, could be worth as much as $100 million.\n\n\u201cThis is a game-changing gift,\u201d said DAM director Christoph Heinrich, and perhaps the largest in DAM\u2019s 120-year history. \u201cWe will have the biggest collection in the West of Impressionist art.\u201d\n\nThe 22 landscapes, including works by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro and Edouard Manet, are currently on loan to the museum and part of its \u201cPassport to Paris\u201d exhibits. The works will remain on display through Feb. 9, when they are returned to their owner. The museum will take possession officially when he dies.\n\nHamilton, 85, has been a long-time benefactor of DAM and served on its board of trustees for nearly three decades, much of that as chairman. In 2006, he gave $20 million toward a 146,000-square-foot addition, designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and named the Frederic C. Hamilton Building\n\n\u201cFrankly, our museum is derelict in one significant area, and that is Impressionism,\u201d Hamilton said last week. \u201cI think this will be a big deal for the people of Colorado.\u201d\n\nHamilton made his fortune in the oil business. He and his late brother, Ferris, launched Hamilton Brothers Drilling in 1950 and morphed it into a broad energy company with international operations.\n\nHe began collecting art four decades ago, taking advice from friend Charles S. Moffett, now a vice chairman at Sotheby\u2019s auction house in New York.\n\nHamilton picked up pieces as they came available from private dealers and public sales. He purchased van Gogh\u2019s \u201cEdge of a Wheat Field with Poppies\u201d at an auction because \u201cit fit the right size in terms of where I wanted to put it in the house.\u201d\n\nEventually, the collection grew to include examples of all the major names.\n\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary grouping of works by the greatest artists of France,\u201d said Earl A. \u201cRusty\u201d Powell III, director of the National Gallery of Artin Washington, D.C., who has seen the paintings during visits to Hamilton\u2019s Denver home.\n\n\u201cIt would be a big deal for any museum to get.\u201d\n\nDAM got it through two years of lobbying on the part of Heinrich. Hamilton and his wife, Jane, have four children, and he planned to pass on his collection to his heirs.\n\n\u201cThere was a strong constituency in my family that was looking forward eagerly to those pictures,\u201d he said.\n\nHamilton began to change his mind after Heinrich wrote him a letter making a case for a donation.\n\n\u201cHe waxed poetic and got carried away,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nIt was convincing enough that Hamilton approached his family to consider giving up the collection to the institution he long served.\n\nFrom there, Hamilton, who is an avid hunter, joked that Heinrich was \u201clike a dog chasing a rabbit.\u201d\n\nThe final capture came when Hamilton agreed to lend his collection to DAM for the current show. Crowds have lined up, and that convinced Hamilton the move was right\n\n\u201cHe was very private with his collection,\u201d said Heinrich. \u201cOnly a few friends really knew about it.\u201d\n\nThe Hamilton paintings make a neat complement to DAM\u2019s own works, telling a more complete history of Impressionism. For example, DAM already had an early example of Pissarro\u2019s work, a mostly formal, 1867 landscape called \u201cThe Banks of the Oise near Pontoise. \u201d But the addition of Hamilton\u2019s 1900 \u201cSpring at Eragny,\u201d with its loose brush strokes and fluid form, tracks how painting took on a new personality as artists found a freer voice.\n\nThe gift could fundamentally change a visit to DAM, with the museum potentially giving over an entire portion of its space for French work. It also changes DAM\u2019s collecting habits. A museum best known for its contemporary, Native American an Western art now has the responsibility \u2014 and possibility \u2014 of turning its fledgling Impressionism holdings into a world-class collection.\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s a huge commitment for us to see what\u2019s missing and continue that collection,\u201d Heinrich said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "boudin,C\u00e9zanne,Denver Art Musuem,Fred Hamilton,Frederic Hamilton,impressionism,Nature as Muse,passport to paris. chrisoph heinrich,pissarro,Ray Mark Rinaldi,ray rinaldu,Van Gogh", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/2014/01/12/denver-art-museum-gets-100-million-gift-of-impressionist-paintings/10944/", "site_name": "Artmosphere", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/files/2014/01/rsz_1cezanne_paul-_a_painter_at_work.jpg", "type": "blog", "title": "Denver Art Museum gets $100 million gift of Impressionist paintings"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Denver Art Museum gets $100 million gift of Impressionist paintings", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/2014/01/12/denver-art-museum-gets-100-million-gift-of-impressionist-paintings/10944/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/artmosphere/files/2014/01/rsz_1cezanne_paul-_a_painter_at_work.jpg", "creator": "@rayrinaldi", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Denver Art Museum gets $100 million gift of Impressionist paintings"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNow, there\u2019s a huge commitment for us to see what\u2019s missing and continue that collection,\u201d Heinrich said.\n\u201cThis is a game-changing gift,\u201d said DAM director Christoph Heinrich, and perhaps the largest in DAM\u2019s 120-year history.\nThe gift could fundamentally change a visit to DAM, with the museum potentially giving over an entire portion of its space for French work.\nThe Denver Art Museum will acquire 22 masterworks by the most revered names in French Impressionism through a bequest from Colorado collector and philanthropist Frederic C.
