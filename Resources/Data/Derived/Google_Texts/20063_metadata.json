Last week, Fox News talking head Sean Hannity set out to show just how badly the Affordable Care Act was hurting ordinary Americans, introducing us to six of them \u2014 three couples \u2014 with stories to tell.\n\nAnd tell they did. But the problem was, much of what they had to say was inaccurate, inconsistent and at times just flat out wrong.\n\nWriter Eric Stern tells what happened when he fact-checked their claims. Spoiler alert \u2014 had they even tried a health exchange to see how they\u2019d fare, Hannity\u2019s guests would have learned that with an ACA health insurance policy, their coverage would be cheaper and better.\n\nFor the facts about health insurance under the ACA and to get an estimate of how much you\u2019d pay for a policy, visit this helpful Kaiser Family Foundation website.\n\nParents and kids\n\nSpeaking of misconceptions, \u201cenough with the standardized testing,\u201d said nearly 80 percent of parents at one New York City K-2 elementary school who opted out of having their children take a required test\u2013 forcing the school to cancel it.\n\nMany experts now say that continuous testing only promotes rote learning at the expense of other skills \u2014 like learning how to think.\n\nAnd four-year-olds just don\u2019t need the stress, one mother said.\n\nWhat they do need, says writer and digital media guru Bill Jensen, are better playgrounds.\n\nPlaygrounds can be a veritable lab for socialization and creativity \u2014 skills most children (and plenty of adults, for that matter) need to refine.\n\nBut over the years, we\u2019ve allowed them \u2014 like tests \u2014 to become safe and standardized, Jensen says. As he tells writer Celeste Hamilton Dennis in this IdealistBlog piece:\n\nBack in the 60s, our playground crafters took a cue from Europe\u2019s and designed spaces unafraid to venture beyond the traditional four S\u2019s: slide, seesaw, swing, and sandbox. We had giant rocket ships, hinged robots, fabulous circus wagons, and more\u2014with all sorts of frills and thrills. But they were too high. And too rough. Kids fell and broke bones. And got splinters. So we sued. Downsized. And in the process, Billy argues, stunted kids\u2019 imaginations and contributed to the nation\u2019s growing childhood obesity problem.\n\nJensen has launched Epic Playgrounds, a nonprofit that aims \u201cto get kids ages eight through twelve excited about being outside again, before they start doing all those things you see on after school specials.\u201d\n\nOld and new\n\nAnd speaking of playgrounds, if you\u2019ve been in Washington, D.C. lately, you may have walked past the U.S. Supreme Court building looking like someone had attached a jungle-gym to its exterior.\n\nNo, that structure was not for justices at play, but rather served as the scaffolding for a needed facelift. Much of the exterior had been surrounded by protective netting since November 2005, when about 80 pounds of marble fell from exterior molding to a plaza below.\n\nCleaning and repairing the marble facade began in May 2012, and all scaffolding is scheduled to be removed by this November.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca8bc\"", "article_summary": "But the problem was, much of what they had to say was inaccurate, inconsistent and at times just flat out wrong.\nNo, that structure was not for justices at play, but rather served as the scaffolding for a needed facelift.\nCleaning and repairing the marble facade began in May 2012, and all scaffolding is scheduled to be removed by this November.\nWhat they do need, says writer and digital media guru Bill Jensen, are better playgrounds.\nMany experts now say that continuous testing only promotes rote learning at the expense of other skills \u2014 like learning how to think."}
