Some students at the women\u2019s liberal arts school are reportedly furious that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been invited to deliver the graduation address since she\u2019s a \u201cwhite feminist,\u201d according to National Review\u2019s Kat Timpf.\n\nTimpf wrote that Kinzie Mabon wrote about her discontent with the commencement selection in the student newspaper, though noted that she has a legitimate criticism regarding Albright\u2019s rather inflammatory remarks that women who do not support Clinton have a \u201cspecial place in hell;\u201d Mabon isn\u2019t a fan of the former first lady.\n\nStill, the Claremont Independent, another student paper that covers the Claremont Colleges system, wrote that most of the controversy is all centered on Albright being \u201cwhite.\u201d\n\nIt was announced recently that the 2016 commencement speaker will be none other than former Secretary of State, white feminist and repeated genocide enabler Madeleine Albright,\u201d senior Kinzie Mabon wrote in a piece for the Student Life, the school\u2019s official newspaper. That\u2019s right. Albright may have been the first female Secretary of State, but that doesn\u2019t matter! She\u2019s also white \u2014 something so awful that it automatically makes her an unacceptable choice. [\u2026] According to an article in the Claremont Independent, however, much of the objection to Albright\u2019s selection was specifically due to \u201cthe fact that Albright is white.\u201d\n\nAre we getting to the point where any commencement speaker is bound to draw uproar? The notion that the mere presence of someone with differing views is akin to an act of violence is absurd, will always be absurd, and these kids are about to get what could only be described as a brick to the face once they realize that this country actually has tens of millions of people who think their progressive dispositions are utter garbage (they\u2019re not wrong). Frankly, it\u2019s hard to take anyone who freaks out about Trump chalkings seriously. Madeleine Albright is liberal, a Democrat, and a Clinton supporter. That\u2019s fine. Her political views aside, she has served our country and made history by being the first female secretary of state. She\u2019s been invited and folks should listen, even if they vociferously disagree. Why? It\u2019s because this isn\u2019t North Korea\u2013and we shouldn\u2019t act like seven-year-olds. It\u2019s commencement, kids. This speech isn\u2019t the highlight of the day. You graduating college, celebrating with your friends and family, and entering the real world should be the moments you cherish, not debating about \u201cwhite feminists\u201d and the Balkan intervention that occurred under the Clinton administration.\n\nAre you kidding me?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Commencement Wars .05/27/2016 9:08:13AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Commencement Wars", "title": "Scripps College Students Mad That 'White Feminist' Madeleine Albright Is Commencement Speaker", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/05/scripps-college-students-made-that-white-feminist-madeleine-albright-is-commencement-speaker-n2143558", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/43/2015-02-12T110608Z_1_LYNXMPEB1B0HB_RTROPTP_3_USA-POLITICS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Commencement Wars", "title": "Scripps College Students Mad That 'White Feminist' Madeleine Albright Is Commencement Speaker", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/04/05/scripps-college-students-made-that-white-feminist-madeleine-albright-is-commencement-speaker-n2143558", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/43/2015-02-12T110608Z_1_LYNXMPEB1B0HB_RTROPTP_3_USA-POLITICS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Scripps College Students Mad That 'White Feminist' Madeleine Albright Is Commencement Speaker , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Well, it looks like at Scripps College, the commencement speaker wars have begun.\nMadeleine Albright is liberal, a Democrat, and a Clinton supporter.\nSome students at the women\u2019s liberal arts school are reportedly furious that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has been invited to deliver the graduation address since she\u2019s a \u201cwhite feminist,\u201d according to National Review\u2019s Kat Timpf.\nHer political views aside, she has served our country and made history by being the first female secretary of state.\nShe\u2019s also white \u2014 something so awful that it automatically makes her an unacceptable choice."}
