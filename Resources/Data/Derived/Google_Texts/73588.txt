TIPS ON DECLUTTERING

Even if you’re not a hoarder or finder-keeper, it can be challenging to declutter. Carolyn Quinn has these tips to shrink your piles of stuff:

Separate items into three piles: Keep, recycle or donate, and trash. Quinn said organizing things into what you need versus what is cluttering your home can help.

If you’re not sure if you want to keep a certain item or not, have a friend or family member take it for a week. Quinn said if you can live without it for a week, it can leave the home.

Have a buddy. Quinn said she encourages members of the group to touch base with each other on occasion, in case someone misses a workshop or generally needs a friend.

It all starts with one room. Quinn said some of the members of the “Buried in Treasures” group tackle one room or area of the home. For some, it’s the bedroom. For others, it’s the hallway or another point of access. Concentrating on one area can make the decluttering process more manageable.

Don’t be discouraged by slow progress, particularly if you have a lot to declutter. Quinn said one group member said she tackles her clutter “one yard at a time.”
