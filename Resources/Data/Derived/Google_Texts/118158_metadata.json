Jessa Duggar said that while her brother\u2019s actions were \u201cnot permissable,\u201d that he was not a child molester or a pedophile. Jill Duggar said they were speaking out to set the record straight. And both were critical of tabloid media coverage and angry about the invasion of their privacy.\n\nHere are the seven most crucial exchanges \u2014 six between the Duggar sisters and Kelly, and then one from Fox\u2019s post-interview analysis with \u201cmedia critic\u201d Howard Kurtz.\n\n1. Josh was \u201ca little too curious about girls\u201d\n\nMEGYN KELLY: You are going on the record as being two of Josh\u2019s victims. JILL DUGGAR DILLARD: Uhm. KELLY: It feels strange to you, that word? DILLARD: You know, I think we didn\u2019t choose to come out and tell our story. This wouldn\u2019t have been our first choice. But now that the story has been brought about, we really feel like as we\u2019ve been seeing these headlines, as we\u2019ve been seeing things that people are saying about our family, we feel like as victims we have to come out and speak. This is something like we chose to do. Nobody asked us to do this. Jessa and I were talking and we were like, oh, my goodness, most of the stuff out there is lies, it\u2019s not true. And so for truth sake, we want to come out and set the record straight. KELLY: When I said, you know, \u201cvictims,\u201d you furrowed your brow a little bit. Do you feel like the victim of a molestation? JESSA DUGGAR SEEWALD: Well, I think in the case of what Josh did, it was very wrong. I\u2019m not going to justify anything he did or say it was okay. Not permissible. But I do want to speak up in his defense against people who are calling him a child molester or a pedophile or a rapist some people are saying. That is so overboard and a lie really. I mean, people will get mad at me for saying that but I\u2019m like I can say this. You know? I was one of the victims, so I can speak out and I can say this and set the record straight here. Like in Josh\u2019s case he was a boy, young boy in puberty and a little too curious about girls and that got him into some trouble. And he made some bad choices but really the extent of it was mild inappropriate touching on fully clothed victims. Most of it while girls were sleeping.\n\n2. \u201cHe\u2019s very subtle anyway \u2026 he was very sly\u201d\n\nKELLY: You said you were feeling angry. But do you get the chance to express that anger to him? Did you fight? SEEWALD: No. I think for us our situation is so different than most girls in that he was \u2014 he\u2019s very subtle anyway. Like he knew in his mind my actions are wrong and I have bad intentions but he was very sly, like the girls didn\u2019t catch on, you know. It was like, okay, if you catch the girl sleeping, you know, like a quick feel or whatever. Or it\u2019s like, you know, if you\u2019re just not really aware, you know, in the situation that happened when the girls were awake, it\u2019s like they weren\u2019t aware what was happening. It was very subtle. And so I think that for us it\u2019s like, okay, we realize this is serious \u2014 but at the same time it wasn\u2019t like a horror story or like this terrible thing. KELLY: That\u2019s one of the headline covers, \u201cHouse of Horrors.\u201d SEEWALD: Ridiculous. KELLY: That is not how you view it? SEEWALD: No. And I think my parents, they acted, I can see looking back as an adult, now they handled the situation very well. They set up safety guards in our house. And, you know, they sent Josh away.\n\n3. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do this hide and seek thing where two people go off and hide together\u201d\n\nKELLY: Did you feel scared at all that he might resume? DILLARD: You know, when this happened, when my dad and mom sat down with us and shared what happened and Josh asked us to forgive him, we had to make that choice that I think everyone has to make and my dad explained to us, he said you know there\u2019s a difference between forgiveness and trust. That\u2019s not the same thing. You know, you forgive someone and then you have boundaries. Forgiveness with boundaries and so trust comes later. You know, Josh destroyed that trust at the beginning, and so he had to rebuild that. And so I think when he came back, that was his \u2014 that was his point of, okay \u2014 well, actually, when he asked us to forgive him, that was the point of rebuilding. KELLY: That was the beginning. What were the safeguards that were put into place just to make sure? DILLARD: I was going to say not, you know, being alone. My parents said, okay, we\u2019re not going to do this hide and seek thing where two people go off and hide together \u2014 and not baby-sitting the girls. KELLY: At night in your room? DILLARD: Locks on the doors, you know, everybody\u2019s in bed, girls in the girls\u2019 room, boys in the boys\u2019 room. And so, yes. And as a mother now, I look back and I think, you know, my parents did such an amazing job. For me, even when we went through the DHS investigation, they complimented my parents on what an amazing job they did through that process. And so, I think not only taking the legal actions that they did and then going the extra mile and I see as a mom I hope that I can set the same safeguards in my family that they did and, you know, reaching the heart of their children. And not only trying to take care of Josh but us girls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kelly's interview with the sisters had a much different tone than Wednesday's with the Duggar parents.
