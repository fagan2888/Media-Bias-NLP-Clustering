For a quarter century or more, he and his brother Marco have led donkeys through the streets of Chile\u2019s capital, milking them on the spot for customers.\n\nIt\u2019s a rare job, but a very old one. The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended donkey\u2019s milk for some ailments, and at least some claim that Cleopatra bathed in it for her skin.\n\nThe use of donkey\u2019s milk has persisted in some parts of the world. Pope Francis has said he drank it as a boy in Argentina, prompting an Italian company that produces the milk to give him two donkeys recently.\n\nThe Alegrias sell shot-sized cups of the milk for about $2. A half-liter, the most they say a donkey produces in a day, goes for about $20.\n\nRicardo Alegria said the milk \u201cis taken as a vitamin jolt for babies with gastric problems,\u201d and researchers at the University of Camerino in Italy have reported it can be a good substitute for children with allergies to cow\u2019s milk. But adults often drink it, too.\n\nCarlos Aravena, 54, said he has been raising burros on the outskirts of Santiago and selling their milk as long as he can remember. His father did as well.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fresh donkey milk for sale on streets of Chile", "title": "Fresh donkey milk for sale on streets of Chile", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/25/fresh-donkey-milk-for-sale-on-streets-of-chile/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225__20141226_A23_ND26DONKEYp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141225__20141226_A23_ND26DONKEYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-25T19:04:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:52:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce758\"", "article_summary": "The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended donkey\u2019s milk for some ailments, and at least some claim that Cleopatra bathed in it for her skin.\nThe use of donkey\u2019s milk has persisted in some parts of the world.\nSANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 Ricardo Alegria is a different sort of milk man.\nCarlos Aravena, 54, said he has been raising burros on the outskirts of Santiago and selling their milk as long as he can remember.\nPope Francis has said he drank it as a boy in Argentina, prompting an Italian company that produces the milk to give him two donkeys recently."}
