As a gesture of goodwill to Republicans, that bill would have reinstated all of the Bush tax cuts for the first big chunk of everyone\u2019s income, but in return they\u2019d have to agree to rescind sequestration entirely, and partially offset the cost of all this new spending and tax cutting with a cap on tax expenditures for high earners.\n\nThe other (and a half) was that Obama should cut a deal of some kind before the New Year\u2019s \u201ccliff.\u201d Some of the people in this camp believed Obama should pocket the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for top earners and call it a day, fight sequestration separately (which is essentially what happened). Others, including Obama, believed the best option was to reach a big fiscal accord, built up from the baseline of higher taxes on rich people, from which he\u2019d agree to some entitlement cuts, Republicans would agree to close some tax loopholes, and the parties could put sequestration and budget brinkmanship behind them for years.\n\nThis is how a Democratic president ended up supporting a Social Security cut called Chained Consumer Price Index, which reduces spending by indexing benefits to a less generous measure of inflation. One of the White House\u2019s most poorly kept secrets is that many of Obama\u2019s economic advisers support Chained CPI on the merits, or believe it to be the least-bad benefit cut Obama could offer Republicans. It\u2019s how Chained CPI ended up in Obama\u2019s budget last year as a partial sequestration replacement. And if the metaphysics of conservative tax policy hadn\u2019t prohibited further budget wheeling and dealing between the White House and GOP, Republicans could\u2019ve pocketed a big win.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president dropping Chained CPI from his budget is a reprieve for the left -- and a message to the right", "title": "GOP\u2019s Social Security disaster: Conservatives just lost their chance to cut benefits", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The president dropping Chained CPI from his budget is a reprieve for the left -- and a message to the right", "title": "GOP\u2019s Social Security disaster: Conservatives just lost their chance to cut benefits", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/20/gops_social_security_disaster_how_conservatives_lost_their_chance_to_cut_benefits/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/boehner_paul_mcconnell.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The president dropping Chained CPI from his budget is a reprieve for the left -- and a message to the right", "title": "GOP\u2019s Social Security disaster: Conservatives just lost their chance to cut benefits", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/boehner_paul_mcconnell.jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Brian Beutler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Barack Obama, Bush Tax Cuts, Chained CPI, Editor's Picks, Entitlement cuts, Entitlement reform, Entitlements, Social Security, Tax cuts, Taxes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8418\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Barack Obama, Bush Tax Cuts, Chained CPI, Editor's Picks, Entitlement cuts, Entitlement reform, Entitlements, Social Security, Tax cuts, Taxes, Politics NewsBack in November 2012, with the Bush tax cuts scheduled to expire and sequestration looming, liberals were divided among two and a half significant schools of strategic thought.\nIt\u2019s how Chained CPI ended up in Obama\u2019s budget last year as a partial sequestration replacement.\nThis is how a Democratic president ended up supporting a Social Security cut called Chained Consumer Price Index, which reduces spending by indexing benefits to a less generous measure of inflation.\nOne (mine) was that President Obama should let all of the cuts expire, allow sequestration to kick in, then return from a restful Christmas break with an \u201cObama tax cut\u201d bill in hand.\nOne of the White House\u2019s most poorly kept secrets is that many of Obama\u2019s economic advisers support Chained CPI on the merits, or believe it to be the least-bad benefit cut Obama could offer Republicans."}
