Putting Story at No. 2 protects the rookie behind a base-stealer and in front of a slugger. Second baseman DJ LeMahieu hit eighth, where he excels at turning over a lineup. LeMahieu\u2019s .301 batting average and .358 on-base percentage led Colorado last season.\n\nLeft fielder Gerardo Parra hit fifth behind Nolan Arenado, followed by catcher Nick Hundley and first baseman Ben Paulsen.\n\nRockies bullpen update:\n\nThe Rockies\u2019 bullpen remains open. Chris Rusin, who made his first spring appearance Saturday after coming back from a finger injury, moved toward winning a job. He allowed four hits and one run on 32 pitches in 1 innings. He will pitch three more innings Tuesday.\n\nColorado\u2019s bullpen sets up with lefties Jake McGee and Boone Logan and right-handers Jason Motte, Chad Qualls, Jason Miller and Christian Bergman. Jon Gray is injured, so the Rockies may need Bergman as a fifth starter. Rusin would then be the long reliever. If the Rockies leave camp with four starters, they likely would use an eight-man bullpen. That would leave Miguel Castro and Scott Oberg battling for the final spot.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the design of the bullpen. If we break with eight or we break with seven,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nJorge De La Rosa to start opening day:\n\nJorge De La Rosa will start opening day at Arizona, but Weiss is undecided on a pitcher for the Rockies\u2019 home opener April 8. \u201cThere is some debate there,\u201d he said. Tyler Chatwood, Jordan Lyles or Bergman are possibilities. The Rockies will have extra rest days for Chatwood early in the season to protect him as he comes back from Tommy John surgery.\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 spring training lineup starting to look like regular-season squad", "title": "Rockies\u2019 spring training lineup starting to look like regular-season squad", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/26/rockies-spring-training-lineup-starting-to-look-like-regular-season-squad/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-26T23:40:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-26T23:40:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rockies bullpen update:The Rockies\u2019 bullpen remains open.\nJorge De La Rosa to start opening day:Jorge De La Rosa will start opening day at Arizona, but Weiss is undecided on a pitcher for the Rockies\u2019 home opener April 8.\nThe springtime Rockies are finally solidifying into a regular-season squad.\nChris Rusin, who made his first spring appearance Saturday after coming back from a finger injury, moved toward winning a job.\nThe Rockies will have extra rest days for Chatwood early in the season to protect him as he comes back from Tommy John surgery."}
