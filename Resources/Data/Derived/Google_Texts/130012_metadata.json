That means a minimum of six victories. But Buffaloes coach Mike MacIntyre said Saturday during the school\u2019s football media day interviews that he doesn\u2019t look at it that way.\n\nCoaches never want to place a limit on their team or have players look past the next practice, never mind the next game.\n\n\u201cWe play 12 games, right?\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cWe have to go out each Saturday and take care of business. We want to start out 1-0. And then the next week we want to start out and go 1-0 again.\n\n\u201cWe look at each game as a season in itself. We talk about that all the time.\u201d\n\nFans, of course, are apt to look at CU\u2019s schedule and try to project at least six wins.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, our players hear all types of views,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cAnd when I go to speak at a function, I hear people talk about bowls. Of course, we want to go to a bowl. That\u2019s a given.\n\n\u201cBut I look at each game as a season in itself. I want to win the first one. And then I want to get ready and win the second one. We don\u2019t want to lose any of them.\u201d\n\nColorado went 4-8 last fall in MacIntyre\u2019s first season in Boulder. He said he does not hear as much negativity about the program. The ongoing facility upgrades, including an indoor practice facility, have helped immensely, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited for what the future holds,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThe new facilities have changed the undercurrent of what I would hear when I first got here \u2014 that \u2018the University of Colorado is not committed to football.\u2019 They cannot say that anymore. Period.\n\n\u201cYou can just walk outside (and look at the construction); there is tangible evidence,\u201d he added. \u201cI know it\u2019s changing. This has always been a special place. It\u2019s a beauty town. It\u2019s a great, great school. But we were always being hit about facilities and this and that. Now, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nTom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Buffs coach Mike MacIntyre looks at each game as \u201cseason in itself\u201d", "title": "CU Buffs coach Mike MacIntyre looks at each game as \u201cseason in itself\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/09/cu-buffs-coach-mike-macintyre-looks-at-each-game-as-season-in-itself/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__CUspringgame109p1.jpg", "height": 474}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140809__CUspringgame109p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-09T14:21:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T04:56:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "But Buffaloes coach Mike MacIntyre said Saturday during the school\u2019s football media day interviews that he doesn\u2019t look at it that way.\nCoaches never want to place a limit on their team or have players look past the next practice, never mind the next game.\n\u201cWe look at each game as a season in itself.\n\u201cBut I look at each game as a season in itself.\nBOULDER \u2014 Qualifying for a bowl game is a 2014 team goal for Colorado."}
