The agency also encouraged taxpayers and tax practitioners to take a fresh look at the many benefits of e-filing. \u201cTennessee experienced another record breaking year with more than 2.5 million e-filed returns, said IRS Spokesman Mark Green. \u201cEveryone should try e-file. It\u2019s safe, easy, fast and accurate. I strongly recommend that taxpayers try it,\u201d Mr. Green said.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Mr. Green offer highlights that taxpayers should watch for as they file tax returns for 2014:\n\n\n\nWhat is the due date for the 2014 federal tax returns?\n\nYour tax return (or a request for an extension) must be filed no later than Wednesday, April 15.\n\n\n\nHow many returns does the IRS expect to be filed this year?\n\nNationwide, the IRS expects to receive about 151 million 2014 individual tax returns.\n\nAbout 2.9 million from Tennessee\n\n\n\nWhen can people file their 2014 tax return?\n\nThe IRS plans to open the 2015 filing season and begin processing individual income tax returns on Jan. 20. The IRS will be working closely with the tax software industry and tax professional community to minimize delays and ensure as smooth a tax season as possible under the circumstances.\n\nWhat happens if someone files a paper return before the Jan. 20?\n\nThe IRS will not process paper tax returns before the anticipated Jan. 20 opening date.\n\n\n\nWill the extenders legislation affect the starting date?\n\nTaxpayers can file starting Jan. 20, including those affected by Congress renewing a number of \"extender\" provisions (about 55) of the tax law that expired at the end of 2013. These provisions were renewed by Congress through the end of 2014. The final legislation was signed into law Dec 19, 2014.\n\n\n\nSome of the more popular renewed Tax Credits for Individuals are:\n\nResidential Energy Tax Credit - for installing energy efficient windows, doors, water heaters, etc. in an existing home. Up to $500 lifetime credit.\n\n\n\nEducator's deduction of $250 for out-of-pocket classroom expenses - With this provision, originally enacted in 2002, teachers could deduct up to $250 of out-of-pocket expenses for kindergarten through grade 12 educators with out-of-pocket classroom expenses of up to $250 classroom materials.\n\n\n\nSales Tax Deduction - One of the largest permanent tax breaks is the state and local tax deduction, which allows filers who itemize to deduct the amount paid in state or local income tax. However, people who live in states with no income tax cannot take advantage of this deduction. This provision created a deduction for sales tax states by allowing an individual to deduct either the amount they paid in sales tax or income tax since 2004. (Primarily benefiting people living in areas without state and local income taxes.)\n\n\n\nCharitable Donations from an IRA - Under this provision created in 2006, retirees age 70.5 and older could donate up to $100,000 tax-free from their IRA each year to charity. Normally, the donation would be eligible for a charitable deduction, but this provision converts the deduction to a complete exclusion, which allows retirees to make their required IRA withdrawals without triggering a tax a Social Security benefits for retirees with income other than Social Security.\n\n\n\nTuition and Fees Deduction - This deduction, in place since 2001, allows filers with incomes less than $65,000 a year ($130,000 if filing jointly) to deduct up to $4,000 of tuition and fees paid for higher education. This provision was for filers who did not claim one of the other educational credits, and it phased out entirely for filers with incomes over $80,000 ($160,000 if filing jointly). Benefiting parents and students. Claim on Form 8917 .\n\n\n\nMortgage Debt Forgiveness - Normally, forgiven debt counts as taxable income. In response to the housing crisis, homeowners could exclude up to $2 million of canceled debt ($1 million if married filing separately) on their principal residence. The forgiveness must be directly related to a decline in the home\u2019s value or the taxpayer\u2019s financial condition. This provision was passed as temporary stimulus measure in 2007.\n\n\n\nMortgage Insurance Premiums - itemized deduction.\n\n\n\nParity for Commuter Transit Benefit - Before this provision expired, commuters could spend up to $245 a month of tax-free income for either transit or parking. After the expiration, the amount for transit has dropped to $130 a month, while the amount for parking rose with inflation to $250 a month, meaning that those who drive to work are now subsidized more than those who use public transit. The transit benefit originated in 1993 and became equal to the parking benefit in 2009.\n\nHow will the Affordable Care Act affect an individual\u2019s 2014 tax return?\n\n\u201cI strongly encourage taxpayers to visit our website and order/view publications 5187 and 5185 for more information on ACA,\u201d said Mr. Green. (http://www.irs.gov/Affordable-Care-Act/Individuals-and-Families/Health-Care-Law-and-Your-Tax-Return, www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5187.pdf, www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5185.pdf)\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of Americans are already covered and don\u2019t need to do anything more than check a box on their tax return. Check box 61 on the Form 1040, Line 38 on Form 1040A, or Line 11 on Form 1040EZ.\n\nIndividuals who didn\u2019t maintain their healthcare coverage throughout the year must either have exemptions from coverage or make individual shared responsibility payments with their federal income tax returns.\n\n\n\nOnly people who got coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace may be eligible for the premium tax credit.\n\n\n\nIndividuals that purchased coverage through the Marketplace and opted to have advance credit payments sent directly to their insurance company must reconcile those payments with the amount of the credit they are actually allowed on their tax return.\n\nCoverage Exemptions and payment amounts will be calculated using the Form 8965 instructions.\n\n\n\nHow will people know what to put on their tax return?\n\nFor most people it will mean just checking a box on their tax return to indicate that they had coverage for the entire year. Others should visit IRS.gov/aca for more information about exemptions and payments. Exemptions will be claimed using Form 8965, Health Coverage Exemptions.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who bought health insurance through the Marketplace should receive Form 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, by the end of January. Most people are already familiar with using similar tax information documents such as their W2 or Form 1099 to prepare their tax return.\n\n\n\nIndividuals claiming the premium tax credit will use the information on Form 1095-A to complete Form 8962, Premium Tax Credit, to claim the credit on a Federal Tax Return or to reconcile advance credit payments.\n\n\n\nWhat can people do now if they don\u2019t have insurance?\n\nIndividuals can purchase coverage directly from insurance companies or brokers, or through the Marketplace.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services administers the requirements for the Marketplace and the health plans that are offered.\n\n\n\nAlthough the Marketplace open enrollment period for 2015 ends in February 2015, under certain circumstances eligible individuals may qualify for a Special Enrollment Period and will still be able to buy health coverage for 2015 through the Marketplace. The open enrollment period for coverage in 2015 will run from Nov. 15, 2014 through Feb. 15, 2015.\n\n\n\nVisit the Department of Health and Human Services website at HealthCare.gov to learn more about coverage options, financial assistance and to enroll in coverage.\n\n\n\nInformation on health care related tax provisions, including the individual shared responsibility provision, is on IRS.gov/aca.\n\n\n\nWhere can I get assistance?\n\n\u2022 The IRS Web site at www.irs.gov.\n\n\u2022 Information on IRS.gov:\n\n\u2022 Highlights of the latest tax law changes, tax tips, news releases and frequently asked questions.\n\n\u2022 Links to information about:\n\n\u2022 Popular Tax Credits and Deductions\n\n\u2022 IRS Free File, the free electronic tax filing service provided by IRS partners in the tax software preparation industry.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWhere\u2019s My Refund?\u201d which helps taxpayers track the status of their refunds.\n\n\u2022 Commonly used forms and tax instructions and\n\n\u2022 Information for those facing difficult times financially.\n\n\u2022 Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) provides free tax return assistance to low or moderate income taxpayers.
