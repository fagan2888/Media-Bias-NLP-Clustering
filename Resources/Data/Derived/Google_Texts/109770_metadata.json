The use of drugs to induce labor has become far more common, as have cesarean sections. Today, about half of all births in this country are hastened either by drugs or surgery, double the share in 1990.\n\nCrucial to the change has been a widely held belief that once fetuses pass a certain set of thresholds \u2014 often 39 weeks of gestation and five and a half pounds in weight \u2014 they\u2019re as healthy as they can get. More time in the womb doesn\u2019t do them much good, according to this thinking. For parents and doctors, meanwhile, scheduling a birth, rather than waiting for its random arrival, is clearly more convenient.\n\nBut a huge new set of data, based on every child born in Florida over an 11-year span, is calling into question some of the most basic assumptions of our medicalized approach to childbirth. The results also play into a larger issue: the growing sense among many doctors and other experts that Americans would actually be healthier if our health care system were sometimes less aggressive.\n\nThe new data suggest that the thresholds to maximize a child\u2019s health seem to be higher, which means that many fetuses might benefit by staying longer in the womb, where they typically add at least a quarter-pound per week. Seven-pound babies appear to be healthier than six-pound babies \u2014 and to fare better in school as they age. The same goes for eight-pound babies compared with seven-pound babies, and nine-pound babies compared with eight-pound babies. Weight, of course, may partly be an indicator of broader fetal health, but it seems to be a meaningful one: The chunkier the baby, the better it does on average, all the way up to almost 10 pounds.\n\n\u201cBirth weight matters, and it matters for everyone,\u201d says David N. Figlio, a Northwestern University professor and co-author of the study, which will soon be published in the American Economic Review, one of the field\u2019s top journals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Figlio \u2014 5 pounds, 15 ounces at birth \u2014 is quick to add that birth weight is not destiny. Its effects are considerably smaller than those of social class, for example. A lighter baby of well-educated parents is likely to do much better in life than a heavier baby of high-school dropouts.\n\nYet within every group the researchers studied, birth weight appeared to have a noticeable effect, even after controlling for a long list of other factors. Mr. Figlio estimates that, all else equal, a 10-pound baby will score an average of 80 points higher on the 1,600-point SAT than a six-pound baby. Another way to see the pattern is to look only at top-scoring students: Among the top 5 percent of test scorers in elementary school, one in three weighed at least eight pounds at birth, compared with only one in four of all babies.\n\nThe Florida study will not be the last word on birth weight and timing. As the authors acknowledge, they cannot rule out the possibility that weight is a proxy for other aspects of fetal health that more time in the womb would not improve. And late and heavy babies also bring some risks. Still, the results are sufficiently striking \u2014 across a very large population, and present in every subgroup \u2014 that they\u2019re likely to influence the debate about the medicalization of birth.\n\nIn 2011, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other groups began pushing to eliminate induced labor before the 39th week of pregnancy absent a clear medical reason. The induction rate has since fallen. If further research confirms the Florida findings, it will be easy to see an argument for further declines, as well as for a serious look at whether the induction rate is also too high in the 40th week. Many inductions today are elective, rather than coming after a woman\u2019s water has broken or after a medical problem.\n\nThe notion that fetuses may benefit from being in the womb beyond the 39th week, says Dr. Brent C. James, who runs the Institute for Health Care Delivery Research in Salt Lake City, \u201cmakes perfect clinical sense.\u201d As in much of biology, he added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a hard cutoff, a cliff edge.\u201d\n\nThese issues are part of a debate that extends well beyond childbirth. The notion that Mother Nature should more often trump Pitocin and other induction drugs fits with a broad questioning of the American health care system, famously the world\u2019s most intensive and expensive. Starting about a decade ago, an inchoate group of reformers \u2014 doctors, nurses, hospital executives, social scientists and others \u2014 began pushing the idea that there was a better way. Yes, intensive medicine can bring lifesaving benefits, but technologically advanced treatments often don\u2019t work any better than more basic forms.\n\nIn particular, treatments that work wonders on a small group of patients often spread to a much wider group of people, including many who don\u2019t benefit from them. Induced labor, which does indeed help women and babies facing health risks, is one example. Others include cardiac stents, back surgery and prostate treatment.\n\nArmed with reams of evidence, the reformers began pushing hospitals and insurers, including Medicare, to change. In the private market, among other things, insurers have excluded some high-cost doctors from their networks. For all the problems and waste that still exist, the effort has had an effect: Health costs have slowed sharply in the last several years, surprising nearly every expert. Remarkably, per-person spending in Medicare is on a pace to be about 6 percent lower this year than it was three years ago.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know whether the trend will last. But Obamacare, while not the main reason for the slowdown, may be sustaining it. Even as the law has added people to the health-insurance rolls, which increases costs, it has also targeted unnecessary, expensive care.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhether the slowdown will continue is among today\u2019s biggest economic questions. Yet the economic implications aren\u2019t even the most important ones. The health implications are. The idea that we can be healthier with less health care is no longer just wishful thinking; it\u2019s a serious theory, with growing evidence.\n\nChildbirth makes for a crucial case study. It affects everyone, and for centuries was among the biggest dangers women confronted. The maternal death rate per childbirth long approached 1.5 percent, historians estimate.\n\nSo the notion that modern medicine should be removed from childbirth altogether is clearly wrong. In the United States today, the death rate for mothers in childbirth is less than 0.02 percent. Modern medicine saves the lives of millions of childbearing women \u2014 and their infants \u2014 every year.\n\nYet as with stents, back surgery and prostate treatments, many believe the medicalization of childbirth almost certainly went too far. \u201cToo much intervention is not a good thing,\u201d said Dr. Barbara S. Levy, vice president for health policy at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Researchers now agree that nonmedical inductions before 39 weeks are a problem. The next question is whether fetuses continue to get substantial benefits from being in the womb \u2014 without much additional risk, for mother or baby \u2014 after 39 weeks.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141010125858, "twitter": {"description": "Babies who are allowed to linger in the womb are often healthier and do better in school.", "title": "Heavier Babies Do Better in School", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/upshot/heavier-babies-do-better-in-school.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003167114"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/sunday-review/1012COVER/1012COVER-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/upshot/heavier-babies-do-better-in-school.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003167114", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/upshot/heavier-babies-do-better-in-school.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "upshot", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Oct. 10, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "American Economic Review, The (Journal)", "keywords": "Pregnancy and Childbirth,American Economic Review  The (Journal),Babies and Infants,Research,Education (K-12)", "news_keywords": "Research", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "David Leonhardt and Amanda Cox", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/sunday-review/1012COVER/1012COVER-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By DAVID LEONHARDT and AMANDA COX", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Babies who are allowed to linger in the womb are often healthier and do better in school.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/sunday-review/1012COVER/1012COVER-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Babies who are allowed to linger in the womb are often healthier and do better in school.", "CG": "upshot", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Oct. 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/amanda_cox/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/upshot", "section": "The Upshot", "modified": "2015-01-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/upshot/index.jsonp", "tag": "Education (K-12)", "published": "2014-10-10", "section-taxonomy-id": "D64FAE4C-4425-4E5A-B898-6C8CB59F9957"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "12upshot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150122020005, "hdl_p": "Big Baby, Smart Kid", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/upshot/heavier-babies-do-better-in-school.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/12/sunday-review/1012COVER/1012COVER-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Babies who are allowed to linger in the womb are often healthier and do better in school.", "title": "Heavier Babies Do Better in School"}, "pdate": 20141010, "des": "Education (K-12)", "articleid": 100000003167114, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Heavier Babies Do Better in School", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1198\"", "article_summary": "The same goes for eight-pound babies compared with seven-pound babies, and nine-pound babies compared with eight-pound babies.\nSeven-pound babies appear to be healthier than six-pound babies \u2014 and to fare better in school as they age.\nLike so many other parts of health care, childbirth has become a more medically intense experience over the last two decades.\nA lighter baby of well-educated parents is likely to do much better in life than a heavier baby of high-school dropouts.\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Figlio \u2014 5 pounds, 15 ounces at birth \u2014 is quick to add that birth weight is not destiny."}
