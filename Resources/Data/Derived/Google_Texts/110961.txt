U.S. Congressman Joe Pitts recently toured Quadrant Plastics to take a closer look at how changing regulations could potentially affect the plastics industry in the U.S. and abroad.

Quadrant Plastic, located at 2120 Fairmont Ave. in Reading, is a leading global manufacturer of high-performance thermoplastic materials in the form of semi-finished products.

The company, which employs 2,000 people worldwide, makes products for many types of industries including medical and life sciences, food and beverage, automotive, heavy equipment and chemical and oil.

During the April 8 tour, Pitts said he was astonished by the high level of technology used to make products at the Reading facility, which is Quadrant’s U.S. headquarters.

The Reading facility employs 225 people, according to Kress Schwartz, Quadrant’s product manager, engineering and advanced materials.

Schwartz said he is proud that the company provides jobs to so many people who live locally.

“You can have a great job in Reading with strong wages and great healthcare,” Schwartz said.

As part of his visit, Pitts saw several phases of operations including production and material testing and met with employees for a question and answer session after the tour.

Employees who met with Pitts asked questions regarding several issues regarding the medical device tax, Cadillac tax, entitlement programs, the Affordable Care Act, and tax reform as they relate to the plastics industry.

Pitts also talked about the need for improvement in the medical sector specifically in regard to information-sharing about important testing methods such as clinical trials.
