After all, this Spanish classic is basically rice richly flavored with ingredients from land and sea.\n\nIt can be extravagantly embellished with lobster or simply studded with sausage. Vegetarian renditions make use of whatever the earth or farmers' markets offer up.\n\nThink of it as a one-dish masterpiece that needs only a simple salad to complete the meal.\n\nBut a pamphlet included with a recently purchased paella pan had some ominous words: \"Besides the paella pan, you need a good dose of courage and confidence.\"\n\nPaella does involve lots of chopping and a pinch or two of expensive saffron. It also takes practice to get the rice cooked to perfection. But courage?\n\nOne fearless maker of paella is Chef Nicolas Ramos, who owns Antigua Latin Restaurant in West Allis with wife, Citlali Mendieta-Ramos. On their menu you'll find paella valenciana with chicken and pork, as well as paella de mariscos, his seafood interpretation, adapted from a recipe given to him by his mother-in-law.\n\nHe teaches a series of cooking classes during the year including Spanish paella, which is his most popular and which often sells out well in advance. (His next paella class is from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Oct. 25. The cost is $50.)\n\nWhen it comes to this iconic dish, Ramos is easygoing: \"Making paella is a good excuse to relax and enjoy some time in the kitchen,\" he said. \"If you're at home, have yourself a glass of wine and start cooking.\"\n\nAnd he's certainly not a purist. He sets aside some of the traditional ways in deference to modern tastes, availability of ingredients and convenience.\n\nYes, paella originally hails from Valencia, Spain, but according to this Mexican-American chef, \"it's become an international dish now. And it's hard to say what's traditional and what's not.\"\n\nHe pointed out, for instance, that \"it was once usual to use rabbit\" in many of the most traditional recipes for paella valenciana, but rabbit has long since been replaced by chicken in most instances.\n\nPaella is named for the pan in which it's cooked. And most home cooks don't have one of these wide, flat, thin-bottomed pans in their larder.\n\nSo, Ramos advises, if you don't have a dedicated paella pan, go ahead and use a skillet \u2014 \"make sure it's flat\" \u2014 as long as it's the same size as the pan called for in the recipe.\n\nIf necessary, use two pans to accommodate all the ingredients without crowding.\n\nSo far so good, but Ramos commits absolute heresy by suggesting the use of long-grained rice rather than the short-grained or medium-grained rice considered mandatory by most other experts.\n\n\"We used to use bomba rice, but now I use long-grain rice because it's is less starchy and seems to cook more evenly,\" he said.\n\nStubby, short-grained Spanish bomba rice, grown in the Valencia region, is often recommended for paella recipes. Italian arborio is an easier-to-find alternative. Another short-grained option, available at many local grocery stores, is La Preferida brand Pearl Rice \u2014 or arroz tipo valenciano.\n\nBecause bomba rice is so absorbent, it requires a ratio of about 3 to 1 liquid to rice, while Ramos uses the standard 2 to 1 ratio for long-grained rice.\n\n\"Sometimes we worry too much about ingredients,\" he said. \"We've been told paella has to be this way or that way, but you can do it your own way. Don't let not having the right rice stop you.\"\n\nSpanish food authority and author Jeff Koehler, who lives in Barcelona, is more of a stickler.\n\nIn his most recent book, \"Spain: Recipes and Traditions from the Verdant Hills of the Basque Country to the Coastal Waters of Andalucia\" (Chronicle Books, 2013, $40), he refers to rice as the \"protagonist\" in paella because the highly absorbent grains of rice act \"as vehicles for the flavors.\"\n\n2 worthy recipes\n\nThere are two paella recipes in his book: the first is rabbit paella with artichokes and red bell peppers \u2014 and, yes, he does mention that you can substitute bone-in chicken for rabbit \u2014 and the second is for shellfish paella.\n\nNeither of these lengthy, traditional recipes \u2014 with lots of detailed instructions \u2014 is included here, but courageous students of paella might want to check them out.\n\nAn earlier book of his is \"La Paella\" (Chronicle, 2006, $18.95), which has about a dozen paella recipes, as well as recipes for other Spanish rice dishes and desserts.\n\nAccording to Koehler, celebrated bomba rice, with its high degree of starchiness and absorbency, is more resilient and less likely to \"open\" than other varieties.\n\nOf course, you'll pay more for bomba. La Tienda, a well-known online purveyor of Spanish foods and cookware, sells 2.2 pounds (about 4\u00bd cups) of this specialty rice for $14.95.\n\nKoehler writes that paella dates back centuries in Valencia, noting that Moors introduced rice into Spain \u2014 along the fringes of Albufera, a freshwater lagoon just south of Valencia \u2014 in the eighth century.\n\nPaella was traditionally cooked over embers, and Koehler offers tips in his book on how to accomplish that with a modern-day grill.\n\nBut even if you decide to cook indoors, two traditional ingredients, cured chorizo and smoked Spanish paprika, help to lend a smoky flavor.\n\nFor newbies, the author has 27 tips in a section called \"Paella: Techniques and Advice,\" organized in order of preparation.\n\nThey include some age-old edicts: Do not use long-grain or parboiled rice, do not stir, do not cover the pan as the rice cooks.\n\n(Not surprisingly, the West Allis chef doesn't worry too much about these rules.)\n\nBut it's Koehler's initial advice that shouldn't be overlooked: \"A paella is always a festive occasion. But do not make a paella for the first time for a large group of people. Do a practice run first to be comfortable with the pan, the heat source, rice and amount of liquid. Take notes....\"\n\nOnce you've got it down \u2014 and your picture-perfect paella is ready \u2014 carry it to the table in the pan.\n\nAnd here are Koehler's words of wisdom to guests: \"If you're sitting at the table, applaud appreciatively when the paella is carried out.\"\n\nPaella tips\n\nPlanning to make paella? Here are a few tips to consider first:\n\n\u25a0Paella pans are wide and flat with low sloping sides and two handles. The least expensive and most traditional are made from polished carbon steel, with common sizes ranging from 14 to 20 inches. A 14-inch steel pan costs about $22.\n\nAn easier-to-take-care-of alternative \u2014 and nearly as inexpensive \u2014 is a steel pan coated with black and white speckled enamel.\n\nOne online source is La Paella.\n\n\u25a0Before purchasing a paella pan, find out the size of the pan, including the handles, to see if it will fit in the oven. A 17- or 18-inch pan \u2014 and that's the width across the top \u2014 is more like 22 inches by the time you take the two handles into account.\n\n\u25a0Indian grocery stores carry some of the least expensive saffron threads around, at least in the Milwaukee market. Expect to pay about $6 per gram, with 1 gram of whole threads equaling about 2 teaspoons, enough for several recipes of paella. The saffron is usually kept behind the counter.\n\n\u25a0Chop ahead of time. The late Penelope Casas was one of the great authorities on Spanish cooking, and she wrote in \"Paella!:\" \"Have all ingredients chopped and measured before beginning the final cooking of paella...this can be done well in advance, especially when cooking for guests.\"\n\n\u25a0The broth in which the rice is cooked is important to the success of the dish. Use a top-quality commercial product \u2014 or better yet, make your own.\n\n\u25a0No socarrat \u2014 no problem! Paella aficionados talk about the coveted crusted rice that sometimes forms at the bottom of the pan. But in an email, author Jeff Koehler noted that not having the browned bottom crust \u2014 or \"socarrat\" \u2014 doesn't mean the chef has failed.\n\n\"It is quite rare, to be honest,\" he wrote. \"And you can never 'try' to get it. As I say, it is just seconds away from being burnt.\"\n\n\u25a0The traditional way is to have guests eat right from the pan. Each guest starts at the perimeter and eats toward the center. And as Koehler tells us, \"It is considered bad manners to reach across the pan for that particularly plump shrimp. Stick to your own pie-shaped section of rice in front of you.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "title": "Learn to make paella correctly, then accept the applause", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/features/food/learn-to-make-paella-correctly-then-accept-the-applause-b99352787z1-277073871.html", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99352787z.1_20140925094309_000_g0k7tpop.1-0.jpg", "height": 1333}, "type": "article", "description": "Paella seems as if it should be pretty easy to make, but experts say it takes courage and time to do it right.", "title": "Learn to make paella correctly, then accept the applause"}, "twitter": {"site": "@FreshMKE", "image": {"src": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99352787z.1_20140925094309_000_g0k7tpop.1-0.jpg"}, "description": "Paella seems as if it should be pretty easy to make, but experts say it takes courage and time to do it right.", "card": "summary", "title": "Learn to make paella correctly, then accept the applause"}, "author": "", "publishdate": "2014-09-27T04:00:00+00:00", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "pagetype": "JSO Article"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe20\"", "article_summary": "But a pamphlet included with a recently purchased paella pan had some ominous words: \"Besides the paella pan, you need a good dose of courage and confidence.\"\nStubby, short-grained Spanish bomba rice, grown in the Valencia region, is often recommended for paella recipes.\nHe teaches a series of cooking classes during the year including Spanish paella, which is his most popular and which often sells out well in advance.\nAn earlier book of his is \"La Paella\" (Chronicle, 2006, $18.95), which has about a dozen paella recipes, as well as recipes for other Spanish rice dishes and desserts.\n\u25a0Before purchasing a paella pan, find out the size of the pan, including the handles, to see if it will fit in the oven."}
