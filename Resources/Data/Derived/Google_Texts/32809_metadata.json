Several people have taken advantage.\n\n\u201cIt's important for our community because there are a lot of former smokers,\u201d said William Adams of Portersville, 69, the program's first patient. \u201cIf this hospital provides this service, it really could be a life-saver.\u201d\n\nAdams, chairman of Portersville furniture maker Adams Manufacturing Corp., said he quit smoking a couple years ago after about 20 years. His doctor thought Adams would make a good candidate for the program with his smoking history.\n\nThe low-dose CT scan revealed Adams' lungs have no signs of cancer.\n\n\u201cIt's a relief to know that there was no danger left inside me,\u201d he said.\n\nThe scans not only give people peace of mind, but they can discover lung cancer at its early stages, when it is more curable. By the time lung cancer can be diagnosed through a standard chest X-ray, it's usually in an advanced stage and chances of curing it are \u201cfairly low,\u201d Davliakos said.\n\nIf the disease is detected early through low-dose CT scans, which show small spots on the lungs, there's more than a 50 percent chance it can be treated or cured, Davliakos said.\n\n\u201cThe purpose is to identify lung cancer early at a stage where it can be treated much more effectively and possibly cured,\u201d Davliakos said. \u201cThere's a much higher cure rate to find it earlier.\u201d\n\nDavliakos said the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial shows that low-dose CT scans in high-risk patients improve the survival rate by 20 percent over six years.\n\nIt's important the scans are used on the appropriate patients and with a multidisciplinary team of doctors, said Dr. Lana Schumacher, co-director of the institute for the treatment of esophageal and thoracic disorders for Allegheny Health Network.\n\n\u201cIf you don't stick to the guidelines, it can be dangerous,\u201d Schumacher said, because of the high risk for false positives and the small exposure to radiation.\n\n\u201cBut I really don't see too many downsides. There's a dramatic difference in outcomes when it's diagnosed early,\u201d Schumacher added.\n\nTo qualify for the Butler program, patients must be between 55 and 80, have smoked within the last 15 years, have at least a 30-pack-a-year smoking history and have no other medical conditions, such as severe emphysema, that would prevent additional testing. They also must have a referral from their primary care doctor.\n\nIf a scan shows potential problems, any follow-up treatments or procedures are generally covered by insurers.\n\nLung Center officials hope the screening program will be free next year under the Affordable Care Act as preventive care.\n\nRachel Farkas is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
