It\u2019s an impossible and impossibly divisive idea.\n\nThe only policy proposal more offensive? To ban any and all Muslims who live outside the United States from stepping foot on American soil, either as visitors or immigrants.\n\nAnd now, in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and elsewhere, Cruz is surging as a right-wing absolutist.\n\nHe led the government shutdown in 2013 over a pointless effort to defund Obamacare \u2014 and wanted to push the government over the cliff again this year due to the tiny fraction of taxpayer money that goes toward Planned Parenthood.\n\nTRUMP, CRUZ, OTHERS FACE OFF AT TERRORISM-FOCUSED GOP DEBATE\n\nThe Cruz tax plan \u2014 boasting a 10% flat rate, and a complete elimination of all payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare \u2014 is an irresponsible fantasy.\n\nCruz is also a culture warrior without peer. In June, he said states had \u201cno obligation\u201d to accept the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark same-sex marriage ruling. In the immediate wake of the ISIS-driven San Bernardino attack, he held a Second Amendment rally .\n\nThe two men are riding high on a tide of anger fueled by economic dislocation, middle-class stagnation, a resurgent terror threat and two terms of President Obama. While Republican voters\u2019 frustrations are understandable, their easy embrace of simplistic answers offered by charismatic messengers has cast candidates who should be far more credible onto the fringes.\n\nContenders from Chris Christie to Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to John Kasich are hardly Republicans in name only. They each have credible conservative credentials of their own.\n\nSTASI: DONALD TRUMP IS BAD, BUT CRUZ WORSE FOR U.S.\n\nBush, Christie and Kasich \u2014 current or former governors who\u2019ve proven the ability to actually run blue or purple states \u2014 have demonstrated more interest in crafting solutions than in making purist proclamations.\n\nRubio has also shown an occasional willingness to build bridges, rather than to throw bombs.\n\nCruz savages his fellow senator as a sellout for joining other Republicans and Democrats in 2013 to draft a comprehensive immigration reform bill that among other things would have given undocumented immigrants the eventual chance to earn legal status.\n\nIt should sadden those who care about the future of the Republican Party that a sizable contingent of the base disqualifies Rubio for attempting to resolve a pressing national issue.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS CRUZ A DAY AFTER POLLS SHOW TEX. SENATOR IN LEAD\n\nThe Iowas caucuses and succeeding primaries will reveal whether Republican voters will follow Trump or Cruz. Doing so would result in a near-certain loss in November.\n\nThey will have only themselves to blame when a second President Clinton takes the oath of office.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Editorials", "twitter": {"description": "Bigoted, juvenile Donald Trump \u2014 with a tax plan that would increase the U.S. deficit by up to $12 trillion over 10 years", "title": "Trump & Cruz vs. the GOP", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/trump-cruz-gop-article-1.2476301", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2476300.1450990394!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/was8958405.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "donald trump, ted cruz, donald trump ted cruz,", "parsely-author": "Editorials", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "donald trump, ted cruz, donald trump ted cruz,", "nydn_tags": "donald trump, ted cruz, 2016 election, marco rubio, chris christie, john kasich, ben carson, hillary clinton, isis, san bernardino shooting, lgbt news, obamacare, gun control, jeb bush, terrorism", "news_keywords": "donald trump, ted cruz, donald trump ted cruz,", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/trump-cruz-gop-article-1.2476301", "parsely-title": "Trump & Cruz vs. the GOP", "sailthru.date": "2015-12-28T04:10:00-0500", "sailthru.title": "Trump & Cruz vs. the GOP", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-28T09:10:00", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2476300.1450990394!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/was8958405.jpg", "description": "Bigoted, juvenile Donald Trump \u2014 with a tax plan that would increase the U.S. deficit by up to $12 trillion over 10 years", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Bigoted, juvenile Donald Trump \u2014 with a tax plan that would increase the U.S. deficit by up to $12 trillion over 10 years", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Bigoted, juvenile Donald Trump \u2014 with a tax plan that would increase the U.S. deficit by up to $12 trillion over 10 years", "title": "Trump & Cruz vs. the GOP", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/trump-cruz-gop-article-1.2476301", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2476300.1450990394!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/was8958405.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "donald trump, ted cruz, 2016 election, marco rubio, chris christie, john kasich, ben carson, hillary clinton, isis, san bernardino shooting, lgbt news, obamacare, gun control, jeb bush, terrorism", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2476300.1450990394!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/was8958405.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Editorials", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "article_summary": "TRUMP, CRUZ, OTHERS FACE OFF AT TERRORISM-FOCUSED GOP DEBATEThe Cruz tax plan \u2014 boasting a 10% flat rate, and a complete elimination of all payroll taxes that fund Social Security and Medicare \u2014 is an irresponsible fantasy.\nSENATOR IN LEADThe Iowas caucuses and succeeding primaries will reveal whether Republican voters will follow Trump or Cruz.\nGOP SENATE CANDIDATE WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP, CRUZVoting in state primary contests, just over a month away, will start to clarify whether Republicans will march on the scorched-earth course set by Trump and Cruz.\nRejecting any path to legal status for undocumented immigrants, Trump would deport 11 million people \u2014 and, in theory, vet them on return.\nTwo Republican strains are slugging it out: Rejectionists, represented by Trump and Ted Cruz, are pitted against candidates who offer greater hope of responsibly governing an ideologically diverse country."}
