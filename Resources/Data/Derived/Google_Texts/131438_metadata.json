Despite a smooth launch to Kentucky's online exchange system, that feeling still exists across the Bluegrass State.\n\n\"Just a lot of confusion and I don't know what to do about it really.\" said Danny Edmunds.\n\nHere in south central Kentucky, recently trained individuals called \"Kynectors\", are going out into communities to not only clear up any questions, but to also help facilitate enrollment.\n\n\"They want to be pre-screened and know what they're eligible for. They're just looking for that in-person assistance.\" said Kynector Charity Parrish.\n\nOne of their first stops was the Warren County Public Library, where the group helped some get started online while showing them figures that pertain to their health and their wallets.\n\n\"You can pre-screen online. So, I did that method and put a normal household income and then look at the numbers. They were all relatively low.\" added Kynector April Cain.\n\nJulie Graham has a 16 month old daughter and currently is uninsured. She hasn't logged onto KYNECT yet; but the prospect of coverage at low rates may entice her.\n\n\"It would help drastically for me and her. It would help us dramatically. Even if it's something paying $15 a month, or $100 a month that's pretty cheap to come by.\" said Graham.\n\nThose who've been through the process with hands on assistance say it's the boost they needed to getting coverage.\n\n\"I've been unemployed for a while. Having coverage with our previous employer, I didn't have to worry about all of that. I've now gone years without insurance. This is going to be a great piece of mind for me.\" commented Harriet Osborne. Osborne recently signed up with the help of relatives.\n\nThe help is only beginning. At the Governor's request, Kynectors will be at libraries all across the state Saturday to help in any way they can.\n\nList of Counties with Kynectors at libraries this Saturday:\n\nAllen County 9AM-4PM\n\nEdmonson County 9AM-12PM\n\nLogan County 10AM-12-PM\n\nMetcalfe County 9AM-2PM\n\nWarren County (Bob Kirby Branch) 2PM-4PM", "article_metadata": {"description": "Many across the Bluegrass State are still confused about the new healthcare law.", "language": "english", "author": "Jake Boswell", "og": {"url": "http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/Kynectors-Help-With-Online-Healthcare-Enrollment-234515091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/kynect-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Many across the Bluegrass State are still confused about the new healthcare law.", "title": "Kynectors Help With Online Healthcare Enrollment"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many across the Bluegrass State are still confused about the new healthcare law.", "title": "Kynectors Help With Online Healthcare Enrollment", "url": "http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/Kynectors-Help-With-Online-Healthcare-Enrollment-234515091.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/504*315/kynect-logo.jpg", "creator": "@wbkotv", "site": "@wbkotv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Kynectors Help With Online Healthcare Enrollment", "fb": {"app_id": 127798975567, "pages": 63322919917}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "JEsUJ-apax7vWIA6vgCv7Vo4tJmOvw3rjQlzmYfV01M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kynectors Help With Online Healthcare"}, "article_summary": "List of Counties with Kynectors at libraries this Saturday:Allen County 9AM-4PMEdmonson County 9AM-12PMLogan County 10AM-12-PMMetcalfe County 9AM-2PMWarren County (Bob Kirby Branch) 2PM-4PM\nAt the Governor's request, Kynectors will be at libraries all across the state Saturday to help in any way they can.\nHere in south central Kentucky, recently trained individuals called \"Kynectors\", are going out into communities to not only clear up any questions, but to also help facilitate enrollment.\nOsborne recently signed up with the help of relatives.\nDespite a smooth launch to Kentucky's online exchange system, that feeling still exists across the Bluegrass State."}
