Environmental activists are pushing to ban toxic chemicals often found in dog collars and other pet products.

The Natural Resources Defense Council filed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday seeking to force the agency to restrict the use of tetrachlovinphos, which it describes as a highly toxic pesticide.

This comes after the EPA last year restricted the use of a related pesticide, propoxur, but refused previous requests to block tetrachlovinphos from being used in pet products, NRDC noted.

NRDC argues these chemicals are highly toxic and pose a risk to children who are exposed to those animals.

“EPA’s blatant disregard for protecting our children’s health from toxic flea collars is irresponsible and unacceptable,” said Miriam Rotkin-Ellman, NRDC’s senior scientist.

“Science shows, time and again, that brain and nervous system-damaging chemicals like TCVP are too harmful to have in our homes, on our pets and around our children,” Rotkin-Ellman added.
