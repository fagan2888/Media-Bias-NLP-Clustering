The latter responses were adjusted for factors, like age, ethnicity, and marital status. The results showed 40 percent of women diagnosed with severe mental illness were raped, had been attempted to be rape, while 53 percent of those same women attempted suicide.\n\nAs for cases of domestic violence, 69 percent of women were victims compared to 49 percent of men. To put those numbers in perspective, seven percent of women and 0.5 percent of men are sexually assaulted out of the general population. And there\u2019s a 30 percent difference between the domestic violence cases among the mentally ill (63 percent) and general population (35 percent).\n\n\"This study highlights that patients with severe mental illness are at substantially increased risk of being a victim of domestic and sexual violence,\u201d Louise Howard, study co-author and a professor in women\u2019s mental health at King's College London, said in a press release. \u201cDespite the public's concern about violence being perpetrated by patients with severe mental illness, the reality for patients is that they are at increased risk of being victims of some of the most damaging types of violence.\"\n\nThis study defined sexual violence as a perpetrator who exposed himself indecently, touched a woman sexually without her consent, and committed rape. Domestic violence was defined as emotional, physical, or sexual abuse perpetrated by a partner or family member.\n\nDespite finding a strong association between mental illness and sexual and domestic violence, researchers are uncertain of causality. Some men and women experience onset of mental illness post-violence, but 10 percent of those surveyed experienced sexual assault within the last year. This means it was after they were diagnosed.\n\n\u201cConsidering the high rate of suicide attempts among rape victims in this group, clinicians assessing people after a suicide attempt should consider asking them if they have been sexually assaulted,\u201d Dr. Hind Khalifeh, lead study author of the University College London\u2019s Division of Psychiatry, also said in the press release. \u201cCurrently this is not done and so patients may miss opportunities to receive specialist support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "women, suffering, severe, mental, illness, are, 5, times, more, likely, be, sexually, assaulted", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Psychiatric outpatients experienced more sexual and domestic violence than the general population.", "title": "Women With Mental Illness Are 5 Times More Likely To Be Victims Of Sexual Assault", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/women-suffering-severe-mental-illness-are-5-times-more-likely-be-sexually-assaulted-make-301086", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/psychiatrist-holding-patients-hands.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Psychiatric outpatients experienced more sexual and domestic violence than the general population.", "title": "Women With Mental Illness Are 5 Times More Likely To Be Victims Of Sexual Assault", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/women-suffering-severe-mental-illness-are-5-times-more-likely-be-sexually-assaulted-make-301086", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/psychiatrist-holding-patients-hands.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/03/psychiatrist-holding-patients-hands.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-09-03T19:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-03T19:01:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Psychiatric outpatients experienced more sexual and domestic violence than the general population."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda26e\"", "article_summary": "The results showed 40 percent of women diagnosed with severe mental illness were raped, had been attempted to be rape, while 53 percent of those same women attempted suicide.\nDespite finding a strong association between mental illness and sexual and domestic violence, researchers are uncertain of causality.\nA study published today in the journal Psychological Medicine revealed staggering statistics regarding women who suffer from severe mental illness: They are five times more likely to be victims of sexual assault.\nAnd there\u2019s a 30 percent difference between the domestic violence cases among the mentally ill (63 percent) and general population (35 percent).\nThis study defined sexual violence as a perpetrator who exposed himself indecently, touched a woman sexually without her consent, and committed rape."}
