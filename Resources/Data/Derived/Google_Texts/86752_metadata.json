Blue Shield, which said it would protest the state\u2019s decision, could wind up paying millions of dollars yearly to the state.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nLast year, Blue Shield of California collected $13.6 billion in revenue; with 3.4 million customers, only nonprofit Kaiser Permanente and for-profit Anthem Inc. rank ahead of it. Defying other insurance companies that opposed the idea, Blue Shield backed universal healthcare in 2002. Criticized in 2011 for its rate increases, Blue Shield accepted a ceiling of 2% of annual revenue for profit and returned roughly $560 million to the public between 2010 to 2012. In another gesture of generosity, Blue Shield gave over $325 million to a charitable foundation it runs.\n\nIn 2013, 260,000 members of a Blue Shield individual plan were hit by an 11.7% annual premium increase on average, according to Insurance Department actuaries. That figure was projected at the time to rise to 20.5% by 2015. Blue Shield defended the increase, stating, \u201cBlue Shield has lost tens of millions of dollars in the individual market in recent years and we expect similar losses in 2013.\u201d\n\nBut the company\u2019s surplus of $4.2 billion by the end of 2014, four times the total that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn. requires for Blue Shield of California to cover future claims, has raised eyebrows, according to the Los Angeles Times. Other criticisms include the company\u2019s minimal efforts on behalf of the poor using Medi-Cal, the huge salary of its former chief executive, who was paid almost $5 million, $10 million that the company invested in defeating Proposition 45, which championed rate regulation, and $2.5 million spent for a luxury box at the new professional football arena in Santa Clara.\n\nThe move to strip Blue Shield of its tax-exempt status has been accompanied by a critic from the inside of the company; Michael Johnson, who just resigned as public policy director, said Blue Shield has been \u201cshortchanging the public\u201d for years. He is expected to commence an online petition drive aimed at Blue Shield\u2019s board on Wednesday to force the company to abandon its non-profit status and assume profit status, as well as to pay billions of dollars to the state to fund its healthcare. He told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThe public is not getting its money\u2019s worth out of Blue Shield now.\u201d He added that he had attempted to discuss the company\u2019s role as a non-profit during the last six months, but his protests were ignored.\n\nCompany spokesman Steve Shivinsky responded to the criticisms by stating simply, \u201cBlue Shield as a company and management team firmly believes it is fulfilling its not-for-profit mission and commitment to the community.\u201d The Times notes, \u201cIndustry analysts also note that nonprofit health plans favor a bigger surplus because they don\u2019t have the ability to issue stock like a for-profit company or access debt markets in the same way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The California Franchise Tax Board, following a state audit, has revoked the tax-exempt status of nonprofit Blue Shield of California.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The California Franchise Tax Board, following a state audit, has revoked the tax-exempt status of nonprofit Blue Shield of California.", "title": "Blue Shield of California Loses Tax-Exempt Status - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/03/18/blue-shield-of-california-loses-tax-exempt-status/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The California Franchise Tax Board, following a state audit, has revoked the tax-exempt status of nonprofit Blue Shield of California.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "title": "Blue Shield of California Loses Tax-Exempt Status - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Blue Shield of California, Non-Profit, Revoked, Tax-exempt,Breitbart California,blue shield of california", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart California", "tag": "Tax-exempt", "published_time": "2015-03-18T11:43:06-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart California"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe California Franchise Tax Board, following a state audit, has revoked the tax-exempt status of nonprofit Blue Shield of California.\nBlue Shield defended the increase, stating, \u201cBlue Shield has lost tens of millions of dollars in the individual market in recent years and we expect similar losses in 2013.\u201dBut the company\u2019s surplus of $4.2 billion by the end of 2014, four times the total that the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Assn.\nrequires for Blue Shield of California to cover future claims, has raised eyebrows, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nDefying other insurance companies that opposed the idea, Blue Shield backed universal healthcare in 2002.\nIn 2013, 260,000 members of a Blue Shield individual plan were hit by an 11.7% annual premium increase on average, according to Insurance Department actuaries."}
