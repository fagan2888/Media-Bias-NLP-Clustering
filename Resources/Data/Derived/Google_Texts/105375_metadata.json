It will be used by students in the computer integrated manufacturing course and will assist them in learning manufacturing processes, said Justin Heckman, who teaches science and engineering classes at Abraham Lincoln.\n\nGreg Olenick, vice president and general manager for the engineering company, said the robotic arm is the same machinery that Stark uses to repair his armor in the \u201cIron Man\u201d movie.\n\nThe donation to Abraham Lincoln began with a conversation between Heckman and Olenick.\n\nHeckman asked Olenick: \u201cDo you have any robots just sitting around and gathering dust?\u201d\n\nThe company had a robotic arm that costs about $60,000 that was equipped with a special gripper. In fact, only about 10 are used across the United States, Olenick said.\n\nHeckman said students will use the robot to help produce wooden iPhone cases, which may be customized and later sold. Other options, including a golf club head or light switch, were considered.\n\nFor 16-year-old Matt Cumberland, a junior engineering student, operating the robotic arm showcased technological advances and the department's educational opportunities.\n\nHe said the engineering program \u201creally works my brain the way it needs to be worked.\u201d\n\nOlenick said the equipment shows the community the reality of manufacturing work. Often, he said, people have an image of a dirty environment.\n\n\u201cWe thought this was a great opportunity to show what manufacturing is today,\u201d he said. \u201cJobs robots do today are jobs that are hard to fill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "The device will be used by students in the computer-integrated manufacturing course and will assist them in learning manufacturing processes.", "title": "Tech firm donates robot arm, like the one used in 'Iron Man,' to Council Bluffs school", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/tech-firm-donates-robot-arm-like-the-one-used-in/article_14a64cbe-9b1f-5fa9-8b8a-233770fad782.html", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/d0/6d0e8b69-4022-5ddf-8568-5183e3c22e81/5390c60ce15d3.image.jpg?resize=1024%2C686", "height": 686}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The device will be used by students in the computer-integrated manufacturing course and will assist them in learning manufacturing processes.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb66d\"", "article_summary": "COUNCIL BLUFFS \u2014 If a robotic arm worked for Tony Stark in \u201cIron Man,\u201d it can work for engineering students at Abraham Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs.\nFor 16-year-old Matt Cumberland, a junior engineering student, operating the robotic arm showcased technological advances and the department's educational opportunities.\nGreg Olenick, vice president and general manager for the engineering company, said the robotic arm is the same machinery that Stark uses to repair his armor in the \u201cIron Man\u201d movie.\nHe said the engineering program \u201creally works my brain the way it needs to be worked.\u201dOlenick said the equipment shows the community the reality of manufacturing work.\nHeckman asked Olenick: \u201cDo you have any robots just sitting around and gathering dust?\u201dThe company had a robotic arm that costs about $60,000 that was equipped with a special gripper."}
