It\u2019s a time-tested rubric for \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d: Send a caricature of neo-conservatism out in search of caricatures of bleeding-heart liberals, and ask them condescending (sometimes sexist) questions. Then edit in a few clips from movies to provide extra-condescending commentary on everyone\u2019s answers to make everyone involved sound as stupid as possible. Fun!\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nThe last time one of these segments came on our radar Watters was in Denver trolling this year\u2019s 420 celebration . This time he left the pink collar-popped polo at home, apparently thinking a regular man-suit was a better troll at a Hillary event. The most satisfying shut-down of his annoying smugness comes after managing to ask a young woman the offensive question, \u201cDo you have a crush on Bill Clinton\u201d and getting the answer, \u201cI have a crush on Hillary.\u201d He doubles down on the asshole factor, asking incredulously, \u201cYeah? Do you go that way?\u201d \u201cI am bisexual,\u201d she answers, \u201cso yes.\u201d\n\nAfter stumping someone with the question \u201cWhat would you say is Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest accomplishment as Secretary of State?\u201d and editing in some crickets he segues into the inevitable Benghazi. Always Benghazi. Not to make any point, mind you\u2014just to keep the word floating there as a rally cry against her impending candidacy. Can\u2019t blame him\u2014O\u2019Reilly\u2019s cohorts are going to need something new now that \u201cObamacare\u201d isn\u2019t going to cut the mustard anymore.\n\nWatch above to piss yourself off, and then look at this and forget about the whole thing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly sent his perennially collar-popped bro Jesse Watters out to interview Hillary Clinton fans lined up to get her autograph at a recent book signing.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly sent his perennially collar-popped bro Jesse Watters out to interview Hillary Clinton fans lined up to get her autograph at a recent book signing.", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly sends resident douche to interview Hillary Clinton fans", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/223151/bill-oreilly-sends-resident-douche-to-interview-hillary-clinton-fans/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2014/06/Screen-Shot-2014-06-17-at-12.10.50-PM.png", "height": 397}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly sent his perennially collar-popped bro Jesse Watters out to interview Hillary Clinton fans lined up to get her autograph at a recent book signing.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "bill o\\'reilly,hillary clinton,hillary clinton book signing,jesse watters,news", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-17T17:00:49Z", "modified_time": "2014-06-17T16:44:16Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfa5\"", "article_summary": "Bill O\u2019Reilly sent his perennially collar-popped bro Jesse Watters out to interview Hillary Clinton fans lined up to get her autograph at a recent book signing in New York.\nIt\u2019s a time-tested rubric for \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d: Send a caricature of neo-conservatism out in search of caricatures of bleeding-heart liberals, and ask them condescending (sometimes sexist) questions.\nCan\u2019t blame him\u2014O\u2019Reilly\u2019s cohorts are going to need something new now that \u201cObamacare\u201d isn\u2019t going to cut the mustard anymore.\nThis time he left the pink collar-popped polo at home, apparently thinking a regular man-suit was a better troll at a Hillary event.\nWatch above to piss yourself off, and then look at this and forget about the whole thing."}
