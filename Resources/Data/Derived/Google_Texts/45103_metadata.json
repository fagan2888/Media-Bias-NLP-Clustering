Rick Snyder, left, and Mark Schauer (Photo: Detroit News )\n\nThere's no shortage of television campaign ads this fall that only tell half of the story.\n\nCandidates are bombarding viewers with commercials in a last-ditch attempt to change minds or reinforce convictions \u2014 especially in Michigan's close governor's race \u2014 as voters cast absentee ballots or get ready to attend the polls on Tuesday.\n\nHere's a look at four ads airing in the campaign between Democrat Mark Schauer and Republican Gov. Rick Snyder.\n\nTitle:\"Knees\"\n\nSponsor: Republican Governors Association\n\nContent: \"Mark Schauer. The last time in Lansing he supported taxes on: Gas. Internet Sales. Income. Inheritance. Pop (really). Computer manufacturers. Home cleaning and lawn care services. Even bottled water. Now Schauer wants to expand taxes on business but is murky on the details. Politicians. Mark Schauer taxed Michigan to its knees. His tax and spend ways won't get us back on our feet.\"\n\nAnalysis: In the state House and Senate, Schauer did vote for the taxes or tax hikes listed, but several had bipartisan support.\n\nFor example, he joined lawmakers in Republican ex-Gov. John Engler's 4-cent-a-gallon 1997 gasoline tax hike to fix roads. The rate went from 15 cents a gallon to the current 19 cents.\n\nA $1.35-billion combination of an income tax boost and short-lived tax on such services as lawn care and cleaning was the key part of a bipartisan deal that ended a brief government shutdown in 2007.\n\nSchauer proposed a 20-cent-a-gallon bottled water tax in 2007 during debates about Michigan groundwater pumping by large bottling companies. He was a co-sponsor of a failed 2004 bill to include pop in the 6-cent state sales tax.\n\nThe ad's business tax claim refers to vague statements Schauer has made about possibly seeking to reduce the corporate tax rate while broadening the tax base if elected.\n\nTitle: \"Faces\"\n\nSponsor: Democratic Governors Association\n\nContent: The narrator says: \"The faces of Rick Snyder's priorities. Alayna Hester in a larger class because of Rick Snyder's education cuts. Jacqueline Payne paying higher property taxes from Rick Snyder. Mike Bauer paying Rick Snyder's new retirement tax. Now Rick Snyder's administration officials. Jon Braeutigam got a 90-percent pay raise to $333,000 a year. Robert Brackenbury and Greg Parker received 82-percent pay increases. Tell Rick Snyder he's got the wrong priorities.\"\n\nAnalysis: The ad touches on measures early in Snyder's first term to fix a billion-dollar structural deficit, then skips to 2013 raises given to three key Treasury Department investment officials.\n\nThe pay raises are accurate and were approved by the bipartisan Civil Service Commission. Snyder said they are in line with salaries they would command if they decided to take their skills elsewhere.\n\nOn education, Democrats have relied on outdated data to claim Snyder cut school funding $1 billion in 2011. The $1 billion figure doesn't account for an extra $455 million Snyder spent in 2011 on school districts with employee retiree costs and $100-per-pupil grants for schools that performed \"best practices.\" Overall, education funding has increased $1.1 billion.\n\nBut that picture is more complicated. Snyder has used $783 million of the increase to cover teacher retirement costs school districts otherwise would fund, rather than sending the money directly to schools.\n\nThe minimum state per-pupil grant has increased 1.4 percent since fiscal year 2011. When adjusted for inflation, schools are getting less money for classroom operations.\n\nSnyder and lawmakers did remove a tax exemption protecting most pensions from the 4.25 percent state income tax to raise $350 million in revenue. But the tax status of pensioners born before 1946 is unchanged. The tax is phased in for others, with the full bite hitting those born after 1952.\n\nHomestead property tax exemptions were made less generous.\n\nTitle: \"Slashing\"\n\nSponsor: Michigan Republican Party\n\nContent: An older female actress talks about the Affordable Care Act of 2010, saying Schauer \"voted to slash funding for Medicare by $700 billion. That's your money. The insurance companies made a killing. And you lost what's rightfully yours.\"\n\nAnalysis: This ad's contention is misleading.\n\nSchauer served one term in Congress and voted for the law that scaled back payments to hospitals and insurance companies that offer Medicare Advantage plans, resulting in a $716 billion projected savings from 2013 to 2022, according to a 2012 estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAnnual Medicare spending continues to rise, but the reduced payments for Medicare Advantage plans are expected to slow growth in the entitlement program, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nAARP, which backed the Affordable Care Act, has said claims that Obama and congressional Democrats raided Medicare to pay for the Affordable Care Act are a \"myth.\"\n\nTitle:\"Potential\"\n\nSponsor: Mark Schauer's campaign\n\nContent: Schauer talks directly to voters. \"There's so much potential here in Michigan, but Gov. Snyder's economy is only working for the wealthy. I'm Mark Schauer, and I have a plan to bring back Michigan's middle class. First, I'll reverse Rick Snyder's billion-dollar cuts to our schools \u2014 because good jobs come from a good education. Next, I'll end Rick Snyder's tax breaks for corporations that send our jobs overseas and help businesses create jobs here.\"\n\nAnalysis:\n\nSnyder eliminated the Michigan Business Tax and created a flat 6 percent tax on corporate profits, resulting in 95,000 small and medium-size businesses no longer paying $1.8 billion in taxes. The owners of those firms now pay the 4.25 percent individual income tax on their profits \u2014 instead of both.\n\nSchauer's contention that the economy isn't working for average Michiganians ignores the fact that 254,000 non-farm jobs have been created in the state since December 2010 \u2014 the month before Snyder took office \u2014 at an average weekly wage of $860 or $44,720 annually across all sectors, according to state statistics.\n\nOn education, Schauer has not said specifically how he will pay for a $1 billion increase in education spending.\n\nSchauer's claim that Snyder gave businesses tax breaks \"even if they ship jobs overseas\" is rooted in a $1.6 million grant the Ada-based Amway Corp. got from Snyder's Michigan Economic Development Corp. in 2012 for relocating its Nutrilite production plant from California to Kent County.\n\nThe MEDC says the Amway subsidiary has not yet received any money because of delays in relocating jobs to Michigan. Schauer's campaign admits it is relying on Amway's past outsourcing to China to tie the two issues together.\n\ngheinlein@detroitnews.com\n\nVoting information\n\nAbsentee ballots\n\nRegistered voters can apply for an absentee ballot through their local city or township clerk if they are:\n\nAge 60 years old or older.\n\nUnable to vote without assistance at the polls.\n\nExpect to be out of town on Nov. 4.\n\nAre in jail awaiting arraignment or trial.\n\nUnable to go to the polls on Election Day due to religious reasons.\n\nWorking as an election inspector outside of their precinct of residence.\n\nVoters can search for their local clerk's contact information online at www.Michigan.gov/vote.\n\nDeadlines\n\nRequests for getting an absentee voter ballot mailed to you must be received by a voter's clerk no later than 2 p.m. Saturday.\n\nUnder state law, township and city election clerks must keep their offices open until 2 p.m. Saturday to allow for absentee voting.
