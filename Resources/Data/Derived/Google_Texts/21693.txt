Chicago became the latest U.S. city to see its financial prospects dragged down by its pension obligations when Standard & Poorâ€™s changed its outlook to negative from stable, while affirming its A-plus bond rating.

"The outlook change reflects our view of the risks involved in how the city will address its upcoming, large pension payments," Standard & Poor's credit analyst Helen Samuelson, said in a statement.
