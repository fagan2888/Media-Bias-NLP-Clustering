The awards are named in honor of former Rep. Randy \"Duke\" Cunningham , who epitomizes the iconic modern scandal.\n\nOur celebrity judges -- Julieanne Smolinski, Dan Savage, Hendrik Hertzberg and Susie Bright -- waded their way through all 28 finalists in 7 categories, and selected the winners.\n\nCheck out the lucky nominees and the reader emails that selected them here. And now, without further ado, the winners:\n\n\n\nBest Scandal -- General Interest: Bob McDonnell\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Chris Christie\n\nMy favorite part of Bridgegate was probably the catchphrase, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\" So good, right? You can hear the palms being lustily rubbed together.\n\nYes, okay, there's no concluuuuuuuusive evidence that Christie knew that his aides were doling out a little old fashioned lane closure justice, which makes it kind of a lame gotcha. But who doesn't love a revenge plot where the victims are being served a cold dish of Being Very Inconvenienced? It's petty, it's passive\u00adaggressive...it's Jersey.\n\nDan Savage: Bob McDonnell\n\nBefore we start can I just say how much I miss Rob Ford? He got my vote in every category for which he was nominated last time around\u2014and I loudly protested the injustice of Ford not being nominated in those few categories he was excluded from in 2013. Reading over this year's list of nominees was a bit depressing. All the nominees are worthy but there is no one of Rob Ford's stature or caliber to be found on this year\u2019s list. Illness, exhaustion, and the voters of Toronto conspired to ruin Ford politically\u2014and that's a tragedy for lovers of political scandal everywhere.\n\nOkay, my runner-up in this category is Chris Christie and the never-ending Bridgegate scandal. The whole thing was pure New Jersey\u2014from the petty abuse of power to the vainglorious presser to all those lieutenants being thrown under all those buses. I hate to go all MSNBC on you, dear reader, but we\u2019re going to have more on Bridgegate in the coming year. David Wildstein and Bridget Anne Kelly have to be sitting on some dirt\u2014dirt that is likely to come out in 2015 as their former boss prepares to run for prez\u2014so Chris Christie may yet win in this category. But not this year.\n\nMy pick for Best Scandal - General Interest is Bob & Maureen McDonnell, the former governor and first lady of Virginia, who were found guilty on multiple corruption counts for taking \"gifts\" from a wealthy Virginia businessman in exchange for political favors. McDonnell is an anti-gay Christian conservative who got his law \"degree\" at Pat Robertson's Regent \"university.\" McDonnell ran on a \"family values\" platform\u2014he pimped his wife and kids on the campaign trail and promised to \"defend\" marriage from same-sex couples\u2014and then, after he was indicted, McDonnell threw his wife under the bus. Everything was his wife\u2019s fault: she was crazy, greedy, and scary and poor Bob couldn't do anything but stand helplessly by while his wife accepted money and gifts\u2026 including gifts for him. The jury didn't buy it and in 2015 Mr. and Mrs. McDonnell will be defending marriage from inside a prison.\n\nSusie Bright: Former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki\n\nThe Angel of Death herself blanches at the VA's indifference to pain. There is no saving grace here, only an unforgivable abyss. No waiting list.\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: Bob McDonnell\n\nThe General Interest nominees are strikingly milder this time than in most previous years. I blame the Obama Administration, which has consistently failed to meet the standards of poltroonery set by its predecessor. The Shinseki offering, for example, was wholly without entertainment value. Far from being a juicy scandal of the traditional type, it was a sad instance of chronic bureaucratic sclerosis for which a personally honorable Cabinet officer was obliged to take the fall. The Republican House\u2019s creation of fake scandals such as the Benghazi \u201ccover-up\u201d and the I.R.S.\u2019s \u201cpersecution\u201d of Tea Party activists was itself a scandal worthy of nomination, but these failed to make the finals.\n\nA generation or two ago, the Mississippi nursing home videographer guy would have been the type of arrested-development, post adolescent libertarian whose ability to damage himself and others would have been limited to writing unpublished letters to his local newspaper and importuning his friends, if he had any, to read \u201cAtlas Shrugs.\u201d Cellphone video and the Internet have made it possible for such people to humiliate themselves before a wider public. As scandals go, though, this one is small beer.\n\nI reckon that the heavy favorite will be the Governor Chris Christie Fort Lee New Jersey Traffic Jam, with its excellent visuals (the Fatty Arbuckle-like protagonist, the sleazy aides, the majestic bridge, the idling cars) and fine musical score (the Springsteen-Fallon duet). My problem with it is that Christie\u2019s initial press conference persuaded me that he didn\u2019t know about it in advance, and I\u2019m still persuaded. Nor has evidence emerged that he made a Nixonian effort to cover it up afterwards.\n\nTherefore my vote goes to the McDonnells. Theirs is the poignant story of a striving upper-middle-class couple brought down by a cheesy Republican economy and their own unchristian longing for the designer dresses, expensive wristwatches, and private plane rides that their one-percenter overlords take for granted. Drowning in credit-card debt and underwater real estate, Bob and Maureen accepted shiny objects and solicited multiple six-figure \u201cloans\u201d from a dietary-supplement zillionaire whose cure-alls they clumsily promoted. Today the former Governor of Virginia and his now-estranged wife are convicted felons, pleading for the kind of judicial mercy they would once have denounced as mollycoddling. Their tale is squalid and almost too sad, but as an emblem of our hard-hearted, money-worshipping times it\u2019s hard to beat.\n\nBest Scandal -- Sex and Generalized Carnality: The Palin Clan\n\n\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Investigator David Nieland\n\nI have to hand it to David Nieland and his scrotum of Elvish mithril. This one has a little of everything: Hookers! Florida! IRONY. A prostitution scandal investigator resigning over his own prostitution scandal? Just typing that, I involuntarily twirled my mustache. It's like a health inspector entering a restaurant, waltzing up to a table, and farting on a sandwich.\n\nDan Savage: The Palin Clan\n\nWhenever the Palin kids make the news\u2014teen pregnancies, on-and-off-again engagements, hate speech eruptions, drunken brawls, etc.\u2014I like to pretend that the news is about the Obama girls and then imagine what the RWNJs on Twitter and Breitbart and Redstate would have to say about it. The Obama girls were slammed for failing to treat the annual pardoning of a Thanksgiving turkey with the solemnity it deserved. (Sorry, but looking bored and rolling your eyes are the only appropriate responses to this idiotic ritual\u2014and this ritual isn\u2019t just stupid, it\u2019s soured by how few human beings President Obama has pardoned during his presidency.) So imagine the reaction if Sasha and Malia got involved in a drunken brawl at a party\u2014with mom and dad there, screaming and yelling and throwing punches themselves. The commentary and handwringing would be loud and long\u2014and the dog whistles would be loud enough to wake Lee Atwater.\n\nSusie Bright: The Palin Clan\n\nDespite the absence of bonafide insertion shots, the bodacious Palin borrachos nevertheless make every media occasion a dead ringer for early 90s VHS sequel porn. Suckers are played for Money Shots; we endure interminable boredom between blasts of sweat and hairspray. It's not their fault they're tan, photogenic, and prone to Zappa-esque \"Valley Girl\" loops of brio. They're just drawn that way.\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: The Palin Clan\n\nThe Palins. As Josh says, no sex\u2014but plenty of flesh, much of it bruised and bleeding. It\u2019s a whole country-music song cycle, with lyrics by the Anchorage police department and stunt work by the first family of political reality television. The violence is spectacular but family-oriented and resulting in no serious injury and probably not even much physical pain, given the analgesic properties of such prodigious quantities of booze. Sarah, her brawling brood, and their fellow revelers deserve special commendation for choosing, in this instance, not to exercise their Second Amendment rights.\n\nBest Scandal -- Local Venue:Local TV station KSTP\n\n\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Monica Wehby\n\nI happen to not believe that Republican women exist, having never seen one with my own eyes or held a moonbeam in my hand. So it was weird for me when the GOP rounded up a bunch of their hottest moms to run for office under the auspices that the \"war on women\" was the invention of delusional cat ladies who probably just mega on their periods.\n\nOne such 2nd amendment superbabe was Monica Wehby: baby\u00adsaving doctor, dog person, friend of the Koch brothers AND of the sisterhood. Unfortunately she was also kinda stalky. Believe me, it upsets me more than anybody that you cannot ring your ex-boyfriend's doorbell until he gets so scared that he calls the cops and be a viable congressional candidate. Now I'll never be a girl senator.\n\nDan Savage: Local TV station KSTP\n\nThe mayor of New York City and the mayor of Minneapolis should get together and form a support group for liberal big city mayors who are being smeared by buttsore police departments working in cahoots with hack conservative media outlets. (The New York Post in Bill DeBlasio\u2019s case, KSTP in Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges\u2019 case.) Hodges was accused of flashing gang signs when she was photographed standing next to a black man\u2014Hodges pointed at the man, Colbert-style, and the man, a neighborhood activist, pointed back at her. Police officers attacked the Mayor Hodges, accusing her of palin\u2019 around with felons and gangbangers. Like DeBlasio, Hodges is attempting to reform her city\u2019s police department, hence the \u201cscare whitey,\u201d Fox-News-style smear.\n\nSusie Bright: Cliven Bundy\n\nIn the Johnson County Range Wars of 1892, they didn't propose to \"use women as human shields,\" as Cliven does. He's special that way.\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: Local TV station KSTP\n\nEach nominee\u2019s story was interesting in its own way. The Montana/Dartmouth/Stanford poli sci fiasco was a case study in academic cluelessness. The Cliven Bundy standoff, though not precisely a scandal, was a useful window into two uniquely American cults: anti-Constitutional sheriff worship and Fox News. The Monica Wehby implosion was good news if you happen to be a Democrat, but I detected nothing truly scandalous in her behavior. So she went through a couple of bad breakups? What of it? She put out the same health care proposal as some other Republicans? That\u2019s \u201cplagiarism\u201d?\n\nI\u2019m going with Pointergate, a real-life \u201cAnchorman\u201d comedy. The Ron Burgundy-like pomposity of the local \u201cEyewitness News Team,\u201d the laziness of its concept of \u201cinvestigative reporting,\u201d the idiocy of any suggestion that the nice liberal lady mayor of Minneapolis was knowingly \u201cflashing gang signs\u201d in order to incite lethal violence\u2014these add up to a small journalistic scandal, one that weirdly prefigures the current slanders against the mayor of New York for supposedly encouraging the murder of police officers.\n\nCraziest Campaign Ad: Tie between Joni Ernst and the members of the Michigan Republican Party\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Wendy Davis\n\nVERY strong showing on all counts, and obviously I should feel personally affronted by the \"sad single lady fuckin' the president\" one, but there's NOTHING funnier than the opening line of Wendy Davis' hilariously bonkers attack ad: \"A tree fell on Greg Abbott.\" Seriously. Just play it. Play it a couple times.\n\nDan Savage: Tie between Joni Ernst and the members of the Michigan Republican Party\n\nHow do you choose between the sounds of pigs having their nuts cut off and the sight of badly animated sharks puking up money? You don\u2019t. Top honors in this category go to both Joni Ernst\u2019s \u201cmake \u2018em squeal\u201d ad and the Michigan Republican Party\u2019s ad attacking Rep. Gary Peters (now Senator-Elect Gary Peters) for taking donations from airborne and airsick money-stuffed sharks.\n\nSusie Bright: Joni Ernst\n\nJoni Ernst gets my video vote for incisors so sharp and white I can feel the bacon screaming.\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: The members of the Michigan Republican Party\n\nThe craziest is the Sharknado spot. But if there were a Golden Duke for the cleverest, it would go to the disappointed Obama girlfriend ad. It\u2019s a pack of lies, of course\u2014that goes without saying. But it handles a very treacherous metaphor with great assurance and, yes, sensitivity.\n\nBest Campaign Gaffe and/or Goof: Alison Grimes\n\n\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Sen. Vincent Sheheen\n\nInterviewer: Senator Sheheen, freestyle for us! Sheheen: ... Sheheen: ... Sheheen: Escort whore out the door\n\nDan Savage: Alison Grimes\n\nGrimes gave Mitch McConnell a run for his (huge piles of) money and for a minute or two things looked promising. But toppling the GOP\u2019s Senate Minority Leader wasn\u2019t in the cards. (Fun fact: I originally wrote, \u201ctopping the GOP\u2019s Senate Minority Leader wasn\u2019t in the cards.\u201d Ha ha! Now let\u2019s all try not to picture that.) The GOP wave was so big that Grimes didn\u2019t have a chance, of course, but she may have lost by just a bit less if she had admitted to voting for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012\u2014and running on Obamacare, which has been a huge success in Kentucky, instead of from it? That might\u2019ve helped too.\n\nSusie Bright: Rick Scott\n\nMiss Rick is inspired by Tallulah Bankhead: \"Nobody can be exactly like me. Even I have trouble doing it.\"\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: Alison Grimes\n\nNot even close: Alison Grimes.\n\nOutstanding performance in the art of trolling: Stephen Colbert\n\n\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Nancy Pelosi\n\nExcitable leprechaun vagina and enemy of unpooped on floors Chuck Johnson is a troll par excellence, but I'm afraid if I give him an award, he will poop on my floor. Instead, I give Nancy Pelosi nine of out ten \"Oh Damn Gurls\" on this one.\n\nDan Savage: Stephen Colbert\n\nStephen! Stephen! Stephen!\n\nSusie Bright: Stephen Colbert\n\nColbert invented \"Speaking Truthiness to Power.\" The man lends trolling a good name.\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: Stephen Colbert\n\nThis isn\u2019t really fair\u2014he\u2019s a professional and the rest of them are amateurs\u2014but:\n\nStephen Colbert, may he live long and prosper.\n\nWeirdest Conservative Freak Out: Tie between Sean Hannity/Karl Rove and Andrea Tantaros\n\nJulieanne Smolinski: Sean Hannity and Karl Rove\n\nKarl Rove knows what chai is!\n\nDan Savage: Andrea Tantaros\n\nIf you have to tell \u2018em you\u2019re awesome, you\u2019re not.\n\nSusie Bright: Andrea Tantaros\n\nTantaros' ancestors are weeping in \"awe\" at their daughter's ignorance. Even the Dogs of War blink, but not Andrea. One day these craven-istas at Fox are going to get down on their knees and beg for a second chance, a wit-pro program, a moment of silence. \u2014And that last wish, they will receive.\n\nHendrik Hertzberg: Sean Hannity and Karl Rove\n\nThis real scandal is this whole business of the President returning the Marine Guards\u2019 salute. It goes against standard military-civilian protocol. President Eisenhower did it once in a blue moon anyway, but always in specific situations that cast him in the role of retired five-star General as well as current Commander-in-Chief. When Reagan came along, he made a regular thing of it. Now, of course, it\u2019s politically mandatory, especially for liberals. No doubt Obama would prefer to knock it off, but that would set off another War on Christmas over at Fox News. It\u2019s the same with his American flag lapel pin. My guess is he\u2019d rather not wear one. He\u2019s old enough to remember the little Hero of Socialist Labor lapel pins worn by Khrushchev and the lineup of Politburo hacks atop Lenin\u2019s Tomb. Who wants to be like them? Medals are for soldiers, not civilians, and so are salutes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Talking Points Memo", "description": "TPM is pleased to announce the winners of the Eighth Annual Golden Dukes recognizing the year's best purveyors of public corruption, outlandish behavior, The Crazy and betrayals of the public trust.
