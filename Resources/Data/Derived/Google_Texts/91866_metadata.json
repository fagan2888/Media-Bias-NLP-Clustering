Can't find a taxi on a busy Friday afternoon? Use your smartphone to summon an Uber car for door-to-door black-car service. Hard to find reasonably priced lodging in a popular destination? Log onto AirBnB and book yourself a stay for a few days in a stranger's house or apartment. Need some temporary help at the office? Fire up eLance and browse the profiles, ratings and work histories of contractors from all over the world to find the talent and skills you need.\n\nWhether the term \"disruption\" is being overblown at the moment or not, the truth is technology continues to progress unabated, and nowhere is that more visible than in HR and workplace technologies. Workplaces and work have been fundamentally transformed (or disrupted), over the past half-century by the introduction, acclimation and eventual widespread adoption of newer and better tools and technologies. From telephones to typewriters, personal computers to smartphones, almost nothing about the modern workplace would be familiar to employees of a generation ago. How, where, when and even with whom we work are all dramatically impacted by the kinds of technologies we (and our organizations) choose to leverage to support the workforce.\n\nToday, enabled by a thriving marketplace for new and innovative tools, HR leaders have arrived at an important and potentially transformative point themselves. Making the best decisions about HR technologies can help empower organizations to meet their business objectives, support and engage their employees, attract and engage sought-after talent, use data to drive workforce decision making, and continue to transform work and workplaces.\n\nRather than try to predict or speculate on what might happen with HR and workplace technologies in 2015 and beyond, I want to call out three areas of focus for HR leaders that, while not necessarily representing brand new developments, still offer the second wave of adopters (i.e., most organizations) the potential opportunity to \"disrupt\" their own organizations and their HR and talent processes.\n\n1. Mobile recruiting becoming mainstream.\n\nThis may seem like a pretty obvious and \"2011\" kind of recommendation, but some studies still suggest that fewer than 20 percent of large organizations have invested in fully mobile-enabled recruiting sites and candidate-application support. And if large, well-funded organizations are still lacking in this important area, it's likely that small and mid-size organizations are also lagging. \"Mobile\" isn't really a category anymore, not in the general sense. The expectations, demands, and habits of more and more candidates simply require that any public-facing technology-be it your career site or the latest social messaging platform-be fully functional across devices. If there isn't a well-functioning app or responsive site, with full capability that candidates expect, they simply will not \"stick\" when accessing your career opportunities.\n\nSo whether you work with your current applicant-tracking-service provider, or engage one of several excellent add-on technologies that provide mobile-recruiting support, 2015 should be the year when you ensure your organization no longer has to talk about \"mobile\" recruiting-it will just be \"recruiting\" and it will work on every device for every candidate, recruiter and hiring manager.\n\n2. Rethinking your time tracking and workforce scheduling.\n\nWithout attempting to get into the deep details of the requirements U.S.-based organizations must adhere to for Affordable Care Act compliance, many of which take effect in 2015, chances are that there will be impacts on HR and workforce-management processes, including additional scrutiny of employee time tracking, scheduling and benefits enrollment. You need an accurate picture into hours worked for full-time and part-time staff, the ability to analyze that data in real-time in order to determine benefits eligibility, and ideally, insight into the financial and operational impact of workforce decisions around this data. Finally, you need an effective way to report on this data to ensure and document compliance in this area.\n\nIn addition to Affordable Care Act compliance, modern workforce planning and scheduling technology offers organizations the opportunity to engage employees more actively in scheduling, provide new and better forms of interaction and communication, and simplify what can be a complex, time-consuming process for frontline managers, freeing them up for more customer-facing activities. You might have to use the ACA as the \"excuse\" to invest in workforce management tech in 2015, but the ultimate benefits should be far greater than mere compliance.\n\nNewsletter Sign-Up: Benefits\n\nHR Technology\n\nTalent Management\n\nHR Leadership\n\nInside HR Tech\n\nHRENow\n\nSpecial Offers\n\nEmail Address\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n3. Better insights into the workforce composition-and the impacts on organizational performance.\n\nOne trend in 2014 was the increased focus and attention that was paid to diversity, particularly gender diversity in the technology industry and in technical roles across organizations in general. Some leading technology companies made headlines by releasing their workforce demographic and gender-diversity data in aggregate, for leadership positions and for those holding \"technical\" roles. It was no surprise that, in almost all of these circumstances, males were overrepresented. But this phenomenon is not just a problem in technology firms; it is seen in finance, engineering and, as the recent and unfortunate hack of Sony Pictures Entertainment revealed, in the entertainment industry.\n\nIronically, with many still considering gender inequality a tech-industry problem, perhaps technology solutions that can provide better insights into the makeup of the workforce-on basic data points such as gender, but also on almost limitless employee attributes and skills-are where the important first steps in addressing workforce diversity will be launched. The challenge for HR leaders going forward will be much more complex than simple aggregate workforce-diversity reporting; it will lie in how, where, and to what end to delineate talent management strategies, (talent attraction, development, retention, rewards and more) to improve diversity and to track these results with the end goal being to improve business performance.\n\nAs you begin 2015 and work on your important plans and goals for the year, keep these areas of focus in mind. All three represent important elements of a modern, technology-influenced and enhanced approach to delivering HR services, keeping the organization compliant and delivering high-value strategic insight to the organization.\n\nSteve Boese is a co-chair of HRE's HR Technology \u00ae Conference and a technology editor for LRP Publications.
