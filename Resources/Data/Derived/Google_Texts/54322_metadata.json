These are compounds that could help detoxify and eliminate cancer-causing free molecules in the body, says lead researcher Mosbah Kushad, who is a crop scientist.\n\n\n\nThey also found that the amount of these molecules differed according to strain, with the highest quality horseradish having the most. But even in the lower grades, the detection of the enzymes in horseradish is noteworthy, says Kushad of the study, which appears in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Chemistry.\n\n\n\n\"No one is going to eat a pound of horseradish,\" Kushad points out, but adds that luckily, a teaspoon of the pungent condiment is sufficient to get the benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 2016 NewsmaxHealth.
