Complete with handwritten motivational signs and the typical smattering of campaign literature and photos, the home serves as the base of operations in one of the most interesting primaries of the 2014 cycle.\n\nIn the 2nd Senatorial District \u2014 where Onder is running against Rep. Chuck Gatschenberger and former Rep. Vicki Schneider \u2014 there is no Democrat on the November ballot, making the August 5 primary victor the de-facto future senator from the O\u2019Fallon and St. Charles areas.\n\nOnder is a former state representative, like both of his opponents. His profile was raised in 2008, when he left the statehouse to run against Blaine Luetkemeyer and several other candidates to succeed Kenny Hulshof in Congress. Onder finished 2nd in the crowded primary, but didn\u2019t swear off politics for good.\n\nWhen it became clear the senate seat he lived in would become open, Onder threw in his hat and considerable name recognition into the fray. Onder is relying on voters to see him as the most socially conservative candidate on the ballot.\n\n\u201cOne of my opponents called me a single issue candidate,\u201d Onder said, referring to his stringent pro-life position. \u201cIf the single issue is to preserve and defend liberty under the constitution, then I plead guilty.\u201d\n\nOnder secured the Missouri Right to Life endorsement in his race early on before locking down Missouri Club for Growth, a fiscally conservative organization vocally battling Nixon on tax issues. Onder also likes to remind voters of his tough immigration bill from 2008, which he calls \u201cthe strongest in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of my opponents voted for Obamacare exchanges,\u201d Onder said. \u201cOne of them just voted for the largest tax increase in Missouri history. I think it\u2019s clear I have the best record as an effective conservative leader.\u201d\n\nOnder\u2019s staunch opposition to abortion and vocal involvement in stem cell research issues led some in his own party to worry whether he\u2019d be able to work in the fluid, ever-compromising body of the Senate. But he says he\u2019s the kind of man who can compromise.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m always, always going to be pro-life, but as they say, the devil is in the details,\u201d Onder said. \u201cIf it becomes about deciding to maybe let one issue go so we can get another issue across the line, I\u2019m not opposed to that. But it\u2019s a session-by-session, bill-by-bill decision.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the devil-in-the-details applies to basically every issue, Onder said. His staunch distaste for Obamacare aside, Onder says an appropriate overhaul and reform of the Medicaid system might just persuade fellow conservatives like him to favor expansion.\n\n\u201cAgain, it\u2019s the details,\u201d Onder said. \u201cIf we could really overhaul it and then get the waivers associated with that overhaul and see some serious reform, I\u2019d be open to the possibility of expanding eligibility.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not all social issues for Onder. Recent tax fights are the just the beginning, and he says he\u2019ll look closely at Missouri\u2019s regulatory climate if elected to office. And while he agrees that there need to be lower taxes, he urged caution on some of the bills Nixon vetoed for criticism of being \u201cgiveaways.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen every bill,\u201d Onder said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to lower the tax burden on everyone. It\u2019s more logical to me to have a broad tax base with a low rate than to carve out these special breaks for some people and not for all. Let\u2019s focus on lowering the burden across the board.\u201d\n\nOnder believes he can get large numbers of his supporters to the polls on primary day, which he says is key in a low turnout election. He\u2019s hoping that some constituents will be inspired to come vote against the sales tax increase for transportation projects, or to come support Missouri\u2019s so-called \u201cRight-to-Farm\u201d amendment.\n\nThe 19-year veteran of medicine and father of 6 is cautiously optimistic about his chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been blessed by an outpouring of support from conservatives,\u201d Onder said. \u201cThey recognize that I\u2019m their candidate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "O\u2019FALLON, MO. \u2014 Dr. Bob Onder has converted the front half of his Lake St. Louis home into a full tilt campaign headquarters.
