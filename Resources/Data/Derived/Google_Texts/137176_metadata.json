The U.S. military, which commands the operation, said enemy fire was not the cause of the crash.\n\nKasaesbeh, who comes from a prominent Jordanian Sunni Muslim family, is the first pilot from the international coalition known to have been captured by Islamic State.\n\nThe Sunni Muslim jihadist group has a history of killing enemy soldiers that it captures on the battlefield and beheading Western civilians that it takes hostage. Many of the captives it has killed are Shi'ites or non-Muslims, but the group has also executed Sunnis for fighting alongside its enemies.\n\nHis family has pleaded for mercy.\n\n\"I do not want to describe him as a hostage. I call him a guest,\" his father, Saif al-Kasaesbeh, told Reuters Television.\n\n\"He is a guest among brothers of ours in Syria Islamic State. I ask them - by the name of God and with the dignity of the prophet Mohammed, peace be upon him - to receive him as a guest of his hosts and treat him well,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Reuters Television; Writing by Peter Graff; Editing by Louise Ireland)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jordan is one of several Arab countries participating in the U.S.-led military mission", "title": "Father asks Islamic State to treat captured pilot son as 'guest'", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2014/12/25/Father-asks-Islamic-State-treat-captured-pilot-son-guest", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-crash_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2014/12/25/Father-asks-Islamic-State-treat-captured-pilot-son-guest", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-crash_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Jordan is one of several Arab countries participating in the U.S.-led military mission", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Kasaesbeh, who comes from a prominent Jordanian Sunni Muslim family, is the first pilot from the international coalition known to have been captured by Islamic State.\n\"He is a guest among brothers of ours in Syria Islamic State.\nFirst Lieutenant Muath al-Kasaesbeh, 27, was captured after his jet crashed in northeast Syria on Wednesday during a bombing mission against the militants.\nThe Sunni Muslim jihadist group has a history of killing enemy soldiers that it captures on the battlefield and beheading Western civilians that it takes hostage.\nJordan is one of several Arab countries participating in the U.S.-led military mission to bomb fighters from the Islamist group, which holds territory in both Syria and Iraq."}
