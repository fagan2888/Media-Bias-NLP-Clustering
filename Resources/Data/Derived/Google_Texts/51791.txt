Jessica Steindorff, the driver of the Prius involved in the fatal multi-car pileup in which Caitlyn Jenner was also a driver, is condemning the former Olympian’s acceptance of ESPN’s Arthur Ashe Courage Award, saying she needs to stop promoting herself and “take responsibility for her actions.”

“I find it difficult to understand how the culture we live in can honor a person who is responsible for taking a life and injuring several others with both an award and a reality show,” Ms. Steindorff, a talent manager who attended Wednesday’s ESPY Awards as a guest, told Entertainment Tonight. “For an individual who is such a positive role model in many aspects of her life, Caitlyn has failed to do the right thing and take responsibility for her actions.”

“I would hope that someone who seems to greatly value the importance of human existence would be more sensitive to the fact that she ended another person’s life. Sadly we are living in a tabloid society,” she added.

Ms. Jenner, formerly Bruce, was involved in the crash on Malibu’s Pacific Coast Highway, which resulted in driver Kim Howe’s death.

Ms. Steindorff filed a personal injury lawsuit blaming the reality TV star for the crash, claiming she drove “negligently, carelessly, recklessly and wantonly.” Ms. Steindorff is seeking more than $25,000 in damages, ET reported.

Ms. Jenner, who has not been charged with a crime, was also named in a wrongful death suit filed May 1 by Ms. Howe’s stepchildren.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department continues to investigate the crash.
