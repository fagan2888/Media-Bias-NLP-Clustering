SAUTEE NACOOCHEE, Ga. (AP) - A new state historic site is set to open for tours in north Georgia next week.

The Department of Natural Resources says guided tours will start at Hardman Farm in White County March 5.

The farm’s main house was built in the Italianate style by Captain James Nichols in 1870. It was originally known as West End because it was at the west end of the Nacoochee Valley.

The family of Dr. Lamartine Hardman, who served as Georgia’s governor from 1927-1931, was the last owner. The family preserved it for many years and donated it to the state in 1999.

Visitors can go on a guided tour of the house and dairy barn.
