Adrian Peterson has been indicted in a child abuse case.

The 29-year-old NFL football player was booked at the Montgomery County jail on Saturday (September 13) and posted bond for $15,000.

“The charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son. This indictment follows Adrian‘s full cooperation with authorities who have been looking into this matter. Adrian is a loving father who used his judgement as a parent to discipline his son,” Adrian‘s lawyer shared in a statement to TMZ.

His lawyer added, “[Adrian] used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas. Adrian has never hidden from what happened. He has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours. Adrian will address the charges with the same respect and responsiveness he has brought to this inquiry from its beginning. It is important to remember that Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury.”

The news comes at the heels of the controversy with Ray Rice, who was suspended from the NFL for beating up his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in a hotel elevator earlier this year.
