It could be important.\u2019\u201d Arizona State University postdoctoral scholar Amanda Tachine (pictured at the Center for Indian Education at the Tempe campus Sept. 8) is being recognized for her work with Native American students at a White House \"Champions of Change\" event this week in Washington, D.C. Photo by: Deanna Dent/ASU News Download Full Image It most certainly was. The call was from the White House. They wanted Tachine and her family to come to Washington, D.C., and pick up a national award. Tachine, a postdoctoral scholar at ASU\u2019s Center for Indian Education, will be one of 11 young women honored Sept. 15 as \u201cChampions of Change\u201d by the White House in the Office of the First Lady. In addition to honoring the group for empowering their communities, the goal of the event is to inspire girls and young women to recognize their potential for leadership as educators, advocates, artists and entrepreneurs. Among her other efforts with Native students, Tachine\u2019s work on a two-tiered college-access mentoring program caught the eye of those organizing the Washington event. The program will feature remarks by Valerie Jarrett, senior advisor to the president and chair of the White House Council on Women and Girls; Tina Tchen, chief of staff to the first lady and executive director for the White House Council on Women and Girls; and NASA astronaut Serena Aunon. On hand will also be Tachine\u2019s husband, her two children, her mother and her aunt. \u201cAmanda is a gift, and her work as a Champion of Change is fitting,\u201d said Bryan McKinley Jones Brayboy, President\u2019s Professor, director of the Center of Indian Education and ASU\u2019s special adviser to the president on American Indian Affairs. \u201cShe is engaged in changing not only the ways that institutions engage first-year American Indian students but also the ways that we think about their challenges. Amanda is forcing us to engage these students as resources, trendsetters and those to whom we should listen to most closely.\u201d Listening to students is what Tachine\u2019s academic career has been all about. With her dissertation, based on 10 interviews she conducted with Native American students, \u201cMonsters and Weapons: Navajo Students\u2019 Stories on Their Journeys Toward College,\u201d Tachine is bringing the struggles of Native American students to light. Before coming to ASU in August, Tachine was the former leader of Native SOAR (Student Outreach, Access and Resiliency) in Tucson. It was there where she fostered relationships between Native American graduate students and staff to encourage and represent Native American undergraduates, who in turn provide mentorship to high school students. \u201cA lot of blame is put on Native Americans that they\u2019re not strong enough, savvy enough, economically smart enough to get the resources to go to college,\u201d said Tachine, who is from Ganado, Arizona, considered the heart of the Navajo Nation. \u201cI\u2019ve found that there are structural barriers for Native American students that don\u2019t exist for others. We have a myriad of issues, which include poverty, homes without electricity or running water, crime, and social conditions like diabetes. There is a constant fear in the back of their heads. \u2018How am I going to pay for college? How am I going to pay for tuition? How am I going to pay for gas for my car? How can I run off to college when my family at home needs me and my financial support?\u2019\u201d As the child of a single-parent household, Tachine said she can identify with many of the Native American students she encounters. Her mother was a teacher and hinted of tough financial times. Her grandparents and aunt pitched in to help whenever they could, and they stressed that education was the only solution to a better life. \u201cMy passion has always been to help my community and my people. That teacher has always been tucked away inside of me,\u201d Tachine said. \u201cThe feeling grows stronger as I get older now that I have two kids, nieces and nephews. I\u2019m constantly asking, \u2018What can we do to help our little ones?\u2019 I don\u2019t want them to have the hurdles that I went through because I know they still exist.\u201d When Tachine returns from the East Coast, she hopes to continue advancing ideas and strategies for Native American student success.
