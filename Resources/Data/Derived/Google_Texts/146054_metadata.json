Ted Cruz, the stalwart conservative from Texas, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday night that he was ready to work alongside President Obama to ensure meaningful compromise with the White House. Then he stood up and essentially told a cheering Austin crowd that he would never surrender to the president.\n\nWhich version of the senator is going to return to Washington?\n\nHe earnestly explained to The Daily Beast how he hoped Republicans could find common ground with the Obama administration on corporate tax reform, for example. \u201cFor the last two years, the president has been unwilling to work with Republicans on anything,\u201d he said from his room at the W Hotel in Austin. \u201cNow I hope\u2026 the White House will stop being a partisan attack machine all the time and will work together on jobs, on economic growth, on opportunity. That\u2019s where we should be working together.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized the military sexual-assault bill and anti-Hamas legislation he had worked on with Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, but old roles are hard to shake. Cruz has built his reputation\u2014and a national following\u2014in part due to his willingness to confront the president, not for working with him.\n\nSo minutes after his remarks to The Daily Beast, he walked over to the stage at a theater next door, and pledged before a cheering Republican crowd to \u201cdo everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare\u201d\u2014an issue with which there is no prospect of working with the White House.\n\nBefore hundreds of party faithful, Cruz mocked Democrats for trying to make Texas blue, and joked gleefully that there was a maintenance man already headed to Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s office to change the sign on the door.\n\nOne of two Cruzes will emerge: It could be the Cruz who told The Daily Beast Tuesday evening, \u201cIt is very much my hope and intention to work with anybody, Republican or Democrat, to solve the real problems facing this country\u201d; or it could be the Cruz would characterized the last few years to the Austin crowd as the \u201cera of Obama lawlessness.\u201d\n\nThe talk of compromise could be the result of the heady, pro-Republican results that streamed in from every direction Tuesday evening. Or it could be that Republicans are planning a campaign to show Americans they can be trusted to govern\u2014perhaps even from the White House after 2016.\n\nSen. John Cornyn, currently the second-ranking Republican senator, certainly seemed to suggest this could be the start of a new era of Republican legislation. He pledged that governance is going to be a key focus of the Republican Senate.\n\n\u201cCampaigns are one thing, and governing\u2019s another. And I hope we can separate the two,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cWe can only go halfway. The president\u2019s going to have to meet us halfway, but I think we need to try. What we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working. For anybody.\u201d\n\nCornyn said that Republicans could find common ground with the president on trade agreements, patent reform, energy field, tax reform, as well as getting \u201csome of the money that is parked overseas back here in the United States, and be used productively to create jobs here at home.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy, however, to see how this fragile willingness to reach across the aisle could be shattered. If the president were to, despite the result on Election \u02dcight, move ahead with an executive order on immigration reform\u2014as ABC News\u201d Jon Karl has suggested he will\u2014it would be a slap in the face to this Republican sentiment.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "timkmak"}, "keywords": "Google, u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201411051300, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The Texas senator told The Daily Beast he was ready to work alongside President Obama, but he\u2019s telling crowds of Republicans something altogether different.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Which Ted Cruz is Going to Washington?", "tags": "syndication:syndication-google,topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Which Ted Cruz is Going to Washington?\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/05/the-two-faces-of-ted-cruz.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/05/the-two-faces-of-ted-cruz/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47174178.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/05/the-two-faces-of-ted-cruz\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-05T13:00:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Tim Mak\",\"tags\":[\"syndication-google\",\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "Google, US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Tim Mak", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-11-05T13:00:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/tim-makhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/05/the-two-faces-of-ted-cruz", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The Texas senator told The Daily Beast he was ready to work alongside President Obama, but he\u2019s telling crowds of Republicans something altogether different.", "title": "Which Ted Cruz is Going to Washington?", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/11/05/the-two-faces-of-ted-cruz.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/11/05/the-two-faces-of-ted-cruz/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1415225354281.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/t/tim-mak", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "Ted Cruz, the stalwart conservative from Texas, told The Daily Beast on Tuesday night that he was ready to work alongside President Obama to ensure meaningful compromise with the White House.\nHe earnestly explained to The Daily Beast how he hoped Republicans could find common ground with the Obama administration on corporate tax reform, for example.\nCruz has built his reputation\u2014and a national following\u2014in part due to his willingness to confront the president, not for working with him.\nThe Texas senator told The Daily Beast he was ready to work alongside President Obama, but he\u2019s telling crowds of Republicans something altogether different.\nWhich version of the senator is going to return to Washington?"}
