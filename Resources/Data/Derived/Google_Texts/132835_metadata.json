If an employee\u2019s salary is already at market value, the budget suggests a 1 percent cost of living increase.\n\n\u201cThis plan attempts to get us in a more competitive market with the comparisons that we\u2019ve made,\u201d explained Brads. \u201cTo get groups to market, we analyzed every position in the division and we are very pleased with where we are in terms with this recommendation.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Brads will present the school division\u2019s recommended budget to the Culpeper County Board of Supervisors, the county\u2019s governing body that provides county funding.\n\nThe supervisors will finalize the county\u2019s budget and tax levies in May.\n\nThe school division\u2019s proposed budget also includes six new teaching positions.\n\nThe projected budget, in addition, suggests implementing a self-funded health insurance plan rather than the fully funded option. Essentially, a self-funded health plan is where an employer provides health or disability benefits to its employees with its own funds.\n\n\u201cThis will reduce our overall exposure to some of the taxes and fees associated with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d explained Brads. \u201cThat will save us quite a bit of money and hold employees harmless.\u201d\n\nFollowing the budget approval, school board member Elizabeth Hutchins complimented the recommendations.\n\n\u201cIt covers areas that really hadn\u2019t been for a long time and I appreciate the work on that,\u201d said Hutchins.\n\nDuring delegations before the vote, Matt Orman, an educator for 13 years in Culpeper and president of the Culpeper County Education Association, also applauded the recommended budget.\n\n\u201cI have some members with me tonight wearing red because I wanted them to stand out. It\u2019s time to stop cuts and as you know red means stop,\u201d explained Ortman. \u201cI\u2019ve seen cut after cut after cut year after year. And fortunately we have a budget that is supporting us now. Not just teachers, but nurses, bus drivers, and food services and we appreciate that.\u201d\n\nCCPS Finance Director Jeff Shomo shared that he\u2019s still pleased with the lower diesel prices for buses. This year, the school division pays $3.31 per gallon and he predicts shelling out $2.86 a gallon next fiscal year, possibly saving $102,000 next school year.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "starexponent,news,local_news,featured", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Progress", "description": "Proposal headed to board of supervisors includes raising starting teachers' salary from $39K to $41,972, 1 percent increase for other employees.", "title": "Culpeper school board approves $86.7 million budget plan", "url": "http://www.dailyprogress.com/starexponent/culpeper-school-board-approves-million-budget-plan/article_7b931754-ea4a-11e5-ad68-0320b560b84d.html", "image": "http://www.dailyprogress.com/app/NewSafeImage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,10152170988485008,10101111419558100", "app_id": 366214100134806}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/dailyprogress"}, "keywords": "starexponent,news,local_news,featured", "google-site-verification": "sz237c0jgdTfDm1AqlrYHFhfluLF3VvL35nkk6TaMaM", "description": "Proposal headed to board of supervisors includes raising starting teachers' salary from $39K to $41,972, 1 percent increase for other employees."}, "article_summary": "The Culpeper County School Board approved the school division\u2019s recommended operating budget for the 2016-17 school year during Monday\u2019s regular meeting potentially increasing next year\u2019s spending plan by $3 million.\nThe $86.77 million budget, which includes food services, increases the current $83.7 million financial plan by 3.6 percent.\nLoudoun County teachers\u2019 average starting salary is $47,975 while new Culpeper teachers earn $39,000.\nTo bring new teachers salaries to the midpoint, the proposed budget recommends starting their salaries at $41,972 and addressing other employees\u2019 salaries with step increases.\nDuring delegations before the vote, Matt Orman, an educator for 13 years in Culpeper and president of the Culpeper County Education Association, also applauded the recommended budget."}
