(This rider was written, it turns out, by Citigroup, if you can believe that \u2014 but of course you can.)\n\n- allows for cutting existing pensions paid to already retired people;\n\n- among other anti-environment measures, cuts the Environmental Protection Agency budget by $60 million and halts funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service to determine whether certain birds should be placed on the Endangered Species List \u2014 birds that happen to live where energy companies want to drill;\n\n- cuts funding to an already beleaguered I.R.S., making audits of tax avoiders less likely;\n\n- and, yes, weakens mandating healthier school food, lowers nutrition standards for the Women, Infants and Children program and directs experts to ignore environmental factors in determining the new dietary guidelines.\n\nThis brings us to the Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for carrying out nutrition labeling in restaurant chains. (This is part of the Affordable Care Act.) When federal agencies propose new regulations, they\u2019re required to do an evaluation to make sure the costs do not outweigh the benefits. Sounds logical enough. But this is the government we\u2019re talking about, and recently the F.D.A.'s interpretation of this order has taken a turn for the absurd. This summer, the F.D.A. discounted by 70 percent the benefits of increased tobacco legislation. Why? That was the value of the \u201cpleasure\u201d lost by smokers, according to the agency, pleasure these addicts would miss by giving up a nasty habit.\n\nMass- and hyper-produced food, of course, is ostensibly not as dangerous and arguably more pleasant in its consumption than cigarettes. So the agency was required to discount the \u201cpleasure\u201d lost by eaters who would be discouraged from buying fast food because they determined that its massive calorie load and pathetic nutrition profiles were perhaps not desirable. In an \u201calternative\u201d analysis, the cost of that pleasure was put at $5 billion over 20 years, which is about the same as the low end of the estimated value of the health benefit we\u2019ll derive by eating less junk.\n\nWhen asked, an agency representative pointed out that this analysis was not included in the \u201cfinal benefits estimation.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo which I say, \u201cSo what? The damage is done.\u201d Because you can bet that the labeling regulations will be taken to court, and that every piece of ammunition will be deployed in the struggle to keep Americans in the dark about the quality of food we are being fed.\n\nThere are, of course, the obvious and almost inane questions like, \u201cHow could the F.D.A. possibly know that eaters will lose \u2018pleasure\u2019 by eating healthy food as opposed to unhealthy?\u201d \u201cWho is the F.D.A.'s pleasure analyst?\u201d \u201cHow can a voluntary choice by a better-informed person to eat better food and improve his or her life possibly be a \u2018cost\u2019 \u201d? And finally, \u201cHow can you possibly fix a monetary value on this?\u201d (By the way, this whole scheme, and that\u2019s what it is, was cooked up by a lone graduate student, who determined that \u201chealthier foods are worse off on other dimensions such as taste, price, and convenience.\u201d Clearly, this is a person who\u2019s never prepared broccoli raab with oil, garlic and chiles.)\n\nBut there\u2019s a bigger question: How can intelligent, thoughtful, science-based legislation survive attacks by well-funded lobbyists \u2014 many of whom have worked in the very agencies they besiege \u2014 who now seem to be able to include sneaky \u201cfixes\u201d that might embarrass even a Republican-led Congress (it\u2019s hard to publicly argue against listing new endangered species) into a spending bill that must be passed and is essentially veto-proof?\n\nThe answer: It cannot. Not without active and ongoing demonstration of passion by people who care. If you\u2019re reading this, and any of it resonates, that\u2019s you.\n\nRemember, in the 1960s, few in Congress were civil rights advocates, and Lyndon Johnson was hardly anti-segregation, yet citizen action brought big changes. Barack Obama did not come into office as a supporter of gay rights, yet \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d fell under his watch, and gay marriage is now legal in a majority of states. There are a dozen other examples of people claiming their rights through struggle, the latest being that two years ago almost no one was talking about a livable minimum wage, and now $15 an hour is making its way into reality.\n\nThe 2014 election was a wake-up call; when the reactionaries fully take over Congress, not only school lunch standards but every standing bit of progressive legislation, from the new Affordable Care Act to the 42-year-old Clean Water Act, will be ruthlessly attacked. To defend these programs, we must recognize that politicians will not do anything smart unless they are pushed, and it\u2019s up to us to push them.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime":
