Perez's wife told the New York Daily News, "He was a hero then and a hero now." And Leka's family member said the 24-year-old saved his sister before "the car hit him, and he went into the wall."

Four people in total were injured, including the 52-year-old driver who was reportedly in serious yet stable condition. It's not yet clear why the crash occurred.

New York Post says police believe the driver may have had a seizure while behind the wheel. WABC reports, as of Sunday morning, no charges have been filed.
