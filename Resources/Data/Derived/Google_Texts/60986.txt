Two CNN correspondents were reportedly injured during a live broadcast Thursday morning while covering the chaos in Sao Paulo, Brazil, ahead of Thursday’s opening match of the World Cup.

Correspondent Shasta Darlington suffered “a minor cut on her arm” and producer Barbara Arvanitidis “was hit on her wrist” by a tear gas canister fired by police during a protest in Sao Paulo, Mediabistro reported, citing CNN’s Brian Stelter.

Video of the broadcast showed Miss Darlington duck out of the way after a loud shot is heard. “That hit my arm!” she is overheard yelling as protesters scatter out of the way amid the smoke. Miss Darlington quickly jumped back into the broadcast to finish her segment.

Miss Darlingtontweeted thanks Thursday morning to BBC News’ Wyre Davies and a group of protestors who apparently helped her during the frenzy.

Demonstrators have descended on Brazil’s largest city ahead of the games to protest the exorbitant costs and corruption invested in staging the World Cup. Police fired tear gas into several crowds Thursday morning and at least one person was arrested.
