On its face, the idea of cutting spouses out of employer health care plans sounds like a good cost-cutting move. The Employee Benefit Research Institute, however, says not so fast.

A decision by United Parcel Service late last year to eliminate health benefits for spouses who were eligible for coverage through their own employer drew national attention. EBRI went so far as to say it could have been a “tipping point” in employment-based health benefits, in part due to provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.
