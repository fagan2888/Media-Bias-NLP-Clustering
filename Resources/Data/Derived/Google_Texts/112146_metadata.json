Mu\u00f1oz spoke at a recent lecture entitled \"Hobby Lobby, Obamacare & the Future of Religious Freedom\" at the University of Oklahoma\u2019s Fred Jones Auditorium.\n\nDuring his February 18, 2015 presentation, Mu\u00f1oz outlined his employer\u2019s criticisms of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mandate under the Affordable Care Act (also known as \u201cObamacare\u201d) that requires employer health plans to provide contraceptive health care. Mu\u00f1oz linked those complaints to similar arguments made by Hobby Lobby in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court case which granted Hobby Lobby a religious exemption from providing contraceptives to its employees.\n\nAccording to Mu\u00f1oz, the Institute for Medicine recommended that HHS cover all FDA-approved contraceptive methods. This included the drug Ella, which some believe to be an abortifacient. When HHS announced its plan, Mu\u00f1oz said several religious groups and institutions, including the University of Notre Dame, began pressuring the White House to make exemptions for them. Instead, the White House issued a narrow exemption that exempted only groups partaking exclusively in religious activity.\n\n\u201cSo very few groups qualify for the exemption,\u201d said Mu\u00f1oz. \u201cIn essence, accommodation was given to non-profits like the University of Notre Dame, not to for-profits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is the burden substantial? $475 million,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said, referring to the fine Hobby Lobby would have to pay if it didn\u2019t pay for the contraceptives.\n\nTo make his case, Mu\u00f1oz described what he called the court\u2019s \"evolving view\" on religious freedom, citing the 1993 passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, among other things.\n\nMu\u00f1oz said the court\u2019s ruling on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act played a crucial role in the recent Supreme Court decision concerning Hobby Lobby, which argued that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that the company\u2019s insurance cover certain contraceptives was a burden on its faith, that its faith was sincere and that the burden was substantial.\n\nMu\u00f1oz also challenged the government\u2019s argument that a corporation cannot have a sincerely held belief. Mu\u00f1oz countered by asking, \u201cIf a corporation can be responsible and ethical, why can\u2019t it be religious?\u201d\n\nMu\u00f1oz concluded by saying that the United States is deeply divided on human sexuality. The divide is so deep, Mu\u00f1oz said, that subjecting matters of sexuality to law can only cause trouble.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we should try to de-politicize matters of human sexuality. Not everything needs to be a political battle,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cGiven our fundamental disagreement on human sexuality, perhaps it might be best if we simply did not make anybody pay for anyone else\u2019s birth control.\u201d\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nKGOU is a community-supported news organization and relies on contributions from readers and listeners to fulfill its mission of public service to Oklahoma and beyond.
