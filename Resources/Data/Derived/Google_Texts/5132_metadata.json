A WFI below 50 indicates a short-term job contraction while an index above 50 indicates job expansion.\n\nThe WFI for Colorado dipped slightly from 71.3 in June, but the state\u2019s economy \u201cis healthy and improving,\u201d said Creighton University College of Business MacAllister Chair and economics Prof. Ernie Goss.\n\nThe index is produced monthly by Creighton University and Applied Information Management, a non-profit based in Omaha with an office in Denver.\n\nIn July, the largest number of online postings in Colorado were for sales jobs, followed by openings in management and customer service.\n\nAs a share of state employment, the largest number of job openings in descending order were finance, engineering and customer service.\n\nNationwide, Colorado moved up to No. 16 from No. 17 in June.\n\nNorth Dakota ranked No. 1, followed by Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Kansas and Iowa. Goss attributed their high rankings to energy and agriculture.\n\nMississippi was at the bottom, followed by Maine at No. 49, Georgia, No. 48, New York, No. 47, and California at No. 46.\n\nGoss sounded a note of caution when it came to wages in Colorado.\n\nHe said weekly earnings in Colorado rose 1.4 percent year-over-year, which he said is not keeping up with inflation, which rose 2 percent year-over-year.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be an economist to know that is not good,\u201d Goss said. \u201cYou\u2019re moving backwards, folks. If you\u2019re getting a 1.4 percent raise \u2014 not enough to keep up with inflation.\u201d\n\nHoward Pankratz: 303-954-1939, hpankratz@denverpost.com or twitter.com/howardpankratz", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Job growth healthy in Colorado, but wages are lagging inflation", "title": "Job growth healthy in Colorado, but wages are lagging inflation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/13/job-growth-healthy-in-colorado-but-wages-are-lagging-inflation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140813__pizzap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140813__pizzap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-13T12:54:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T09:05:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9775\"", "article_summary": "He said weekly earnings in Colorado rose 1.4 percent year-over-year, which he said is not keeping up with inflation, which rose 2 percent year-over-year.\nJob expansion proceeded at a healthy pace in July in Colorado, hitting 69.5 percent on the AIM WorkForce Index, but wages aren\u2019t keeping pace with inflation.\nThe WFI index, which ranges between 0 and 100, is a ratio of unique online job postings and the number of unemployed in Colorado.\nA WFI below 50 indicates a short-term job contraction while an index above 50 indicates job expansion.\nAs a share of state employment, the largest number of job openings in descending order were finance, engineering and customer service."}
