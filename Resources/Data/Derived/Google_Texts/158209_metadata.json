With the tagline \u201cmaximize human potential,\u201d participants at the third annual Voice and Exit festival explored the frontiers of entrepreneurship and innovation towards a utopia of utopias \u2014 from bossless organizations (holacracy) and seasteading to \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d and the philosophy of action.\n\nAlthough diverse in content and audience, the event\u2019s distinct name signals the unifying themes or \u201chuman algorithm,\u201d as promoted by cofounder Max Borders: \u201cvoice\u201d refers to persuasion and peaceful association, and \u201cexit\u201d refers to creating one\u2019s own systems and alternatives to escape the status quo. Borders advocates \u201ccriticism through creation\u201d and \u201cnon-coercive means of making social change.\u201d\n\nOrganizers divided the two-day event into three phases: seeds, sprouts, and harvest \u2014 moving from short speeches on provocative ideas to small-group discussions and then finally to action plans on Sunday. The festival, which included talks on health and physiology, also featured various artistic performances and live painting.\n\nDylan Evans was one of the featured speakers, a British author now based in Guatemala, and he explained the respect for individuality and creativity on account of there not being a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d ideal.\n\n\u201cA utopia really is \u2026 a space that gives room for lots of different people to do their own way of living, to set up their own experiment. Some of those will fail; some of them will attract more people,\u201d but \u201cthat broad framework of freedom to innovate\u201d is what Evans was there to promote.\n\nThe youthful crowd heard from John Mackey, Whole Foods Market founder and chief executive, as he promoted mission-oriented ventures. He sought to break down the distinction between for-profit and nonprofit organizations, and remove the bad wrap that the former type receives.\n\n\u201cBusiness is fundamentally good, because it is the greatest value creator in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cFor-profit business creates far more value than all the governments and all the nonprofits added together, by an exponential factor.\u201d He added that business is also ethical, \u201cbecause it\u2019s based on voluntary exchange.\u201d\n\nOne of the recurring terms was creative destruction. Education entrepreneur Isaac Morehouse of Praxis, for example, explained how he was providing an accelerated and targeted form of higher education, for those not willing to wait through the conventional four-year bachelors degree. He echoed the sentiment of a fellow speaker, author and media entrepreneur Ryan Holiday, who dropped out of college to engage with a wider audience.\n\nThe event website explicitly shunned politics as obsolete \u2014 \u201cthe era of force is passing away\u201d \u2014 but that didn\u2019t mean policy was irrelevant to attendees. Many speakers addressed the tension between the eagerness to innovate and the lag time of laws and government. Jeffrey Tucker of Liberty.me opined that in the meantime many people would suffer the wrath of protectionism, and shared sadness at the life prison sentence imposed on the founder of the online black-market platform Silk Road.\n\nOthers offered potential arbitrage opportunities and ways out from underneath such laws. Michael Strong explained the ZEDEs or special development zones in Honduras, while Randolph Hencken and Joe Quirk went over the prospects and challenges associated with starting communities on the ocean. Despite many setbacks, they remain hopeful of finding a friendly host nation that will permit such a project on their waters.\n\nAlong the same lines, Alex Tabarrok, an economics professor of George Mason University, spoke of the moral problem of border constraints. He described these as a grave barrier to human progress and a form of discrimination. He believes that \u201cthe big picture, however, is in the right direction. Most notably, take a look at the European Union.\u2026 That is an incredible achievement in humanity.\u2026 Now people are free to move across these countries.\u201d\n\nSara Robertson was a local attendee who volunteered to man one of the booths in exchange for entry. She came \u201cjust to learn new thoughts and ideas,\u201d and described herself as a non-scholastic, an opponent of traditional education. It turned out \u201ca little more on the nerdy side \u2026 really free thinking,\u201d although she enjoyed the bio-hacking portion.\n\nMax Borders shared that attendance exceeded expectations, and that half a dozen attendees hoped to start spin-off events in other cities. Although he was excited about that, \u201cthere\u2019s always a question of growing too fast, getting too big for your britches,\u201d he said. \u201cBut certainly we would like to replicate this.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For 400 free thinkers, one utopia wasn't enough.
