His father, Mark, was a former CU pole vaulter and a Buffs fan as he and his wife, Karen, a University of Denver graduate, raised their family in coastal northern California. And Ty\u2019s older brother, Erik, also was a CU graduate.\n\nTy said, \u201cI was \u2026\u201d\n\nThe pause was brief, but noticeable.\n\n\u201d \u2026 not. I wasn\u2019t really a Buffs fan.\u201d And he went on to say, \u201cI bleed green and gold.\u201d\n\nTo this day, I\u2019m not certain what he had been about to say, but I know he called an audible in midsentence. That\u2019s thinking on your feet, a handy trait for a Broncos second-round draft choice about to be thrown into the mix as a possibility to protect Peyton Manning and be a part of zone-blocking schemes, whether at right tackle \u2014 the position John Elway cited \u2014 or left guard.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you need to put your five best offensive linemen out there no matter what,\u201d Sambrailo said Saturday at Dove Valley. \u201cIf I\u2019m one of the keys in the cog to make that happen, that will be it.\u201d\n\nThe issue of how an eventual high draft choice with CU ties drew only mild interest from the Buffs before the 2010 national signing date is pertinent now only because it underscores that Sambrailo, a successful alpine skier in the regional youth ranks as recently as 2005, was a late bloomer. That\u2019s common for high school linemen, yet there was risk- taking and savvy projection required for the Steve Fairchild staff to make the commitment.\n\nFor a redshirt year and then his first three seasons with the Rams, Sambrailo grew, improved and learned the nuances of the offensive line, playing left and right guard and both tackle spots. By the time he was a senior in 2014, he was the entrenched starter at left tackle and suddenly also the leader after the departure of cornerstone center Weston Richburg and three other starters from the season before.\n\nAfter CSU coach Jim McElwain cracked me up at his news conference on the eve of the first preseason practice a year ago with a comparison to the animated opening of the 1970s sitcom \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d saying Sambrailo was the big partridge the little partridges were following around, Ty immediately did some YouTube research.\n\n\u201cI guess I get it,\u201d he mused a few minutes later, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t watch enough of it to get any character analysis.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s Sambrailo. Dryly funny, sometimes self-effacing and, well, a little goofy. I met his parents and other family at their tailgate before CSU\u2019s game in Reno, Nev., where the CSU flag hanging from Mark\u2019s pole vault pole marked the spot. Now he\u2019s moving on, and the Sambrailo family will follow.\n\nFriday night, several minutes before soon-to-be Ring of Famer Rick Upchurch announced the Broncos\u2019 pick in Chicago, Sambrailo got the call at a family gathering. He stepped away to talk, and when he re-entered the room, Upchurch was at the microphone. And the reaction was tumultuous.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty crazy, exciting and a lot of fun,\u201d Sambrailo recalled.\n\nLast season the Broncos were a mess at right tackle, leading to the move of Louis Vasquez out from guard. The new staff, including line coach Clancy Barone, has Vasquez back at guard, and Michael Schofield \u2014 the 2014 third-round draft choice \u2014 and Sambrailo will get chances to claim the starting spot. Schofield\u2019s absence from the active list on game days last season, and his lack of development, were points of contention between the front office and the John Fox staff.\n\nIf Sambrailo\u2019s upward curve of improvement \u2014 almost the opposite of the 12-year-old kid skiing downhill \u2014 continues, he was a steal at No. 59.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei @denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Rookie Ty Sambrailo from CSU has CU ties too", "title": "Frei: Rookie Ty Sambrailo from CSU has CU ties too", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/03/frei-rookie-ty-sambrailo-from-csu-has-cu-ties-too/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-03T20:16:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:47:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University, Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "Last August, after a Colorado State practice, I asked Rams offensive tackle Ty Sambrailo if he ever had been a Colorado Buffaloes fan.\nNow he\u2019s moving on, and the Sambrailo family will follow.\nLast season the Broncos were a mess at right tackle, leading to the move of Louis Vasquez out from guard.\nHis father, Mark, was a former CU pole vaulter and a Buffs fan as he and his wife, Karen, a University of Denver graduate, raised their family in coastal northern California.\nThe question was a natural, and not only because the Rams\u2019 2014 opener against CU was imminent."}
