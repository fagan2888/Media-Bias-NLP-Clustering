Admission revenue dropped from $18.4 million in October to December 2012 to $17.2 million for the same period in 2013.\n\nOfficials for the Concord, N.C.-based company blamed a weak economy, including high unemployment and high food, fuel and health care costs for a drop in revenue and ticket sales.\n\nThe 2013 revenue was also hurt by bad weather at a NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Sonoma Raceway and rain-delayed, shortened and rescheduled NASCAR Sprint Cup and Nationwide races at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Kentucky Speedway.\n\nSpeedway Motorsports\u2019 big revenue-maker is its increasing annual TV broadcast rights deals with Fox and NBC, which help make up for declining ticket sales. NASCAR broadcast revenue for 2013 was $199 million, including $27.4 million for the last three months compared with $192.6 million for 2012 and $26.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2012.\n\nLas Vegas Motor Speedway President and General Manager Chris Powell said he could not comment on Speedway Motor\u00adsports issues, but he said his facility expects more fans in the grandstand for this weekend\u2019s Kobalt 400 Sprint Cup and Boyd Gaming 300 Nationwide races compared with last year.\n\nPowell said his track is diversifying its non-NASCAR revenue streams because of a dozen distinct race tracks; renting space to auto manufacturing companies that test products and invite dealers; and various businesses such as the Richard Petty Driving Experience.\n\n\u201cWe have nontraditional revenue on non-NASCAR weeks,\u201d Powell said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cTrack rental business has increased a lot over 10 years. We just had a private function Tuesday night attended by several thousand people. Auto manufacturers are spending many dollars. It\u2019s helped replace any shortfalls in any other areas.\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe are doing business about 51 weeks a year with automotive companies on this property. The revenue we\u2019re deriving is noteworthy.\u201d\n\nPowell said there are 1,400 event days annually at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which covers about 1,000 acres north of Las Vegas.\n\nSpeedway Motorsports has identified families and kids as demographic groups to pursue in hopes of growing its fan base.\n\nPowell said his track is using social media to try and capture those fans.\n\n\u201cTime will tell how successful we are with that,\u201d Powell said.\n\nLast year, Las Vegas Motor Speedway had a social media hub at the Neon Garage where racers and industry stars churned out real-time comments, but the social media center will not be returning this weekend, said Jeff Motley, speedway spokesman.\n\nShares of Speedway Motorsports gained 1 cent, or 0.05 percent, on Wednesday to close at $20.01 on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nContact reporter Alan Snel at asnel@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-5273.
