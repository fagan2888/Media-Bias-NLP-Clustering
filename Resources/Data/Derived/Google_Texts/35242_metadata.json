In the meantime, his phone is blowing up with text messages \u2014 many from players lobbying for their teammates to get on the team, he said.\n\nTulo has mentioned that Miami\u2019s Giancarlo Stanton is all but on the team. And he\u2019s hinted the Yasiel Puig is a top candidate. Tulo and Puig were chatting Sunday after a series finale between the Rockies and Dodgers at Coors Field.\n\nTulowitzki also said he will use the derby to honor Yankees veteran Derek Jeter, his fellow AL counterpart captain in the All-Star Game. Jeter, playing in his final season, is a player Tulowitzki has said he long looked up to.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a charity that we get to pick, meaning the captain, with the gold home run balls,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cAnd the charity I\u2019m picking is actually the Turn 2 Foundation, which is the charity he\u2019s been running for a long time. That\u2019s a kind of tribute that I\u2019m gonna do for him.\n\n\u201cBut in return, I\u2019m looking for something from the game from him, as a fan. Whatever it may be.\u201d\n\nThe NL\u2019s home run leaderboard after Sunday:\n\n1. Giancarlo Stanton, Miami \u2026 21\n\n2. Troy Tulowitzki, Colorado \u2026 18\n\n3.
