This week, expect the Nuggets to turn up the heat on their search for a new coach. The process is expected to take most if not all of the month.

The Nuggets are looking to replace Brian Shaw, who was fired in the second half of the season. Their list of candidates is believed to include, but is not limited to Melvin Hunt, who took over as interim head coach when Shaw was fired; former NBA head coach Mike D’Antoni; Golden State assistant coach Alvin Gentry; and Scott Brooks, recently fired as Oklahoma City coach. The Nuggets are looking for a coach who will institute a fast-paced style.

Working in the Nuggets’ favor is that there is only one other vacancy, in Orlando, and there is a deep pool of candidates who are interested. The search contrasts with what happened two years after the Nuggets fired George Karl. Multiple teams were in search of head coaches and the overall field of candidates was more limited.

The Nuggets are expected to travel to meet most of their potential coaching targets rather than bring them into town. The coaching decision will be made by general manager Tim Connelly and team president Josh Kroenke.

For the past few weeks management has been focused on scouting and getting ready for the draft.
