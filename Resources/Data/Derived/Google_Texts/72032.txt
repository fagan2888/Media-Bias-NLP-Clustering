His mind was willing, but his body wasn’t able.

Ventura College sophomore Hironori Koyanagi’s failed to defend his singles title at The Ojai, losing to Irvine Valley’s Javi Velasco 7-5, 6-2 in the Men’s Community College singles final on Sunday afternoon at Libbey Park.

“I am disappointed because I wanted to play my best tennis, and I didn’t. If I had played my best tennis and lost, it would have felt better,” Koyanagi said. “I was really tired today and my legs were dead. I couldn’t move or even really get to balls.”

Koyanagi played three matches on Saturday, including a three-hour, three-set semifinal.

The Ojai marked the final event of Koyanagi’s career at Ventura College. The loss was only his second in the two years he played for the Pirates.

Koyanagi also lost to Santa Barbara City College’s Sasha Hedberg, an Oxnard native, during the regular season this year.

“It’s been a great two years. I guess if I could have won this title, it would be a perfect life at VC. But things can’t be perfect all the time,” Koyanagi said. “It just stinks because the coach from UCSB was here to watch and I didn’t play well.”

Koyanagi became emotional after he lost and was consoled by his teammates and members of the VC women’s team.

“Give credit where credit is due, Javi played awesome. Hiro just didn’t have his legs under him today,” VC coach Nelson Emery said. “But that is what makes Ojai special. It’s not always the best player who wins, it’s the person who survives and keeps surviving.”
