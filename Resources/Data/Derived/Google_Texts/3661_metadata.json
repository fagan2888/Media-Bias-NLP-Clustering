Joe Rice, who missed his share of Christmases while serving overseas as an Army reservist, to post something on Facebook to really make you stop and think:\n\nIn a few hours, it will be Christmas in Afghanistan. I spent three Christmas Days in Iraq. Only on one of them did I have to go out on Christmas Day itself. I found myself praying that I didn\u2019t want to die this day and ruin every future Christmas for my family. I realized that most of the other soldiers I was with were quietly or openly saying the same thing. So, for all those around the world in harms way, we will pray with you \u2026 \u201cPlease God, just not today.\u201d\n\nRice, a Littleton Democrat, served three terms in the House before losing his seat in a GOP wave in 2010. He now is the director of government relations for Lockheed Martin Space Systems.\n\nRice was mayor of Glendale from 1996 to 2003 but resigned when he was shipped overseas. In addition to serving in Bosnia, he was deployed to Iraq five times between 2003 and 2011:\n\n* 1-year deployment, 2003-2004: Main duty was to set up the first post-Saddam Baghdad City Council and then serve as military liaison and adviser to the council.\n\n* 6-month deployment, 2005-2006: Gathered \u201clessons learned\u201d and advised US units on interactions with Iraqi government officials and Iraqi Security Forces.\n\n* 4-month deployment, 2007-2008: Performed same duty.\n\n* 6-month deployment, 2009: Worked on the development of Iraqi Security Forces.\n\n* 7-month deployment, 2011: Working on the final transition/withdrawal and laying the framework for future military and police partnership programs.\n\nRice is a colonel in the Army reserves.
