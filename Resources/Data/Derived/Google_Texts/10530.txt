Mitt Romney is slated to appear on “Fox News Sunday,” amid the MSNBC Melissa Harris-Perry controversy, according to a Jan. 3 article in The Hollywood Reporter. Fox New announced Friday that the former Massachusetts governor and 2012 Republican presidential candidate will be interviewed by Chris Wallace during the Jan. 5 episode of “Fox News Sunday.” Topics include the Affordable Care Act and 2014 Winter Olympics security.

It is highly probable that the topic of MSNBC’s Harris-Perry will come up. As the Examiner previously reported, the host and her guest panel recently made jokes about Romney’s black grandson, Kieran James Romney, who was seated on the former governor’s lap in a family holiday photo.

Harris Perry then took to Twitter to apologize to Romney’s family. “I am sorry. Without reservation or qualification. I apologize to the Romney family,” Harris Perry tweeted, in response to outrage over her comments about Romney’s black grandson during a segment on her MSNBC talk show, “Melissa Harris-Perry.”

According to CNN, the host’s apology continued on the MSNBC website, where it read, “As black child born into large white Mormon family I feel familiarity w/ Romney family pic & never meant to suggest otherwise.” She continued her Twitter apology with, “I apologize to all families built on loving transracial adoptions who feel I degraded their lives or choices.”

“Fox News Sunday” airs on Fox affiliates Sunday morning with an encore on Fox News Channel at 2 p.m. ET, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
