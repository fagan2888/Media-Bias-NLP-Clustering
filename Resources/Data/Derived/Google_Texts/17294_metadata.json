The Korean Central News Agency said the move \u201cwas caused by their joint bid to achieve a higher level in political, economic and cultural relations.\u201d\n\nRelated: Nuclear Treaty with Russia May Be Breaking Down\n\nRussia\u2019s ambassador to North Korea, Alexander Matsegora, said that Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are in frequent contact. \u201cAn active political dialogue is maintained at the highest and high level,\u201d Matsegora told Russian news agency TASS. \u201cThe leaders of the two countries regularly exchange messages.\u201d\n\nMatsegora said that Russia believes there is room for significant expansion of the economic relationship between the two countries. \u201cTaking into account the considerable unused potential, we are not yet satisfied with the level of its development,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot has to be done in this direction in the future.\u201d This would include financial cooperation, as well as trade and investment deals.\n\nRussia\u2019s economy is currently struggling under the dual burden of low oil prices and a regime of international financial sanctions applied last year after Russian troops invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and then began supporting rebels in the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk.\n\nRelated: Putin Pulls Out of Post-Cold War Arms Treaty\n\nNorth Korea doesn\u2019t have much of an economy at all. As has been widely documented, one of its largest exports is its own people, who are hired out to work in third countries, with most of their wages paid not to them or to their families but to the North Korean state.\n\nThe Kim Jong-un regime frequently issues bellicose warnings to the U.S. and to South Korea. Last week, when the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea was attacked during a public appearance by a knife-wielding assailant and seriously injured, North Korea issued a statement officially applauding what it called a \u201cknife attack of justice.\u201d\n\nKim will make his first trip abroad as North Korea\u2019s leader in May, visiting Moscow for a celebration of the end of World War II.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Increasingly isolated from the west over his country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and continued military provocations, Russian President Vladimir Putin is looking elsewhere.
