But right in her introduction, we got a clue otherwise. Smith described the case, Zubik v. Burwell, as, \u201cWhat some are calling the biggest fight for religious liberty waged against ObamaCare to date.\u201d She forgot to mention that others, namely the editorial boards of three major newspapers, are calling it \u201cabsurd,\u201d \u201cextreme\u201d and \u201cresorting to hyperbole.\u201d\n\nFor more fairness and balance, Smith hosted one of the litigants, Sister Constance Veit, of the Little Sisters of the Poor, attorney Mark Rienzi, representing the nuns, and John Garvey, president of The Catholic University of America, who just happened to have the same opinion as the other two guests.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t even try to present the other side of the case. She was all about showing solidarity with her guests. Her first question to Veit was, \u201cThank you for all of your service. You\u2019ve been caring for the elderly and the poor for 28 years now. You took your argument to the Supreme Court today, how did it go?\u201d\n\nThen, in another version of the same question, Smith wanted to know, \u201cWhat essentially, was the court\u2019s response to your argument today?\u201d\n\nBut just in case anyone missed whose side she was on, Smith wrapped up the interview by saying, \u201cJohn, Mark and Sister Constance, thank you to all three of you and Sister Constance, continue your fight, we\u2019ll be watching it.\n\nWhat kind of news anchor advocates this way? A Fox News \u201cstraight news anchor.\u201d\n\nWatch the \u201cfairness and balance\u201d below, from the March 23 The Kelly File.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "ZX9El8OIpP+3vvyiN7da3fjuP9qkpPvNSD2OZXLiktw=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/fox_anchor_encourages_nun_to_continue_your_fight_against_obamacare_contraception_mandate_032316", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Fox Anchor Encourages Nun To \u2018Continue Your Fight\u2019 Against ObamaCare Contraception Mandate"}, "Title": "Fox Anchor Encourages Nun To \u2018Continue Your Fight\u2019 Against ObamaCare Contraception Mandate"}, "article_summary": "A Fox News \u201cstraight news anchor.\u201dWatch the \u201cfairness and balance\u201d below, from the March 23 The Kelly File.\nHer first question to Veit was, \u201cThank you for all of your service.\nSmith didn\u2019t even try to present the other side of the case.\nBut right in her introduction, we got a clue otherwise.\nYou\u2019ve been caring for the elderly and the poor for 28 years now."}
