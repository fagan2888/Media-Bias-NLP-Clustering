Royster Harper said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThe initial decision to cancel the movie was not consistent with the high value the University of Michigan places on freedom of expression and our respect for the right of students to make their own choices in such matters.\u201d\n\nThe film screening will go on as originally planned Friday night as part of the UMix late night activities series, however the school will host an \u201calternative\u201d screening of the PG-rated film \u201cPaddington\u201d in a separate location on campus to provide \u201cadditional options\u201d for students made \u201cuncomfortable\u201d by \u201cAmerican Sniper.\u201d\n\nThe university\u2019s Center for Campus Involvement initially cancelled the event after 300 students and some faculty members signed a letter asking the school to scrap the film showing because \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d propagates \u201cnegative and misleading stereotypes\u201d of Muslims.\n\nOf course, the campus organization was met with plenty of backlash for doing so. A petition to reinstate the screening circulated the university Wednesday, garnering more than 500 signatures in just over 13 hours.\n\n\u201cThe movie \u2018American Sniper\u2019 is not about a racist mass murderer or a criminal,\u201d read the petition. \u201cIt is about a decorated American war hero who served his country valiantly. While we may disagree about the motives and politics of the Iraq War, the movie shows the sacrifice that Chris Kyle made, like so many of his fellow servicemen and women who put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the university prevents a movie like this from being shown, it promotes intolerance and stifles dialogue and debate on the subject and goes directly against the atmosphere UMix purports to provide,\u201d it continued. \u201cAs adults at a public university, we should have the option to view this movie if we so choose and have the opportunity to engage on the topics it presents to come to our own conclusions on the subjects.\u201d\n\nRachel Jankowski, a student at the University of Michigan Law School who started the petition, told Red Alert Politics in a statement, \u201cUniversities should be places where students can express diverse ideas and engage in open debate and dialogue, even if it might make some feel uncomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cStudents should be able to watch movies like \u2018American Sniper,\u2019 so they can be exposed to a broad array of opinions and come to their own conclusions on different issues without being censored by other students who feel these different viewpoints are offensive and should be silenced,\u201d Jankowski added, describing herself as \u201cextremely proud\u201d of the university for reversing its decision.\n\nEven Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh jumped to the defense of \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d and freedom expression in a tweet.\n\nMichigan Football will watch \"American Sniper\"! Proud of Chris Kyle & Proud to be an American & if that offends anybody then so be it! \u2014 Coach Harbaugh (@CoachJim4UM) April 9, 2015\n\n\u201cMichigan Football will watch \u2018American Sniper\u2019!\u201d he wrote. \u201cProud of Chris Kyle & Proud to be an American & if that offends anybody then so be it!\u201d\n\nEarlier on amid the backlash Wednesday, the Center for Campus Involvement announced that \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d would be screened in a \u201cseparate forum\u201d and that \u201cPaddington\u201d would take its place, but the university ultimately decided to completely walk back its cancellation of the event.\n\nWe're planning to show American Sniper in a separate forum that provides an appropriate space for dialogue & reflection. More info to come. \u2014 Campus Involvement (@UMInvolvement) April 8, 2015\n\nSophomore Lamees Mekkaoui, the student who spearheaded the initial protest of the film, dubbed the petition circulated Wednesday \u201ccompletely and utterly moot,\u201d according to the College Fix.\n\n\u201cNo one\u2019s freedom of speech was infringed upon,\u201d she alleged. \u201cIt was just completely inappropriate for a fun and inclusive UMix event.
