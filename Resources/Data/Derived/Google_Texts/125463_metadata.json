He is trying to do it while playing with young linemates who have combined for a grand total of five career goals \u2014 center Mikhail Grigorenko (4) and winger Andreas Martinsen (1).\n\nThe Avalanche\u2019s depth has been additionally diluted by injuries to veteran forwards John Mitchell (oblique) and Alex Tanguay (knee), who both are skating in orange no-contact jerseys at practice. Colorado coach Patrick Roy has shown no signs of wavering in his determination to leave Duchene, a natural center, at right wing on the line with MacKinnon and Landeskog. Duchene has 10 goals in November, tying Claude Lemieux\u2019s franchise record for the month.\n\nThe three young standouts on the line, plus defenseman Tyson Barrie, are the only Colorado draft choices currently on the roster who have been with the Avalanche their entire NHL careers. Tanguay also was an Avalanche draftee (in 1998), but this is his second tour of duty with Colorado.\n\nEspecially during Iginla\u2019s long run with the Calgary Flames, it was a given that any mention of loading up a top line included Iginla. But now he\u2019s 38, still effective, but winding down. As recently as earlier this month, he was on a \u201cRespect Your Elders\u201d line with MacKinnon, 20, also centering Tanguay, 36.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely playing very well,\u201d Iginla, 38, said of the top line after Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cThey\u2019re carrying a lot of the play. The other lines, you have to try to chip in one here. Your focus is to get to be a plus at the end of the night. If you can get a goal for, keep it down against, it helps. You need offense from other guys and other lines.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say that in his long career, Iginla \u2014 who has seven goals and eight assists this season \u2014 never before has played on a line with a Norwegian (Martinesen) and a Russian (Grigorenko).\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been together that long,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cMarty\u2019s a big guy and he works hard and can be physical and be a presence at the net and in the corners. I think with \u2018Grigo,\u2019 you can see his confidence growing and growing. But we have to score. It\u2019s not just about scoring, but about being plus.\u201d\n\nHe noted of the top line: \u201cAs good as they are, on some nights, they might get one, they might get two, and that\u2019s great, you want to chip in and help them out. \u2026 Everyone wants to score every night, but it doesn\u2019t always work out that way. We have to make sure we\u2019re strong.\u201d\n\nMacKinnon seems to have settled in at center after playing most of his first two seasons at wing.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve played the puck pretty well,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cWe\u2019re not really in our own zone a lot, and we\u2019re controlling it offensively. \u2026 I\u2019ve watched a ton of video this year and every day I feel more comfortable, watching how positionally I could be better. It\u2019s a learning process for sure. There are some really good centers you have to play against every night, and against their top D pairing.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or TFrei@denverpost.com\n\nWinnipeg at Colorado\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Saturday\n\nTV/Radio: ALT, 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Andrew Agozzino:\n\nThe Avalanche recalled the 24-year-old left wing Saturday from San Antonio after winger Dennis Everberg cleared waivers and was demoted to the Rampage. Agozzino was leading the Rampage in scoring, with seven goals and 16 points. He played one game with the Avalanche last season, getting an assist in his NHL debut.\n\nNotebook\n\nJets:\n\nFor the second home game in a row, Colorado will be facing an opponent that played the day before. The Jets beat the Wild 3-1 at St. Paul on Friday afternoon. Goalie Connor Hellebuyck made his NHL debut and stopped 14-of-15 shots. The Jets snapped a road winless streak at seven games.\n\nAvalanche:\n\nSemyon Varlamov, yanked during the second period against Ottawa on Wednesday and criticized by coach Patrick Roy after the game, will be back in the net against the Jets. Said Roy: \u201cIt was clear in my mind, (Varlamov) was playing. He will play (against) the Islanders next game, if healthy. He\u2019s our number one goalie. Like I said, I was very upfront with you guys after the game and said the first goal was a bad goal. You even said that in your article and I agree with that. From there, he\u2019s our number one goalie and I\u2019m behind him.\u201d Roy said Everberg, who doesn\u2019t have a point in 15 games this season, hadn\u2019t been playing physical enough or as well defensively as he had as a rookie last season.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche\u2019s top line carrying scoring load; other lines need to help", "title": "Avalanche\u2019s top line carrying scoring load; other lines need to help", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/27/avalanches-top-line-carrying-scoring-load-other-lines-need-to-help/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127___1SM7785p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151127___1SM7785p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-27T18:57:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T04:37:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Especially during Iginla\u2019s long run with the Calgary Flames, it was a given that any mention of loading up a top line included Iginla.\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely playing very well,\u201d Iginla, 38, said of the top line after Friday\u2019s practice.\nAs recently as earlier this month, he was on a \u201cRespect Your Elders\u201d line with MacKinnon, 20, also centering Tanguay, 36.\nHe played one game with the Avalanche last season, getting an assist in his NHL debut.\nTanguay also was an Avalanche draftee (in 1998), but this is his second tour of duty with Colorado."}
