Unseasonably warm temperatures and dry conditions are expected to remain in the Denver metro area through Wednesday, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Both Saturday and Sunday, the temperature is forecasted to reach 56 degrees, significantly higher than the seasonal average of 44. By Monday and Tuesday, temperatures in the mid- to upper-60s are expected.

Monday’s expected high of 67 would be 6 degrees short of the record, set in 1982.

While the metro area enjoys warm and sunny weather, parts of northeast and north-central Colorado are under a hazardous weather outlook Saturday.

According to the National Weather Service, a weak upper-level disturbance may lead to rain showers in the afternoon and light snow overnight. The storm is expected to leave the area by Sunday morning.

By Wednesday, metro temperatures will drop down to the 50s, with seasonal temperatures in the 40s returning by late in the week.

“Expect scattered showers to develop in the mountains by Tuesday afternoon and evening,” the National Weather Service said in a report. “A cooling trend will follow in the later half of the week.”
