An elaborately decorated, 1.5 ton gingerbread village with a hot chocolate brewery and pierogi store on display in Queens was recently named the world’s largest gingerbread village by Guinness World Records.

The village, named “GingerBread Lane” by creator Jon Lovitch, has been on display at the New York Hall of Science in Corona, Queens, since Nov. 17. It was approved by Guinness World Records on Nov. 22.

The new category, created earlier this year, had a minimum requirement of at least 100 buildings, 5.9 inches or more in height, according to Sara Wilcox of Guinness World Records. Mr. Lovitch created a bustling scene of 135 residential buildings and 22 commercial buildings, including a town hall, train terminal, hot chocolate brewery, pie bakery, pierogi store, subway station and fire station, according to Ms. Wilcox.
