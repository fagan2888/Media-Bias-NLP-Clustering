Catanio said Tuesday there were two spots left in the second sauces class March 7 and six open in the appetizers class March 21, though he may schedule more depending on demand.\n\nCatanio said his students need only know basic food preparation to participate.\n\n\u201cI show how to make classical stuff (with) food items in our local community instead of having to spend a tremendous amount of money on high-cost items,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to make it as simple as possible, where they can really apply simple skills and get a great result for something that could be a classical-looking dish.\u201d\n\nHaving completed his apprenticeship in 1980 as sous-chef of the Waldorf Astoria New York, where he cooked for celebrities like Frank Sinatra and prepared several presidential inaugural dinners, Catanio has been a personal chef for the Clintons in Little Rock, Ark. and the opening chef at the Hilton Hotel Pleasanton.\n\nAfter working for six years at a casino in Oregon, he moved to Roseville to be closer to family and started Mealz, a culinary company for cooking classes and catering.\n\nCatanio said he has two other projects brewing in Roseville: He is looking for ways to locally market a vegan-friendly, gluten-free, dairy-free Italian panna cotta ganache dish \u2013 \u201cA lot of people have dietary needs, you know\u201d \u2013 and hopes to find a grant to turn a commercial kitchen into a training center to teach Placer County inmates basic food safety and preparation to make them employable upon release.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
