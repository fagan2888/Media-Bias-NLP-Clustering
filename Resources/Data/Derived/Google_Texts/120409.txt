A Minnesota-based startup has developed a two-shot handgun that looks like a smartphone. It seems to be optimal for concealed carry holders, though given its innocuous look, it could be good for open carry holders, as it won’t lead to confrontations with the police. Yes, it’s legal to open carry without a permit in public in a majority of states, though people who can’t mind their own business, and overzealous anti-gunners, at times call the police on Americans exercising their Second Amendment rights, which occasionally leads to testy exchanges; you can view them on YouTube. For concealed carry holders, no longer is there a worry of accidental exposure (unlawful display) while in public since folks think you're just carrying your smartphone.

The palm-sized firearm is affordable, costing less than $400. For now, it fires a .380 caliber round, though Kirk Kjellberg, said he’s looking to developing a semiautomatic version and others that can chamber different calibers (via CNN):
