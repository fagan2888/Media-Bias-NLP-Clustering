The new research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, may expand that list.\n\n\"We were interested in whether smoking causes more than these diseases that are on the list. And we certainly did find some,\" coauthor Eric Jacobs told Reuters Health. \"The fact that about 17 percent of the extra deaths that occur in smokers were due to causes that were not on the Surgeon General's list was a bit of a surprise to me.\"\n\nIf the findings are applied nationwide, he said, the number of previously-unrecognized smoking-related deaths could be greater than the total number of Americans who die each year of influenza or liver disease.\n\nUntil this study, about 480,000 U.S. deaths each year were believed to be attributable to cigarettes.\n\nThe researchers also found that the elevated risks faded as smokers stayed off cigarettes.\n\nThe findings derive from databases following nearly a million people over age 54 for about a decade.\n\nThe researchers expected to see smokers dying faster than nonsmokers, and they did.\n\nBut when they looked beyond conventional causes, they found that smoking doubled the risk of death from kidney failure and from various respiratory diseases. It also seemed to pose a six-fold risk of death from intestinal ischemia, where the intestine is damaged by reduced blood flow.\n\nThe risk of death from infections was 2.3 times higher and the likelihood of death from cirrhosis of the liver was 3.1 times higher.\n\nBreast cancer deaths were 30 percent higher among the smokers. Prostate cancer death rates were elevated by 40 percent.\n\nIn many cases, the more people smoked, the greater the risk. That wasn't seen in prostate cancer, \"but the risk of death decreased significantly as the number of years since quitting smoking increased,\" said Dr. Graham Colditz of the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, in an editorial.\n\n\"It's not a surprise that smoking kills. We've known that for years,\" said Jacobs, who is director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. \"But it's important for people to realize the full impact that smoking has in terms of the national deaths. So eliminating smoking needs to be a national priority.\"\n\nIn his editorial, Colditz points out that 18 percent of the U.S. population, 42 million Americans, smoke, and public health efforts to help them quit have not done enough to change \u201csocial norms.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., smoking has become a habit of the poor and the poorly-educated, Colditz told Reuters Health. He said that \"in 2013, a total of 29 percent of adults below the poverty line smoked, whereas 16 percent at or above the poverty level did. In addition, only 6 percent of adults with advanced college degrees smoked, whereas 41 percent of those with a general equivalency degree did.\"\n\nColditz writes in the editorial, \u201cThe Affordable Care Act provides expanded access to cessation support for many, but holes in Medicaid coverage in many states leave numerous smokers without as much evidence-based support as they need.\u201d\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1xJnCqb New England Journal of Medicine, online February 11, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKBN0LF2M320150211", "sailthru.author": "Gene Emery", "Author": "Gene Emery", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A new study suggests that smoking may be responsible for 60,000 to 120,000 more deaths in the U.S. each year than previously thought.The examination of", "title": "Fatal smoking risks may be higher than thought", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
