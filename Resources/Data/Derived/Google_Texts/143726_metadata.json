It was not easy to prepare the course,\u201d Weirather said. \u201cWe were already experienced because in Garmisch we had the same problem, it was also like 10 degrees (Celsius, or 50 Fahrenheit) so we kind of knew how to deal with it.\n\n\u201cWhen you inspect the course in the morning and there\u2019s no salt in it you almost think it\u2019s impossible to have a race and then you still have to get ready for a race and be prepared,\u201d Weirather added.\n\nFor Vonn, it was a second consecutive podium result after losing sleep to clean up damage from an ill-advised Facebook post.\n\nVonn apologized to her equipment supplier Friday after posting a video of an angry outburst in which she destroyed her bindings with a hammer following a downhill where one ski detached.\n\nThe DJ during Sunday\u2019s race poked fun at Vonn by playing MC Hammer\u2019s 1990 hit \u201cU Can\u2019t Touch This,\u201d during the American\u2019s run.\n\n\u201cThat was funny,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes out now but I did it to myself.\n\n\u201cMistakes happen and you just got to move forward and today I was finally 100 percent focused on the skiing and I felt a lot better,\u201d Vonn added. \u201cI actually got some sleep last night. So now I\u2019m just thinking about racing and that\u2019s what I should be thinking about, because I have a lot of important races coming up.\u201d\n\nWith bright sunshine, a crowd of nearly 10,000 showed up, many of them young children clamoring for autographs, and Vonn and the other top skiers had to be escorted off the mountain by police officers on skis.\n\n\u201cThat was intense,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cComing down from the finish was incredible. There were so many kids and I love that. I love the enthusiasm they have for the sport and it makes our job a lot more fun as well.\u201d\n\nVonn\u2019s overall lead over Gut was reduced to 23 points, while in the super-G ranks she holds a 79-point lead on Gut with three races remaining in the discipline this season.\n\nFabienne Suter of Switzerland finished fourth and Romane Miradoli of France fifth, while local favorite Federica Brignone of Italy was sixth.\n\nSaturday\u2019s downhill winner Nadia Fanchini and Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany were among those who didn\u2019t finish.\n\nUp next is a special parallel slalom city event in Stockholm for men and women on Tuesday.\n\nWhile Gut said she would travel to Sweden, Vonn was considering skipping the event over concern about a jump on the temporary course \u2014 potentially giving up points to her Swiss rival.\n\n\u201cI have to think about all the consequences, the positives and the negatives and we\u2019ll see,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cThe duel is definitely a different beast. I really like duels, actually, but with the jump in there I\u2019m not really sure about it. So I have to make that decision tonight or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThe women\u2019s circuit then travels to Soldeu, Andorra, for a super-G and Alpine combined next weekend.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tina Weirather wins while Lindsey Vonn is reminded of social media gaffe", "title": "Tina Weirather wins while Lindsey Vonn is reminded of social media gaffe", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/tina-weirather-wins-while-lindsey-vonn-is-reminded-of-social-media-gaffe/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221_100446_lindsey-vonn.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221_100446_lindsey-vonn.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T09:54:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:04:24+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was not easy to prepare the course,\u201d Weirather said.\nIt was the fifth career win for Weirather, the daughter of two-time Olympic gold medalist Hanni Wenzel and Harti Weirather, who won downhill gold at the 1982 world championships.\nRacing in unusually warm weather, Weirather finished 0.57 seconds ahead of Lara Gut with Vonn 0.64 back in third.\nLA THUILE, Italy \u2014 A daughter of skiing royalty, Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein won a slushy super-G Sunday for her first victory of the season while Lindsey Vonn was reminded of her social media gaffe during another podium finish.\nFor Vonn, it was a second consecutive podium result after losing sleep to clean up damage from an ill-advised Facebook post."}
