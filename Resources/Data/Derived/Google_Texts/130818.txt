8 a.m.-5 p.m. Making Changes During Open Enrollment During Open Enrollment, it is necessary to determine if your current benefits still meet your needs or if you need to make a change, such as: • Enrolling in a health care plan for the first time or dropping an existing plan. • Switching to a different medical, dental or vision plan. • Increasing or decreasing your life insurance coverage. • Changing how much you contribute to a flexible spending account. • Adding or dropping a dependent from your benefits coverage.* *If you add a new dependent, you will receive a letter requesting that you provide verification of that dependent’s eligibility under Penn’s plan rules. You’ll also need to provide verification if you re-enroll a spouse/partner who had previously been covered. If You Don’t Enroll If you don’t make changes during Open Enrollment, you’ll receive the same coverage you had last year. It is important to remember that under the Affordable Care Act, if you waive your University coverage, you are still responsible for obtaining coverage through some other source. For example, you can obtain coverage through a spouse’s or domestic partner’s plan, your parent’s plan (if you are under age 26) or via the Health Insurance Marketplace. Making Changes After Enrollment The choices you make during Benefits Open Enrollment will remain in effect through June 30, 2016, unless you experience a qualifying event. Qualifying events include the birth or adoption of a child, marriage or domestic partnership, divorce or separation, death of a dependent or change in your dependent’s eligibility for benefits. Keep in mind that the IRS limits the types of changes you can make for qualifying events. If you experience a qualifying event, please contact the Penn Benefits Center within 30 days at 1-888-PENN-BEN (1-888-736-6236), Monday through Friday, between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. EST. When Are Changes Effective? Changes made during Open Enrollment will be effective as of July 1, 2015. New rates for all plans will be reflected in your July 2015 paycheck. Your pay must support your contributions for the benefits elected. If that is not the case, then your enrollment cannot be processed.
