ABC reports the government set aside $611 million in 2015 for government-funded vaccines.The proposed cuts to the program would mean there would be less government-provided vaccines to be handed out to Americans. There are, however, more people with health insurance under Obamacare, which explains the decreased need for free vaccines to un-insured Americans.\"The health insurance expansion will further increase access to immunizations and decrease the number of uninsured and underinsured individuals in need of Section 317 vaccine for routine immunizations,\" Office of Management and Budget spokeswoman Melanie Roussell told ABC.Obama furthered the debate on whether vaccines should be required when he urged parents over the weekend to get their children vaccinated. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, said Monday parents should have a \"choice\" in giving their children vaccines, he changed his messaging to say, \"there is no question kids should be vaccinated.\"A measles outbreak that has infected more than 100 people is plaguing the nation's healthcare system. The outbreak hit 14 states in January, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC says the majority of the measles cases occurred in people who were not vaccinated for the disease, which is covered under the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.Also on Monday, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul \u2014 a potential Republican candidate for president next year \u2014 said he feels most vaccines should be \"voluntary.\" Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson, another possible Republican candidate for president in the 2016 election, said Monday people should not be allowed to say no to vaccines based on religious or philosophical beliefs.\"Although I strongly believe in individual rights and the rights of parents to raise their children as they see fit, I also recognize that public health and public safety are extremely important in our society,\" Carson said.\"Certain communicable diseases have been largely eradicated by immunization policies in this country and we should not allow those diseases to return by foregoing safe immunization programs, for philosophical, religious, or other reasons when we have the means to eradicate them.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vaccines, funding, cut, parent, choice, required, measles, outbreak", "pubdate": "2015-02-03T18:16:37", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Barack Obama's proposed 2016 budget stokes the debate on vaccines by cutting $50 million from the government's immunization program.\r\nAccording to ABC News, the cuts are in play because of a lesser need for free vaccines thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\r\nThe...", "title": "Obama's 2016 Proposed Budget Cuts Federal Vaccine Funding", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/vaccines-funding-cut-parent/2015/02/03/id/622506/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/App_Themes/Newsmax/images/facebook/newsmaxFBLogo.gif", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/vaccines-funding-cut-parent/2015/02/03/id/622506/", "title": "Obama's 2016 Proposed Budget Cuts Federal Vaccine Funding", "description": "President Barack Obama's proposed 2016 budget stokes the debate on vaccines by cutting $50 million from the government's immunization program.\r\nAccording to ABC News, the cuts are in play because of a lesser need for free vaccines thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\r\nThe...", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1422987397, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "vaccines, funding, cut, parent, choice, required, measles, outbreak", "article": {"section": "US", "published_time": "2015-02-03T18:16:37"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/US/vaccines-funding-cut-parent/2015/02/03/id/622506/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "President Barack Obama's proposed 2016 budget stokes the debate on vaccines by cutting $50 million from the government's immunization program.\r\nAccording to ABC News, the cuts are in play because of a lesser need for free vaccines thanks to the Affordable Care Act.\r\nThe..."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3c5d\"", "article_summary": "There are, however, more people with health insurance under Obamacare, which explains the decreased need for free vaccines to un-insured Americans.\nChris Christie, a Republican, said Monday parents should have a \"choice\" in giving their children vaccines, he changed his messaging to say, \"there is no question kids should be vaccinated.\nABC reports the government set aside $611 million in 2015 for government-funded vaccines.The proposed cuts to the program would mean there would be less government-provided vaccines to be handed out to Americans.\nPresident Barack Obama's proposed 2016 budget stokes the debate on vaccines by cutting $50 million from the government's immunization program.According to ABC News the cuts are in play because of a lesser need for free vaccines thanks to the Affordable Care Act.The vaccine program provides free vaccines to children and adults at the local, state, and national levels.\n\"A measles outbreak that has infected more than 100 people is plaguing the nation's healthcare system."}
