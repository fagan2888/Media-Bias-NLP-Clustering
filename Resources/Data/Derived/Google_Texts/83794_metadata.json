(Photo: Photo courtesy of Reggie Goodman)\n\nHundreds of Morris County residents have been moving to Ocean County, New Jersey for a number of reasons, including the promise of lower property taxes.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons is the lower price of homes,\u201d said longtime realtor Michael Kosman, who moved from Clifton in Passaic County to Holiday City South in Berkeley Township where he and his wife Carol have lived for the past 12 years.\n\n\u201cThe reason my wife and I moved down from north Jersey to here is because there are much more activities and organizations to get involved in down here,\u201d Kosman said. Plus Ocean County has the advantages of lower taxes and more affordable homes than in north Jersey, he added.\n\n\u201cOcean County has a lot to offer an aging population, including retirement community homes for over 160,000 seniors,\u201d said Donna Flynn, Ocean County\u2019s public information director. \u201cThat\u2019s the second largest number of seniors of any U.S. state after Florida, which ranks number one in the country.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, an estimated 468 people moved from Morris County to Ocean County, Flynn said.\n\nJoan Heid said she and her husband Fred, who have two daughters and one son, moved to Parsippany for good schools in 1969, and to Holiday City in Ocean County to escape high taxes in Morris County.\n\nReggie and Rosann Goodman also made the moved to Holiday City South last month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re retiring and looking for a more affordable place to live so we can enjoy our retirement,\u201d Reggie Goodman said. The Goodmans had lived in Parsippany before moving to Ocean County.\n\n\u201cWe lived in a single family house in Parsippany,\u201d said Reggie Goodman. \u201cWe were looking to downsize. We also wanted to continue to be social, and we looked for an area where we could socialize a little more easily. Our new home is all on one floor which makes it a little easier to take care of.\u201d\n\nThe couple said they love being out in the fresh air and are now very happy with their house. \u201c(When) we lived in Parsippany, everything became more work than fun,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cWe sold the home in a day. The way this all came together for us, we knew it was what the Lord wanted for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrice and low taxes are the incentives for moving into Whiting,\u201d said realtor Darlene Buonomo, who has a real estate office in the Crestwood Village 7 Clubhouse in Whiting, a section of Manchester Township.\n\n\u201cWhiting is kind of a hidden gem,\u201d Buonomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s far enough from the shore line yet a relatively quick drive to the shore area. You can get a nice move-in condition home in Whiting for under a hundred thousand dollars.\u201d\n\nPlan ahead before retiring\n\nMarco Lima, a certified financial planner with Ameriprise Financial Services in Parsippany, recommends creating a written retirement income plan before retiring or moving.\n\n\u201cThe plan should consider your committed and lifestyle expenses, taxes, inflation, rates of withdrawal on investments, health care expenses and estate planning,\u201d said Lima. \u201cReview your plan at least once a year on your own or with the help of a retirement income professional.\u201d\n\nLima provides a checklist to review before retiring or moving out of the area:\n\nMonthly budget \u2014 Re-estimate your monthly budget in the new house, especially if on a fixed income.\n\nEmergency fund \u2014 Have a cash reserve/emergency fund of six to 12 months.\n\nRenovation budget \u2014 Plan to budget for renovations very carefully. Add a 20 percent cushion to address unforeseen expenses.\n\nUmbrella insurance \u2014 Consider obtaining an umbrella insurance policy (ULI). This type of policy provides liability protection above and beyond the basic coverage that homeowners/renters and auto insurance policies usually offer, to protect against the catastrophic losses if sued. ULI is often referred to as excess coverage.\n\nRealty Transfer Fee \u2014 Speak with your tax advisor to estimate a Realty Transfer Fee tax. This tax is mandatory and it is often overlooked by homeowners selling properties in New Jersey.
