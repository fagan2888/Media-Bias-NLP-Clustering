I loved Chris Borland's game but I can't fault him for calling it quits. His concerns are real. Still it takes a man to do the logical. \u2014 Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) March 17, 2015\n\nWhile some members of the NFL chose to stand behind Borland in his decision, others feel his relatively young age and $530,000 expected payout next year should\u2019ve factored into his decision. Borland recalled being diagnosed with two sports-related concussions since the eighth grade.\n\nNo offense to anyone but I'm playing until I can't anymore. I love this game to much. \u2014 Bobby Wagner (@Bwagz54) March 17, 2015\n\nChris Borland was scheduled to make $530K this year, plus $10K workout bonus. Not many jobs pay 24-year-olds $540K for 6 months of work. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 17, 2015", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "chris, borland, announces, retirement, nfl, 24, over, concussion, fears, nfl, has, mixed", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Amid concussion fears, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced his retirement from the NFL at the age of 24.", "title": "24-Year-Old NFL Player Retires Because He's Scared Of Brain Damage [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/chris-borland-announces-retirement-nfl-24-over-concussion-fears-nfl-has-mixed-326010", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/17/chris-borland.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amid concussion fears, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced his retirement from the NFL at the age of 24.", "title": "24-Year-Old NFL Player Retires Because He's Scared Of Brain Damage [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/chris-borland-announces-retirement-nfl-24-over-concussion-fears-nfl-has-mixed-326010", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/03/17/chris-borland.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/17/chris-borland.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-17T14:06:55-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-17T14:06:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Amid concussion fears, San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced his retirement from the NFL at the age of 24."}, "article_summary": "#OnWisconsin \u2014 Russell Wilson (@DangeRussWilson) March 17, 2015WOW.\n\u2014 Bobby Wagner (@Bwagz54) March 17, 2015Chris Borland was scheduled to make $530K this year, plus $10K workout bonus.\nLess than a week after San Francisco 49ers linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the NFL, Chris Borland has confirmed that he will be retiring from professional football at the age of 24 amid fears over the relationship between football and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), ESPN reported.\n\"I just honestly want to do what's best for my health,\" Borland told ESPN\u2019s Outside the Lines.\n\u2014 Chris Long (@JOEL9ONE) March 17, 2015While some members of the NFL chose to stand behind Borland in his decision, others feel his relatively young age and $530,000 expected payout next year should\u2019ve factored into his decision."}
