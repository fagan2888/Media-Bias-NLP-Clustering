Let's keep Wausau from ever seeing some of the problems we've seen elsewhere.

EDITOR: Let us be thankful we have not endured the problems seen around the country. We have the opportunity to make sure it doesn't happen here.

The leadership provided by the police chief and sheriff, plus the support of the city and its citizens is a real plus. It seems to me the recruitment, training and evaluation are the keys, but it is still the performance of individuals that makes the difference.

Think of what might have occurred if officers had responded to the group of Wausau West High School students with a shoot-first approach when they responded to a call of individuals with weapons.

We must be realistic and recognize that every profession will have individuals who should not be retained. I am sure law enforcement as well as citizens support responsible gun legislation like background checks. Arming citizens hasn't been the answer.

Most places of employment now have cameras in their work environment, so why not provide law enforcement with the same tool? The Boston bomber may not have been captured as quickly without videos and Ray Rice being filmed on elevator made us aware of domestic violence.

Let us not reach the point in Wausau where parents tell their children to beware of police. Police are citizens performing stressful work. How about New Year's resolutions to build relationships? A smile, handshake, thank you or a note would be a start by all.

Ronald Sem,

Wausau
