It\u2019s called Learning Express Library, and it can teach a lot of people a lot of things.\n\nA smart place to start is a 16-minute video tutorial that outlines the navigation and use of the site. It also gives a quick look at the resources that can help job seekers, students, members of the military and others find what they\u2019re looking for.\n\nThe information is arranged in groupings called centers. The Adult Learning Center has tutorials on the content users will need to know to get ready for the GED exam. Once a user is ready, he or she can take practice tests, see the scores, and get detailed answers to questions answered incorrectly. Based on your test scores, the site might recommend other areas of study.\n\nThere\u2019s a personalized, secure storage area called My Center, where you can store tests you\u2019ve completed or partially completed. You can also store tutorials you\u2019re working on.\n\nThere\u2019s a two-step process to get to Learning Express Library. First, you navigate to MARVEL!, Maine\u2019s Virtual Library ( www.maine.gov/marvel). From there, you\u2019ll find a link to Learning Express. You can visit that site and check out its offerings without registering. However, to take the tutorials and tests, you have to register with your name and a password.\n\nLearning Express LLC is an educational technology company that\u2019s been around since 1995. It has 4,000 libraries, 5,000 schools and 1,200 colleges as clients.\n\nLearning Express Library has been available at public libraries in Maine for a couple of years. Reference librarians such as Christy Coombs at the Bangor Public Library will be happy to help patrons get started, as will staff people at libraries across Maine. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful database,\u201d she told me Friday.\n\nHer library offers computer classes; find out more at the library website, www.bpl.lib.me.us, or call 947-8336. For help with connectivity issues or questions, call the Maine State Library at 287-5620.\n\nConsumer Forum is a collaboration of the Bangor Daily News and Northeast CONTACT, Maine\u2019s all-volunteer, nonprofit consumer organization.
