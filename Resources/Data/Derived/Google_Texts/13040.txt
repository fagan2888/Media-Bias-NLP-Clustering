South Dakota cornerback Steve Tellefsen has signed an undrafted free-agent contract with the Minnesota Vikings and offensive tackle Matt Huffer has done the same with the Atlanta Falcons. Both will report to their respective team’s rookie mini camp later this month.

Tellefsen of Weston, Fla., competed in two seasons for the Coyotes after transferring in from Arizona Western College. He had 26 tackles, one interception and forced a fumble this past season. He was also credited with eight passes defended.

Huffer of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, started 34 consecutive games at left tackle for South Dakota during his four-year career. He helped lead an offense that averaged 166 yards rushing and 189 yards passing per game this past season. Huffer rejoins teammate Tyler Starr whom he competed with for three seasons at South Dakota.
