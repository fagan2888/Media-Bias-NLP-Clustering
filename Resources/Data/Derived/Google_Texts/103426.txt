Percy Evans, 66, sat across from his wife Beverly, 65, as she grimly shuffled through her unpaid medical bills while sitting at their kitchen table.

For Beverly the $11,000 in bills comes from a stroke and a subsequent knee surgery. They just added to an already precarious financial situation for the couple. Before her stay in the hospital, the Evanses were already struggling to pay off $1,100 monthly mortgage payments for their house.

“When I see her walking compared to 20 years ago, it’s a lot different,” Percy said in the six-part Al Jazeera documentary series Hard Earned. “She walks slowly and more cautious about her steps.”

Although insured their policy did not cover every expense and Beverly wracked up the debt since the couple declared bankruptcy after they both lost their jobs during the Great Recession.

She is far from alone. Nearly 20 percent of U.S. consumers — 42.9 million people — have unpaid medical debts, according to a December 2014 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

“Medical debt is incurred differently than other unpaid bills, such as unpaid phone or utility bills. Medical debt can result from an event that is unpredictable and costly, such as an accident or sudden illness,” the CFPB said. “In addition, consumers are often temporarily responsible for the whole bill until insurance works it out.”

“Complaints to the CFPB indicate that many consumers do not even know they owe medical debt until they get a call from the collections agency or they discover it on their credit report.”

A 2014 analysis by the financial planning company NerdWallet found that health care expenses comprised 38 percent of all debt payments received by third-party agencies. About half of all overdue debt mentioned on Americans' credit reports is from medical debt.
