Michael Bennet\u2019s support for the Iran deal endangers our safety and jeopardizes the future. The deal allows Iran to pursue weapons, arms, cash and intercontinental ballistic missile systems and does not provide the adequate safeguards to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nOut of the right side of his mouth, Bennet says, \u201cIran is the biggest exporter of terrorism in the world; Iran is anti-Semitic; Iran has threatened the existence of Israel; Iran has threatened our existence; Iran has done nothing to earn the validation of its nuclear program.\u201d Out of the left he says, \u201cNay,\u201d as he votes in favor of Iran building a nuclear weapon and wiping Israel off the face of the map.\n\nOn perhaps the most pressing national security issue of a generation, Bennet and his allies in the upper chamber refused to allow an up-or-down vote on a bipartisan disapproval resolution on Obama\u2019s dangerous Iran deal.\n\nWhile walking hand-in-hand with President Obama and Ayatollah Khomeini and giving a voice to radical Iranians, Bennet rejects the opinions of those who will suffer the consequences.\n\nRational and informed Coloradans do not support the Iran deal and social media has provided an outlet for the public outcry on this issue. Voters are outraged with the political class acting against their best interests, and Bennet\u2019s votes to silence our voices shows he is not listening to us.\n\nColoradans don\u2019t want to see the largest state sponsor of terror enriched with the means to pursue its dangerous agenda, and that\u2019s why so many Coloradans have joined Advancing Colorado in opposition to Bennet\u2019s support for the deal.\n\nJonathan Lockwood is executive director of Advancing Colorado, a non-partisan non-profit.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Guest Commentary: Michael Bennet speaks out of both sides of mouth on Iran", "title": "Guest Commentary: Michael Bennet speaks out of both sides of mouth on Iran", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/02/guest-commentary-michael-bennet-speaks-out-of-both-sides-of-mouth-on-iran/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002__20151004_Z00_OP04G_LOCKWOODp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151002__20151004_Z00_OP04G_LOCKWOODp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-02T11:52:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T08:43:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd968\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
