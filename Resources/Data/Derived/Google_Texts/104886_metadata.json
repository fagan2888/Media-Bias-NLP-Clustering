But one troubling use of the technology consists of assisting lenders in discriminating against a borrower based on his or her social network connections.\n\nThe patent application explains that a lender can use the technology to examine the credit ratings of members of the social network of the individual who is applying for a loan. If the average credit rating of the social network reaches a minimum, pre-defined level, the lender moves forward with the loan process. If the average credit score is too low, the loan application is rejected.\n\nRelated: Now Facebook Wants to Know Where You Buy Your Toothpaste\n\nThe new technology raises concerns about potential unjust bias, but banks would most likely use it as an additional factor in the loan approval process, not as an end-all metric. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act imposes strict guidelines as to what factors creditors can use when determining whether to approve a loan. It\u2019s unclear if Facebook\u2019s new technology falls under the criteria the federal law defines \u2013 things like income, expenses, debt and credit history.\n\nAnother fear involves predatory lenders. People rejected for loans through this process would make a nice customer list for unscrupulous financial operators.\n\nSome of the less worrisome uses of the technology include preventing spam email and inappropriate content and improving the accuracy of searches. At this point, it\u2019s not clear how Facebook plans to implement the new technology. Let\u2019s hope the social networking giant stays on the sunny side of the street on this one.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "All that data Facebook has been gathering on you and your friends could someday be used to approve -- or deny -- your application for a loan.", "title": "Facebook Patents a Technology That Could Use Your Social Network Against You", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/05/Facebook-Patents-Technology-Could-Use-Your-Social-Network-Against-You", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/facebook-data_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/05/Facebook-Patents-Technology-Could-Use-Your-Social-Network-Against-You", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/facebook-data_1.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "All that data Facebook has been gathering on you and your friends could someday be used to approve -- or deny -- your application for a loan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0910\"", "article_summary": "Facebook was just granted an updated technology patent for \u201cauthorization and authentication based on an individual's social network.\u201d This innocent-sounding technology can no doubt be applied in a multitude of ways, many of them benign.\nBut one troubling use of the technology consists of assisting lenders in discriminating against a borrower based on his or her social network connections.\nIf the average credit rating of the social network reaches a minimum, pre-defined level, the lender moves forward with the loan process.\nThe patent application explains that a lender can use the technology to examine the credit ratings of members of the social network of the individual who is applying for a loan.\nAt this point, it\u2019s not clear how Facebook plans to implement the new technology."}
