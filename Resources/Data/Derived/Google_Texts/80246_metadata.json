The five-year, $10 billion \u201cBridge to Reform\u201d waiver helped create the Low Income Health Program and implement the Affordable Care Act. It is due to expire in October and the state plans to submit a new proposal to federal officials that builds from the success of the first waiver.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at 2015 as kind of the deep breath after we have rushed to get to the finish line of 2014,\u201d Kent said. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve implemented the basic provisions [of the ACA], how do we go about refining our work?\u201d\n\nThe first answer will be found in the 1115 waiver proposal, she said.\n\n\u201cThis renewal of the waiver, we\u2019re really looking at it as a way to take [the ACA implementation] to a new frontier, if you will,\u201d Kent said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough that you have just have coverage, and that you\u2019re walking around with a Medi-Cal card, but what does that card actually get you? Does it get you your physical medical services, does it get you your mental health services, does it address if you have a substance use problem? People who utilize multiple system issues should not be treated in a silo, because their issues are not siloed.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s proposed waiver centers on payment reforms, but it\u2019s more than that, Kent said.\n\n\u201cThe waiver is testing out new concepts and trying to get new funding and investment for how we break those barriers down,\u201d Kent said. \u201cSo the waiver is a phenomenal opportunity for us as a state to demonstrate new and exciting ways, both from a payment perspective \u2026 but also [for] the services that we provide to beneficiaries in the right setting.\u201d\n\nThe waiver is close to final draft form that can be distributed to stakeholders and the public for discussion, she said.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have a draft in the next few weeks,\u201d Kent said.\n\nKent also mentioned one potentially large gap in the health care budget: the managed care organization tax, which represents about $1 billion in funding to California and which federal officials have said is not viable in its current form.\n\n\u201cThat would be a big gap if it\u2019s not appropriately addressed,\u201d Kent said.\n\nShe also said monitoring Medi-Cal managed care plans would be critical to addressing the concerns raised by many consumer advocates and stakeholders.\n\n\u201cWe are now a managed care state,\u201d Kent said, with all 58 counties served by Medi-Cal managed care plans.\n\n\u201cThe question is, are people getting access to care at the right time and the right place, and are there enough providers to care for them?\u201d Kent said. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019ll be working on is, how do we monitor our plans to make sure people are getting the right access.\u201d\n\nCurrent monitoring efforts set a strong foundation for that effort, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of Medi-Cal quality measures we have implemented,\u201d Kent said. \u201cI think what we\u2019re doing today in Medi-Cal managed care, in terms of our quality monitoring, we will probably be a national leader, because no one is doing what we\u2019re doing in terms of quality monitoring.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>The Department of Health Care Services is close to finalizing the first draft of the new federal Medicaid \u00a0waiver, director Jennifer Kent said at her first legislative hearing as head of DHCS.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "The Department of Health Care Services is close to finalizing the first draft of the new federal Medicaid \u00a0waiver, director Jennifer Kent said at her first legislative hearing as head of DHCS.", "title": "State \u2018A Few Weeks\u2019 From Waiver Draft", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/state-a-few-weeks-bfrom-waiver-draft/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-02-20T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-20T03:00:00+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde5d7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe are now a managed care state,\u201d Kent said, with all 58 counties served by Medi-Cal managed care plans.\nThe state is weeks away from finishing the first draft of a new 1115 federal Medicaid waiver, according to Jennifer Kent, director of the Department of Health Care Services.\nShe also said monitoring Medi-Cal managed care plans would be critical to addressing the concerns raised by many consumer advocates and stakeholders.\nDoes it get you your physical medical services, does it get you your mental health services, does it address if you have a substance use problem?\nThe five-year, $10 billion \u201cBridge to Reform\u201d waiver helped create the Low Income Health Program and implement the Affordable Care Act."}
