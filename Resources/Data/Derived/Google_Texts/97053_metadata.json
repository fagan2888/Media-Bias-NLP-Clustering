Just a year after getting blitzed in the 2012 election, Minnesotans find themselves less than enchanted with Democratic officeholders. And 2014 incumbent Sen. Al Franken fares the worst of all:\n\nIn the poll released this week, 44% of Minnesotans polled said Governor Mark Dayton is doing excellent or pretty good. That\u2019s a 9% drop from last year, which political analyst David Schultz says may have something to do with football. \u201cI think he\u2019s getting a lot of blowback on the Vikings stadium,\u201d said Schultz, \u201cespecially in the financing mechanisms, and I think he\u2019s starting to feel some of the repercussions and some of the negative approvals coming off of a deal many people are thinking was not best for state of Minnesota.\u201d \u2026 In the Senate Democrat Al Franken shows only a 39% in terms of a pretty good or excellent rating. He too is up for re-election next year. Last time Franken only eked by Norm Coleman in a recount.\n\nFranken has kept a low profile in the past five years since his disputed election in 2008, which has served him well back home, at least until now. He only gives interviews to Minnesota media, and after a couple of incidents in his first few months of attempting to pick fights on the floor of the Senate, he has become a natural backbencher. Minnesotans aren\u2019t terribly impressed with public-relations stunts from their politicians, with the temporary exception of Jesse Ventura, and the low profile has protected Franken from questions about his lackluster track record and rubber-stamp approach to the Obama agenda.\n\nThat, however, has backfired of late, thanks to the ObamaCare disaster. Barack Obama has also nose-dived in a state which he won handily a year ago, dropping nine points as well to 38% who give him \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cpretty good\u201d marks on job approval. That kind of linkage \u2014 if supported by more polling \u2014 might force people to rethink the risk Democrats run in 2014\u2019s midterms, especially for Senate seats. Most people would have considered Minnesota a fairly safe bet for Franken\u2019s re-election, and Republican disorganization might still prove that true. But if ObamaCare drives numbers this far down in blue Minnesota, which states will still be safe for Democrats in 2014?\n\nSmall wonder, then, that Franken told Minnesota Public Radio last week that he\u2019d back a delay in the individual mandate if the incompetence continues at HHS. Franken might be forced to raise his profile in order to do something he hasn\u2019t done in the past five years \u2014 distance himself from the Obama agenda. He won\u2019t be the only one doing so, either, if this disaster rolls into January.\n\nEric Ostermeier analyzes the buyers\u2019 remorse arising in Minnesota:\n\nPolling has been sparse in Minnesota\u2019s 2014 U.S. Senate race \u2013 a contest that a year ago was seemingly a slam dunk for one-term DFL incumbent Al Franken. Franken\u2019s seat currently sits on the \u2018watch list\u2019 of D.C. prognosticators Charlie Cook and Larry Sabato \u2013 both identifying the race as a \u2018likely\u2019 hold for Franken, with the caveat that the race may yet become competitive. Such caution seems validated in light of a new St. Cloud State University poll that was released on Wednesday, which shows Franken receiving a job approval rating of just 39 percent among his constituents \u2013 18 points behind the state\u2019s senior delegation member Amy Klobuchar at 57 percent. Fifty-one percent of Gopher State residents rated Franken\u2019s job performance negatively.\n\nI\u2019m still skeptical of a flip in Minnesota, but I\u2019d have laughed out loud two months ago.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "ObamaCare\u2019s reach may be broader than we think.", "title": "Franken in trouble in MN for 2014?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/02/franken-in-trouble-in-mn-for-2014/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-02T19:01:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-02T17:19:39+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, Al Franken, ObamaCare, US Senate,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdccbf\"", "article_summary": "Franken in trouble in MN for 2014?\nSmall wonder, then, that Franken told Minnesota Public Radio last week that he\u2019d back a delay in the individual mandate if the incompetence continues at HHS.\nJust a year after getting blitzed in the 2012 election, Minnesotans find themselves less than enchanted with Democratic officeholders.\nEric Ostermeier analyzes the buyers\u2019 remorse arising in Minnesota:Polling has been sparse in Minnesota\u2019s 2014 U.S. Senate race \u2013 a contest that a year ago was seemingly a slam dunk for one-term DFL incumbent Al Franken.\nAnd 2014 incumbent Sen.
