Points in the map\u2019s red section are closer to somewhere in Texas than the opposite sides of Texas are to each other.\n\nThat\u2019s right: You can be in Fargo, or Atlanta, or San Diego ... and be closer to Texas than Texas is to itself.\n\nThat\u2019s what the map above says. Texas is big.\n\nThis map comes from a Reddit thread (and via a radio station) that is brief but also worth revealing. It\u2019s a fun read: One Redditor questions whether the original poster failed to account for the curvature of the Earth; another asks whether Cuba makes the cut.\n\nA third does something else fun: apply the concept of the map to the even larger American state, Alaska. Though they didn\u2019t make an image, that user volunteers:\n\nAlaska misses Lousiana, Mississippi, Tennesee, Virginia, West Virginia, Pensylvania and everyone further away. Alaska reaches Japan, China and North Korea (Almost South Korea and Mongolia) in Asia and Norway (Svalbard) in Europe.\n\nBut the thread\u2019s worth reading for a final, crucial reason: It shows how maps like this, which seem increasingly popular online, get made. It shows that they have creators and an argument, and that those creators iterate them to more effectively make their point.\n\nAnd it reminds us, finally, that the size of something isn\u2019t always a meaningful metric: As the old sketch comedy show SCTV once showed, Texas pales next to Russia.", "article_metadata": {"description": "San Diego is closer to El Paso than El Paso is to Houston.", "author": "Robinson Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "San Diego is closer to El Paso than El Paso is to Houston.", "title": "What's Closer to Texas Than Texas Is to Itself?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/04/X3wcL5G/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/04/whats-closer-to-texas-than-texas-is-to-itself/360433/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/yayitsrob"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s right: You can be in Fargo, or Atlanta, or San Diego ... and be closer to Texas than Texas is to itself.\nPoints in the map\u2019s red section are closer to somewhere in Texas than the opposite sides of Texas are to each other.\nThough they didn\u2019t make an image, that user volunteers:Alaska misses Lousiana, Mississippi, Tennesee, Virginia, West Virginia, Pensylvania and everyone further away.\nThis map shows (roughly) how large the Lone Star State is.\nIt shows that they have creators and an argument, and that those creators iterate them to more effectively make their point."}
