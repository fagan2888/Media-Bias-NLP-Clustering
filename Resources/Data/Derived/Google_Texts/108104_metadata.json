Service officials have pegged the price tag of the next-generation nuclear submarine program, also known as the SSBN(X), at around $139 billion, with a lifetime cost of roughly $347 billion.\n\nRelated: The Navy Hunts for Its Next-Generation Nuclear Submarine\n\nThe fiscal 2015 defense policy bill authorized the creation of the special deterrence account for the submarine program. Some lawmakers believe that because the sub effort is so large and so expensive that it should be considered a \u201cnational\u201d program and therefore funded from accounts throughout the Pentagon rather than strictly from Navy coffers, thus avoiding painful budget cuts to other service programs.\n\nJames\u2019 comments suggest the Air Force may have come to the same conclusion about the B-21, especially after a think-tank report released last month warned of a coming \u201cbow wave\u201d in bills to the service budget in the 2020s, cresting at $232 billion in fiscal 2022, as the Air Force looks to modernize its portions of the nuclear triad as well as its fighters and tankers while still pursuing expensive weapons like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nRelated: How the Air Force\u2019s New Planes Could Bankrupt the Pentagon\n\nIf the Air Force can get the rest of the Pentagon to chip in for the B-21, it would give the service some real budgetary relief.\n\nBut just because James suggested adding the bomber and missile to the deterrence account \u2014 thus expanding the size of its pot to over $500 billion \u2014 doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s going to happen. Congressional appropriators have shown discomfort over the deterrence fund, arguing that a special account sets a bad precedent and that the \u201cnational\u201d tag could be slapped on other expensive weapon platforms, like the F-35.\n\nNavy officials will want to weigh in on the suggestion, too, potentially sparking a turf battle between the two services as they look to modernize their arsenals.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A top Air Force official on Wednesday floated a potentially controversial scheme to pa", "title": "How Will the Air Force Pay for its Budget-Busting Next-Generation Bomber?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/17/How-Will-Air-Force-Pay-its-Budget-Busting-Next-Generation-Bomber", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Artist_Rendering_B21_Bomber_Air_Force_Official.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/17/How-Will-Air-Force-Pay-its-Budget-Busting-Next-Generation-Bomber", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Artist_Rendering_B21_Bomber_Air_Force_Official.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A top Air Force official on Wednesday floated a potentially controversial scheme to pa", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24fd\"", "article_summary": "A top Air Force official on Wednesday floated a potentially controversial scheme to pay for the service\u2019s pricey next-generation bomber, one that could see the entire Defense Department fund the expensive effort.\nRelated: How the Air Force\u2019s New Planes Could Bankrupt the PentagonIf the Air Force can get the rest of the Pentagon to chip in for the B-21, it would give the service some real budgetary relief.\nRelated: The Navy Hunts for Its Next-Generation Nuclear SubmarineThe fiscal 2015 defense policy bill authorized the creation of the special deterrence account for the submarine program.\nThe Navy wants to purchase 12 vessels to replace its existing force of 14 Trident Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines.\nBut just because James suggested adding the bomber and missile to the deterrence account \u2014 thus expanding the size of its pot to over $500 billion \u2014 doesn\u2019t automatically mean it\u2019s going to happen."}
