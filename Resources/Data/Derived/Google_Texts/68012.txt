People came from across the state to Summerville on Saturday to honor former Summerville football coach John McKissick at a Legacy Gala thrown by the Dorchester Two Educational Foundation at Bud Knight's Barn.

McKissick, who spent over six decades as the Green Wave head coach, is known as the coach with most wins in any level of organized football ever.

Among those in attendance were Clemson head football coach Dabo Swinney, and University of South Carolina head Coach Will Muschamp.

“The reason I am attending is simply because of my deep respect for Coach, the job he has done for so many years, and mostly because of the impact he has had on this state and the lives of so many. He represents everything that is great about the game of football and is an inspiration to me,” Swinney said.

Both coaches praised McKissick's for his sixty-plus years of coaching a winning team, in the same place.

McKissick announced his retirement from coach last year, and his been replaced by his grandson Joe Call.

Proceeds from the Legacy Gala will go towards Summerville High School's growing sports medicine program.

“We are honored to host this event for Coach McKissick,” said Jennie Crosby, Executive Director of the Education Foundation. “The Sports Medicine program represents a perfect partnership between sports and academics and the state-of-the-art athletic training lab is needed to meet the growing demand of students.”
