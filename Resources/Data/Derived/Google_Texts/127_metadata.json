The bad news: The nearly two dozen co-ops have lost roughly $200 million in the first six months of the year, putting them on pace match last year\u2019s losses, according to a POLITICO review of the co-ops\u2019 NAIC filings. A Nevada co-op this week became the third to fail, and insurance experts are expecting more to follow suit. The news isn\u2019t all bad, with four co-ops turning a profit in the first six months of this year. However, as Pro\u2019s Paul Demko details, the odds are truly stacked against these nonprofit insurers: http://politico.pro/1Im2Mlw.\n\nOBAMACARE TAX COULD WRECK FSAs \u2014 The popular middle-class tax benefit could be one of the first casualties of the ACA\u2019s Cadillac tax on high-cost workplace health plans. Pro\u2019s Brian Faler and Paul Demko report: \u201cFlexible spending accounts, which allow people to save tax free for everything from doctor\u2019s co-pays to eyeglasses, may vanish in coming years as companies scramble to avoid the law\u2019s 40 percent levy on pricey health care benefits.\u201d That could be a huge surprise for middle-class voters, who might only vaguely know what the Cadillac tax is or realize it could up end one of their treasured benefits. \u201cIf the Cadillac tax doesn\u2019t change, FSAs will go away very quickly,\u201d one actuary said.

Ok, ZoomCare, you\u2019ve piqued PULSE\u2019s interest.

Pro\u2019s Brett Norman writes: \u201c[O]nly drugs prescribed by providers who are employed by or are under contract with covered entities would be eligible for the discounts. This requirement would apply to all drugs, but the guidancespecifically highlights infusion drugs, including high-cost cancer treatments that are sometimes administered in hospitals based on orders from community-based clinics delivering patients\u2019 primary care.\u201d Under the proposal, hospitals would have to submit more documentation, and eligibility for the discounts would be evaluated on a prescription-by-prescription basis rather than per individual patient.

Payment information was originally slated to be released on Aug. 14, but CMS delayed the release because of significant data problems. There appears to be major discrepancies in the data some insurers submitted for the risk corridors program and what they sent in for the other ACA risk-mitigation programs, CMS said.

Amgensaid it will price the drug at $14,100 each year, just under the $14,600 pricetag of its competitor, Praluent. Thursday\u2019s approval is likely to set offintense price negotiations among payers, who\u2019ve warned that this new class of drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, could bankrupt the system if used too widely. The Pro story: http://politico.pro/1NXTO2P\n\nPLANNED PARENTHOOD HANDS OVER FETAL TISSUE DETAILS TO LAWMAKERS \u2014 Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards sent congressional leaders a letter Thursday saying that on rare occasions, the organization\u2019s doctors make adjustments to an abortion procedure if a patient wants to donate fetal material. Richards explained that if a woman who has decided to have an abortion wants to donate the fetal tissue or organs ,she and her doctor choose which method is best suited to her case. But the decision to donate is only made after the procedure is chosen. With certain methods, a physician can adjust the procedure to better facilitate the requested donation, she said. Abortion opponents saythe statement amounts to a smoking gun that suggests illegal activity \u2014 underfederal law, physicians are prohibited from switching the abortion method to facilitate donation when the tissue is used for federally funded fetal transplantation. Richards\u2019 letter maintains that Planned Parenthood complieswith the law, indicating that a physician does not adjust which procedure to use, and instead only makes adjustments during the course of the procedure as warranted to donate tissue.

(The 2010 episode involving metal-on-metal implants, which went into thousands of elderly people before their tendency to crumble was confirmed, comes to mind.) But CMS has been reluctant to require a field for the UDI in medical claims, saying an update in the form will be costly and challenging. Now, the West Health Institute has offered CMS more reasons to include UDIs: transparency and cost-savings. In a letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell earlier this month, West Health said failure to include UDIs \u201cwill not only frustrate efforts to create a learning, value-based health care system, but will hamper the private sector\u2019s efforts to develop innovative approaches to improve care and reduce costs for patients that rely on medical implants.\u201d So there, CMS. The letter: http://politico.pro/1MY1u8i\n\nHAPPENING NEXT WEEK: While PULSE is off, here are some things to keep your eye on:\n\n\u2014 WILL FIRST BIOSIMILAR LAUNCH NEXT WEEK? \u2014 Sandoz could become the first company t o launch a biosimilar approved under the Obamacare-created pathway that streamlines the process of getting cheaper versions of biologics medicines to patients. But the drug could hit yet another stumbling block before the scheduled Sept. 2 launch. Amgen, which makes the branded version of Neupogen, has been in a legal battle with Sandoz over biosimilar policy. A federal circuit court decision in July was a mixed bag, and both companies have asked for the entire court to hear the case. Amgen this week asked the court to issue an injunction preventing next week\u2019s launch of the Sandoz biosimilar until the court decides whether to further review the precedent-setting case.\n\n\u2014 ORAL ARGS IN WEST VIRGINIA ACA CASE \u2014 A D.C. judge on Thursday will consider West Virginia\u2019s challenge to the administrative \u201cfix\u201d from fall 2013 that allowed expiring health plans to continue in some states. West Virginia argues the fix was unlawful because it violated the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine by making states responsible for federal law.\n\nPORTRAIT GALLERY: NOPE, NOT TAKING DOWN THE SANGER BUST \u2014 The National Portrait Gallery is not bowing to protestors\u2019 demands Thursday to take down the bust of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger. A gallery spokesperson said: \u201cThe museum\u2019s intent is not to honor her in an unqualified way, but rather to stimulate our audiences to reflect on the experience of Americans who struggled to improve the civil and social conditions of 20th-Century America.\u201d\n\nFOR YOUR PLANE RIDETO FIJI \u2014 Or wherever else you might be traveling during this last week of August recess: the latest Freakonomics podcast tackles end-of-life care. Guests like UPenn's Ezekiel Emanuel and Princeton's Uwe Reinhardt offer their thoughts on an end-of-life option that lets patients choose between wildly costly care and a payout for one last grand vacation or providing a legacy for their kids.

That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
