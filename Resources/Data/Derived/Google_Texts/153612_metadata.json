But as New York Times columnist and economist Paul Krugman emphasizes this morning, voters awarded Senate control and an historic House majority to a party that has gotten every major policy question of the last several years woefully wrong.\n\nTake the financial crisis and its aftermath. \u201cAccording to conservative dogma, which denounces any regulation of the sacred pursuit of profit, the financial crisis of 2008 \u2014 brought on by runaway financial institutions \u2014 shouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201d Krugman writes. But Republicans refused to rethink their reflexive opposition to robust regulation, he notes, and they badly bungled the response to the ensuing Great Recession. Denouncing deficit spending and championing austerity, GOPers like House Speaker John Boehner prescribed policies that actually exacerbate economic slumps. Though the GOP\u2019s knee-jerk opposition to government spending didn\u2019t stop the enactment of President Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus, the party did preside over a drastic cut in crucial investments like infrastructure after it captured control of the House of Representatives in 2010, and those spending cuts have held back the economic recovery.\n\nOn health care reform, meanwhile, the party\u2019s predictions of peril haven\u2019t panned out. Krugman notes that the GOP forecast \u201cminimal enrollments, more people losing insurance than gaining it, [and] soaring costs.\u201d The reality? More people than expected are enrolling in health care plans; the number of Americans without health insurance has substantially decreased; premiums are \u201cwell below expectations\u201d; and the rate of health spending growth has slowed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economist asks how a party that's gotten every major policy question wrong could do so well at the ballot box", "title": "\u201cSo wrong about so much\u201d: Paul Krugman blasts newly empowered GOP", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The economist asks how a party that's gotten every major policy question wrong could do so well at the ballot box", "title": "\u201cSo wrong about so much\u201d: Paul Krugman blasts newly empowered GOP", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/07/so_wrong_about_so_much_paul_krugman_blasts_newly_empowered_gop/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul-krugman-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The economist asks how a party that's gotten every major policy question wrong could do so well at the ballot box", "title": "\u201cSo wrong about so much\u201d: Paul Krugman blasts newly empowered GOP", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/paul-krugman-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, Affordable Care Act, cap-and-trade, Climate Change, Deficit, Economics, GOP, John Boehner, John McCain, midterm elections, Mitch McConnell, Obamacare, obstruction, Paul Krugman, R-Ariz., R-Ky., R-Ohio, Republicans, Stimulus, The New York Times, U.S. Economy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7175\"", "article_summary": "Krugman notes that the GOP forecast \u201cminimal enrollments, more people losing insurance than gaining it, [and] soaring costs.\u201d The reality?\nOn health care reform, meanwhile, the party\u2019s predictions of peril haven\u2019t panned out.\nMore people than expected are enrolling in health care plans; the number of Americans without health insurance has substantially decreased; premiums are \u201cwell below expectations\u201d; and the rate of health spending growth has slowed.\nDenouncing deficit spending and championing austerity, GOPers like House Speaker John Boehner prescribed policies that actually exacerbate economic slumps.\nThe obvious answer is that midterm elections witness a substantial dropoff in turnout by core Democratic voters; the dynamics of this year\u2019s contest simply favored the GOP."}
