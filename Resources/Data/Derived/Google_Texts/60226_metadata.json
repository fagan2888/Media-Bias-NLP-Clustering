It means different things in different parts of the country.\n\nFor the East Peoria Fire Department, it will mean an added service for a particular set of residents.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, when I first started hearing about it, it was primarily billed as a service that would be used for places like Wyoming, places that would have a long distance between where someone lived and the closest hospital,\u201d said Ryan Beck, assistant chief and EMS coordinator. \u201cParamedics would be able to perform a wider scope closer to procedures and things that a doctor would do, such as putting in sutures, removing sutures.\u201d\n\nThe goal, Beck said, is to cut down on unnecessary transports to the emergency room.\n\n\u201cA lot of this is due to the Affordable Care Act. ... There is a health care reform component. ... Where paramedicine is at now \u2014 mobile integrated health care, or community paramedicine, community paramedics, are really all the same thing \u2014 the service now is an opportunity for us to further serve our residents,\u201d Beck said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re our citizens. They\u2019re our responsibility,\u201d said Chief Al Servis.\n\nBeck said the paramedicine program in East Peoria has been in the works for the past year and a half, and he is hoping to kick it off in May. The Department has been coordinating the program mainly with OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, but Unity Point Health Methodist is on board as well, Beck said.\n\nCase managers at OSF will use a risk scoring tool to select patients for the home visits in the 61611, 61603 and 61605 ZIP codes, said Debbie Trau, director of emergency services and patient experience at the hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital of Illinois. East Peoria Fire Department will cover the 61611 area, and Advanced Medical Transport will cover the 61603 and 61605 areas in Peoria. There is no cost to the patient for these visits in East Peoria, Beck said.\n\nTrau said the program will help decrease 30-day readmission rates, which Medicare and Medicaid have initiatives to reduce.\n\nBeck said other fire departments are expressing interest in paramedicine, adding that it\u2019s \u201cthe big thing that\u2019s on everybody\u2019s radar.\u201d\n\nInitially, two East Peoria paramedics will be sent to a patient\u2019s home in the 61611 area after he or she is discharged from the hospital.\n\nThe program in East Peoria will consist of three components: the discharge follow-up visit, a focus on non-emergency calls and preventative visits.\n\nNationwide, over 20 percent of patients with certain diagnoses, like congestive heart failure and diabetes, are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of their initial visit, Beck said. The main reason this is happening, he added, is a lack of access to follow-up care.\n\nWhen EMS providers do patient assessments in the home, Trau said they will be able to pick up on subtle changes, such as weight gain or breathing patterns, which could be corrected with a visit to their doctor.\n\nHospitals will supply the EPFD with a list of patients\u2019 names for scheduled house visits. Patients will be informed of this before they leave the hospital and can decline the service.\n\nThose who take advantage of it will be visited up to five times a month.\n\n\u201cThe hospital wants us to go in because we can be eyes and ears in a home setting that they can\u2019t do,\u201d Beck said.\n\nAfter visits are completed, paramedics will report patients\u2019 conditions back to the hospital.\n\nHospitals will pay $95 to the EPFD per visit. Beck estimates the fire department\u2019s call volume to increase by 250 in the first year of the program.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the paramedics won\u2019t be the increased call volume; Beck said it will be changing their mindset toward a non-emergency call.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re used to something acute, emergent. We go and do things very quickly and get (patients) transported to the hospital if necessary, whereas this is a much more laid-back situation and we want our provider to take time with the patient,\u201d Beck said.\n\nThe EPFD is not out to compete with other providers, such as home health care and nursing homes, Beck said.\n\n\u201cI know nationwide it\u2019s a concern. No one wants anyone encroaching on their area of business,\u201d he said. \u201cOur focus is on those patients who are falling through the cracks.\u201d\n\nBeck said he sees paramedicine as a great service for hospitals.\n\n\u201cHospitals obviously want the best for their patients. They\u2019re overwhelmed. There\u2019s doctor shortages. They\u2019re swamped. ... They\u2019re seeing all the patients they can see at this point. They\u2019re looking at the best way they can serve these patients even if it\u2019s outside of the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\nTrau echoed Beck\u2019s comment: \u201cThis program will help the hospital. It\u2019s really a program to help our patients, with the focus on the patient. We want to collaborate with our community partners to deliver care to where they are and help prevent a readmission to the hospital.\u201d\n\nIn the future, Beck said the call volume may increase to the point that a paramedic would be dedicated to paramedicine full time and make house visits by a car rather than an ambulance or fire truck.\n\n\u201cAs the program grows and is financially supported from the hospitals or other payer sources, then it may make sense to transition to a different model,\u201d Beck said.\n\nTrau envisions the program beginning in April.\n\n\u201cOne of the other reasons that nationally this has been very successful, EMS providers know their communities. ... They are embedded in their community,\u201d Trau said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about reconnecting the community with a collaborative effort to improve our patients\u2019 outcomes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "EAST PEORIA \u2014 There is not one definition for paramedicine.
