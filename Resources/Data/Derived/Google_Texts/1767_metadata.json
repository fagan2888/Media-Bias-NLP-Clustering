If the story ends on Saturday, it\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nGeorgia State\u2019s Ron Hunter, working the sideline on a rolling chair less than a week after tearing his left Achilles while celebrating his team\u2019s Sun Belt Conference title, fell off the chair after his son\u2019s 3-point shot with 2.7 seconds left gave the 14th-seeded Panthers a 57-56 win against third-seeded Baylor.\n\nGeorgia State will play No. 6 Xavier on Saturday for a place among the final 16. That game against the winner of No. 10 Ohio State and No. 2 Arizona is scheduled for March 26.\n\n\u201cThose 4-5 days are a lot more media,\u201d Steiner said. \u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201d\n\nNational Prominence\n\nThe 50-year-old coach is already taking advantage of the notoriety. On Friday morning, he appeared on ESPN\u2019s \u201cMike & Mike\u201d national radio program.\n\nThe coach\u2019s son, R.J., a 6-foot-6 guard, is a projected first-round National Basketball Association draft pick. Against Baylor he finished with 16 points, including the 3-pointer that sent his father to the floor.\n\n\u201cI saw him cannonball off his chair,\u201d R.J. told reporters after the game. \u201cI told him, they\u2019ve got to get him a chair with a back or something because that wasn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\nSteiner said the father-son theme, coupled with the coach\u2019s injury, would make an attractive storyline to marketers.\n\nRon Hunter, who played at Miami of Ohio, is in his fourth season at Georgia State. He\u2019s averaged more than 20 wins a season while restoring the program to national prominence.\n\nCoaches frequently use NCAA tournament success as leverage for more lucrative contracts or higher-paying jobs with more visible programs.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-type": "post", "sailthru.author": "Scott Soshnick", "description": "The college basketball coach who fell off his chair after his team\u2019s upset win in the NCAA tournament will need another victory to cash in on the moment that\u2019s become an Internet sensation.", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The college basketball coach who fell off his chair after his team\u2019s upset win in the NCAA tournament will need another victory to cash in on the moment that\u2019s become an Internet sensation.", "title": "Coach Who Fell Off Chair Needs Second Win for Endorsement Riches", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/coach-who-fell-off-chair-needs-second-win-for-endorsement-riches", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isazvcxXHr2M/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/coach-who-fell-off-chair-needs-second-win-for-endorsement-riches", "twitter": {"description": "The college basketball coach who fell off his chair after his team\u2019s upset win in the NCAA tournament will need another victory to cash in on the moment that\u2019s become an Internet sensation.", "title": "Coach Who Fell Off Chair Needs Second Win for Endorsement Riches", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-20/coach-who-fell-off-chair-needs-second-win-for-endorsement-riches", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isazvcxXHr2M/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "fb": {"status": "The college basketball coach who fell off his chair after his team\u2019s upset win in the NCAA tournament will need another victory to cash in on the moment that\u2019s become an Internet sensation."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-title": "Coach Who Fell Off Chair Needs Second Win for Endorsement Riches", "parsely-tags": "Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NLIG236JTSEN01", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "parsely-author": "Scott Soshnick", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "date": "2015-03-20T12:58:01.289Z", "parsely-section": "culture", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/isazvcxXHr2M/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-03-20T12:58:01.289Z"}, "article_summary": "The college basketball coach who fell off his chair after his team\u2019s upset win in the NCAA tournament will need another victory to cash in on the moment that\u2019s become an Internet sensation.\n\u201cI saw him cannonball off his chair,\u201d R.J. told reporters after the game.\n\u201cNo question there\u2019s a father-son play here, but you need this thing to extend at least one week,\u201d said Brandon Steiner, founder of Steiner Sports Marketing.\nCoaches frequently use NCAA tournament success as leverage for more lucrative contracts or higher-paying jobs with more visible programs.\n\u201cIt makes a huge difference.\u201dNational ProminenceThe 50-year-old coach is already taking advantage of the notoriety."}
