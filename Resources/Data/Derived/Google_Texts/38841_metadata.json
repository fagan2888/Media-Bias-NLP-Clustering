And statewide, 11 of the 16 insurers won\u2019t cover visits to Buffalo\u2019s widely respected cancer center.\n\n\u201cThe question has to be asked: Why?\u201d said Dr. Willie Underwood III, a urologic oncologist at Roswell Park who\u2019s allied with its Office of Cancer Health Disparities Research.\n\nThe two local insurers that do not cover visits to Roswell Park are Fidelis Care and MVP Health Care. Spokespeople for the two insurers, which are both based in the Albany region, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRep. Brian Higgins, a Buffalo Democrat and one of the leading congressional advocates of cancer care and research, acknowledged that many insurers have narrowed their provider networks for plans they offer on the new health care exchanges in order to hold down costs.\n\nBut excluding comprehensive cancer care centers from an insurer\u2019s network is a step too far, said Higgins, who is otherwise a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis just needs to be fixed,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThere needs to be an administrative fix to it, but all cancer patients should have access to the highest quality of care.\u201d\n\nHiggins and Rep. Tom Reed, R-Corning, are preparing a letter to Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, to express their concerns about the issue and suggest changes that would ensure broader access to comprehensive cancer centers under the health reform law.\n\nUnderwood stressed that overall, the Affordable Care Act still increases Roswell Park\u2019s pool of potential patients. That\u2019s because most of the people buying insurance on the state exchange did not previously have health insurance.\n\nBut still, Underwood said it\u2019s a problem if insurers are excluding patients from the nation\u2019s top cancer centers.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to improve the health and health care of the nation,\u201d he said. \u201cTo create a situation that means that some people are excluded from these facilities is probably not within the intent of the law.\u201d\n\nSome 91 percent of Roswell Park\u2019s patients come from the eight counties of Western New York, while 6 percent come from other parts of New York State and 3 percent come from outside the state or outside the country.\n\nRoswell has been trying to broaden its service to people from other parts of the state \u2013 and Higgins said that will only get more difficult if insurers outside the region are not allowing their subscribers to go to Roswell Park.\n\n\u201cThis is a regional facility that depends both on residents and nonresidents,\u201d Higgins said.\n\nAnd while Underwood acknowledged that the overall number of patients being excluded from Roswell Park may be small, the consequences of that exclusion are not.\n\nAfter all, Roswell Park and the nation\u2019s 41 other comprehensive cancer care centers offer access to clinical trials and other specialized treatment not available at other hospitals.\n\n\u201cIt may be five people who are affected, but for those individuals, this matters 100 percent,\u201d Underwood said.\n\nemail: jzremski@buffnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Affordable Care Act may be increasing access to health care for millions of Americans, but it\u2019s excluding some potential patients from going to Roswell Park Cancer Institute and other top comprehensive cancer care centers.In a survey of 23 of the nation\u0201...", "og": {"site_name": "www.buffaloNews.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Affordable Care Act may be increasing access to health care for millions of Americans, but it\u2019s excluding some potential patients from going to Roswell Park Cancer Institute and other top comprehensive cancer care centers.In a survey of 23 of the nation\u0201... - The Buffalo News", "title": "Insurers exclude some potential patients from Roswell Park  - The Buffalo News", "url": "http://www.buffalonews.com/city-region/medical/insurers-exclude-some-potential-patients-from-roswell-park-20140322", "image": "http://www.buffalonews.com/images/BNSocialShareLG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TheBuffaloNews", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": "51000084,100004991951001"}, "__sync_contentCategory": "PayWall", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc4e3\"", "article_summary": "In the Buffalo area, five of the seven insurers on the state insurance exchange allow patients access to Roswell Park.\nThe two local insurers that do not cover visits to Roswell Park are Fidelis Care and MVP Health Care.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The Affordable Care Act may be increasing access to health care for millions of Americans, but it\u2019s excluding some potential patients from going to Roswell Park Cancer Institute and other top comprehensive cancer care centers.\nAfter all, Roswell Park and the nation\u2019s 41 other comprehensive cancer care centers offer access to clinical trials and other specialized treatment not available at other hospitals.\nAnd while Underwood acknowledged that the overall number of patients being excluded from Roswell Park may be small, the consequences of that exclusion are not."}
