Five people were injured Sunday when a car crashed through the front of a well-known Bonita Springs restaurant.

Witnesses said they heard the crash, followed by screams.

The crash occurred at about noon at the Old 41 Restaurant on Bernwood Drive, just off Old US 41.

"A car came through the front and it just kept on coming," said Dennis Crimboll. "Tables were flying and people were flying, there was glass. The car went all the way to the back of the restaurant."

Witnesses said the driver claims his foot got stuck on the gas pedal.

For David Johnson, it was a close call.

"It pushed me the whole length of the restaurant. I'm lucky it stopped within 10 feet of the wall or I don't know if I'd be standing here today," he said.

The owner of the restaurant said one of his managers suffered a broken leg, the most serious injury he's aware of.

Information on the victims' conditions, the driver or whether any charges will be filed has not been made available.
