( Danielle Venton/KQED )\n\nMore than 23,000 people have been evacuated in the face of the Valley Fire in Lake County and the Butte Fire east of Stockton. Officials have not set a timeline for when residents can return to their homes \u2014 if they have homes to return to.\n\nAs firefighters struggle to contain those fires and others burning across the state, relief workers are preparing to staff evacuation centers through the end of the week or longer.\n\nOne of those centers is the Napa County Fairgrounds in Calistoga, and it\u2019s a study in contrasts right now. There are big signs posted in carnival lettering that beckon people to buy tickets for the Calistoga Speedway. You can imagine the cotton candy hanging in the food and beverage window.\n\nBut today, hundreds of people who have lost everything they own line up for lunch served by the Red Cross.\n\nJenea Rubio walks with her husband, son and daughter, carrying plates of potato salad and pulled pork. They fled the wildfires in Hidden Valley over the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe literally had a four-minute warning to get out,\u201d Rubio says. \u201cWe had no time to grab [anything]. We left with the clothes on our backs.\u201d\n\nThen, on Sunday night, they were watching the news on TV and saw the remnants of their own home on the screen.\n\n\u201cIt was a video, so we were able to watch it and see that there\u2019s nothing left,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAt all. Anywhere on the property.\u201d\n\nRubio says knowing the house is gone is better than constantly wondering what happened to it.\n\n\u201cI just kind of felt a sense of peace once I knew, and I had an answer,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, it is what it is. We\u2019re going to deal with it and move on.\u201d\n\nFor a lot of other people here, the anxiety of not knowing is getting to them. Dr. Colleen Townsend, a family practice doctor in Napa, is helping to staff the makeshift medical center inside one of the buildings on the fairgrounds. She says anxiety is one of the main complaints. And that is making other health conditions worse.\n\n\u201cSo many folks in this area are really affected by chronic illness,\u201d Townsend says, especially diabetes and high blood pressure. Because people were evacuated so quickly, many didn\u2019t have time to grab medications.\n\n\u201cCertainly in these settings, their blood sugar and blood pressure are already rising just from the stress of the occasion,\u201d Townsend said. \u201cWithout adequate supplies of their medicines, that can cause acute symptoms like feeling shaky, nausea, sometimes dehydration.\u201d\n\nRaul Arroyo lies on a cot recovering from smoke inhalation and a high blood pressure scare. He\u2019s on six different drugs, but he hasn\u2019t taken any of them in three days.\n\nThere was \u201cno time to get anything,\u201d he says. \u201cNo medication, no nothing.\u201d\n\nHe lives in an apartment complex in Middletown. Many of his neighbors are disabled, and he tried to help them get out as the fire rushed into town.\n\nFrom his cot, he tries to describe how he\u2019s feeling. \u201cStress, helping people, because I thought I wasn\u2019t good enough, and see the thing coming, stressful, really bad,\u201d he says. \u201d \u2019Cause you don\u2019t know what to do, you know? That\u2019s worry, you know, lots of worry.\u201d\n\nMental health staff say most people here are still in shock. But as the days go by, they are expecting to see more people with signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.", "article_metadata": {"description": "One family said they had just 4 minutes to evacuate, leaving little time to get anything -- like medications.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Anxiety Taking Toll on Fire Evacuees and Exacerbating Other Health Problems\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/09\\/15\\/anxiety-taking-toll-on-fire-evacuees-and-exacerbating-other-health-problems\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-09-15 11:39:11\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-09-15 19:07:51\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":78182,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/09\\/RS16634_DSCF0132.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "One family said they had just 4 minutes to evacuate, leaving little time to get anything -- like medications.", "title": "Anxiety Taking Toll on Fire Evacuees and Exacerbating Other Health Problems", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/09/15/anxiety-taking-toll-on-fire-evacuees-and-exacerbating-other-health-problems/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/09/RS16634_DSCF0132.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccbf3\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSo many folks in this area are really affected by chronic illness,\u201d Townsend says, especially diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\u201cCertainly in these settings, their blood sugar and blood pressure are already rising just from the stress of the occasion,\u201d Townsend said.\nOne of those centers is the Napa County Fairgrounds in Calistoga, and it\u2019s a study in contrasts right now.\nTents for Valley Fire evacuees at the Napa County Fairgrounds in Calistoga.\nThat\u2019s worry, you know, lots of worry.\u201dMental health staff say most people here are still in shock."}
