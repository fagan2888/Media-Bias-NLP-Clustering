Kennedy was assassinated 50 years ago . They said they were there to peacefully show that carrying firearms is legal in Texas and that the people who do it aren\u2019t dangerous.\n\n\u201cWe are law abiding citizens exercising our rights,\u201d said Brad McClain, one of the organizers of the event.\n\nMcClain said he understood the significance of the site where they were protesting, but said they mostly picked the location because it was high-profile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s visible, it\u2019s historical and the landscape is perfect for photo ops,\u201d he said.\n\nMcClain said they planned to march from the plaza to the West End district. The event was organized to coincide with another rally at the Alamo in San Antonio, where organizers expected 1,000 people to show up.\n\nThe turnout in Dallas was paltry compared to that. The number of media and regular tourists at the site easily outnumbered the marchers. And many passersby seemed to misunderstand the purpose of the rally, thinking it was a group of conspiracy theorists. One person screamed \u201cI shot him,\u201d from his car as he drove by.\n\nMcClain said the turnout was low because many of the leading gun rights activists in the area went to the San Antonio event. But spirits were high. Attendees slung their weapons over their backs and talked and joked among each other. They even let a young group of tourists pose for pictures with their weapons.\n\n\u201cThese are good people out here that carry,\u201d said one attendee, Fort Worth resident David White.\n\nThe protest lasted for about 45 minutes. Then, the group gathered, said a prayer and walked with their weapons to Chipotle for some lunch.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzEwL2d1bi1yaWdodHMtYWR2b2NhdGVzLW1hcmNoLXdpdGgtcmlmbGVzLWF0LWRlYWxleS1wbGF6YS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Matthew Watkins", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "About a dozen people carrying rifles protested in Dallas Saturday morning at the sight of one of the most infamous gun crimes in United States history.
