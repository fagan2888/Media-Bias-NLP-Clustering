The CRS issues about 1,000 such reports annually at a cost to taxpayers of $107 million.\n\nBut for the most part, taxpayers don't get to see the reports they pay for. They are held close to the vest by the lawmakers who requested them.\n\nU.S. Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th Dist.) is trying to change all that. He has introduced legislation with Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) to make the reports public.\n\n\"These reports are paid for by taxpayer dollars,\" Lance said. \"Taxpayers should get to see them.\"\n\nLance said lawmakers can give the reports to lobbyists or others as a favor, but they are not released to the general public. \"I don't think that's appropriate,\" he said.\n\nMembers who ask for private reports can still get them, Lance said. For the most part, though, the reports focus on major national issues and the information is of concern to the public.\n\nLance said the best opportunity to change the policy could come when the Senate confirms a new librarian of Congress to succeed James Billington, who retired earlier this year after almost three decades of service.\n\n\"We have among the best researchers anywhere on earth,\" Lance said. \"These are certainly topical. They should be made available to the American public.\"\n\nJonathan D. Salant may be reached at jsalant@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @JDSalant.
