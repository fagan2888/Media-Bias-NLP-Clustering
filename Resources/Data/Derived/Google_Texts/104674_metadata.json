It came one day after the Senate voted 68-29 to provide that $1.1 billion in emergency Zika funds as part of a larger spending bill for transportation, housing and military construction projects.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) took to the floor Wednesday to argue that the larger bill could easily get tied up in Congress' dysfunctional process, and be stalled until the fall -- well after the money will be needed. The Zika spending should be broken out, they argued.\n\n\u201cAs the weather warms, the mosquitoes will multiply and people will be bitten by these vicious little insects,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThe appropriations process -- to say it is slow is a gross understatement. We need to get this done now.\u201d\n\nPart of Democrats' concerns stem from the legislation House Republicans are currently considering -- $622 million redirected from previously authorized Ebola funds and other programs. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) argues that the House proposal should be seen as an addition to the roughly $600 million the White House has already transferred from its Ebola response.\n\nIn any case, the House and Senate proposals are different, and the Senate's is currently tied to a spending bill, which could require a conference committee process to work out the differences.\n\n\u201cSo how are we going to take these things to conference when the House can\u2019t even come up with a budget?\u201d Reid said, tweaking Ryan for his inability to get his members in line behind even a basic annual fiscal blueprint.\n\nAfter Reid\u2019s request to push through the president\u2019s full $1.9 billion was unsuccessful, Murray took a shot, calling for a vote on the $1.1 billion Zika deal she'd helped craft with Republicans, but as a standalone.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason to keep it attached to the bill we\u2019re on and allow House Republicans to slow-walk it,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason that this funding can\u2019t be approved and signed into law next week, in time for summer and the peak of mosquito season.\u201d\n\nBut Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) objected, and instead asked her to modify her request in a way that Republicans might prefer.\n\n\"Would the senator modify her request to include my language... which has the exact same funding levels... but includes a pay-for using the prevention fund in the Affordable Care Act?\" Cornyn said, referring a part of Obamacare that aims to boost public health through preventive means, but that Republicans often target as a slush fund. (You can read more about the prevention fund here.)\n\nMurray objected to Cornyn's counteroffer, noting that the prevention fund helps keep women and infants healthy -- one of her same goals in pushing emergency Zika funding.\n\n\"The agreement that the senator from Texas has just broached means that we're going to have to fight over cuts -- cuts to women, cuts to families, cuts to critical health care efforts in order to fight the Zika virus,\" Murray said. \"That is objectionable.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Worth a shot, right?", "sailthru.expire_date": "2016-05-19 16:14:30 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Worth a shot, right?", "title": "GOP Senator Tries To Take Zika Money Hostage Over Obamacare Cuts", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-cornyn-zika-funding_us_573cb65ae4b0646cbeebd2b3", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/573cc7cf130000d6053821ba.jpeg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Worth a shot, right?", "creator": "@lbarronlopez,@mmcauliff", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/573cc7cf130000d6053821ba.jpeg", "height": 1000}, "title": "GOP Senator Tries To Take Zika Money Hostage Over Obamacare Cuts", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-05-18 16:14:30 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_573cb65ae4b0646cbeebd2b3", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "zika virus,Patty Murray,Harry Reid ,John Cornyn", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "zika virus,Patty Murray,Harry Reid ,John Cornyn", "published_time": "2016-05-18 16:14:30 -0400", "modified_time": "2016-05-18 16:22:10 -0400", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/MichaelGMcAuliff"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "\"The agreement that the senator from Texas has just broached means that we're going to have to fight over cuts -- cuts to women, cuts to families, cuts to critical health care efforts in order to fight the Zika virus,\" Murray said.\n\u201cThere is no reason to keep it attached to the bill we\u2019re on and allow House Republicans to slow-walk it,\u201d Murray said.\nMurray objected to Cornyn's counteroffer, noting that the prevention fund helps keep women and infants healthy -- one of her same goals in pushing emergency Zika funding.\nWe need to get this done now.\u201dPart of Democrats' concerns stem from the legislation House Republicans are currently considering -- $622 million redirected from previously authorized Ebola funds and other programs.\nIt came one day after the Senate voted 68-29 to provide that $1.1 billion in emergency Zika funds as part of a larger spending bill for transportation, housing and military construction projects."}
