The leaders of these companies rely on their ability to make independent choices in the best interests of their organizations and employees. But one of those choices\u2014to self-fund their employees' health care\u2014is at risk of being lost.\n\n\n\nFor employers who self-fund, stop-loss insurance is essential. It caps their liability in the event of large, unforeseen claims that would otherwise threaten their fiscal stability. Such claims can come from including accidents, illnesses, hospitalizations, or even a particularly bad flu season, like the one we had this year.\n\n\n\nState law prohibits small companies\u2014those with two to 50 employees\u2014from purchasing stop-loss protection. That effectively prevents them from self-funding. Unfortunately, this prohibition is about to be extended to employers with up to 100 workers, because the Affordable Care Act requires New York to redefine small businesses that way beginning in 2016.\n\n\n\nNo other state in the nation would have this prohibition on stop loss. The expanded ban would put New York at a competitive disadvantage against New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and other nearby states.\n\n\n\nAbout 1,700 New York businesses statewide with 51 to 100 employees self-fund insurance for 127,500 workers. Self-funding allows them to offer more personalized health care plans to meet the specific needs of their employees, and provides a stronger incentive to promote employee health and workplace wellness programs. Employees benefit from high-quality, affordable care, giving them greater peace of mind.\n\nWithout the financial protection of stop loss insurance, many of these employers will be unable to provide their current levels of health benefits. The negative consequences would be profound: If an employer were forced to switch plans, its workers would risk losing in-network access to their current doctors and hospitals. Employers could also lose the edge that strong health benefits offer in attracting and retaining talent. And, ultimately, it would be far harder for these employers to comply with the Affordable Care Act's coverage mandate when it takes effect Jan. 1, 2016.\n\n\n\nThe loss of small businesses' opportunity to self-fund could have other consequences, too. Some could decide to drop health benefits altogether by downsizing or cutting employee hours. According to a 2012 RAND study model, \"When self-insurance is not an option, most firms that would otherwise have self-insured decline to offer coverage rather than [purchasing health insurance on] the [public] exchanges.\"\n\n\n\nAt companies who do switch to the exchanges or who drop coverage altogether, employees could face serious sticker shock. Workers who move to an exchange plan in New York would likely be downgrading from a gold- or platinum-rated plan to a silver or bronze one. In doing so, they would likely face significantly higher out-of-pocket costs and much higher deductibles.\n\n\n\nLast year, bills to let employers with 51 to 100 workers continue buying stop-loss insurance passed the state Senate but not the Assembly. Similar bills have been introduced again, and the Senate version, S. 2366 , has received unanimous bipartisan support in the Senate Insurance Committee and is poised for a vote by the full Senate. But the Assembly version, A. 1154, has been stalled for nearly four months in the Assembly Insurance Committee.\n\n\n\nNew York's small businesses leaders want to do the right thing by offering quality health benefits to their hard working employees. They should have access to the same options as larger companies. The Senate and Assembly to pass these bills to let thousands of small businesses continue to purchase stop-loss insurance.\n\n\n\nScott Evelyn is the tri-state general manager at the health insurance company Cigna.\n\nGet Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.
