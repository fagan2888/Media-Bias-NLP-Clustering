A cat rescued from a Wichita rooftop Christmas day has been nursed back to health and is settling into her new home.

For five days in December, the cat was stuck on a rooftop of a home on N. Topeka Street near downtown Wichita. Annette Wooldridge heard the cat crying and tried to help. But she says the homeowner wouldn't let her bring over a ladder.

She says she and her neighbors tried calling the police department, the fire department, animal control, and others. But they say nobody came to the rescue.

So, she called KAKE News. As she and two of her neighbors tried to coax the cat down, KAKE's Jason Tarr made some calls. Not long later on Christmas day, a fire truck arrived and firefighters rescued the cat.

Wooldridge and her neighbors say they decided to call the cat "Kake" to show their appreciation.

KAKE News checked in with Kake the cat Sunday. Annette and her husband, Frank, have lovingly provided the cat a home.

"When we first got her (down from the roof) she was really thin and she worried about food a lot. She ate everything as soon as it went out! Then she finally started to relax a little bit and get more social!" Wooldridge said. "I don't regret it for one minute."

Wooldridge says Kake even is getting along with their other cat, Furby. She says Kake has even picked out a favorite spot in the apartment: curled up near the TV.

"Channel 10 KAKE, I couldn't have done it with you and everybody!" Wooldridge said.
