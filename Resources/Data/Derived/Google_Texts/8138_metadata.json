Peyton Manning, addressing the media at the podium, appeared frustrated, hamstrung. Wes Welker was absent, concussed since Sunday and held out of Denver\u2019s 27-20 loss to San Diego.\n\nAnd so the media horde settled at Andre Caldwell\u2019s locker. Poor Bubba, he of the two touchdown receptions, six catches and 59 yards, he who led the Broncos\u2019 offense in every category. He was the hero on a night when heroes don\u2019t matter, but after a season sacrificing a bigger role for a spot on Denver\u2019s roster, he\u2019s not looking for pity.\n\nHe\u2019s looking for playing time, and it finally came Thursday, under the least desirable of circumstances. It came filling in for Welker.\n\nCaldwell was on the field for more than half the Broncos\u2019 offensive plays, getting reps that would have otherwise gone to Welker. Tell anyone before the game that Welker\u2019s replacement would post the numbers Caldwell did, and to assume a Denver victory would be logical. You see, those numbers would come with the assumption that Julius Thomas was productive, and Demaryius Thomas, and Knowshon Moreno too, and maybe even Montee Ball.\n\nThe problem is, those assumptions were false. Julius Thomas, Demaryius Thomas and Eric Decker combined for only 136 yards receiving. Moreno and Ball, though they had 10 catches between them, combined to rush for only 18 yards. Add in the Broncos\u2019 inability to convert on third down \u2014 they went 2-of-9 \u2014 and the offense became stagnated.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the Denver offense the rest of the NFL has come to fear.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Caldwell, who has the biggest game of his Broncos career and he can\u2019t even smile. When the questions are flying about how much the team missed Welker, it\u2019s hard not to feel a little bit sorry for the guy replacing him.\n\n\u201cBubba Caldwell played excellent,\u201d Manning said. \u201cHe had a great route on his first touchdown, then a good job getting in the end zone. \u2026 I think it tells you the confidence I have in him. Adam (Gase) called his number a couple of times, and I went right to him.\u201d\n\nCaldwell deserves credit. He deserves that confidence. He\u2019s slogged through two years in a minor role to get his chance, and his performance Thursday proved he hasn\u2019t let up.\n\n\u201cWe believe in Bubba,\u201d Julius Thomas said. \u201cWe see what he\u2019s able to do all of the time, but how do you get in? How do you find time out there on the field?\u201d\n\nAs disappointing as Thursday\u2019s game was, the Bubba Show proved one thing: In this offense, the backups are ready, no matter when. Caldwell said he wasn\u2019t certain before the game how much his role would expand, and he was ready for anything. As one of Manning\u2019s receivers, he knows this: He had better be ready when his name is called.\n\nSo don\u2019t blame Welker\u2019s absence for the Broncos\u2019 struggles, or the Chargers\u2019 control of the clock.\n\nThursday was a night when the replacement, the mystery, was dependable, and the mainstays were miserable. It was bizarre, and the Broncos hope it never happens again.\n\nExcept, of course, for Caldwell. He\u2019s more than welcome to take another crack at being the hero, if given the opportunity.\n\nJoan Niesen: jniesen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joanniesen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Andre Caldwell quick to catch up", "title": "Andre Caldwell quick to catch up", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/13/andre-caldwell-quick-to-catch-up/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131213__20131214_B1_SP14FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 487}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131213__20131214_B1_SP14FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-13T21:12:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:09:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd829f\"", "article_summary": "Poor Bubba, he of the two touchdown receptions, six catches and 59 yards, he who led the Broncos\u2019 offense in every category.\nTell anyone before the game that Welker\u2019s replacement would post the numbers Caldwell did, and to assume a Denver victory would be logical.\nCaldwell said he wasn\u2019t certain before the game how much his role would expand, and he was ready for anything.\nAnd then there\u2019s Caldwell, who has the biggest game of his Broncos career and he can\u2019t even smile.\nCaldwell was on the field for more than half the Broncos\u2019 offensive plays, getting reps that would have otherwise gone to Welker."}
