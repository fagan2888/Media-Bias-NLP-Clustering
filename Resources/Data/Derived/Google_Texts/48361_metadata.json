Instead they\u2019ll get a stipend from the company, which they can use to buy their own health insurance.\n\nDuke joins large companies including IBM, General Electric, Time Warner, DuPont and Caterpillar that are moving retirees off company-run health plans and offering a direct subsidy.\n\nMany companies making the shift are moving retirees to a health exchange, where they can shop for plans. Duke is different because it only offers a stipend to retirees who buy coverage from the company\u2019s insurer, United Health Care.\n\nMost retirees qualify for Medicare, but retirees have supplemental plans to cover gaps in government coverage.\n\nExperts in the field say the move will benefit some employees who can switch from a one-size-fits-all plan to one tailored for them. But workers who need more coverage may end up paying more for their health care in the long run.\n\nDuke\u2019s move is part of a historic shift in health insurance coverage. The Wall Street Journal reports that among large companies offering health care to employees, almost three quarters do not offer it to retirees.\n\nGuest", "article_metadata": {"description": "Duke Energy has joined a growing list of large companies that are moving retirees off of company-run health plans, instead offering them stipends they can use to buy their own health insurance.", "application-name": "WBUR: Here and Now", "og": {"site_name": "hereandnow", "description": "Duke Energy has joined a growing list of large companies that are moving retirees off of company-run health plans, instead offering them stipends they can use to buy their own health insurance.", "title": "Duke Energy Is The Latest Big Company To Move Retirees Off Heath Plan", "url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/09/19/duke-energy-health", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2013/09/0919-dukeenergy1-e1379605311979-624x408.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/09/19/duke-energy-health", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/11/files/2013/09/0919-dukeenergy1-e1379605311979-624x408.jpg", "site": "@HereAndNow", "card": "summary", "title": "Duke Energy Is The Latest Big Company To Move Retirees Off Heath Plan"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-19", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "article_summary": "The Wall Street Journal reports that among large companies offering health care to employees, almost three quarters do not offer it to retirees.\nDuke joins large companies including IBM, General Electric, Time Warner, DuPont and Caterpillar that are moving retirees off company-run health plans and offering a direct subsidy.\nMany companies making the shift are moving retirees to a health exchange, where they can shop for plans.\nDuke is different because it only offers a stipend to retirees who buy coverage from the company\u2019s insurer, United Health Care.\nMost retirees qualify for Medicare, but retirees have supplemental plans to cover gaps in government coverage."}
