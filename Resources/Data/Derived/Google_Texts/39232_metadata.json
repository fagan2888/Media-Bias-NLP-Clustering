Oliver is specifically concerned with the future of expanded Medicaid benefits, citing several key elections among the 20 states that bafflingly decided not to expand Medicaid, thereby providing health coverage to those who need it most.\n\n\"Basically, for relatively little of their own money, states could cover all of their poorest citizens,\" Oliver says, citing one of the crucial components of the Affordable Care Act. \"It was an exceptionally favorable deal, but guess what many states chose to do?\" If you guessed \"Act against the interest of the people who need it most!\" then, wow, you\u2019re a tremendous guesser.\n\nOliver reserves the bulk of his characteristically thorough segment for Kentucky, a state that has apparently \"seen the nation\u2019s steepest drop in uninsured residents\" since adopting a Medicaid expansion plan. \"Only an idiot would try to undo that,\" Oliver proposes, \"which brings me to gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin.\"\n\nIn addition to some downright charming Bevin blasting, Oliver also delivers this distinctly Oliver-esque gem:\n\n\"Healthcare is like a pair of gym shorts. Even if it covers nearly all it\u2019s supposed to, you\u2019re still left with some problematic gaps. Terrible things can happen.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_feed_thumb/Screen_Shot_2015-11-02_at_5_opt_vnchxd.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Trace Cowen", "description": "Important elections are taking place, as in the ones happening soon.
