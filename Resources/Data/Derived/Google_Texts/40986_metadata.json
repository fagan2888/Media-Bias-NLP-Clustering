Despite a few hiccups, they have pitched relatively well in spring training.\n\nTheir cumulative ERA is 3.58, with Bettis (2.57) on the low end and Lyles (5.56) on the high end after a rough outing followed by a strong four innings Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s very early, of course. But the early returns are good news for general manager Jeff Bridich, who did not make any trades during the offseason to bolster the rotation, despite Colorado\u2019s 5.27 ERA in 2015 being the worst in the National League.\n\n\u201cI think, for the most part, the outings have been very competitive,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cYou can\u2019t go crazy, one way or another. You try to keep a rational perspective on it. But, yeah, they have been competitive.\u201d\n\nBettis and De La Rosa spent the entire winter working out and throwing at Salt River Fields, and they came into camp prepared to pitch well.\n\n\u201cWe are able to start them right away, in games, at three innings,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cI think they really prepared themselves well and I think it shows. De La (Rosa) is physically in good shape and he\u2019s in a good place. It\u2019s fun to watch.\u201d\n\nTom Murphy\u2019s place\n\nTom Murphy, penciled in as the Rockies\u2019 catcher of the future, was optioned to the minor-league camp Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Rockies were displeased with his performance at spring training, but they consider him a work in progress. Playing for Triple-A Albuquerque, he will be given an opportunity to play nearly every day instead of getting sporadic playing time as Nick Hundley\u2019s backup.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of it,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cPlus, there is some development that he needs to work on. He needs to play, and that development process is best served playing every single day.\u201d\n\n\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post\n\nSpring Training Recap: Rockies 5, Padres 5\n\nAt Peoria Sports Complex\n\nRight-hander Tyler Chatwood continued his comeback from Tommy John surgery in strong fashion Saturday. He had a first-inning hiccup, walking a batter to set up a two-run homer by San Diego Padres shortstop Jemile Weeks, but he settled down after that, allowing just three hits and striking out two over four innings. Chatwood\u2019s outing was his longest appearance since he underwent his arm surgery in 2014. \u201cI felt good,\u201d Chatwood said. \u201cThe biggest thing was I got better as I went along. The second time through the lineup, I felt sharper, so that\u2019s a big thing for me going forward, building the confidence up.\u201d He was especially happy with how his right arm felt. \u201cThis is my first time to go four innings since I got hurt, so this was an exciting day to be able to get out and go four innings,\u201d he said. \u201cNext time I\u2019ll go five and 75 (pitches).\u201d\n\nHits:\n\nBrandon Barnes broke out of a spring funk, going 3-for-3 with two RBIs.\n\nOutfielder Gerardo Parra had two hits.\n\nMiss:\n\nLeft-handed reliever Boone Logan gave up one run on one hit and threw two wild pitches in two-thirds of an inning.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nThe Rockies host the San Francisco Giants on Sunday at Salt River Fields, 2:10 p.m. MDT (no TV, KOA 850 AM).\n\nRockies\u2019 pitchers \u2014 LHP Jorge De La Rosa, LHP Yohan Flande\n\nGiants\u2019 starter \u2014 RHP Clayton Blackburn", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 starting rotation off to solid start in spring training", "title": "Rockies\u2019 starting rotation off to solid start in spring training", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/19/rockies-starting-rotation-off-to-solid-start-in-spring-training/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__7fb3ab05417548ce97ef30c02879c796p1-1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160319__7fb3ab05417548ce97ef30c02879c796p1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-19T20:06:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:38:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. \u2014 The Rockies\u2019 starting rotation \u2014 featuring Jorge De La Rosa, Chad Bettis, Jordan Lyles, Tyler Chatwood and Jon Gray \u2014 appears set.\n\u201cWe are able to start them right away, in games, at three innings,\u201d Bridich said.\nRockies\u2019 pitchers \u2014 LHP Jorge De La Rosa, LHP Yohan FlandeGiants\u2019 starter \u2014 RHP Clayton Blackburn\nIt\u2019s not that the Rockies were displeased with his performance at spring training, but they consider him a work in progress.\nDe La (Rosa) is physically in good shape and he\u2019s in a good place."}
