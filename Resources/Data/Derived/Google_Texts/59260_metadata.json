(It wouldn\u2019t, supervisors said.)\n\nOthers questioned the timing of the reorganization when the future of the county\u2019s health insurance plan was uncertain.\n\nIn what was perhaps the most contentious moment of the meeting, Story County Auditor Lucy Martin questioned the timing of the board\u2019s decision to reorganize the positions \u2014 intended to improve the efficiency of departmental communications with the board \u2014 when morale was low because of the regionalization of the county\u2019s mental health program and health insurance change.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, we don\u2019t know what the status quo is,\u201d she said. \u201cThe status quo for the county is crumbling beneath us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere you\u2019re going to superlative kind of statements that aren\u2019t even close to accurate, it doesn\u2019t help anything,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cJust tone it down a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, thanks Dad,\u201d Martin shot back, before saying she thought the board had improved efficiency in recent years but risked \u201cthrowing all of that credibility away with this proposal.\u201d\n\nThe board had proposed reshuffling current staff, moving Community Services Director Deb Schildroth into the position of director of external operations and county services and adding the position of director of internal operations and human resources to Human Resources Director Alissa Wignall\u2019s workload.\n\nOne of the promotions, Sanders said, would come with a salary increase.\n\nOther county employees split their allegiances. County Attorney Stephen Holmes sided with the board, noting it had broad discretion in hiring decisions.\n\nBut Information Technology Director Barb Steinbeck agreed with Martin\u2019s assessment of \u201ccrumbling\u201d morale.\n\nEnvironmental Health Director Margaret Jaynes said the reorganization was an \u201cinsult\u201d to other department heads, a suggestion they were inadequately efficient. Jaynes also criticized what she viewed as a lack of competition for the positions, arguing it seemed that Wignall and Schildroth had been \u201ctapped on the shoulder\u201d for them.\n\nEarlier, sheriff\u2019s Deputies Adam Christian and Bret Johnson grilled the board about how the flexible account money would be used next fiscal year and why employees were only informed this month about the change when, as Sanders said, the board knew a mandated change was a possibility 2 1/2 years ago.\n\n\u201cYou realized 2 1/2 years ago that this could have been a problem and yet, because you thought that the issue wasn\u2019t going to be a problem, you didn\u2019t explore any other options,\u201d Christian said.\n\nSanders objected, replying the county hired a broker to review the county\u2019s insurance system then, and Sanders had argued that the county should explore ditching the flexible accounts \u201cbut was shouted down like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nHe said he was only made aware of the required change this month.\n\nThe county\u2019s flexible plan, which will become unlawful beginning July 1 because of an Internal Revenue Service ruling last November, allows employees to collect $575 a month in lieu of taking county health insurance that supervisors acknowledged was subpar.\n\nBecause taking the cash no longer will be allowed starting next fiscal year, the majority of the 300-plus full-time employees who opt out of the county insurance don\u2019t know what will come of the $6,900 they would otherwise continue to receive.\n\nSupervisors stressed that the flexible account money would not go toward the reorganized staff positions but to the county\u2019s general fund.\n\n\u201cI think, looking at the initial numbers, that we will end up in a situation where Story County is spending more money total than it is right now on the health benefit package,\u201d Sanders said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to mean that different employees get different things out of that package \u2026 (but) it\u2019s in a pool, it\u2019s going to stay in a pool, it\u2019s just going to be divided differently.\u201d\n\nSanders predicted that three separate health insurance options would be available for employees next fiscal year.\n\nSupervisors took no action on the insurance question, which wasn\u2019t on the agenda. But after they voted unanimously to appoint Wignall and Schildroth to the reorganized positions effective July 1, the sheriff\u2019s deputies and the other critics of the board\u2019s decisions exited the room.\n\nSupervisors subsequently cast another unanimous vote to establish a new county job position for a \u201chuman resources generalist.\u201d\n\nWignall guessed that the position would come with a salary of around $50,000.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tensions flared Tuesday between the Story County Board of Supervisors and other county employees over the handling of mandated changes to health insurance options and the reorganization of two liaison staff positions that some viewed as problematic.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Gavin Aronsen Staff Writer garonsen@amestrib.com", "og": {"site_name": "Ames Tribune", "description": "Tensions flared Tuesday between the Story County Board of Supervisors and other county employees over the handling of mandated changes to health insurance options and the reorganization of two liaison staff positions that some viewed as problematic.", "title": "Tensions flare at supervisors meeting; employees, supervisors clash over insurance, staffing changes", "url": "http://amestrib.com/news/tensions-flare-supervisors-meeting-employees-supervisors-clash-over-insurance-staffing-changes", "image": "http://amestrib.com/sites/amestrib.com/smtheme/_img/site-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://amestrib.com/news/tensions-flare-supervisors-meeting-employees-supervisors-clash-over-insurance-staffing-changes", "title": "Tensions flare at supervisors meeting; employees, supervisors clash over insurance, staffing changes", "description": "Tensions flared Tuesday between the Story County Board of Supervisors and other county employees over the handling of mandated changes to health insurance options and the reorganization of two liaison staff positions that some viewed as problematic.", "creator": "@AmesTribNews"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1019145", "app_name": "ames-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.amestribune"}, "ios": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1019145", "app_store_id": 552175169, "app_name": "ames-tribune"}}, "keywords": "News,Ames and Story County,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-20T23:49:26-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce30b\"", "article_summary": "Others questioned the timing of the reorganization when the future of the county\u2019s health insurance plan was uncertain.\nEnvironmental Health Director Margaret Jaynes said the reorganization was an \u201cinsult\u201d to other department heads, a suggestion they were inadequately efficient.\nTensions flared Tuesday between the Story County Board of Supervisors and other county employees over the handling of mandated changes to health insurance options and the reorganization of two liaison staff positions that some viewed as problematic.\nOther county employees split their allegiances.\nSupervisors stressed that the flexible account money would not go toward the reorganized staff positions but to the county\u2019s general fund."}
