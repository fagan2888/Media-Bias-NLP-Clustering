Rick Stewart/Getty Images\n\nTwo former Philadelphia Phillies recently expressed some bitter pheelings toward each other. According to the New York Daily News, Mitch Williams and Bankruptcy Beat legend Lenny \u201cNails\u201d Dykstra traded barbs during the Philly Sports Roast, an event that helps raise money for charity. The Daily News noted that the bad blood between the two started when Mr. Williams gave up a walk-off home run during a 1993 World Series game (skip to 2:47:55) against the Toronto Blue Jays, causing the Phillies to lose and to give the Blue Jays the championship.\n\n\u201cPrison was like a f\u2014\u2014 fantasy camp\u201d compared to playing with Mr. Williams, said Mr. Dykstra, who went away for bankruptcy fraud. He continued with some scathing words about Mr. Williams\u2019s former gig as an analyst for the MLB Network, noting, \u201cHe found a way to f\u2014 that up just like he found a way to f\u2014 up the World Series. What haven\u2019t you f\u2014\u2013 up?\u201d\n\nMr. Williams\u2019s reply? \u201cI have five kids that I have never stolen a dollar from,\u201d a comment that Mr. Dykstra seemed to take offense to, retorting, \u201cThis is about baseball, not personal.\u201d\n\nSuper Bowl ticket seller SBTickets.com didn\u2019t have a super week. Amid battles with customers whose tickets to the Big Game fell through, the New York ticket short seller filed for chapter 11 protection, Bankruptcy Beat reported. People from as far away as Papua New Guinea and Australia are looking to recoup money for travel and lodging after their tickets to the game failed to materialize just hours before kickoff. Mark Jay Heller, a lawyer for the company, said SBTickets hadn\u2019t realized there would be a shortage of tickets and that \u201cregrettably, at the final hour, the tickets were not made available.\u201d The company said this was the first time it didn\u2019t have enough tickets.\n\nThe company that distributed movies such as \u201cAce Ventura\u201d and \u201cRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\u201d is getting ready to leave bankruptcy. According to Reuters, Inverness Distribution Ltd. got the OK to emerge from bankruptcy despite protests from the U.S. trustee in the case. Judge Shelley Chapman of the Manhattan bankruptcy court said the U.S. trustee\u2014an arm of the Department of Justice\u2014had a \u201cvery, very disturbing\u201d dependence on doctrine. Inverness, which also distributed \u201cMajor League\u201d and \u201cTrue Romance,\u201d filed for bankruptcy in 2011.\n\nWrite to Melanie Cohen at melanie.cohen@wsj.com.
