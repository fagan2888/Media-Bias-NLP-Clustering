That\u2019s what we at Judicial Watch (JW) discovered anew after obtaining records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force highlighting yet another Obama fundraising trip to Los Angeles and San Francisco, California.\n\nThese documents came to us in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed on October 20, 2014. Instead of advancing the nation\u2019s interests and keeping the public trust, the president is instead, once again, using taxpayer money to subsidize lavish political junkets.\n\nOn October 9 2014, Obama attended a ritzy fundraiser hosted by Hollywood actress Gwyneth Paltrow in Los Angeles. Obama also attended \u201ca $15,000-per person \u2019roundtable\u2019 discussion fundraiser for the DNC on Friday morning at the home of restaurateur Michael Chow and his wife Eva, a fashion designer.\u201d\n\nThen he went to San Francisco for two more fundraisers, including one at a \u201cprivate home.\u201d The AP reported that \u201cthe event, his fourth California fundraiser in three days, is closed to media coverage.\u201d\n\nAccording to the newly released records JW obtained, transportation for Obama to Los Angeles, California, on October 9, 2014, for the Paltrow fundraiser cost taxpayers $1,011,051.30. Transportation for Obama to San Francisco, California on October 10, 2014, fundraiser cost taxpayers an additional $165,069.60.\n\nObama\u2019s fundraiser at the home of Paltrow marked his thirtieth Los Angeles fundraiser since he took office \u2013 though his July fundraiser at the home of Michael Rapino had been billed as \u201cthe last trip to Los Angeles the president will be making this year,\u201d according to KCAL TV. With the threat of a Republican sweep of Senate seats, however, Hollywood again opened its coffers in another attempt to raise money for the Democratic National Committee a month out from mid-term elections. The fundraiser at the home of A-list actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who also held a fundraising event for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, came with a price tag of up to $32,400 per attendee.\n\nWhile Obama benefits financially from the allure of Hollywood, some of the comments made by his host proved to be more than a little embarrassing. Paltrow showed an apparent disregard (or perhaps lack of understanding) for the constitutional separation of powers when at one point she gushed, \u201cIt would be wonderful if we were able to give this man all of the power that he needs to pass the things that he needs to pass.\u201d Even the editors at TMZ, a popular celebrity gossip news site, gave Paltrow and Obama a harsh tongue-lashing for that comment. \u201cIt\u2019s the latest example of how demeaning it has become for Presidents to act like circus animals \u2013 performing for crowds that will feed them\u2026\u201d TMZ editors concluded, \u201c\u2026the celebrity circus has sullied the Presidency of the United States.\u201d\n\nOn October 10 2014, Obama took time out from his fundraising schedule to declare the Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park part of the San Gabriel Mountains in San Dimas as a national monument via executive order, bypassing the constitutional authority of Congress to declare a national park \u2013 and making it more difficult to protect our border.\n\nEven as Obama postures as a champion of average Americans, he continues to run up excessive tabs for taxpayer-funded political junkets. Over the Labor Day Weekend, for example, Obama ran up a total of $1,539,402.10 in taxpayer-paid transportation expenses.\n\nThe trip began in Westchester, New York, on Friday, August 29 2014. While in New York, Obama attended two fundraisers for the Democratic National Committee, one of them a BBQ at the home of millionaire and former UBS CEO Robert Wolf. Obama later that day took off for Providence, Rhode Island, for a fundraiser at the plush private residence of former Nortek CEO Richard Bready and Betty Easton, where tickets cost up to $32,400. Although the president was initially scheduled to fly back to Westchester, New York, that Friday night, and then return to D.C. after attending the Saturday wedding of White House chef Sam Kass to MSNBC host Alex Wagner, he made some very costly last minute changes. Instead, according to White House press secretary Josh Ernst, Obama flew back to Washington on Friday to \u201csleep in his own bed, do a little work\u2026 spend time with his family \u2026.\u201d Then he flew back to New York on Saturday \u2013 at a cost total of $295,227.80 more in taxpayer-paid flight expenses. And that is nearly six times what the average American makes in a year \u2013 an amount which, critics would argue not so coincidentally, has actually fallen 8% since Obama became president.\n\nTaxpayers are being gouged by President Obama for unnecessary travel for political fundraising and vacations.\n\nThere needs to be a reconsideration of the longstanding taxpayer subsidy that forces our nation\u2019s military and Secret Service into the service of political parties and candidates.\n\nPrior presidents \u2013 Republican and Democrat \u2013 also made 30 plus trips on Air Force One for fundraising activities. Reimbursement by the parties and candidates for the tremendous costs to taxpayers is ridiculously low \u2013 just relatively modest airfare and money for hotel, food. It is a scam and the actual process for billing is secret, as the AP reports, in the most transparent White House in history:\n\nWhen a presidential trip includes multiple stops, some of them for political events and some for official purposes, then travel costs get divided up between the campaign and the government. But following a decades-old White House tradition, Obama aides declined to share details on how that\u2019s done.\n\nThis is an area ripe for reform, which JW hopes its works can further. Could you imagine an easier issue to unite Democrats and Republicans than the notion of requiring politicians to more fairly reimburse our decimated Defense Department and barely functional Secret Service for those agencies precious services that turns the President of the United States into the traveling Barnum and Bailey of political fundraising?\n\nIn the meantime, President Obama will abuse his presidential perks further by going to Hawaii for a 17 day \u201cworking vacation.\u201d JW found that one prior Christmas vacation for Obama cost you and your grandchildren \u2013 and their grandchildren \u2013 $4,086,355.20 for flights alone! Try not to think of how our country is going further into debt as you enjoy your Christmas.\n\nYour JW is the best source for details on Air Obama. A complete rundown of First Family vacations and junkets is available here.\n\nWho is On the Obama Enemies List? Judicial Watch Sues to Find Out.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that Judicial Watch has joined forces with investigative journalist Sharyl Attkisson in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed jointly against the Department of Justice (DOJ). We want \u201cany and all records\u201d relating to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) background checks on the award-winning correspondent. The request includes correspondence between Attkisson and FBI agents.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by Judicial Watch one month ago, the DOJ and the White House targeted the former CBS correspondent as a result of her investigations into the growing Operation Fast and Furious scandal. In an October 4, 2011, email to White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz, Attorney General Eric Holder\u2019s top press aide, Tracy Schmaler, described Attkisson as \u201cout of control.\u201d Schmaler added ominously, \u201cI\u2019m also calling Sharryl\u2019s [sic] editor and reaching out to Scheiffer\u201d (an apparent reference to CBS\u2019 Chief Washington Correspondent and Face the Nation moderator Bob Scheiffer). Schultz responded, \u201cGood. Her piece was really bad for the AG.\u201d\n\nLeaving no stone unturned, the Judicial Watch/Attkisson lawsuit specifically asks for:\n\n\u201cAny and all records concerned, regarding or relating to Sharyl Attkisson. Such records include, but are not limited to, records of background checks of Sharyl Attkisson, records of communications, contacts, or correspondence between Sharyl Attkisson and employees, officials or agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and records of investigations concerning or regarding Sharyl Attkisson as a victim\u2026\u201d\n\nOperation Fast and Furious, you will recall, was a Justice Department/Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) \u201cgun-running\u201d operation in which the Obama administration allowed guns to go to Mexican drug cartels in hopes that they would end up at crime scenes, thereby advancing gun-control policies. Fast and Furious weapons have been implicated in the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry and hundreds of other innocents in Mexico. Attorney General Eric Holder has already admitted that guns from the Fast and Furious scandal are expected to be used in criminal activity on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border for years to come.\n\nAttkisson, who in 2012 won both the Emmy and the Edward R. Murrow awards for investigative reporting, first began reporting on Fast and Furious in February 2011 when she broke the story, \u201cGunrunning scandal uncovered at the ATF.\u201d Since then, she has filed more than 100 stories relating to the gunrunning debacle, many of which were exclusive reports. In her new book, \u201cStonewalled, ( tiny.cc/od7brx )\u201d Attkisson reported that she had received inside information from government-related sources that the FBI, among other government agencies had hacked into both her personal and work computers over a lengthy period of time.\n\nThe Fast and Furious lawsuit we have filed jointly filed with Attkisson is not the first collaborative effort. In August 2014, we teamed with Attkisson to file a FOIA lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services to obtain records pertaining to the failed roll-out of President Obama\u2019s health care law. In May 2014, Judicial Watch released a 106-page document obtained from HHS, revealing that on its first full day of operation, Obamacare\u2019s Healthcare.gov received only one enrollment. The document also revealed that on the second day of Healthcare.gov operation, 48% of registrations failed.\n\nJW is proud to represent Sharyl Attkisson, a fiercely independent journalist, who has a demonstrated track-record of refusing to play the Washington media insiders\u2019 game that covers up or covers over public corruption stories such as Fast and Furious. We know from the emails we have already obtained that the Holder Justice Department sought to silence this courageous reporter. Now, we need to find out just how far they went.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to once again partner with Judicial Watch, which is unmatched in terms of success in litigating Freedom of Information claims against the federal government, whether under Bush or Obama,\u201d added Sharyl Attkisson in our press statement on the new lawsuit. \u201cThat I\u2019ve had to sue to get my own FBI file is concerning. This administration has a terrible record in respecting the First Amendment rights of journalists.\u201d\n\nA QUICK FOOTNOTE: There are many added dimensions to the Fast and Furious scandal that continue to come to light thanks to JW\u2019s efforts. We have found, for example, that based on the information uncovered through a Judicial Watch public records lawsuit against the City of Phoenix, Congress has confirmed that an AK 47 rifle used in a July 29, 2013, gang-style assault on an apartment building that left two people wounded was part of the Obama Department of Justice (DOJ) Operation Fast and Furious gunrunning program.\n\nAnd just as we went to press with this Weekly Update, we released graphic crime scene photos taken at the site of the assault in Phoenix. This includes a close-up photo revealing the serial number of the AK-47 rifle used by the assailants. Stayed tuned as we will continue provide updates on this deadly Obama administration scandal.\n\nThe President from ACORN\n\nRemember ACORN? That\u2019s the nationwide network of community organizing groups Judicial Watch helped expose for organizing and implementing a plethora of voter fraud schemes and financial misappropriation exercises that undoubtedly helped put President Obama in office. It\u2019s the group for which Obama once served as an attorney and to which he proudly boasted, \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting alongside ACORN on issues you care about my entire career.\u201d Despite a 5-year-old congressional ban on federal funding for the notably corrupt Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) and new offshoots, JW has now obtained documents that show a sizeable amount of taxpayer money went to an affiliate serving as Obamacare \u201cNavigators.\u201d My report to you here is based on our exclusive report that first appeared at our essential Corruption Chronicles blog.\n\nSpecifically, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) violated the ACORN funding ban by awarding a Louisiana nonprofit called Southern United Neighborhoods (SUN) a hefty $1.3 million Obamacare Navigator grant to recruit customers for the president\u2019s disastrous healthcare law and help them sign-up for its costly and complicated insurance exchanges. Headquartered in New Orleans, SUN was founded with former ACORN members and claims on its website that it is dedicated to combating poverty, discrimination and community deterioration \u2013 all with your tax dollars, no less.\n\nNot-so-coincidentally, the group shares its address-and government grants-with another like-minded nonprofit called United Labor Unions Council Local 100. Local 100 was established by Wade Rathke, the radical left-wing community organizer who also founded ACORN. It\u2019s not clear in the documents obtained by JW how much of the $1.3 million HHS grant actually went to Rathke\u2019s local, which is one of SUN\u2019s four partner organizations. But the point remains that the group is an ACORN successor specifically proscribed by federal law from receiving taxpayer dollars. But receive these illicit monies it does \u2013 at the pleasure and for the benefit of the Obama administration.\n\nAccording to an investigative report by National Review, \u201cLocal 100 is a \u2018sub-grantee\u2019 providing Navigators for the Southern United Neighborhoods group.\u201d Other organizations profiting handsomely from the Navigator boondoggle, by the way, include the National Urban League, which was paid $376,000 for its Obamacare outreach in Texas, as well as such leftwing groups as Planned Parenthood and the Virginia Poverty Law Center Inc.\n\nAs JW has reported to you previously, serious questions have been raised about the requirements to be an Obamacare Navigator and the screening given to those who are hired. At a November 6, 2014, Senate Finance Committee hearing, former HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted to Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) that the federal government conducts no background checks on Obamacare Navigators, and it was \u201cpossible\u201d that they could be convicted criminals. Indeed, in January 2014, it was reported that as many as 43 convicted criminals were working as Obamacare navigators in California alone.\n\nThe controversial Navigator program is not the only way the Obama administration has found to funnel money to ACORN offshoots and its corrupt former officials. As we have reported in the past, the money has flowed through various federal agencies. For instance, in 2011 a JW probe found that Obama\u2019s Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awarded a $79,819 grant to an ACORN reincarnation called Affordable Housing Centers of America (AHCOA) to \u201ccombat housing and lending discrimination.\u201d\n\nA year later a separate JW probe revealed that the Obama administration gave an ACORN director named Joe McGavin nearly half a billion dollars to offer \u201cstruggling\u201d Illinois homeowners mortgage assistance. McGavin was director of counseling for ACORN Housing in Chicago and operations manager for a Chicago ACORN offshoot called Affordable Housing Centers of America (AHCOA) shortly before getting the money. (Details of how ACORN offshoots and officials are continuing to soak up taxpayer money are available in the special JW report, \u201cThe Rebranding of ACORN\u201d). We also have a slew of ACORN news here.\n\nRemember, all of this occurred after Congress was forced to pass a law (Defund ACORN Act) in 2009 to stop the huge flow of taxpayer money that annually filled the corrupt organization\u2019s coffers. The Obama administration chose to do an end run around that law. And it continues to do so today.\n\nThe recent \u201cCrominbus\u201d bill that funds HHS and the departments of Labor and Education once again contains specific language restricting any money from going to ACORN. \u201cNone of the funds made available under this or any other Act, or any prior Appropriations Act, may be provided to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), or any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, allied organizations, or successors,\u201d the bill says. But, there is no reason to believe the Obama administration will abide by that law any more than they have by its predecessors.\n\nSo, your JW will remain vigilant and keep you abreast of breaking developments.\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\nTom Fitton\n\nPresident\n\nJudicial Watch\n\nAbout Judicial Watch:\n\nJudicial Watch, Inc., a conservative, non-partisan educational foundation, promotes transparency, accountability and integrity in government, politics and the law.
