The cases are often linked to sexual violence.\n\nThursday\u2019s birth came by way of a programmed cesarean section, Dr. Mario Villalba, director of the Red Cross hospital where the operation took place, told local radio.\n\n\u201cA baby girl, weighing 3.5 kilos (7.7 pounds), was born without any complications or anomalies,\u201d Villalba said. \u201cThe post-operative recovery is going very well.\u201d\n\nParaguayan law permits abortion if a mother\u2019s life is endangered. In this instance, a panel including medical doctors, psychologists and judicial officials determined that the life of the girl was not at risk.\n\nThe Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, part of the 35-member Organization of American States, asked in June that the Paraguayan government allow an abortion, saying the girl was four times more likely to die in childbirth than an adult.\n\n\u201cOnly time will tell the true extent of the physical and psychological consequences of her tragic ordeal,\u201d Erika Guevara, Americas director at Amnesty International, said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt is terrifying that her story will remain all too common unless Paraguay does more to protect victims of sexual violence, decriminalize abortion and guarantee the availability of modern contraceptives and access to information about sexual and reproductive rights,\u201d Guevara said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Mariel Cristaldo; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Culture, Ethics, Institutions, Politics, abortion, Asuncion, Catholic, Christian, consent", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "ASUNCION (Reuters) An 11-year-old rape victim gave birth in Paraguay on Thursday after being denied termination of her pregnancy by doctors and judicial officials, stoking the debate over abortion in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.", "title": "11-year-old Paraguay rape victim has baby, stokes abortion debate", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/14/11-year-old-paraguay-rape-victim-has-baby-stokes-abortion-debate/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/7383472952_4f08c69c6c_z.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/14/11-year-old-paraguay-rape-victim-has-baby-stokes-abortion-debate/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/14/11-year-old-paraguay-rape-victim-has-baby-stokes-abortion-debate/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "ASUNCION (Reuters) An 11-year-old rape victim gave birth in Paraguay on Thursday after being denied termination of her pregnancy by doctors and judicial officials, stoking the debate over abortion in the overwhelmingly Catholic country."}, "article_summary": "ASUNCION (Reuters) An 11-year-old rape victim gave birth in Paraguay on Thursday after being denied termination of her pregnancy by doctors and judicial officials, stoking the debate over abortion in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.\nIn this instance, a panel including medical doctors, psychologists and judicial officials determined that the life of the girl was not at risk.\n\u201cA baby girl, weighing 3.5 kilos (7.7 pounds), was born without any complications or anomalies,\u201d Villalba said.\n\u201cThe post-operative recovery is going very well.\u201dParaguayan law permits abortion if a mother\u2019s life is endangered.\nThe former partner of the girl\u2019s mother is accused of the rape."}
