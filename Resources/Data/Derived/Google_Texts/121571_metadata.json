Called the \u201cintegrity loophole\u201d by outgoing Rep. Spencer Bachus Spencer BachusThe FDA should approve the first disease-modifying treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Study: Payday lenders fill GOP coffers Pope Francis encourages building bridges to address challenges MORE (R \u2013 Ala.), this lacuna was created in 2010, when a federal court of appeals seemingly removed all state law protections for inventors whose patents are subjected to \u201csham\u201d litigation before the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). When Congress expanded the PTO\u2019s administrative system for challenging patents, it opened vast new opportunities for abuse, while providing inventors no federal remedy like that once ensured by state law.\n\nWe\u2019re currently witnessing an evolution of abuses in this field. The classic strategy was to use administrative proceedings for challenging a patent\u2019s validity to keep it from ever being enforced in the courts: companies would play fast and loose with the evidence, falsify key dates or alter some technical diagrams\u2014anything to persuade the PTO to take a second look at the patent and keep it tied up for years. The new approach does all this, but it also uses these proceedings to turn a profit. Hence the emergence of the so-called \u201cIPR Troll\u201d (named for one of these administrative procedures, inter partes review), a mirror image of the better known and widely denounced figure of \u201cpatent troll.\u201d\n\nIPR Trolls use PTO processes to extort money from inventors; the $37 million \u201cshakedown\u201d of patent owner VirnetX is one recent example. Reports are surfacing that hedge funds are exploiting the loophole, too, telling inventors: \u201ceither pay us, or we\u2019ll file challenges against your patents with the PTO and short your stock as the news reaches Wall Street.\u201d\n\nIf a miscreant marched into an auto dealership and threatened to blow up the place unless he received, say, a Bentley, a Rolls Royce, and a Lamborghini, we would call that extortion. And in patent law terms, that\u2019s just what happened to my company: we received a demand for three free, transferable licenses to our patent\u2014valuable commodities which the extortionists demanding them obviously intended to resell\u2014or else our patent would be challenged before the PTO. We refused to yield and a petition attacking our patent\u2019s validity was filed. Luckily, the PTO realized the petition was meritless and denied it, but in all too many cases the Office acts on the basis of false evidence.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t the PTO always catch the fraud? Patents, because they deal with complex technology, are often difficult to comprehend\u2014and this opens a wide berth for fraud masquerading as technical argument. Justice Breyer noted last term that patent attorneys are \u201cvery brilliant\u201d at dressing up baseless arguments in abstract, jargon-laden language; Justice Kennedy agreed that sometimes a judge can study a patent case for weeks, \u201cwith all the experts,\u201d only to find \u201cthere\u2019s nothing there.\u201d The same is true at the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (\u201cPTAB\u201d), which administers these proceedings. Indeed, the Office has acknowledged that \u201cthird-party allegations\u201d have at times induced it to issue \u201cimproper/unnecessary orders\u201d forcing patents to undergo reexaminations that weren\u2019t actually merited.\n\nClearly, there is little reason for confidence that future attacks against my company won\u2019t be forthcoming. The PTO can do little to deter them beyond sanctioning the attorneys involved, but most often the Office prefers not to delve into these matters. Veteran patent practitioners will remember the failure in the 1980\u2019s of the PTO\u2019s \u201cfraud squad,\u201d an attempt to self-police by an agency better-suited for dealing with cutting edge science and technology than weighing issues of fraud and intent.\n\nThe courts are the right forum for redress, yet their hands are largely tied. My company\u2019s attempt to fight back was shut out: the court dismissed our case against the extortionists, holding that we could not even state a claim under state law. Congress must create a federal remedy empowering the courts to punish IPR trolls and to compensate patent owners subjected to fraud and extortionate demands.\n\nPatent law scholar John R. Thomas has testified that the integrity loophole is a \u201cconcern to small business\u201d and urged Congress to pass \u201clegislation that would allow an aggrieved patent holder to obtain relief against parties that have challenged their patents in an inappropriate way.\u201d He\u2019s right.\n\nThe patent community is arrayed to address patent reform early next year. Whatever compromise they reach, this is a bipartisan issue that all sides can agree on: the patent system shouldn\u2019t tolerate fraud, and its victims should be compensated.\n\nSalmon is an attorney based in Glenview, Illinois.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "When Congress expanded the PTO\u2019s administrative system for challenging patents, it opened vast new opportunities for abuse.", "description": "When Congress expanded the PTO\u2019s administrative system for challenging patents, it opened vast new opportunities for abuse.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "When Congress expanded the PTO\u2019s administrative system for challenging patents, it opened vast new opportunities for abuse.", "title": "Inventors need Congressional protections", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/227906-inventors-need-congressional-protections", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/technology/227906-inventors-need-congressional-protections", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-23T11:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Jeffrey W.
