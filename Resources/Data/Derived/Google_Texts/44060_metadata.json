But as any former champ will tell you, you have to avoid becoming complacent if you want to stay ahead of the pack. First-place finishes aren\u2019t guaranteed, just ask Hong Kong.\n\nEvery year since 1995, the Heritage Foundation and The Wall Street Journal have measured the state of economic freedom in the world. We go country by country, poring over the details of who\u2019s up, who\u2019s down, and who\u2019s treading water. Through all the changes we\u2019ve charted, one thing hasn\u2019t changed: Hong Kong takes the top slot.\n\n\u201cAs the economic and financial gateway to China, and with an efficient regulatory framework, low and simple taxation, and sophisticated capital markets, the territory continues to offer the most convenient platform for international companies doing business on the mainland,\u201d write the editors of the 2015 Index of Economic Freedom.\n\nTo see what Hong Kong does right, consider business licenses. Obtaining one there requires filling out a single form, and the process can be completed in a few hours. In many other countries, it\u2019s more complicated and can take much longer. Bureaucracy, inefficiency and even corruption abound.\n\nBut while Hong Kong in many ways continues to act as a fine example for other countries who aspire to be economically free, its foothold on the No. 1 spot is slipping. Singapore, the perennial No. 2 finisher, has seen the gap between it and Hong Kong steadily narrow in recent years. Only two-tenths of a point (on a scale of 1-100) separate its Index score from Hong Kong\u2019s.\n\nIn short, they\u2019re virtually tied. And it\u2019s worth noting that Singapore\u2019s Index score is unchanged this year, which means Hong Kong has only itself to blame for coming within a hair\u2019s breadth of losing the top slot. The question is, why?\n\nYes, Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China\u2019s since 1997, enjoys a large degree of autonomy. It has small government, low taxes and light regulation. But as the Index notes, \u201ceconomic decision-making has become somewhat more bureaucratic and politicized, and the government\u2019s administrative scope and reach have expanded.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to. Hong Kong was returned to the mainland by the British as part of a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d set-up designed to preserve its prosperity. But last year, Beijing issued a paper that undermined the \u201cBasic Law\u201d that details this agreement. China\u2019s leaders asserted a \u201ccomprehensive jurisdiction\u201d over Hong Kong that would, among other things, give it control over the slate of candidates that Hong Kong citizens could choose from in their next elections in 2017.\n\nIn short, the \u201cfree elections\u201d there would be free in name only. That prompted the student-led protests that dominated headlines for a while last year, complete with a deplorable crackdown from government officials.\n\nThat\u2019s not the kind of behavior you want to see in a country that has long been the global envy of others when it comes to economic freedom, which is tied to political freedom. It\u2019s not the kind of thing that keeps you on top.\n\nAnd the top is exactly where Singapore is aiming. Over the last few years, it\u2019s been advancing a series of reforms that have enabled it to become economically freer. Its markets are open, it doesn\u2019t tolerate corruption, it has a strong rule of law, and it keeps tariffs low.\n\nOther nations in the Asia-Pacific region have been making gains in the Index recently. Taiwan (No. 14 globally), South Korea (No. 29) and the Philippines (No. 76), for example, all saw their scores rise in the 2015 edition. The region as a whole continues to boast the largest number of the world\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d economies (though it also is home to seven of the 20 least-free).\n\nHong Kong still has some impressive bragging rights. At the rate it\u2019s going, though, its continued perch atop the Index of Economic Freedom looks far from certain.\n\nOriginally appeared in the Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's good to be No. 1.
