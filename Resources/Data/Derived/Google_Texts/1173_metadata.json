The only catch was they wouldn\u2019t own the land.\n\nThe Lopezes are among 27 families in Pinellas County that have embraced a housing program that trades the short-term profits of equity for long-term affordability.\n\nAn offshoot of the county\u2019s Housing Finance Authority, the non-profit Bright Community Trust buys old homes, lots and dilapidated apartment buildings in order to keep them below market rates, regardless of whether home prices inflate.\n\nBuyers with income near or below the county\u2019s median household income \u2014 that\u2019s around $45,000 a year \u2014 get a chance to the purchase a brand new or renovated home, but the land underneath it remains property of the trust.\n\nWhen the homeowner sells, they\u2019ll get a portion of the home\u2019s improved value, but the trust will reset the sale price to ensure it\u2019s attainable for another family.\n\nThat means the Lopez family won\u2019t see huge profits, but the lowered cost of living \u2014 which includes ongoing counsel and support from the trust \u2014 will enable them to save more in the long-run should they decide to one day move up the housing ladder.\n\nLauren Lopez calls it \u201csustainable\u201d home ownership.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s affordable now to us at our income level and it\u2019s going to stay that way,\u201d said Lopez, who moved in last month.\n\nMany lenders treated the land trust concept with suspicion at first as charitable groups like Bright Community Trust began to crop up across Florida in the past decade.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nWhen Marcia Barry-Smith first emigrated from Jamaica to South Florida, she worked toward the American home ownership dream the old fashioned way: by getting into a small, inexpensive home and using the equity to gradually build wealth and move into a nicer home.\n\nAs a senior vice president of a major Fort Lauderdale bank, her career focused on helping others in low-income brackets follow the same path.\n\nA land trust, where a buyer wouldn\u2019t fully reap the rewards of their home\u2019s rising value or even own their entire property seemed to remove the cornerstone from this tried-and-true method for mobility, she said at a recent land trust conference at the Pinellas Realtor Organization in Clearwater.\n\n\u201cI stomped through Broward County. I spoke to everyone who would listen,\u201d Barry-Smith said.\n\n\u201cWealth building for the person of modest means is now being taken away from them. This is not fair.\u201d\n\nWhat she and leaders in Pinellas County came to realize during the housing bubble was the homes that were being subsidized for low and middle-income families were rising in value so quickly that the stock of homes at \u201caffordable\u201d prices was disappearing.\n\nAt the time, some people would get financial assistance to buy a home, pay it back when they sold their house shortly after and then use the excess profits to put a down payment on a much more expensive home they truly couldn\u2019t afford, she said.\n\nWhen the dust settled from the crash, proponents of the community land trust model rolled out impressive foreclosure rates, a tiny fraction compared with typical home sales in the same price range.\n\nLand trusts work with homeowners to ensure they can afford to keep up with maintenance and don\u2019t fall into financial trouble.\n\nIf the owner does default, which is rare, the trust will either buy back the home or the bank can take possession and resell it at market values.\n\nThose numbers made a convert out of Barry-Smith and she now travels the state looking to convince more lenders to look at land trust homes as a safe investment.\n\nShe\u2019s convinced it\u2019s the best way to ensure there will still be homes in the future for those without deep pockets.\n\n\u2756 \u2756 \u2756\n\nFacing an alarming shortage of affordable homes in the throes of the 2008 recession, the Pinellas County Board of Commissioners turned its federal and state housing funds toward the land trust model.\n\n\u201cWe were losing it [affordable housing] faster than we could get it,\u201d said Anthony Jones, CEO of Bright Community Trust and former director of the county housing finance authority.\n\nUsing funds from the State Housing Initiatives Program and other sources, the trust has purchased several hundred homes, apartment buildings and vacant lots preserved for affordable housing.\n\nThe non-profit, which broke away from the county last fall, has 27 families in renovated homes, seven on the market, and dozens more at various stages of construction.\n\nThe trust has also developed more than 500 price-controlled multifamily properties and rental homes.\n\nAs Florida has regained its economic footing, the largest housing budget in seven years of $167 million should help land trusts across the state build and renovate even more homes, said Jaimie Ross, director of the Florida Housing Coalition.\n\nIn Pinellas, the most built-out county in the state, a glut of old, deteriorating housing stock makes private redevelopment cost prohibitive in some places and many newly constructed homes and rental apartments are maximizing profits with high rents.\n\nThat means some manner of government support will be necessary to support the work of the land trust, although the goal over time is to make the program increasingly self-sustaining.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a need to find some sort of capital to do the projects,\u201d said Sherri Harris, chief operating officer for the trust.\n\n\u201cThat subsidy is needed initially to make the home affordable but then we can stretch it over the next several buyers.\u201d\n\nLauren Lopez says she has no intention of moving out any time soon, but if they do one day decide to move on, she\u2019s glad to know the home\u2019s modest pricing will be preserved for another young family.\n\n\u201cIt makes us feel really good to know we can pass this on,\u201d she said.\n\njboatwright@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-1277", "article_metadata":
