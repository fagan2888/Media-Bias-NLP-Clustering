Nine out of 10 kids there dropped out of school. His single mom did all she could to make sure that wouldn\u2019t happen to him, but the odds were stacked against Oscar from the start.\n\nThat\u2019s where the Colorado I Have a Dream Foundation came in. The foundation\u2019s team and one of its co-founders, Intertech CEO Noel Ginsburg, began mentoring Oscar when he was just 8 years old. Oscar started accompanying Noel to Intertech\u2019s factory. Eventually, he began a formal internship there and then went on to serve our country in the Navy and earn a college degree. He came home to a good job in the same factory. Today, he is the father of three boys and oversees manufacturing operations at a Denver printing company.\n\nNoel and Intertech understood that the vitality of their business was tied to the vitality of their community. As we say at the Clinton Foundation, \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nStories like Oscar\u2019s are at the heart of the basic bargain of America: No matter who you are or where you come from, if you work hard and play by the rules, you should have the opportunity to build a good life.\n\nUnfortunately, for too many families in America today, that\u2019s not the way it works. Instead of getting ahead, they are finding it harder than ever to keep their footing in our changing economy. The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels out of reach.\n\nI\u2019m particularly concerned about the nearly 6 million young Americans who are out of school and out of work. We are counting on the Millennial generation to become the backbone of our 21st century economy, yet many of them are struggling to break into a tough job market.\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t graduated from college or even high school, most doors just won\u2019t open, no matter how hard they knock. Nearly one in five young Americans who have dropped out of high school are unemployed \u2014 more than three times the national unemployment rate. And for young people of color, the road is even harder. Nearly one in four young African-Americans are unemployed.\n\nEconomists say this youth unemployment crisis could cost America more than $20 billion in lost earnings over the next decade alone. In our first jobs, we learn skills, build networks, gain confidence, and experience the dignity of work and responsibility. When young people can\u2019t find work, they miss out on that crucial period of personal and professional growth.\n\nThis week in Denver, the Clinton Foundation has brought together educators, community leaders, and businesses large and small from across the country to begin a broad effort to connect young people, workforce training programs, and employers looking to hire. We\u2019re calling it \u201cJob One,\u201d because there\u2019s nothing more important than helping our young people get off to a good start.\n\nAt CGI America, employers from a wide range of industries are committing to help young people find pathways to jobs through training, hiring, and mentoring opportunities, and explaining why investing in the workforce of tomorrow is not just the right thing to do, but also a smart investment. We are working with nonprofits like the Small Business Majority in Colorado that are putting together clusters of businesses dedicated to the same goal.\n\nWe want to do for other young people in Denver and across America what Colorado I Have a Dream Foundation and Intertech did for Oscar: give them the opportunity to lift themselves up and pursue their God-given potential.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton is a former U.S. secretary of state.
