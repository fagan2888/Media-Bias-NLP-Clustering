That\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a sensitive situation for Lauvergne, a native of France. In Phoenix and throughout the NBA, arenas conducted a moment of silence for the people killed in Paris. There are many players in the NBA from France.\n\nOnce he was properly informed of what was happening in Paris, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said he talked to Lauvergne to make sure everything was all right.\n\n\u201cObviously, it caught me off guard, and what a tragedy,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWhen I came back I went over to Joffrey to make sure that he was OK, and to check in on all of his family and friends and relatives back in France to make sure that they were OK. To the best of his knowledge, at that time they were.\n\n\u201cBut you take a step back sometimes, and it gives you perspective on life. We get caught up in a bunker mentality: \u2018Hey, let\u2019s win a game, let\u2019s win a game.\u2019 And when you step back when something like that happens, you realize there\u2019s a lot more important things going on in the world. A senseless tragedy, and obviously our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in Paris.\u201d\n\nInjury report. Lauvergne did not play Saturday because of a strained lower back.\n\nIt was the seventh consecutive game he has missed, but he has started running again and is optimistic that he will play Tuesday against the Pelicans in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cIt feels almost perfect,\u201d Lauvergne said. \u201cI am going to do a little bit more (Sunday) and we\u2019ll see how I feel.\u201d Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joffrey Lauvergne\u2019s family, friends in France OK", "title": "Joffrey Lauvergne\u2019s family, friends in France OK", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/14/joffrey-lauvergnes-family-friends-in-france-ok/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151114__Joffrey-Lauvergnep1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151114__Joffrey-Lauvergnep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T21:26:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T08:18:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHOENIX \u2014 Nuggets center Joffrey Lauvergne would rather avoid talking about Friday\u2019s terrorist attacks in Paris, but he did say his family and friends are accounted for.\n\u201cI am going to do a little bit more (Sunday) and we\u2019ll see how I feel.\u201d Christopher Dempsey, The Denver Post\nThat\u2019s all I have to say.\u201dIt\u2019s a sensitive situation for Lauvergne, a native of France.\n\u201cThey are all OK,\u201d he said before Saturday\u2019s game against the Suns.\nIn Phoenix and throughout the NBA, arenas conducted a moment of silence for the people killed in Paris."}
