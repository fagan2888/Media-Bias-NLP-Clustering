His campaign says it has about $28 million cash on hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton reported $37 million raised in the final quarter, bringing her total haul for the year to $112 million, with $38 million still in the bank.\n\nDespite the apparent money edge Clinton has over her rival, Sanders\u2019 fundraising haul assures that she won\u2019t be able to deliver the knockout blow she has sought.\n\nRelated: Al Qaeda Is Using Donald Trump\u2019s Comments to Recruit Terrorists ... and He\u2019s Ok with That\n\nAfter a turbulent summer where questions about Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server while acting as Secretary of State washed away her veneer of inevitability and allowed Sanders to narrow the gap in the polls, the former First Lady has regained control of the race.\n\nAs a result, Clinton has increasingly turned her focus to the general election. She refused to be drawn into contentious arguments with Sanders during last month\u2019s Democratic debate and has begun saving her best campaign barbs for Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, who has accused her of exploiting women while calling former President Bill Clinton \u201cone of the great women abusers of all time.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 fundraising means he will be able to maintain his elaborate ground operation in Iowa. The New York Times reports that he has organizers sprinkled liberally throughout the Hawkeye State who will work to turn out the vote on Feb. 1.\n\nRelated: In & Out: Here\u2019s Where the GOP Presidential Candidates Stand Now\n\nClinton leads in the most recent Iowa polls, but a surprise win or better-than-expected showing by Sanders could spark a fresh round of donations from liberal Democrats ahead of the Feb. 20 New Hampshire primary, where Sanders has the edge in the polls.\n\nA win in the Granite State would keep the river of fundraising flowing and threaten to drag the Democratic primary well into the spring, an outcome Clinton desperately hopes to avoid.\n\nShe wants to pivot her high-tech organization into a general election machine capable of overcoming the apparent \u201centhusiasm gap\u201d between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nFor example, the latest CNN/ORC International poll found 36 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they were \u201cvery enthusiastic\u201d about voting for president next year, compared to just 19 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.\n\nThe more cash Sanders receives, the longer he can hang around and potentially distract Clinton. A protracted battle could become hostile and further taint liberals\u2019 opinion of Clinton, perhaps causing them to stay at home on Election Day in November.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign raised $33 million in the last quarter of 2015,", "title": "Clinton Facing a Long Fight as Sanders\u2019 Fundraising Soars", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Clinton-Facing-Long-Fight-Sanders-Fundraising-Soars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/bernie_sanders_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Clinton-Facing-Long-Fight-Sanders-Fundraising-Soars", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/bernie_sanders_0.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign raised $33 million in the last quarter of 2015,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign chief said Saturday in a statement.\nDespite the apparent money edge Clinton has over her rival, Sanders\u2019 fundraising haul assures that she won\u2019t be able to deliver the knockout blow she has sought.\nThe more cash Sanders receives, the longer he can hang around and potentially distract Clinton.\nBernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign raised $33 million in the last quarter of 2015, providing him the resources to remain a formidable challenger to Hillary Clinton with less than a month left until the first ballots are cast in Iowa.\nMeanwhile, Clinton reported $37 million raised in the final quarter, bringing her total haul for the year to $112 million, with $38 million still in the bank."}
