Today Texas Senator and GOP candidate for president Ted Cruz has endorsed conservative candidate Mike Flynn. Meanwhile, establishment candidate Darin LaHood has come out in support of President Obama\u2019s Cuba policies.\n\nCruz said in a statement released by the Flynn campaign:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMike Flynn is the kind of courageous conservative we need in Washington. When Andrew Breitbart launched BigGovernment.com to expose ACORN and fight back against the institutional left and the political class, he chose Mike Flynn as his lieutenant. For 6 years, Flynn helped expose the media\u2019s lies and led many fights against the Obama Administration and Washington\u2019s entrenched political establishment. I\u2019m happy to endorse his campaign for Congress. With Flynn, Central Illinois will have a strong voice to uphold the constitution, defend the 2nd Amendment and stand up to the media and political elite.\n\nMeanwhile in a recent interview, establishment Republican Darin LaHood has come out in support of Obama\u2019s policies on Cuba. In a recorded interview, LaHood noted that Obama\u2019s policy of opening Cuba was a way for Cuba to \u201ctransition\u201d to democracy.\n\nDespite Cuba\u2019s continued policy of jailing political dissidents and quashing freedom, LaHood said he was \u201csupportive\u201d of Obama\u2019s policy.\n\nDuring the recorded interview posted on Sunday by Central Illinois On the Record, LaHood claimed that opening Cuba is \u201ca good thing.\u201d LaHood said:\n\nI think in terms of opening markets for our farmers, particularly in Cuba, I\u2019m supportive of that. You know, this is the 17th largest agriculture district in the country \u2026 when you think about the commodities that are grown and produced in central Illinois, we have to open up more markets. That\u2019s jobs and economic opportunity for our farmers in our ag community in Central Illinois. So I\u2019m supportive of opening up new markets, such as Cuba, for our corn and our soybeans and other products. That\u2019s a good thing.\n\nLaHood went on to pay lip service to the decades of real human rights abuses perpetrated by Cuban dictator Fidel Castro and his regime, dismissively saying that Cuba has had \u201csome issues\u201d with human rights abuses.\n\n\u201cIn the past, obviously Cuba has had some issues with human rights and other things. But I think this is a way to, you know, transition them to democracy and economic freedom and I\u2019m supportive of it,\u201d LaHood said.\n\nAs Flynn gets the endorsements of many local tea party groups, the latest tea party group endorsement has been withheld from both candidates. On Monday, Tea Party Patriots decided not to endorse either candidate, because its members could not agree.\n\nBut while LaHood has gotten the endorsements from a long, long list of establishment groups like the illegal alien amnesty-supporting U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as Congressional House Speaker John Boehner and his establishment leadership team, Flynn has been endorsed by several local Tea Party groups and conservatives such as Mark Levin and Dana Loesch.\n\nThe election is clearly a race between the big dollar establishment backing LaHood and the grassroots backing Mike Flynn.\n\nThe special election primary is tomorrow, July 7.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "As LaHood Supports Obama's Cuba Policy, Ted Cruz Endorses Mike Flynn in Ill 18th", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "As LaHood Supports Obama's Cuba Policy, Ted Cruz Endorses Mike Flynn in Ill 18th", "title": "As LaHood Supports Obama's Cuba Policy, Ted Cruz Endorses Mike Flynn in Ill 18th", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Ted-Cruz-L-and-Mike-Flynn-AP-Photos.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/06/as-lahood-supports-obamas-cuba-policy-ted-cruz-endorses-mike-flynn-in-ill-18th/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As LaHood Supports Obama's Cuba Policy, Ted Cruz Endorses Mike Flynn in Ill 18th", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/Ted-Cruz-L-and-Mike-Flynn-AP-Photos.jpg", "title": "As LaHood Supports Obama's Cuba Policy, Ted Cruz Endorses Mike Flynn in Ill 18th", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Darin LaHood, Illinois, mike flynn,Big Government,Mike Flynn", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "mike flynn", "published_time": "2015-07-06T15:37:54-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1eb\"", "article_summary": "As Flynn gets the endorsements of many local tea party groups, the latest tea party group endorsement has been withheld from both candidates.\nMeanwhile, establishment candidate Darin LaHood has come out in support of President Obama\u2019s Cuba policies.\nToday Texas Senator and GOP candidate for president Ted Cruz has endorsed conservative candidate Mike Flynn.\nIn a recorded interview, LaHood noted that Obama\u2019s policy of opening Cuba was a way for Cuba to \u201ctransition\u201d to democracy.\nFor 6 years, Flynn helped expose the media\u2019s lies and led many fights against the Obama Administration and Washington\u2019s entrenched political establishment."}
