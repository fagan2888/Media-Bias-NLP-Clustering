Obamacare is so weak and dedicated to corporate profit at any cost to actual health care, that participating corporations, who run it, may withdraw whenever they like, if they don\u2019t get the massive profit they seek.\n\nAnyone actually paying attention may see that Obamacare came out of Nixoncare when Dick Nixon was president and under pressure from the Democrats, who ran Congress at the time, to create a system of Medicare for all. Nixon instead designed a system run by the corporations, and the Democrats, then standing for a bit more than they do today, soundly rejected it.\n\nNixoncare was redesigned by the Heritage Foundation, and Governor Romney of Massachusetts liked the concept of a medical system which benefits capitalists like himself, so much that he adopted it into law.\n\nWhen running against President Obama for the White House, Romney attacked ObamaCare in appealing to Republican voters, who tend to oppose anything Obama. President Obama soundly berated Romney during the debates, pointing out that ObamaCare came from Romneycare and is the same thing.\n\nThe brilliant part of the program\u2019s propaganda is to ignore actual health care and emphasize the number of people \u201cinsured,\u201d which has increased. What\u2019s not pointed out by the Obama regime and its supporters is that the lower tier insurance has co-pays and deductibles so high that many working class people can\u2019t afford to use it.\n\nMany working class people buy the insurance because they are forced to buy it or get fined by the government. I know people who pay the fine rather than buy the insurance, because it is less expensive to do so. These people obviously cannot afford to pay the fine, and do without necessities to be cruelly fined in this manner.\n\nThat a system should be so bankrupt as to attempt to fool the masses in this way, while moving tax dollars to corporations which annually make billions of dollars and pay their CEOs millions in annual salary, is despicable.\n\nDr. Margaret Flowers, who is running for a Senate seat in Maryland as a Green, told me about 33,000 people die each year in the USA for a lack of healthcare coverage. This does not count those who die because they take prescription drugs known to be harmful by Big Pharma, or do without life-saving drugs because of the exorbitant costs, or those who die from complications resulting from unnecessary operations in privatized hospitals performed to increase profits.\n\nIn most of the industrialized world, health care is considered to be a human right, not a luxury doled out according to how much a person can afford.\n\nThat the Democrats should pretend to care about the public interest, while taking millions of dollars from the \u201chealthcare industry\u201d to fund their election campaigns shows how cowardly and subservient they have become.\n\nWhen I was a boy I lived in British Columbia for a few years, when my father found employment there and we moved from Washington State. After my mother was hospitalized, the family gathered at a hospital in Prince George. Upon her release my father went to a window set up to provide information.\n\nWe assumed the worst, that the family would be left in ruin as the medical cost put us under, like happens in the Land of the Free. My father had a troubled look on his face upon approaching the window, asking, \u201cHow much do I owe you?\u201d The woman behind the counter smiled, saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t owe us anything Mr. Balkwill. It\u2019s our job.\u201d\n\nThe American people are kept in ignorance by their mainstream mass media, and will never be free until they get a public interest mass media source. It is by design that we have one of the most ignorant populations on earth.\n\nJack Balkwill is an activist in Virginia.
