Taxes are due April 18.\n\n\"We are still confident that we can get them out by the tax filing deadline,\" Delaney said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, MNsure had sent 29,189 forms, or 67 percent of the 43,674 documents that must be sent.\n\nA week ago, the job was about 62 percent done. Since then, MNsure has mailed 555 forms, and realized that another 3,157 forms don't need to be created. That's because shoppers bought catastrophic insurance or dental coverage \u2014 neither of which requires the 1095-A tax form \u2014 or they signed up for a health plan but never completed enrollment.\n\n\"We know that this is not ideal, and that it's causing headaches and frustration for people,\" Delaney said.\n\nFor the first time, people in employer-sponsored health plans are receiving forms 1095-B and 1095-C, which are like the forms being generated by MNsure in documenting health insurance coverage. The federal Affordable Care Act requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\n\nBut the forms being sent by employers and insurers aren't due until March 31, and they aren't needed for filling out tax forms.\n\nThe 1095-A, however, is different because it allows people who buy through a government-run health insurance exchange to reconcile the tax credits they received for discounting premium costs.\n\nMNsure users obtain tax credits based on an estimate of income, and then true-up at tax time when they know their actual income for the year. So, people like Maureen Cuthbert of Lakeville need the form, because her income for 2015 came in higher than she anticipated.\n\n\"I am going to have to pay back some of the discount that I received, so I really need that form,\" she said. \"It's getting close to tax time and no one can even give me a target date when I'll be getting it, or if there's a problem with my account. \u2026 I feel frustrated.\"\n\nBeyond trouble with the new automated process, MNsure says it's gone slow in creating documents to ensure accuracy.\n\nPeople with special tax circumstances that require them to file before the April 18 deadline should contact MNsure, Delaney said, saying that such circumstances might apply to some farmers and families seeking financial aid for college students.\n\nIn the coming days, the exchange will start using e-mail and regular mail to contact those who haven't received forms, he said.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"description": "MNsure is assigning an extra 25 workers to the job of creating tax forms that are required for health exchange shoppers to complete their filings with the IRS.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "MNsure is assigning an extra 25 workers to the job of creating tax forms that are required for health exchange shoppers to complete their filings with the IRS.", "title": "With clock ticking, MNsure adding staff for tax forms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/with-clock-ticking-mnsure-adding-staff-for-tax-forms/372169201/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MNsure is assigning an extra 25 workers to the job of creating tax forms that are required for health exchange shoppers to complete their filings with the IRS.", "title": "With clock ticking, MNsure adding staff for tax forms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/with-clock-ticking-mnsure-adding-staff-for-tax-forms/372169201/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201483"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "tax forms"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "MNsure,tax forms"}, "article_summary": "But the forms being sent by employers and insurers aren't due until March 31, and they aren't needed for filling out tax forms.\nMNsure is assigning an extra 25 workers to the job of creating tax forms that are required for health exchange shoppers to complete their filings with the IRS.\nSince then, MNsure has mailed 555 forms, and realized that another 3,157 forms don't need to be created.\nIn the coming days, the exchange will start using e-mail and regular mail to contact those who haven't received forms, he said.\nFor the first time, people in employer-sponsored health plans are receiving forms 1095-B and 1095-C, which are like the forms being generated by MNsure in documenting health insurance coverage."}
