I agree that pure socialism does not work, but in his argument, he is perpetuating a myth about healthcare. There is this belief among many Americans that foreigners are flocking here to get better healthcare.\n\nThis is simply not true. There are a few wealthy people who come here for healthcare, because if you are rich, and can pay cash, the U.S. does provide excellent healthcare. But for middle-class Americans who have insurance, the healthcare received is no better than what is received from government-paid healthcare found in Europe and Canada. Middle and lower-class Americans who don\u2019t have insurance receive inferior healthcare.\n\nIt is silly to think that middle-class people would come to the U.S. for healthcare. How would they pay for it? I recently had a knee replacement, and the total cost was about $100,000. Lucky, I had good insurance and it didn\u2019t cost me anything. Do you really think a middle-class person will come here for surgery and pay that kind of money when they could get the operation at home for free?\n\nThis silly myth was spread by anti-Obamacare politicians, and now is believed by millions of Americans.\n\nTom Odell\n\nCedar City\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.thespectrum.com/story/opinion/2016/05/21/healthcare-myth/84576198/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Letter: Foreigners are not flocking to US for better healthcare", "og": {"site_name": "The Spectrum & Daily News", "description": "Letter: Foreigners are not flocking to US for better healthcare", "title": "A healthcare myth", "url": "http://www.thespectrum.com/story/opinion/2016/05/21/healthcare-myth/84576198/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/thespectrum.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letter: Foreigners are not flocking to US for better healthcare", "creator": "@SpectrumNews", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d5dcc884cfd8badc208ab782bd7dfd53d614336/c=0-0-300-300&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/13/StGeorge/B9317342659Z.1_20150513193627_000_G96APFAAF.1-0.jpg", "title": "A healthcare myth", "site": "@SpectrumNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858743444", "fb": {"app_id": 116065358464006}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "But for middle-class Americans who have insurance, the healthcare received is no better than what is received from government-paid healthcare found in Europe and Canada.\nI agree that pure socialism does not work, but in his argument, he is perpetuating a myth about healthcare.\nThere are a few wealthy people who come here for healthcare, because if you are rich, and can pay cash, the U.S. does provide excellent healthcare.\nIt is silly to think that middle-class people would come to the U.S. for healthcare.\nThis silly myth was spread by anti-Obamacare politicians, and now is believed by millions of Americans."}
