Obamacare! abortion!\u2014perhaps giving the impression it was a particularly busy year for the highest court in the land. However, the total number of cases decided, at 74, was less than half of what it was forty years ago and the second fewest since at least 1960. And this isn\u2019t an anomaly.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear answer to why there\u2019s been a downward trend in SCOTUS decisions, but there\u2019s no shortage of theories, either.\n\n\u201cUltimately, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is speculation and inference,\u201d says Stephanos Bibas, professor of law and criminology and director of the Supreme Court clinic at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nThe explanations range from relatively mundane (a 1972 procedural change that altered how petitions were reviewed) to technological (court opinions going online means precedents are easier to find and less likely to conflict with each other) to political (as Congress passes fewer big, bold, controversial laws, fewer objections are brought against them).\n\nBut we don\u2019t need to worry about the drop in jurisprudence. \u201cIt\u2019s not such a bad thing that laws are written better than they once were,\u201d Bibas says, explaining that as statutes are written more clearly, less litigation happens around them. (The most recent challenge to Obamacare, for example, centered on four words in a 1,000+ page law.)\n\nAnd the important issues are being addressed in opinions that are markedly longer and more reasoned than they once were\u2014even if the justices are waiting for critical masses of lower courts to rule on them before weighing in. \u201cIf the Supreme Court was deciding very few cases, you might worry it wasn\u2019t doing its job,\u201d says Kermit Roosevelt, another constitutional law professor at Penn Law. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are lots of circuit splits not getting resolved or constitutional questions not getting answered.\u201d\n\nAs Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg herself asked in a 1987 Harvard Law Review article, \u201cHow much Supreme Court judging does the country really need\u2026?\u201d\n\nThe featured photo was shared on Flickr by John Marino under a Creative Commons License.
