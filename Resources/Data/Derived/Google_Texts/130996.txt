FORT COLLINS — Two Southern Colorado high school products — tight end Kivon Cartwright, from Pueblo South, and linebacker Kevin Davis, from Fountain-Fort Carson — represented the Rams’ players at Colorado State coach Mike Bobo’s Monday noon news conference.

That was appropriate, given the Rams (0-2 in Mountain West play) face Air Force (2-0) at Hughes Stadium Saturday.

Davis, who also was a standout hockey player (for Cheyenne Mountain because his high school didn’t have a team) and is from a military family, noted that Air Force recruited him. “But CSU was my first choice,” he said.

Both Davis and Cartwright, as might be expected, said the Rams are staying the course after the 41-10 loss to Boise State dropped them to 2-4 for the season.

“It’s hard,” said Davis, who leads the Rams with 49 tackles. “But we’re definitely staying together and we’re still confident we can have a good season.”

Cartwright, a sixth-year senior because of a medical redshirt granted by the NCAA, said: “All we’re trying to do is channel all our energy into this week. Last week, we upped the intensity and everybody came to work. This week, we just have to take it up another notch. We have to still come to work. It’s not about what happened, but what we’re going to do about it.”

Despite the rough-around-the-edges start featuring inconsistent quarterback play and offensive efficiency, plus a tendency to give up big-yardage plays on defense, the Rams seem to have a chance to get the ship righted in the second half. There isn’t a game on the remaining schedule the Rams can’t win. That doesn’t mean 6-0 is likely, and improvement will be necessary to to bowl eligibility, but it’s far from impossible.
