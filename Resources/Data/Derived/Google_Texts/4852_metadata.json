Most recently, the 60-year-old administrator worked with four superintendents in five years in Camden, trying to clean up the district\u2019s muddled finances.\n\nIn late April, Azzara was tapped for a new mission: solving the problems within the Lakewood School District.\n\nHe was assigned by the state Department of Education to the district after a $5 million shortfall was discovered in the 2013-2014 school budget. Azzara now is tasked with turning around the district\u2019s troubled finances, as well as finding a solution to the district\u2019s ongoing multimillion-dollar transportation crisis brought on by the rapid growth of private school students.\n\nAs monitor, Azzara oversees the operation and fiscal management of school district facilities and all district staffing. He has the authority to hire, promote or terminate employees, and to override a superintendent\u2019s action or a vote by the school board on any matter involving money.\n\nAzzara has made his presence known in the township in a big way. First, he delayed a vote on the $151 million budget for five days so he could have time to review the spending plan. Then, during a May 13 public meeting, Azzara overruled the nine-member Board of Education when it voted not to adopt the district\u2019s 2014-2015 budget.\n\n\u201cHe is part of our team,\u2019\u2019 said Isaac Zlatkin, board president. \u201cWe are all working to tackle the issues facing the district.\u2019\u2019\n\nAccess denied\n\nRequests to talk to Azzara, who lives in Evesham, Burlington County, were denied by the Department of Education. As policy, the department does not make district monitors available for interviews, said Mike Yaple, spokesman for the department. The state monitors are in place to implement state policy, similar to a judge, Yaple said.\n\nThe silence, though, leaves Azzara an inscrutable figure to the public. While he has overridden the board\u2019s decisions in public, he has given no indication of how he will close the district\u2019s fiscal gaps and still meet the educational needs of students. To save $4 million, for example, Azzara ended courtesy school busing for most students who live within 2.5 miles of their schools, a decision that led to a townshipwide parental protest. They clogged Lakewood streets for two days by driving children to school rather than let them take the buses.\n\nDuring his career, Azzara has spent time overseeing finances in a variety of districts in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, but has never spent any time teaching in the classroom.\n\nGlenn Forney, director of the office of budget review and fiscal monitors for the state Department of Education, said Azzara\u2019s lack of ties to the community made him the perfect choice to be a monitor in Lakewood.\n\n\u201cEveryone has accepted him better than I had hoped. There is a very good outlook for Lakewood. They can really turn things around,\u2019\u2019 Forney said.\n\nDifferent problems\n\nIn Lakewood, Azzara will oversee a district that is smaller than Camden and offers many different challenges than the urban school district.\n\nIn Camden, Azzara oversaw the finances for a district that has 13,000 students in 32 schools. In Lakewood, Azzara is responsible for approximately 5,000 public school students in six buildings. However, the Lakewood district also provides transportation and special education services for more than 25,000 students, most of whom attend private Orthodox Jewish schools.\n\nThe financial issues in Camden were linked to mismanagement of funds, while in Lakewood the budget shortfall was triggered mostly by the growing private school population, the state-mandated 2 percent budget cap and the mismanagement of funds.\n\nThe FBI also has looked into the district\u2019s spending habits. Last May, following an Asbury Park Press expos\u00e9, the FBI began its own investigation into the district\u2019s finances. It delivered subpoenas to the district for spending records, invoices, school board minutes and other fiscal information, district officials have said. The FBI does not comment on the status of investigations.\n\nAs Lakewood continued its rapid growth over the last five years, the school district struggled to keep up with rising transportation costs and increased spending on special education for private school students. The school district has seen the number of bused private school students increase from 18,530 to 22,456 since the 2011-12 school year. During the same period, the number of public school students for which the district provides transportation has increased from 3,734 to 4,359.\n\nThe 2010 census reported Lakewood\u2019s population made it the largest municipality in Ocean and Monmouth counties and the seventh largest in the state. According to projections, Lakewood\u2019s population could grow from 92,000 in 2010 to 220,000 by 2030.\n\nPastor Glenn Wilson, founder of U.N.I.T.E. Lakewood, which stands for United Neighbors Improvements Today\u2019s Equality, said the Azzara appointment has been positive.\n\nAfter years of watching in frustration, Wilson and other leaders in the black and Hispanic communities, along with church leaders, parents and senior citizens, banded together in a historic coalition to stop rumored cuts to the public schools by the school board.\n\nThe group fears the nine-member board \u2014 dominated by Orthodox Jewish residents, most of whom send their children to private religious schools \u2014 might not have the same educational priorities as they do. Coalition members say they have united to protect the educational interests of the nearly 5,000 public school students. The group held a rally about two weeks after Azzara was appointed to the district, and 400 people attended to show their support of public education.\n\n\u201cWe are happy to have him here,\u2019\u2019 Wilson said. \u201cAnytime you have another set of eyes on something, it\u2019s a good thing. There are going to be times when we agree with him, and there are going to be times that we don\u2019t. I believe that it will provide a balance (and) that is what we are looking for.\u2019\u2019\n\nLakewood and Asbury Park are the only districts in Ocean and Monmouth counties that are under state monitoring. Including Lakewood, there are seven monitored districts in the state. There are four state-controlled school districts: Newark, Paterson, Jersey City and Camden.\n\nPolitically savvy\n\nIn early April, Azzara left Camden after Paymon Rouhanifard was appointed superintendent. At that time, the district was debating how to close a $75 million budget gap in its $360 million budget for the 2014-15 school year.\n\nThe budget gap was created by the dwindling enrollment and continued spending at past enrollment levels, state officials said.\n\nWhen Azzara took over in Camden five years ago, the district was facing a budget shortfall of approximately $10 million, officials said. Since then, Azzara was able to close the shortfall and help the district balance subsequent budgets, Forney said.\n\nDespite the budget gap that arose in Azzara\u2019s final year, Forney considered his tenure in Camden a success.\n\n\u201cMike has a good track record,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cHe was able to clean up their finances and get them back on their feet, which is why he was sent there.\u2019\u2019\n\nDuring his time in the urban school district, Azzara was described as being \u201cpolitically savvy\u201d by Sean Brown, a former Camden Board of Education member.\n\n\u201cHe has been through a bunch of different situations and understands how to survive,\u2019\u2019 said Brown, 31, who served on the board from 2010 through 2013. \u201cHe was like an uncle or the godfather.\u2019\u2019\n\nBefore Camden Board of Education meetings, Azzara would meet with board members to discuss concerns they had, so those issues would not come up during meetings, Brown said.\n\nAzzara would limit his comments at meetings to moments when a board member or administrator asked him to comment on an issue.\n\nThe same has held true during his short tenure in Lakewood. So far, Azzara only comments when board members seek his opinion on an issue.\n\nGary Frazier, a 38-year-old Camden resident and leader of the Save Camden Schools, said Azzara\u2019s relationship with the public was sometimes confrontational. Save Camden Schools is a more-than 300-member civic group that is fighting against the state\u2019s plan to close public schools within the city.\n\n\u201cMike was handed orders by Gov. (Chris) Christie and did what he needed to do,\u2019\u2019 Frazier said. \u201cWe butted heads on a variety of issues. He made it known that he was in control at all time.\u2019\u2019\n\nAzzara is paid $96 an hour by the Lakewood district for his role as monitor, and there is no cap on how much he can make. Azzara\u2019s appointment in Lakewood expires next April. During his final year in Camden, Azzara was paid $145,000.\n\n\u201cHe was very quick-thinking,\u2019\u2019 Frazier said. \u201cHe was able to dance around anything. Mike was very good politically.\u2019\u2019\n\nNicholas Huba: 732-557-5617; nhuba@app.com\n\nNAME: Michael Azzara\n\nPOSITION: State monitor appointed to oversee the Lakewood school district\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nRutgers University, Bachelor of Arts in Business Administration\n\nKean University, Master of Arts in Educational Administration\n\nPAST EXPERIENCE:\n\nFebruary 2009 to April 2014: State monitor for Camden City School District.
