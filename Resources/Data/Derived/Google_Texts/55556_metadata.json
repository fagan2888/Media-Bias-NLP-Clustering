But what does it really mean for Louisiana?\n\nOn the day of the signing, Baton Rouge General Medical Center President and CEO Mark Slyter told Business Report that afternoon: \u201cThis is a good day.\u201d\n\nBut he added that Medicaid reimbursements, which he says cover only 60% to 70% of a service\u2019s cost, should to be increased to induce more providers to treat Medicaid recipients and better compensate those that already do.\n\nThe General recently closed its Mid City emergency room, citing the high cost of treating uninsured patients. If Louisiana had joined the Medicaid expansion sooner, the hospital just might have been able to keep the ER open.\n\n\u201cIt would have been a factor that would have helped,\u201d Slyter says. \u201cThat, in combination with some other things.\u201d\n\nSo will the General revisit the decision? \u201cThat day is done, unfortunately,\u201d Slyter says.\n\nCritics of the Affordable Care Act say it doesn\u2019t make sense to expand a program that already is on an unsustainable path. But supporters say Medicaid allows the dollars to follow patients and makes it more likely providers get paid for their care.\n\nEdwards\u2019 executive order is a big win for hospitals, who are required by a Reagan-era federal law to treat the poor.\n\n\u201cReducing the number of uninsured adults in Louisiana makes it easier to improve access to needed care, to limit costs for families and individuals with private insurance, and to create greater stability in Louisiana\u2019s state budget,\u201d says Louisiana Hospital Association President Paul Salles.\n\nBut New Orleans pediatrician Dr. Floyd Buras says if Medicaid doesn\u2019t start paying higher reimbursements, those new Medicaid recipients will have trouble finding doctors.\n\n\u201cMedicaid expansion, in and of itself, is an OK idea,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t have enough money to pay for what you already have, how can you expand it?\u201d\n\nRead the full story.
