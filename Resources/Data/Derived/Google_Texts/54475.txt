CLEVELAND - Perhaps no national political issue in the last few years has been as controversial as the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare.

Should it be kept, altered or repealed in its entirety? Republicans in Congress have voted numerous times to repeal the law. Democrats have said no.

For our Voter Guide at cleveland.com/voterguide, one question we asked all congressional candidates in Northeast Ohio was whether they favored a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act.

Below are their unedited responses. Some answered the question, then went on to explain how they would like to see the health-care law changed.

As for the direct question on a repeal:

• Republicans Bob Gibbs, Richard May, Mark Zetzer and libertarian David Macko were clear in saying they favored a repeal.

• Republican Jim Renacci said he would support a full repeal "coupled with replacement legislation." He also said in his answer that going back to the old system is not an option.

• Republican David P. Joyce said he opposed the law, but did not directly say whether he favored a straight repeal.

• Democrats Marcy Kaptur, Marcia Fudge, Michael Wager and Pete Crossland, as well as independents George Skalsky and Cory Hoffman said they opposed a straight repeal. They also added comments about the changes they would like to see.

The question

Do you favor or oppose a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which includes employer and individual mandates, subsidies for some individuals and businesses, contraceptive coverage and the ban on denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions? If you were part of Congress during previous votes on this issue, state how you voted?

7th District

Bob Gibbs (R): I believe that Obamacare as written is unworkable and must be repealed and replaced. I have voted 50 times for the repeal of Obamacare and supported replacement provisions that focus on a patient driven system working with your physician in determining your healthcare and not a bureaucrat or insurance company. Second, incorporate market based principles to address costs; health savings accounts, increased competition between health insurance providers, portability and tort reform.

9th District

Marcy Kaptur (D): Oppose. I voted for the Affordable Care Act. It extends insurance coverage to approximately 40 million Americans who lack health insurance. Many have preexisting conditions, are over 50 or under 26, have reached lifetime limits, or work for or own small businesses that were discriminated against in insurance market.

Richard May (R): I will repeal the "Affordable" Care Act or Obamacare as most know it. We need healthcare reform in America, but it needs to be bi-partisan. Plus, our representatives need to at least pretend they read it, before they vote for it. Our representatives should never be allowed to exempt themselves and their staff from any law, including healthcare reform.

Cory Hoffman (I write-in): I oppose a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. We should expand it. It is a shame that misguided Congressional obsession with the budget deficit and austerity left us with such a mild reform when we could have had so much more. We should implement a public option while retaining most of the ACA's provisions like subsidies for purchasing health insurance in the individual market & eliminating other parts like the medical device tax. And yes, if I were in Congress at the time, I would have demanded that members of Congress stop worrying about the ACA's impact on the deficit and worry about improving the health care of our people but I absolutely would have voted for it because it corrected massive failures in the health insurance market

George Skalsky (I write-in): Although I was frustrated that "Obamacare" was just "Romneycare" at the national level (and what the big medical industries would allow, I would not vote for a straight repeal of the ACA. One of my major priorities if elected would be to work on the U.S. moving ASAP toward having a Universal Coverage, Single Payer, and Not For Profit health care system. It's time to address the greed, waste, and corruption in our system- and single payer is the best path to doing so. I knew when Obama and Rahm Emanual would not even fight for "a public option" to the ACA in "this political climate" that "The Audacity of Hope" was going to become a heartbreaking disappointment. 32% of every health care dollar goes to "administration"...that is shameful.

11th District

Marcia L. Fudge (D): When I voted for the Affordable Care (ACA) in 2010, I stated then as I do now that no law is perfect when first adopted. That held true for legislation that created Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and it applies to the ACA as well. Let's make adjustments as needed. However, I firmly oppose straight repeal. Why do we want to go back to a broken health care system that left millions of Americans without the ability to see a doctor, that permitted women to be charged more than men for health coverage and people unable to obtain insurance at any price due to pre-existing conditions? The Health Marketplace and Medicaid expansion are directly benefiting people of the 11th district, giving them access to quality, affordable health care.

Mark Zetzer (R): I favor a straight repeal of Obamacare. Like so many other areas of our economy, health care is over-regulated and needs market reforms. I support making all medical expenses tax deductible, allowing insurance to be bought across state lines, tort reform (state-level), and empowering all citizens to save for health expenses by removing the high-deductible insurance policy requirement to access their Health Savings Accounts. More freedom to choose and innovate will make sure that the health care system in Cleveland, Akron and America remains the best in the world. As your U.S. representative, I would vote to make America's health care industry responsive to patients, families and doctors, and not to government bureaucrats.

13th District

Thomas Pekarek (R): Candidate did not respond.

Tim Ryan (D): Candidate did not respond.

David Allen Pastorius (R write-in): Candidate did not respond.

14th District

David P. Joyce (R): I oppose the law and I believe we need to fix our broken healthcare system. The administration has written over 20,000 pages of regulations, raised 19 different taxes and spent $1.2 trillion, and we are still going to have roughly 31 million people in the US without health care insurance, according to the CBO. Clearly ObamaCare is not working and I'm reminded by my constituents every day that Ohioans deserve easier access to better care, as well as coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, not lost coverage and skyrocketing health costs.

David Macko (L): I favor defunding and repeal of Obamacare and replacing it with freedom. I would have voted against it at any possible opportunity. Obamacare is unconstitutional. Lenin stated that control of health is control of people and necessary to enslave them. The treatment of veterans by the VA is proof of death panels and the other dangers of government control of health. As long as there are income taxes, there should be full deductions for health care. People should be allowed to buy insurance across state lines. The National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and Drug Enforcement Agency should be abolished and the federal drug war should be ended since it is unconstitutional and has caused a police state and overfilled prisons.

Michael Wager (D): I oppose repeal and would seek to fix and improve the ACA, which requires amendment to deal with complicated enrollment processes and costs of premiums. I applaud the expanded coverage under ACA for pre-existing conditions, adult children up to age 26 and elimination of lifetime caps and elimination of higher premiums for women. Congressman David Joyce's repeated votes for repeal would hand over control of healthcare to for-profit insurance companies, permitting them to exclude coverage of children from a parent's plan on their 18th birthday, discriminate against women and impose lifetime caps. Congressman Joyce's vote on the government shutdown was another unnecessary roadblock to fixing the law. Brinksmanship is not governance.

16th District

Jim Renacci (R): I support a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act coupled with replacement legislation that includes cost-saving measures and reforms that improve quality of care. We cannot go back to the broken healthcare system we had before Affordable Care Act, but the President's health care law has failed to increase the efficacy of care. Republicans have offered several solutions that would expand coverage, control cost, and incentivize quality. I have voted several times to repeal all or portions of Affordable Care Act in order to move forward with these solutions that protect the doctor-patient relationship and increase access to care.

Pete Crossland (D): Over 17 million Americans have gained access to health care. In the 16th Congressional District over 25,000 people are using the ACA to gain access to care. Preventive care is expanded for 309,000 residences of the district. Seniors have this benefit plus greater drug discounts. There are many benefits. Congressman Renacci has voted dozens of time to repeal ACA while praising its popular aspects. I would vote against repeal efforts and put serious positive energy into fixing the ACA to make it more effective and less costly.
