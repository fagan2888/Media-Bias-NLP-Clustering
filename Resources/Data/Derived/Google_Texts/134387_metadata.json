No one was hurt.\n\nExperts say the rate of school shootings is statistically unchanged since the mid- to late-1990s, yet still remains troubling.\n\nRonald Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center, said there have been about 500 school-associated violent deaths in the past 20 years.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t include a string of recent shootings at colleges and universities. Just last week, a man was shot and critically wounded at the Palm Bay Campus of Eastern Florida State College, according to police.\n\nFinding factors to blame, rightfully or not, is almost the easy part: bad parenting, easy access to guns, less value for the sanctity of life, violent video games, a broken mental health system.\n\nStopping the violence isn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the major problems. There are not easy answers,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cA line I often use is do everything you can, knowing you can\u2019t do everything.\u201d\n\nBill Bond, who was principal at Heath High School in West Paducah in 1997 when a 14-year-old freshman fired on a prayer group, killing three female students and wounding five, sees few differences in how shootings are carried out today. The one consistency, he said, is that the shooters are males confronting hopelessness.\n\n\u201cYou see troubled young men who are desperate and they strike out and they don\u2019t see that they have any hope,\u201d Bond said.\n\nSchools generally are much safer than they were five, 10 or 15 years ago, Stephens said. While a single death is one too many, Stephens noted that perspective is important. In Chicago there were 500 homicides in 2012, about the same number in the nation\u2019s 132,000-plus K-12 schools over two decades.\n\n\u201cI believe schools are much safer than they used to be but clearly they still have a good ways to go,\u201d Stephens said.\n\nThe recent budget deal in Congress provides $140 million to support safe school environments, and is a $29 million increase, according to the office of Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nAbout 90 percent of districts have tightened security since the Newtown shootings, estimates Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\nMany schools now have elaborate school safety plans and more metal detectors, surveillance cameras and fences. They\u2019ve taken other steps, too, such as requiring ID badges and dress codes. Similar to fire drills, some schools practice locking down classrooms, among their responses to potential violence.\n\nThe incident involving the 5-year-old in Memphis led to the use of hand-held metal detecting wands inside elementary schools in Shelby County\u2019s school district.\n\nAttention also has focused on hiring school resource officers, sworn law enforcement officers who are trained to work in a school environment, said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. He said his organization estimates there are about 10,000 of them in the U.S.\n\nCanady said it was such an officer who helped avert more bloodshed at Arapahoe High School in the Denver suburb of Centennial when an 18-year-old student took a shotgun into the building on Dec. 13 and fatally shot another student.\n\nSince the shootings at Colorado\u2019s Columbine High School in 1999, in which two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher and wounded 26 others before killing themselves, police nationwide have adopted \u201cactive shooter\u201d policies where officers are trained to confront a shooter immediately.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to stop it, from the law enforcement side, stop it as quickly as you can because we know with an active shooter if you don\u2019t stop it, more lives will be lost,\u201d Canady said.\n\nConfronting a shooter certainly carriers risks.\n\nIn Sparks, Nev., math teacher Michael Landsberry was killed in November after calmly approaching a 12-year-old with a gun and asked him to put the weapon down, witnesses said. The boy, who had wounded two classmates, killed himself.\n\nWeingarten said more emphasis needs to be placed on improving school cultures by ensuring schools have resources for counselors, social workers and after-care programs. Many of these kinds of programs were scaled back during budget cuts of recent years.\n\nExperts have said a healthy school culture can prevent such incidents and even lead students to tell adults about classmates who display warning signs that they could commit such violence.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan told reporters Thursday that he also believes strong mental health support systems in schools are important. But he said schools are doing a \u201cfantastic\u201d job with school security and often schools are the safest place in a community.\n\nHe blames easy access to guns as a root cause of the problem, but that\u2019s a contention that doesn\u2019t have widespread agreement as gun control continues to be a hotly debated topic.\n\n\u201cThis is a societal problem, it\u2019s not a school problem,\u201d Duncan said.\n\nBond, who is now the safe schools specialist with the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said there was a time when he believed school shootings would stop. He\u2019s come to a sad realization that gives him a \u201csick pit in my stomach\u201d that they won\u2019t end, he said.\n\n\u201cSchools are still part of the American society and the American society is violent,\u201d Bond said.\n\n\u2026\n\nAP Education Writer Kimberly Hefling wrote this report.
