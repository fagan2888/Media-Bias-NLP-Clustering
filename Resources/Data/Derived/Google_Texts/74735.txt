(Update: Normand says he is not running for governor, and sticking with his endorsement of Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne. The poll mentioned in this article is several months old, Normand said, and it appears a glitch caused the Advocate to publish an old article. See updated post.)

Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand might be reconsidering whether he wants to run for governor next year. In April, Normand commissioned a poll that shows him as a contender in a hypothetical field of six candidates, the Advocate reports.

The poll was conducted just a few weeks after Normand told LaPolitics Weekly the he'd decided not to run, and would instead support Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne. Both were in the April poll, conducted by Penn Schoen Berland.

Normand has been "shopping around" the poll, which shows him running fourth in race that includes U.S. Sen. David Vitter, Dardenne, Treasurer John Kennedy and Agriculture Commissioner Mike Strain, all Republicans, along with state Rep. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat. The hypothetical field notably excludes New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, a Democrat who is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate. Vitter, Edwards and Dardenne are the only candidates in the poll who thus far have declared their candidacy.

The poll shows Vitter with a slight edge over Edwards, 18 percent to 17 percent, according to the Advocate. Dardenne and Normand followed with 14 and 10 percent, respectively, while Kennedy polled at 8 percent and Strain trailed with 4 percent.
