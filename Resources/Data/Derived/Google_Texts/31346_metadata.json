Pence earns high marks in GOP polls\n\nIndiana Gov. Mike Pence earns strong marks from 60 percent of Indiana voters as he nears the end of his first year in office, according to a private GOP poll shared with POLITICO.\n\nThe former Republican congressman, who flirted with a campaign for president in 2012, is in positive territory with both men and women and among voters in every region of the state. Only 23 percent of poll respondents said they disapprove of his performance in office, and his personal favorability is a robust 53 percent positive, 24 percent negative.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPence has kept a relatively low national profile since taking office earlier this year and won his 2012 gubernatorial race by an unexpectedly slim, 3-point margin.\n\nSome Republicans in Washington and Indiana view him as a potentially intriguing candidate for the White House in 2016, thanks to his unquestioned conservative credentials and the his new profile as a state executive from outside D.C.\n\nRepublican pollster Kellyanne Conway, who conducted the survey and polled for Pence\u2019s campaign last year, writes in a memo that the governor\u2019s solid numbers contrast sharply with voters\u2019 general pessimism about government.\n\n\u201cGov. Pence and policies associated with the Republican Party find favor with Hoosiers,\u201d Conway writes. \u201cHoosiers hold a much more optimistic view of their state than of the nation as a whole.\u201d\n\nFifty-one percent of poll respondents said that Indiana is on the right track, including 47 percent of independents. That compares with only 23 percent of voters who say the country is on the right track.\n\nThe survey, which was commissioned by the Indiana Republican Party, tested 800 registered voters between Sept. 12 and 15, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent.\n\nGiven Indiana\u2019s conservative lean, it is not a surprise that a GOP governor who has not sought out controversy would win a relatively warm reception from the public during his first year in office.\n\nBut Pence has faced \u2013 and continues to face \u2013 some thorny political challenges that could resonate in any bid for national office down the line. He has opposed expanding Medicaid in Indiana under the Affordable Care Act, and has sought instead to expand the state-based Healthy Indiana Plan.\n\nThe state is also in the midst of a debate over a constitutional ban on gay marriage.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A GOP poll says the Indiana governor earned strong marks from 60 percent of Indiana voters.", "title": "Pence earns high marks in GOP polls", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/09/mike-pence-earns-high-marks-in-gop-polls-97064.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/news/110412_mike_pence_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "GOP (512),Mike Pence (162),Indiana (217),Polls (1188)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A GOP poll says the Indiana governor earned strong marks from 60 percent of Indiana voters.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fe0\"", "article_summary": "Mike Pence earns strong marks from 60 percent of Indiana voters as he nears the end of his first year in office, according to a private GOP poll shared with POLITICO.\nPence earns high marks in GOP pollsIndiana Gov.\nPence and policies associated with the Republican Party find favor with Hoosiers,\u201d Conway writes.\nBut Pence has faced \u2013 and continues to face \u2013 some thorny political challenges that could resonate in any bid for national office down the line.\nThe survey, which was commissioned by the Indiana Republican Party, tested 800 registered voters between Sept. 12 and 15, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percent."}
