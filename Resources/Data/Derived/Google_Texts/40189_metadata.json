The University of Michigan study found mixed opinions on the topic, with Protestants (66%) and Catholics (63%) most likely to agree that health plans should cover contraceptive, ahead of both non-religious women (59%) and women with religious affiliation other than Christian (59%). Baptists (48%) and other Christians (45%) were the least likely to support birth control coverage.\n\nOverall, 56% of women support required health coverage of birth control, and less than 25% of women thought employers should be exempt from the law due to religion. Author Elizabeth Patton, M.D., M.Phil, M.Sc., says:\n\n\u201cWe wanted to examine the relationship between religious affiliation and a woman\u2019s views on reproductive health care policy and what we found was that one didn\u2019t necessarily predict the other. Debates surrounding reproductive health care have often been framed as religious versus non-religious but that\u2019s not an accurate narrative. Our findings show that religious women\u2019s attitudes toward policies affecting reproductive health care are much more complex than they are often portrayed. The differences in opinions about these policies between religious women and non-religious women are not always as striking as some may believe.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive coverage law was changed last year when several companies complained that providing contraceptive coverage went against their religious views. Elizabeth Patton comments \u201cWhen religion enters political discussions, we tend to hear from politicians, business leaders or church leaders who are often the most vocal, but these voices don\u2019t represent the religious community as a whole,\u201d\n\n\u201cPolitical debates in the U.S. about reproductive health and religion continue. These policies primarily affect women \u2013 the vast majority of whom identify with a religion \u2013 and we need to ensure their viewpoints are heard so that misconceptions aren\u2019t perpetuated in these conversations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be aware of the complexity of how religion affects women\u2019s views so we can design reproductive health policies that truly reflect the beliefs and desires of most women in our country.\u201d\n\nResources\n\nFollow the Conversation on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "women, woman, religion, religious, contraception, affordable care act,", "wot-verification": "16fbad63ab63c74f7a00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=848230695", "og": {"site_name": "World Religion News", "description": "The University of Michigan released a study that found, contrary to what many believe, women's support for birth control is not related to their religion.", "title": "Study says Opinions on Birth Control are not Determined by a Woman's Religion - World Religion News", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://d2dr8938rg169c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BirthControlReligionNotLinked.jpg", "url": "http://www.worldreligionnews.com/issues/study-says-opinions-on-birth-control-are-not-determined-by-a-womans-religion", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "World Religion News", "description": "The University of Michigan released a study that found, contrary to what many believe, women's support for birth control is not related to their religion.", "title": "Study says Opinions on Birth Control are not Determined by a Woman's Religion - World Religion News", "image": "http://d2dr8938rg169c.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BirthControlReligionNotLinked.jpg", "creator": "@wreligionnews", "site": "@wreligionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "5f29a126ba9e522baf7e2a66460567c0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100005957105571, "pages": 339229182869545}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msvalidate.01": "AF45DC66947DF3D642757570CA3C0A47", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WorldReligionNews", "section": "Culture", "tag": "University of Michigan", "published_time": "2015-03-18T12:10:39+00:00"}, "bitly-verification": "ed93578da323", "description": "The University of Michigan released a study that found, contrary to what many believe, women's support for birth control is not related to their religion."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6ca\"", "article_summary": "A recent study shows that a woman\u2019s views on religion may not be correlated with their views on health care for birth control coverage.\nBaptists (48%) and other Christians (45%) were the least likely to support birth control coverage.\nDebates surrounding reproductive health care have often been framed as religious versus non-religious but that\u2019s not an accurate narrative.\nThe University of Michigan released a study that found, contrary to what many believe, women\u2019s support for birth control is not related to their religion.\nOverall, 56% of women support required health coverage of birth control, and less than 25% of women thought employers should be exempt from the law due to religion."}
