Ashlee was calling your bluff,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was never seriously going to happen ... the fact is you just didn\u2019t want to do it because it was too difficult.\n\n\u201cYou knew, at the time, it would have been a difficult thing to put in place, you\u2019d never done it before \u2014 you never had any intention to realistically accept the offer from Ashlee.\u201d\n\nMs Francou said she \u201ccouldn\u2019t disagree with that enough\u201d.\n\n\u201cI have never been fearful of things being too difficult ... we were trying to build a rapport with this woman,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Johns interrupted, saying: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t a woman, she was 16 years old.\u201d\n\nThe inquest is investigating Families SA\u2019s handling of 21 abuse notifications it received about Chloe from before her birth through to her death in January 2012, aged four.\n\nPolkinghorne and her former partner, Benjamin McPartland, are serving four-year minimum jail terms over the little girl\u2019s death.\n\nMr Johns has heard many of those notifications were classified as \u201ctier 2\u201d, meaning \u201can investigation is required\u201d and Chloe could have been removed by Families SA workers.\n\nOPINION: NO GROUND FLOOR IN LITTLE GIRL\u2019S PERSONAL HELL\n\nMultiple witnesses have told the inquest the agency failed to act upon their concerns and reports, even though the little girl was living a transient life with Polkinghorne.\n\nThey have revealed the duo lived in squalid, rat-infested homes, that Polkinghorne was a drug user who ignored her child\u2019s needs and convincingly lied to care and welfare agencies.\n\nThey have recalled that, aged three, Chloe \u201chated her mum\u201d and endured further abuse from Polkinghorne\u2019s partner, Benjamin McPartland, who filmed and humiliated her.\n\nThey dubbed Polkinghorne \u201cvery good at lying and hiding things\u201d from social workers, including her drug use and the poor state of her accommodation.\n\nFamilies SA staff have admitted they took a \u201csoftly, softly\u201d approach to Polkinghorne in the hope she would \u201cstop lying and engage\u201d with support programs.\n\nInstead of condemning her illegal habit, the agency drafted an agreement under which Polkinghorne promised to find a sober person to care for Chloe whenever she took drugs.\n\nMs Francou\u2019s involvement with Chloe\u2019s case started in September 2007, after the \u201csoftly, softly\u201d approach was adopted and before the agreement was drafted.\n\nShe said she heard a recording of a \u201cfrightening\u201d phone conversation during which Polkinghorne insisted she was a better mother when she was high on methylamphetamine.\n\nThat recording prompted her to call Polkinghorne in for a face-to-face meeting, notes of which describe Polkinghorne as \u201cslurred and slow of speech\u201d.\n\nMs Francou said that was not of immediate concern to her.\n\n\u201cI thought there could be lots of reasons for that ... she was a 16-year-old person with a four-month-old baby, doing it tough on her own,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know I didn\u2019t have any concerns that she was actively taking drugs that day ... I had seen a lot of parents actively using (with) pupils dilated and scattered thinking.\n\n\u201cThat was certainly not her presentation on that day ... if I thought she was substance-affected, I would have removed Chloe on the spot.\u201d\n\nMr Johns was critical of Ms Francou\u2019s thinking.\n\n\u201cYou actually had no idea at all, really ... (your thinking was) based in your loose previous experience observing people who were drug-affected,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou seem to have exercised your discretion very much in the optimistic hope that Ashlee was going to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nAfter Ms Francou threatening to \u201cwalk\u201d her to Gribbles, Polkinghorne admitted being a drug user but insisted she was not addicted.\n\nMs Francou said she thanked Polkinghorne \u201cfor her honesty\u201d and agreed she would not remove Chloe if that honesty continued.\n\nFive days later, Polkinghorne volunteered to undergo drug testing in order to keep Chloe but Ms Francou dubbed it \u201cnot necessary\u201d as Families SA did not want to take \u201ca punitive approach\u201d.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a very big thing for a 16-year-old to admit what she was doing, knowing what the outcome would be,\u201d she said.\n\nMr Johns said that was the wrong approach to take with a \u201cblatant liar\u201d like Polkinghorne.\n\n\u201cYou had given her an inducement that you would not take Chloe away if she was honest \u2014 why on earth did you perceive she deserved acknowledgment for being honest?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cShe was not an honest person, she had not been honest.\n\n\u201cYou had every reason to expect that her next utterance ... would also be a lie.\u201d\n\nMs Francou disagreed, saying Polkinghorne had \u201cturned a corner\u201d by admitting she had a problem.\n\nAsked whether, \u201cwith the benefit of hindsight\u201d, she should have organised random drug testing, Ms Francou said she did not know.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to collaborate with someone who wanted to work with us (so) it\u2019s a really difficult question,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I was comfortable with the decision.\u201d\n\nMs Francou agreed she had missed an opportunity to require Polkinghorne undergo drug and alcohol counselling.\n\nShe said she assumed that would be initiated by her peer, Nicholas Ratsch, when he took over the case \u2014 the inquest has heard he drafted the drug-taking agreement with Polkinghorne.\n\nThis afternoon, Families SA social worker Jennifer Warren gave evidence about the two times she dealt with Chloe\u2019s case.\n\nThe first was alongside Ms Francou, when she took notes of the meeting in which Polkinghorne admitted using drugs.\n\nMs Warren told the inquest she formed the opinion, that day, that Chloe \u201cwas at high risk\u201d while in her mother\u2019s care.\n\nA year later, in September 2008, Ms Warren was serving as an acting supervisor when another tier 2 child abuse notification was made about Chloe.\n\nThe notifier alleged Chloe, then 14 months old, was \u201cfrequently unwell, vomiting, losing her hair and not even walking\u201d.\n\nMs Warren said that, despite the seriousness of the allegations, she had no choice but to recommend the report be \u201cclosed without investigation\u201d.\n\n\u201c(Our office) didn\u2019t have the capacity to become involved in another matter,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt certainly was not that it didn\u2019t warrant investigation, it was that we didn\u2019t have the resources to investigate.\u201d\n\nAsked how many tier 2 cases were dealt with in the same manner, Ms Warren conceded there \u201cwould have been a number\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was fairly well known we were having to close off intakes (child abuse reports) without investigation,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Warren\u2019s recommendation was authorised by her then-superior, Bruce Johnston, who has since retired from Families SA.\n\nIn his evidence, Mr Johnston said the number and nature of the allegations made about Chloe\u2019s care were \u201cconcerning\u201d \u2014 but that could not alter the realities of resource problems.\n\n\u201cI would see probably 20 to 30 of these (recommendations) a week,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI and every other manager felt extremely concerned about the risk we were carrying, every supervisor I was aware of was concerned they couldn\u2019t get to the work they should get to.\u201d\n\nAsked if his office had ever received more resources, Mr Johnston replied \u201cno, I don\u2019t think there were any\u201d.\n\nThe inquest continues tomorrow.", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "FAMILIES SA did not drug test Chloe Valentines
