These two soldiers are a shade of brown to depict the living and stand side-by-side.\n\nThe remaining statutes are a shade of white representing the spirits of those who made the ultimate sacrifice. The third statute represents the Vietnam Era and his hand is reaching out to offer strength. The fourth represents Korea and the fifth statute placed at the memorial represents WWII. The statutes were all placed to make them look like they are filing into the courtyard to honor and console a comrade.\n\nThe city of Coleman is located next to tribal lands and has close ties to the Native Americans who settled in the area. Lindze Ritter (Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe) is a volunteer who has made it her mission to spread word of the monuments dedication. As an Ojibwa woman, she has been asked by the memorial committee to take part in the dedication by singing an honor song with her hand drum.\n\n\u201cI think the statute is a formidable representation of our dedication to the land as a people and our resilience. It\u2019s really emotional to stand in front of the memorial,\u201d she said. \u201cIt must have been really challenging to a persons integrity to fight in the World Wars when we were facing so many other obstacles as Indigenous Peoples. It\u2019s a powerful statement for our warriors to be honored this way; we still have our warrior societies among our tribal nations who are working for the protection of the people. I can hardly describe in words being there when they raised the statute \u2013 to be a part of that and to see them lifting that veteran into place in a locale I knew was so close to my families heart was very moving,\u201d she said.\n\nPrior to the statutes dedication, there will be a parade at 10 a.m. The tribe located nearest the memorial, the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, has been asked to participate in the parade. The Coleman Veterans Memorial is located at 501 E. Washington St., in Coleman, Michigan. Coleman is a small community located in central Michigan with a deep-seated respect and reverence for our nations heroes.\n\nFor more information, or to read about the history of the 501 (c) 3 non-profit memorial, visit www.colemanveteransmemorial.org or on Facebook, at: www.facebook.com/colemanveteransmemorial.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Coleman Veterans Memorial will be dedicating its sixth bronze life-size statute \u2013 of a WWI Native American Doughboy \u2013 on Memorial Day.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/23/honoring-native-wwi-doughboy-memorial-day-michigan-154938", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/coleman_veterans_memorial_-_courtesy_linze_ritter.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Honoring the Native WWI Doughboy on Memorial Day in Michigan"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Honoring the Native WWI Doughboy on Memorial Day in Michigan"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/23/honoring-native-wwi-doughboy-memorial-day-michigan-154938", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-23T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Coleman Veterans Memorial, United by Sacrifice, Native American Veterans, Tribal Veterans, American Indian Veterans, Memorial Day, Memorial Day", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Honoring the Native WWI Doughboy on Memorial Day in Michigan"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa4e\"", "article_summary": "This newest statute represents a WWI Native American Doughboy and was designed with authentic garments and equipment of the era.\nThe Coleman Veterans Memorial is located at 501 E.
