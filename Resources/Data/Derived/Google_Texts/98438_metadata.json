Earlier this month, he become one of the first 30 residents to move into 250 Kearny \u2014 a single-room-occupancy property on the edge of San Francisco\u2019s Financial District that has been newly renovated to house 130 homeless veterans.\n\n\u201cI feel more of a sense of independence by having my own key,\u201d Cook said. \u201cNow I will have the opportunity to get me some employment \u2026 and give back to society, for giving me a second chance.\u201d\n\nThe former Stanford Hotel has been under construction since 2010 after a notorious past as one of the worst SROs in the city. It was mostly vacant, and filled with debris left by squatters, before it was bought and renovated by real estate developer Sam Patel.\n\nPersuaded by San Francisco\u2019s goal of ending veteran homelessness, Patel chose to rent the building to the city even though there were eight other bidders, some of whom were willing to pay 25 percent more than what the city offered. He and partner Sam Devdhara invested $10 million in improving the property. They have a history of supporting housing for homeless people.\n\nIt was a major triumph for the city, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, related veterans service organizations and community partners, all of whom worked together to secure funding for the lease.\n\nEager for a new beginning, Cook is the type of chronically homeless veteran that the city and the VA targeted for residency at 250 Kearny.\n\n\u201cOnce someone who is highly vulnerable moves into independent housing, they are significantly more likely to be successful in all other areas of their life,\u201d said Miriam Beyer, a social work supervisor for the Department of Housing and Urban Development Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.\n\nBeyer explains that research within the last 20 years supports \u201chousing-first principles.\u201d This is the idea that the most effective solution for chronic homelessness is moving individuals straight from the streets into stable housing, as opposed to a \u201chousing-readiness\u201d philosophy, which moves people through different levels of transitional housing.\n\n\u201cOnce somebody has a home that\u2019s consistent, that\u2019s stable, they\u2019re able to work on all of those other tasks that are not immediately related to survival on the streets,\u201d Beyer said.\n\nBevan Dufty, director of Housing Opportunity, Partnerships and Engagement for the City and County of San Francisco, estimated that there are 700 homeless veterans in San Francisco. About 375 of them applied for the 130 slots available at 250 Kearny.\n\nThose selected had been homeless the longest and have the highest need for the comprehensive services and on-site social workers that 250 Kearny provides.\n\nCook said it\u2019s also important that 250 Kearny is located outside the Tenderloin, where drugs and violence are rampant. \u201cA lot of veterans, including myself, we may have problems with different chemicals. By being outside, it gives you a better chance at staying clean.\u201d\n\nAt last, Cook seems on track to achieve this goal. He is engaged to his girlfriend of 14 months, Lynette Baldwin, who helped him through a relapse and inspired him to stay sober.\n\nNow that Cook has a stable address, he is eager to find employment. He says he could see himself as a truck driver, but he\u2019s not picky. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s work that\u2019s honest,\u201d he says.\n\nAs veterans like Cook search for new jobs, they need not fear getting behind on rent. Though rooms at 250 Kearny go for $1,190 per month, residents are required to pay only 30 percent of their income in rent. If they are still searching for work, their rent will be covered in the meantime.\n\nThe remainder is covered with housing vouchers from Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing, a partnership between the VA and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nCook says he wishes every veteran were afforded this opportunity to get back on their feet, and hopes those who are struggling can find hope in his story.\n\n\u201cIt just might save someone young, it just might save them to hear an old veteran, convict, dope user, stopped and turned his life around. It\u2019s never too late.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Newly renovated building at 250 Kearny in San Francisco now houses 130 veterans.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Video: San Francisco Homeless Veterans Get Permanent Place to Live\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/12\\/22\\/video-san-francisco-homeless-veterans-get-permanent-place-to-live-250-kearney\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-22 09:45:43\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-12-26 08:32:47\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23135,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"Homeless\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/12\\/clarence1CROP.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Newly renovated building at 250 Kearny in San Francisco now houses 130 veterans.", "title": "Video: San Francisco Homeless Veterans Get Permanent Place to Live", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/12/22/video-san-francisco-homeless-veterans-get-permanent-place-to-live-250-kearney/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/12/clarence2-640x359.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "homeless", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1456\"", "article_summary": "Bevan Dufty, director of Housing Opportunity, Partnerships and Engagement for the City and County of San Francisco, estimated that there are 700 homeless veterans in San Francisco.\nEager for a new beginning, Cook is the type of chronically homeless veteran that the city and the VA targeted for residency at 250 Kearny.\nThe remainder is covered with housing vouchers from Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing, a partnership between the VA and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nEarlier this month, he become one of the first 30 residents to move into 250 Kearny \u2014 a single-room-occupancy property on the edge of San Francisco\u2019s Financial District that has been newly renovated to house 130 homeless veterans.\nAs veterans like Cook search for new jobs, they need not fear getting behind on rent."}
