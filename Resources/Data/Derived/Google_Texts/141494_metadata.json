He was stoic, staring straight ahead for most of the hearing.\n\nIn the hallway, after the brief court appearance, Michael Jackson, Porter\u2019s stepfather, talked with the media.\n\nJackson, his eyes welling at times, pulled no punches.\n\n\u201cI want him dead,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cI want to kill him.\u201d\n\nWaide was arrested Friday on suspicion of murder and sexual assault in connection with Porter\u2019s disappearance. She was reported missing by her mother June 5.\n\nWestminster police said Waide was being cooperative in the investigation, and that investigators were searching for a body in the case.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Porter\u2019s body has still not been found, said Cheri Spottke, a Westminster Police Department spokeswoman.\n\nOne location Westminster police may search is the Allied Waste Services Tower Road Landfill at Tower Road and East 88th Avenue in Commerce City, police said.\n\nAt the courthouse, Jackson said Waide has admitted to stabbing and strangling Porter, and then putting her body in a trash bag and then a garbage Dumpster.\n\nBut Jackson believes Waide could be misleading police on where a body may be found.\n\n\u201cHe knows it is in his best interest that it\u2019s not found,\u201d Jackson said.\n\nJackson also talked about a document that Waide allegedly authored back in high school, in which he wrote about abducting, raping, and killing a woman.\n\nPolice investigators are aware of the alleged document and are \u201clooking into it,\u201d Spottke said.\n\nFormal filing of charges against Waide was scheduled for this Friday.\n\nThe case file remains sealed.\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Westminster man appears in court in disappearance of Pueblo teen", "title": "Westminster man appears in court in disappearance of Pueblo teen", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/16/westminster-man-appears-in-court-in-disappearance-of-pueblo-teen/", "image": {"width": 236, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140611__Lea-Chali-Porter-2p1-1.jpg", "height": 318}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140611__Lea-Chali-Porter-2p1-1.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T09:54:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:05:23+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI want to kill him.\u201dWaide was arrested Friday on suspicion of murder and sexual assault in connection with Porter\u2019s disappearance.\nOne location Westminster police may search is the Allied Waste Services Tower Road Landfill at Tower Road and East 88th Avenue in Commerce City, police said.\nIn the hallway, after the brief court appearance, Michael Jackson, Porter\u2019s stepfather, talked with the media.\nAs of Monday morning, Porter\u2019s body has still not been found, said Cheri Spottke, a Westminster Police Department spokeswoman.\nBRIGHTON \u2014 A Westminster man waived the reading of his first advisement Monday in a case linked to the disappearance of a 19-year-old Pueblo woman."}
