About 792,000 Oklahomans, including 511,000 children, are enrolled in SoonerCare.\n\nAgency officials learned about the reduction last week. Because of the federal government's partial shutdown, the agency doesn't have formal confirmation of the reduction. However, Gomez said he believes that's the number they can expect.\n\nAt the authority's board meeting Thursday, board member Tony Armstrong expressed concern about the reduction.\n\n\u201cWe have to come up with a lot of money in a very short amount of time, and it's going to be difficult, but we've been through this before,\u201d Armstrong said during the meeting.\n\nThe amount of money that the Oklahoma Health Care Authority gets from the federal government for Medicaid is based off a formula known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP.\n\nThe Federal Medical Assistance Percentage determines the federal share of the cost of Medicaid services in each state, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe lower a state's per capita income, the higher the state's Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or federal Medicaid matching rate, according to the foundation.\n\nBecause of the reduction, the Medicaid program has to adjust \u2014 either the money is made up by increasing state money or by reducing the spending of the program, Gomez said.\n\nGomez said he wouldn't speculate about whether people would lose services because of the federal funding cuts.\n\n\u201cI don't want to create a panic,\u201d Gomez said. \u201cIt's early on. We're talking about a budget that's effective July 1 of next year, but I'd rather start talking about it now than May. I think it's prudent for us to start this conversation now instead of trying to figure out the \u2018Now what?' in May.\u201d\n\nOther cutbacks\n\nThe reduction doesn't just affect the Oklahoma Health Care Authority. Overall, the reduction in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage will result in a $66 million reduction across multiple state agencies that bill for Medicaid services, including the authority and the state Health Department.\n\nGomez said before the reduction, the federal government was paying 64 cents for every dollar spent toward Medicaid, with Oklahoma paying 36 cents. But with the reduction, the federal government will pay 62 cents for every dollar.\n\n\u201cNow the state has got to decide, \u2018OK, do we keep our portion the same, and make some reductions, or do we find another two cents to replace the lost federal funds to keep that same dollar of service that we're buying?'\u201d Gomez said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The amount of money the federal government provides for Oklahoma's Medicaid program is decreasing, in part, because of an improved state economy.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 NewsOK.com.
