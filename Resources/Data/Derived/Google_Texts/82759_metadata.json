Now that they\u2019re here, they want to stick around for a while.\n\nAlex Gordon hit a bases-clearing double in the first inning, Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas each homered and the wild-card Royals finished off a three-game sweep of the mighty Los Angeles Angels with an emphatic 8-3 victory Sunday night in the AL Division Series.\n\nThe scrappy team with the quirky manager, popgun offense, dynamic defense and lights-out bullpen will open the AL Championship Series against the Orioles beginning Friday night in Baltimore. Kansas City went 4-3 against the O\u2019s this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this group of kids so confident on the big stage,\u201d Royals manager Ned Yost said. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to see their development and watch them come into the postseason and just really take their game to the next level.\u201d\n\nThe Angels, 98-64 in the regular season, became the second team in the divisional era that began in 1969 to have the best record in the majors and get swept out of the playoffs, STATS said. In no small coincidence, the Royals dealt the same humiliating fate to the New York Yankees in the 1980 ALCS.\n\nStalking around the mound amid an electric atmosphere, James Shields lived up to his \u201cBig Game James\u201d billing. The Royals\u2019 ace gave up homers to Mike Trout and Albert Pujols, but otherwise held in check a suddenly punchless Los Angeles lineup\n\nShields was helped, too, by a pair of diving grabs by center fielder Lorenzo Cain on back-to-back plays. All told, the highest-scoring team in baseball managed six runs in the entire series.\n\n\u201cAnything happens in the playoffs,\u201d Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. \u201cYou don\u2019t go in with any badge saying you won the most games, and you\u2019re certainly not going to get any points for that going into the playoffs.\u201d\n\nAs for the Royals, \u201cthey\u2019re going to be a team tough to beat in this tournament,\u201d he said.\n\nKansas City showed off great glovework in every game, especially by its fleet outfielders. In this one, Cain\u2019s catches in the fifth inning ended an Angels\u2019 rally and preserved a five-run lead.\n\nThe Royals coasted the rest of the way to their seventh straight postseason victory dating to Game 5 of the 1985 World Series, the last time they were in the playoffs. George Brett, the star of that team, watched from an upstairs suite and raised his arms when ace closer Greg Holland fanned Trout for the final out.\n\nThis bunch of Royals is certainly making up for all that lost time.\n\nKansas City played a 12-inning thriller against Oakland in the wild-card game, and a pair of 11-inning games in Los Angeles before returning home to an adoring crowd at Kauffman Stadium.\n\nThis one had none of the drama, not that anybody wearing blue cared.\n\nAfter Trout staked his team to the lead, Angels starter C.J. Wilson quickly got into trouble. The left-hander with the $16 million price tag this season gave up consecutive singles and a four-pitch walk in the first inning to load the bases for Gordon, whose slicing two-out double gave Kansas City a 3-1 lead.\n\nSensing the game already slipping away, Scioscia immediately turned the game over to his bullpen. It didn\u2019t fare a whole lot better.\n\nThe Royals kept the pressure on, and even plodding designated hitter Billy Butler got in on the act, stealing second base to the roar of the crowd. It was his fifth career steal and first in two years, but it typified the way the Royals have been winning this postseason.\n\nDazzling pitching, daring baserunning and some dogged determination.\n\nAfter swiping seven bases and playing small-ball against the A\u2019s, the club that hit the fewest homers in the regular season pounded out four long balls against Los Angeles.\n\nMoustakas hit the first of them in the 11th inning of the opener, Hosmer hit the second in the 11th inning the next night, and both of them went deep to finish off the sweep.\n\nHosmer\u2019s two-run shot came in the third inning. Moustakas connected in the fourth.\n\nBy that point, the Angels \u2014 their high-priced offense having fizzled and pitching having failed them \u2014 were slumped over the railing of their dugout. They spent the final five innings bundled up against the October chill, periods of rain making their night miserable.\n\nBut hardly putting a damper on Royals fans that have waited 29 years for these moments.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRoyals RHP Kelvin Herrera pitched a scoreless seventh inning. He left Thursday night\u2019s series opener after five pitches with a strained forearm.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Orioles, who beat Detroit 2-1 on Sunday to finish off their series sweep, are in the ALCS for the first time since 1997.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Royals beat Angels 8-3 to finish off ALDS sweep", "title": "Royals beat Angels 8-3 to finish off ALDS sweep", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/05/royals-beat-angels-8-3-to-finish-off-alds-sweep/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__royals-shieldsp1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141005__royals-shieldsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-05T21:24:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T16:21:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff6b\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 The Kansas City Royals waited nearly three decades to return to the postseason.\nKANSAS CITY, Mo.\nKansas City went 4-3 against the O\u2019s this year.\nKansas City showed off great glovework in every game, especially by its fleet outfielders.\nUP NEXTThe Orioles, who beat Detroit 2-1 on Sunday to finish off their series sweep, are in the ALCS for the first time since 1997."}
