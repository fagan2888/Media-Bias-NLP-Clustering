All politicians are beholden to some organizations and take care of themselves first: the best pensions, the best health care (not Obamacare), perks and liberal benefits.

They promise a lot during elections (remember “Hope and Change”?) but do not deliver.

Donald Trump is brash and unpolished but I prefer that over smooth, politically correct politicians.

Let’s give a non-politician a chance.
