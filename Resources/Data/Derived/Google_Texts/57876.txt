Although Roe v. Wade led to the legalization of abortion in the United States, it remains a heated topic of debate to this day. Chile, on the other hand, has yet to legalize abortion, and pro-abortion activists are doing everything in their power to get the abortion laws in their country changed. One pro-abortion group, Miles, tried to show just how dangerous “accidental abortions” really can be in a series of videos titled “abortion tutorials.” The result is nothing short of disturbing.

"Clandestine abortions are carried out in Chile and abortions will continue with or without politicians or a law," Miles director Claudia Dides said in a statement. "What we want is for abortions to be safe."

One of the videos, titled “Stairs,” mockingly explains the correct technique for climbing a set of stairs and falling down said stairs in order to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Another video, “Traffic Lights,” shows pregnant women the correct way to get hit by a car so they can be pregnancy-free. The last video, “Shoes,” ups the ante by showing how the heel of a woman’s shoe can be used as an abortion tool.

While the videos paint a picture of the abortion issue in a very disturbing light, a select number of countries have refused to fall in line with the norms surrounding reproductive rights. Women who are expected of having an abortion in Chile face the possibility of up to five years in prison. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, based in New York, Chile is one of only six countries that completely prohibits abortion.
