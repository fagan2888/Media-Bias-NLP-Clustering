Is that still your view? Health savings accounts to replace Obamacare.\u201d Carson responded, \u201cAbsolutely, because it puts the care and the responsibility back in the hands of patients and healthcare providers. And it\u2019s not that complex. You know, making a health savings account available to Americans from the day they\u2019re born until they die, using the exact same dollars that we use now. We wouldn\u2019t to use as many of them. And giving people the ability to shift money within their HSA between family members, which gives you enormous flexibility. And because nothing\u2019s coming out of your catastrophic insurance, the cost of that drops dramatically, you make it possible to buy that across state lines. That\u2019ll take care of the majority of Americans.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t take care of the indigent. And, you know, we take care of them now through Medicaid.\u201d Carson then argued that one could buy \u201ca concierge practice\u201d with the money that is spent per-person under Medicaid, and that his plan would teach people responsibility.\n\nCarson added, \u201cWell, the fact of the matter is, that the government would provide the money for the indigent in their HSA. No question about that. But, our overall goal is to get them out of a position where they need to have somebody else doing it.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson said, \"the government would provide the money for the indigent in their HSA\" under his plan to replace Obamacare with HSAs", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ben Carson said, \"the government would provide the money for the indigent in their HSA\" under his plan to replace Obamacare with HSAs", "title": "Carson: Government Would Provide Money for Post-Obamacare HSAs Of Poor - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/ben-carson-2015-freedom-summit-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-08-15T16:05:35-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/15/carson-government-would-provide-money-for-post-obamacare-hsas-of-poor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Carson said, \"the government would provide the money for the indigent in their HSA\" under his plan to replace Obamacare with HSAs", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/ben-carson-2015-freedom-summit-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Carson: Government Would Provide Money for Post-Obamacare HSAs Of Poor - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ben Carson, health savings accounts,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Obamacare,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-15T15:32:41-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-08-15T16:05:35-07:00", "tag": "health savings accounts", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba57\"", "article_summary": "Carson added, \u201cWell, the fact of the matter is, that the government would provide the money for the indigent in their HSA.\nHealth savings accounts to replace Obamacare.\u201d Carson responded, \u201cAbsolutely, because it puts the care and the responsibility back in the hands of patients and healthcare providers.\nYou know, making a health savings account available to Americans from the day they\u2019re born until they die, using the exact same dollars that we use now.\nAnd giving people the ability to shift money within their HSA between family members, which gives you enormous flexibility.\nThat\u2019ll take care of the majority of Americans.\u201dHe continued, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t take care of the indigent."}
