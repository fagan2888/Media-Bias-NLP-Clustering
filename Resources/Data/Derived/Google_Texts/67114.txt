The humble Ford Focus has beaten the McLaren F1 and Bugatti Veyron to be named the greatest car of the past 25 years.

The car, which can be bought for as little as £500 today, has been a hit with families and petrol heads since it was launched by Ford in 1998 as a replacement for the ageing Escort, which had been built in various forms for 30 years.

It was an immediate sales success with pundits and owners hailing the modest motor for its design and performance.

The Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse has a top speed of 255mph and costs around £839,300

And it appears its popularity has stood the test of time, with the 15-year-old MK1 model taking the title as the best car from the past quarter of a century.

In a survey by Auto Express magazine, the Focus came top with the Lancia Delta Integrale rally car taking second spot and the 240mph McLaren F1 third.

Making up the top five were the current Volkswagen Golf family hatchback and the Nissan GT-R supercar.

The Focus cost just £13,350 new and can be picked up for as little as £500 today, but it still beat the £830,000, 253mph Bugatti Veyron which could only make seventh of the list.

Other cars in the top ten included the Audi TT, Alfa Romeo 156, Aston Martin DB9 and Rover Mini Cooper.

The survey was carried out to celebrate the car magazine's 25th anniversary.

News editor Jack Rix said: 'The Ford Focus has beaten a hot hatch with world rally championship-winning pedigree and the world's greatest supercar to the top prize.

' That may shock some of you, but for us it there is no more deserving winner.

' Why? Because when the Focus was introduced, it didn't just improve on the stodgy looks and driving dynamics of the Escort it replaced.

' It redefined what customers should expect from an affordable hatchback. Even today, it is a very comfortable car.'
