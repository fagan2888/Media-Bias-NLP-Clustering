Since its implementation, the exchange has somehow failed to become financially viable because of lower than expected Obamacare enrollment figures. With the state legislature rejecting a $28 million bailout, the website will now be unable to operate past this year.\n\nAccording to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser the Hawaii Health Connector will stop taking new enrollees on Friday and plans to begin migrating to the federally run Healthcare.gov. Outreach services will end by May 31, all technology will be transferred to the state by September 30, and its workforce will be eliminated by February 28.\n\nWhile the exchange has struggled since its creation, it is not for lack of funding. Since 2011 Hawaii has received a total of $205,342,270 in federal grant money from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In total, CMS provided nearly $4.5 billion to Hawaii and other state exchanges, with little federal oversight and virtually no strings attached.\n\nDespite this generous funding, the exchange has underperformed from day one. In its first year, Hawaii enrolled only 8,592 individuals \u2013 meaning it spent $23,899 on its website for each individual enrolled. Unfortunately, taxpayers will have to hand out an additional $30 million so that Hawaii can migrate to the federal system.\n\nThis is not the first time that a state exchange has failed, and taken millions of dollars in federal funds down with it. Earlier this year, Oregon\u2019s state exchange was officially abolished at an estimated cost of $41 million. Cover Oregon, as it used to be known received $305 million in funds from CMS but failed to produce a workable website months after the 2013 November deadline. The debacle has prompted numerous federal agencies and organizations to investigate allegations of inappropriate political interference from then Governor Kitzhaber\u2019s 2014 reelection campaign.\n\nHawaii now joins Oregon, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, New Mexico, and Nevada as cautionary tales in government central planning. With so many failed state exchanges, questions need to be asked about the haphazard allocation of billions of dollars in taxpayer funds and the complete lack of oversight.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "pocket-site-verification": "e8a03e904ad67c23ec990c1928577c", "og": {"site_name": "Americans for Tax Reforms", "description": "Despite over $205 million in federal taxpayer funding, Hawaii\u2019s Obamacare exchange website will soon shut down.\u00a0 Since its implementation, the exchange has somehow failed to become financially viable because of lower than expected Obamacare enrollment figures.
