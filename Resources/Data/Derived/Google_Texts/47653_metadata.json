Obama embraces Obamacare\n\nPresident Barack Obama left no doubt Tuesday night what his Obamacare sales technique will be: loud voice, lots of confidence and no apologies.\n\nDon\u2019t dwell on the scratches on the hood. Just tell the customer how good it will feel to rev the engine and drive the car off the lot.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObamacare didn\u2019t show up in the State of the Union address until over halfway through, and it encompassed all of nine paragraphs in an hour-plus stemwinder. But this was very much a hard sell by the president for Americans to sign up for his signature health care law, the biggest sales pitch Obama has made in a State of the Union address since the law passed. His pitch was a lengthy tour of all the success stories he could find: the Arizona woman with a health condition who got health coverage just in time, the Kentucky governor who built one of the best working enrollment websites in the country and the millions of Americans who have already signed up for coverage.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Full health care policy coverage)\n\nHis message to Obamacare\u2019s supporters and critics: Enough with the repeal votes. Time to sign up \u2014 especially the young adults.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMoms, get on your kids to sign up. Kids, call your mom and walk her through the application. It will give her some peace of mind \u2014 plus, she\u2019ll appreciate hearing from you.\u201d\n\nThe one part Obama didn\u2019t mention: that rocky rollout everyone heard so much about.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s world on Tuesday night, there was no such thing as a broken federal website or canceled health insurance policies. It wasn\u2019t even a call to sign up now that things are working better. It was as if Obamacare has been working well all along.\n\nIn fact, in Obama\u2019s world, the only repairs that were needed were for the \u201cbroken health care system\u201d that Obamacare was supposed to replace.\n\n\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t heard, we\u2019re in the process of fixing that,\u201d Obama said \u2014 as House Speaker John Boehner shot him a skeptical look.\n\n( Full coverage of the 2014 State of the Union)\n\nObama declared that more than 9 million Americans have signed up for private health insurance or Medicaid coverage \u2014 a statement that was technically true but glossed over the uncertainty about whether all of those people really gained new health coverage because of the law.\n\nThat statement, however, made it easier for Obama to make his case against more votes to wipe the law off the books \u2014 as did his declaration to the country that, because of the law, \u201cno American can ever again be dropped or denied coverage for a preexisting condition like asthma, back pain or cancer\u201d and that \u201cno woman can ever be charged more just because she\u2019s a woman.\u201d\n\nObama used his time to shine a powerful spotlight on Amanda Shelley, one of first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s guests. Shelley is a physician assistant from Arizona with a pre-existing condition who got health insurance on Jan. 1 \u2014 and then had emergency abdominal surgery a few days later.\n\nIt was a success story that contained just about all the elements he needed: a sick person who was locked out of the health insurance system, got her coverage and then suddenly had a medical emergency that could have been financially devastating without insurance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what health insurance reform is all about \u2014 the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don\u2019t have to lose everything,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t expect to convince my Republican friends on the merits of this law. But I know that the American people aren\u2019t interested in refighting old battles,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo again, if you have specific plans to cut costs, cover more people, and increase choice \u2014 tell America what you\u2019d do differently. Let\u2019s see if the numbers add up.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s not have another forty-something votes to repeal a law that\u2019s already helping millions of Americans like Amanda. The first forty were plenty,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all owe it to the American people to say what we\u2019re for, not just what we\u2019re against.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "It's the biggest sales pitch he has made in a State of the Union address since the law passed.", "title": "Obama embraces Obamacare", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/barack-obama-obamacare-affordable-care-act-state-of-the-union-2014-102771.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/01/28/140128_sotu_barack_obama_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,State Of The Union 2014,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "It's the biggest sales pitch he has made in a State of the Union address since the law passed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb34\"", "article_summary": "Obama embraces ObamacarePresident Barack Obama left no doubt Tuesday night what his Obamacare sales technique will be: loud voice, lots of confidence and no apologies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what health insurance reform is all about \u2014 the peace of mind that if misfortune strikes, you don\u2019t have to lose everything,\u201d Obama said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, tonight, I ask every American who knows someone without health insurance to help them get covered by March 31st,\u201d Obama said.\nIn Obama\u2019s world on Tuesday night, there was no such thing as a broken federal website or canceled health insurance policies.\nShelley is a physician assistant from Arizona with a pre-existing condition who got health insurance on Jan. 1 \u2014 and then had emergency abdominal surgery a few days later."}
