These are aimed mainly at renters, according to a new study by real estate website Trulia.\n\nRelated: Best Cities to be a Mom-and-Pop Landlord\n\n\u201cRentals are an unusually high share of new construction in 2014, as the housing recovery is now creating more new renters than first-time homebuyers,\u201d said Trulia chief economist Jed Kolko in the release.\n\nConfidence among U.S. homebuilders for newly built single-family homes rose in August and reached its highest level since January, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index.\n\nTo help identify markets where annualized permit activity is highest compared to the metro areas\u2019 historical norm, Trulia studied Census Bureau building permit data for the first half of 2014. For specific markets, it compared the data with the metros\u2019 historical annual average level of building permits from 1999 to 2013.\n\nHere are the top 10 metro areas where new construction is highest above normal \u2013 and the 2014 annualized permit activity relative to these areas\u2019 historical norm:\n\nBoston: 73 percent New York: 70 percent San Jose, Calif.: 69 percent Houston, Texas: 61 percent Oklahoma City, Okla.: 42 percent Orange County, Calif.: 40 percent Austin, Texas: 39 percent Dallas, Texas: 36 percent San Francisco: 36 percent Los Angeles: 34 percent\n\nMulti-unit buildings account for most of the new construction in 7 of these 10 metros, and more than 80 percent of new units in New York and in San Francisco.\n\nRelated: In NYC, Front Doors Are for the One Percent\n\nAdditionally, construction booms tend to go along with small price gains. \u201cPrice increases aren\u2019t especially high, with asking home prices up less than the national average of 7.8 percent in five of those 10 metros,\u201d said Kolko.\n\nHowever, in Austin, Houston, San Francisco and San Jose, construction booms have gone hand-in-hand with strong price gains.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New home construction is recovering slowly on a national level, but in some real estate markets, particularly large metro areas, new residential buildings are sprawling at a much faster pace than the historical norm.", "title": "10 Cities with the Most Homebuilding Gains", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/18/10-Cities-Most-Homebuilding-Gains", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03062012_homes_for_rent_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/18/10-Cities-Most-Homebuilding-Gains", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03062012_homes_for_rent_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "New home construction is recovering slowly on a national level, but in some real estate markets, particularly large metro areas, new residential buildings are sprawling at a much faster pace than the historical norm.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddab\"", "article_summary": "However, in Austin, Houston, San Francisco and San Jose, construction booms have gone hand-in-hand with strong price gains.\nRelated: In NYC, Front Doors Are for the One PercentAdditionally, construction booms tend to go along with small price gains.\nTo help identify markets where annualized permit activity is highest compared to the metro areas\u2019 historical norm, Trulia studied Census Bureau building permit data for the first half of 2014.\nFor specific markets, it compared the data with the metros\u2019 historical annual average level of building permits from 1999 to 2013.\nThese are aimed mainly at renters, according to a new study by real estate website Trulia."}
