regulation Friday that will pressure health insurers to cover sex change operations, which could then be subsidized by taxpayers through Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare.\n\nThe final rule comes the same day the Obama administration ordered schools to let children use whatever bathroom or locker room matches \u201ctheir chosen gender identity,\u201d or risk losing federal funding.\n\nThe agency released its final \u201cNondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities\u201d rule, which enforces Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe regulation \u201cprohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability; enhances language assistance for individuals with limited English proficiency; and protects individuals with disabilities,\u201d the agency said in a release.\n\nDoctors and health insurers also cannot deny \u201chealth care or health coverage based on an individual\u2019s sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping.\u201d\n\nIn a fact sheet on the portion of the rule regarding sex discrimination, the government explains that health care providers cannot refuse to cover all services related to a sex change\u2014such as hormone therapy, breast implants, and the surgery itself\u2014as a matter of policy.\n\n\u201cCategorical coverage exclusions or limitations for all health care services related to gender transition are discriminatory,\u201d the agency said.\n\nClick for more from The Washington Free Beacon.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "regulation", "classification":
