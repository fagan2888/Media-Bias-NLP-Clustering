A decision eliminating subsidies for millions of newly insured people could reinforce the negative outlook for the sector due to the direct impact of lost reimbursement and a resurgence in costs for treating uninsured patients, according to the report.\n\nMid-term elections giving Republicans greater power in Congress also will fuel efforts to repeal or chip away at the reforms.\n\nThe rating agency put a negative outlook on the sector last year and during 2014 downgrades exceeded upgrades, and the disparity would likely have been greater if not for the high level of merger activity, the report said.\n\nFitch on Dec. 9 said the sector outlook for non-profit healthcare was negative, but at the same time said the credit rating outlook is stable.\n\nFitch said its negative sector forecast, the same as last year, reflects the high level of uncertainty faced by healthcare management teams as they attempt to navigate the changing care delivery/reimbursement model and the political and legal uncertainties of further implementation of the ACA.\n\n\"As a result, Fitch expects a higher level of year-over-year performance volatility among its rated entities, compared with prior years,\" Fitch healthcare analysts James LeBuhn and Jennifer Kim wrote, adding that the improving liquidity and moderating leverage would provide a strong financial cushion to offset the increase.\n\nFitch's stable rating outlook for the sector, however, anticipates that \"the vast majority of rating actions and outlooks in 2015 to be affirmations and stable, respectively. Through Dec. 8, Fitch had issued 147 ratings affirmations, 17 downgrades and 24 upgrades.\n\nMoody's earlier this month said it would maintain its negative outlook on the sector, warning that key economic and financial conditions in the already challenged sector are expected to remain weak.\n\nOperating margins, cash flow growth, and revenue growth are all expected to remain low in 2015, according to Moody's.
