But it could have been a blood clot. He quickly ordered an ultrasound.\n\n\u201cWe were just being abundantly cautious,\u201d he said.\n\nSuch vigilance is a point of pride at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. But the hospital\u2019s tests have identified so many infections and serious blood clots that the federal government is cutting the institution\u2019s Medicare payments for a year, by about $1.6 million.\n\nNearly half of the nation\u2019s academic medical centers are being punished similarly through one of the federal government\u2019s sternest attempts to promote patient safety. Medicare is reducing a year\u2019s worth of payments to 758 hospitals, including some of the most prestigious teaching hospitals in the country, with the highest rates of infections and other potentially avoidable complications, including blood clots after surgery, bed sores, hip fractures and sepsis.\n\nThe penalties, created by the federal Affordable Care Act, have incited a vehement debate about quality at many academic medical centers often revered for cutting-edge treatments and top specialists. Are these vaunted hospitals really more dangerous than local, unsung hospitals?\n\nOr, as Northwestern and some other academic medical centers argue, are these hospitals being perversely penalized because they are so aggressive in screening patients for problems? At Northwestern, the penchant for ordering lab tests is so prevalent that physicians often refer to a \u201cculture of culturing\u201d that they credit for helping to keep the death rate there lower than at most hospitals.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t look for infections, you\u2019re never going to find them,\u201d said Dr. Gary Noskin, Northwestern\u2019s chief medical officer.\n\nSince 2008, Medicare has refused to reimburse hospitals for treating complications they created, but studies have found that the change has not resulted in substantial decreases in harm. Nationwide, infections and other avoidable hospital complications remain a threat to patients, occurring during 12 of every 100 stays, according to a federal estimate. Patients were hurt in some way more than four million times when hospitalized in 2014.\n\nHurting Hospitals With Sickest Patients?\n\nThe new Medicare penalties, which reduce payments by 1 percent for a year, were begun in October 2014. Last December, Medicare announced its second round of penalized facilities, which include Stanford Hospital in California, the Cleveland Clinic, and Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, which trains residents from Harvard Medical School. Intermountain Medical Center in Utah and Geisinger Medical Center in Pennsylvania, both of which President Obama has singled out for excellence, also are being penalized.\n\nThe average penalty is estimated at about $480,000, but most academic centers will lose more since they have higher revenues. Medicare says the punishments are effective and notes that teaching hospitals as a group are improving more rapidly than other hospitals.\n\nDr. Kate Goodrich, Medicare\u2019s quality director, said in a statement that the \u201cscores and penalties show an improvement among large teaching hospitals\u201d since the first year of the fines. In some areas, including catheter-associated infections, the rate of injuries at teaching hospitals decreased faster than at other hospitals, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only the magnitude of the penalty, but the publicity that comes out of being penalized,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Kavanagh, a patient safety advocate from Kentucky.\n\nEven hospitals that are improving can be disciplined because Congress required Medicare to fine a quarter of hospitals each year (excluding some special categories such as those serving veterans). Most teaching hospitals penalized this time, including Northwestern, were also fined the previous year.\n\nDr. Atul Grover, chief public policy officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the fines hurt hospitals, such as academic centers, that have the sickest patients. Medicare is \u201cpunishing hospitals for taking on cases that nobody else wants,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you don\u2019t look for infections, you\u2019re never going to find them. Dr. Gary Noskin\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been collecting infection reports from hospitals for decades to help experts identify problems and measure progress in combating dangerous germs. Kristen Metzger, an infection prevention specialist at Northwestern, said that since Medicare now uses the CDC reports in determining penalties, physicians sometimes get into disputes with her team about whether a case meets the criteria to be reported.\n\n\u201cEvery week at our meetings it almost always turns into an argument\u201d about what Northwestern is calling an infection, and whether the hospital is being too strict, Metzger said.\n\nQuestion About Reporting\n\nFederal officials are concerned that not all facilities may be diligently reporting infections. In October, the government informed hospitals that it had heard that some employees were discouraging tests that might identify one of the infections the CDC tracks. The government also said it had been told that in some places, employees unnecessarily tested patients upon admission to document infections they arrived with. While saying there was no evidence of widespread fraud, the government invited whistle-blowers to report misconduct.\n\nNorthwestern identifies an unusually high rate of infections around the sites of colon surgeries, about one in every 19 operations, according Medicare\u2019s most recent public data. Its rates of blood clots after surgeries are also high. The hospital reports one urinary tract infection for every 260 days that patients in the intensive care unit had catheters in place \u2014 a rate that is still higher than at most hospitals even after taking into consideration the fact that teaching hospitals tend to have patients with more infections.\n\nMedicare is scheduled to release updated infection rates later this month and the next year of penalties will begin in October.\n\nThe most reliable way to reduce urinary infections is to avoid using catheters or to take them out as soon as possible, infection experts say. Hospitals such as Brigham and Women\u2019s, which says it loses about $2.6 million each year it is penalized, have given nurses authority to remove urinary catheters in specific situations without getting physician approval to limit their usage. Rob Bailey, a Northwestern nurse, said that was not possible for particularly ill patients.\n\nOne of his patients, comatose and obese, arrived with bed sores that would have been aggravated by movement. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we could have done differently,\u201d Bailey said.\n\nDuring the first three months the patient was at Northwestern, the hospital reported three infections in that patient to the CDC.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the magnitude of the penalty, but the publicity that comes out of being penalized. Dr. Kevin Kavanagh\n\nIn some instances, Northwestern officials say, they have room for improvement. The hospital requires nursing supervisors and their teams to \u201caudit\u201d nurses at least 20 times each month by watching them as they insert and maintain catheters.\n\n\u201cHand hygiene, as easy as it sounds, that takes a lot,\u201d Andrea Stone, the nurse manager, said. \u201cPeople get busy, and it\u2019s a teaching hospital, and if you\u2019re in a group and the doctor or the attending is talking with the entire team, people might not be as focused.\u201d\n\nDr. Richard Wunderink, medical director of the intensive care unit, said Northwestern\u2019s focus on the conditions that determine Medicare penalties has detracted from more prevalent medical challenges, such as how to reduce pneumonias in patients on ventilators, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no penalty right now for pneumonias,\u201d Wunderink said. \u201cWe are spending time on things that are maybe less important from a patient care perspective but more important from a financial perspective.\u201d\n\nNot every expert believes teaching hospitals are inherently more meticulous in screening patients. \u201cI see transfers from community hospitals, and they tend to do just as many cultures as we do,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Meddings, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Medical School whose research focuses on infections.\n\nAscher, Bilimoria\u2019s patient with the swollen leg, praised Northwestern for its thoroughness. She has had four surgeries for melanoma on her left leg. During her treatment, doctors inadvertently discovered a brain aneurysm, which she said \u201cthey found only because they were so thorough because of the testing they did on me.\u201d\n\nOne of the cancer surgeries led to an infection, which Bilimoria said was not unusual for the rare procedure he performed, a type that usually takes place only at academic medical centers.\n\n\u201cIt was caught soon enough that I didn\u2019t have any real problems with it,\u201d Ascher, 74, said. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I\u2019m at the best hospital there is, and we have lots of hospitals to choose from in this city.\u201d\n\nKHN\u2019s coverage of aging and long term care issues is supported in part by a grant from The SCAN Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly half of academic medical centers will be penalized by the government this year for high rates of infections and other avoidable complications, but the hospitals say it shows they screen better for problems.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Kaiser Health News", "description": "Nearly half of academic medical centers will be penalized by the government this year for high rates of infections and other avoidable complications, but the hospitals say it shows they screen bett\u2026", "title": "At Teaching Hospitals, Aggressive Screening May Lead To Medicare Penalties", "url": "http://khn.org/news/at-teaching-hospitals-aggressive-screening-may-lead-to-medicare-penalties/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/nyt-rau-hospitals-770.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://kaiserhealthnews.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/nyt-rau-hospitals-770.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@khnews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@khnews"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://khn.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "Kaiser Health News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-04-20T13:26:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T13:56:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "El-hccfbhMd9lv-h8wAfp8Qu5KhqI8hjJMi1-CefIoQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Medicare says the punishments are effective and notes that teaching hospitals as a group are improving more rapidly than other hospitals.\nThe new Medicare penalties, which reduce payments by 1 percent for a year, were begun in October 2014.\nIn some areas, including catheter-associated infections, the rate of injuries at teaching hospitals decreased faster than at other hospitals, she said.\nMost teaching hospitals penalized this time, including Northwestern, were also fined the previous year.\nDr. Kate Goodrich, Medicare\u2019s quality director, said in a statement that the \u201cscores and penalties show an improvement among large teaching hospitals\u201d since the first year of the fines."}
