In each party, the two front-runners, previously friendly, are going on the attack.\n\nFor Republicans, the Ted Cruz-Donald Trump detente has exploded into shots fired.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, Republican Presidential Candidate: Cruz is going down. He is going down. No, he\u2019s having a hard time. He looks like a nervous wreck.\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ, Republican Presidential Candidate: Donald has been an active supporter. He gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: And in the last day, the candidates have each launched new ads, each arguing the other is not a real conservative.\n\nTrump\u2019s play, immigration. His ad raises Cruz\u2019s past support of some legal status for the undocumented.\n\nSEN. TED CRUZ: I want immigration reform to pass, and that allows those who are here illegally to come in out of the shadows.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Cruz\u2019s ad plays a different card, pointing to Trump\u2019s defense of eminent domain. That\u2019s the taking of private land for development or roads.\n\nNARRATOR: It made him rich, like when Trump colluded with Atlantic City insiders to bulldoze the home of an elderly widow.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Their fight for the nomination is now suddenly a fight for the soul of the Republican Party. This week, Bob Dole, former Senate Republican leader and presidential nominee, blasted Cruz, saying he would mean cataclysmic and wholesale losses for the party.\n\nCruz has said that\u2019s a sign that Washington is scared of him. Other conservatives see Trump as more alarming. \u201cNational Review\u201d magazine, a conservative icon, etched its cover with the words \u201cAgainst Trump,\u201d inside, sharper words still. Editors wrote that \u201cTrump is a political opportunist, that he knows approximately as much about national security as he does about the nuclear triad, which is to say almost nothing.\u201d\n\nThey also wrote that \u201cTrump has shown no interest in conservative issues, limiting government, reforming entitlements or the Constitution.\u201d\n\nTrump, for his part, was equally stinging, tweeting back that \u201cThe National Review\u201d is a failing publication that has lost its way.\n\nMeantime, with the Democratic race suddenly tighter, Hillary Clinton is pushing her national security credentials in a new ad, and she\u2019s going after Bernie Sanders\u2019 for wanting government-run health care after Obamacare.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON, Democratic Presidential Candidate: I don\u2019t want to rip up this accomplishment and begin this contentious debate all over again. That\u2019s where I disagree with my esteemed opponent, Senator Sanders.\n\nLISA DESJARDINS: Sanders is getting attention for this more thematic, ad. It portrays a movement of regular working Americans. The images have been criticized for a lack of diversity, in a race where Sanders trails with African-Americans.\n\nOn the trail, the Vermont senator is stepping up his criticism, this morning pointing to Social Security. He\u2019d like to raise taxes on the wealthy to expand it. It is closing argument time, 10 days until Iowa, tight races on both sides. That also means time for closing punches.\n\nFor the PBS NewsHour, I\u2019m Lisa Desjardins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As voting draws near, Republican front-runners Donald Trump and Sen.
