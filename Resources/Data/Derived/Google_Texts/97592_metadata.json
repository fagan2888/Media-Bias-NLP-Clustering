Now that China\u2019s economy is faltering, the 10 countries that are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (also known as Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam \u2013 are poised to benefit.\n\nThe ASEAN countries represent a huge market. Taken together, they have a population of about 625 million people, skewed heavily toward youth, with 65 percent of the people under 35. Their combined economies make Southeast Asia one of the fastest growing regions in the world, with five of the countries ranked among the top 25 in the world as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Singapore\u2019s GDP per capita ranks among the top 10 in the world, higher than the U.S., and Indonesia\u2019s GDP also ranks in the top 10.\n\nNot surprisingly, the region\u2019s road to economic growth is not without some bumps. Most notably, in Malaysia, there have been recent protests against Prime Minister Najib Razak, who is accused of taking $700 million from a state investment fund he established in 2009 to boost the country\u2019s economy. Cabinet ministers have said the money is a political donation from Middle Eastern donors, and the fund denies paying the prime minister.\n\nNevertheless, the fund has been investigated for mismanagement, including overpaying for investments and paying high fees to investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS).\n\nSome investors have set up shop in the region. For example, Navis Capital Partners was founded in 1998 by Nicholas Bloy and Richard Foyston, both of whom spent many years at the Boston Consulting Group in Asia. Navis, headquartered Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, boasts offices throughout Southeast Asia. Managing $5 billion, Navis has made 60-plus control investments, typically in the $50 million to $150 million range. It has deployed 60 percent to 70 percent of its capital to the more-developed markets of the region, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nLogistics, consumer goods, food and beverage, infrastructure, education and health care are among the region\u2019s promising sectors, says Jean-Christophe Marti, a senior partner at Navis who is based in Singapore. Retailers are attractive to investors because consumer spending is growing throughout Southeast Asia.\n\nNavis has acquired ownership stakes in two retail businesses in 2015. In Thailand, the firm invested in Nitipon Clinic, a chain of centers providing facial treatments and other cosmetic procedures, such as skin whitening and spot removal. And in Singapore, Navis backed Imperial Treasure, a chain of 21 fine-dining restaurants.\n\nIn a related deal, French-backed private equity firm L Capital Asia reportedly spent $100 million for a 90 percent stake in Crystal Jade, a chain of 120 casual-dining restaurants, based in Singapore and China. Crystal Jade was founded in 1991 by the same family that started Navis-backed Imperial Treasure.\n\nIn the for-profit education sector, Advent International bought a stake in Singapore-based the Learning Lab, which provides tutoring services to high-school and pre-high-school-aged children, for about $220 million in 2014.\n\nEarly-mover advantage\n\nFor certain sectors in Southeast Asia, the first investors to establish a foothold will have an advantage, says Andrew Rice, senior vice president of the Jordan Co. The region represents an opportunity that\u2019s \u201cnot going to happen overnight,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to see more and more U.S. firms go there, and if you can get in on the ground floor and have that early-mover advantage, in certain industries that can be a big plus.\u201d Jordan\u2019s Rice knows all about pioneering new territory. The New York PE firm began investing in China in the 1990s, long before most competitors.\n\nFor 20 years, China dominated the attention of M&A investors looking to Asia for opportunities. In addition to inexpensive labor, the country offered a fast-growing domestic market, relative economic stability and infrastructure to support growth, with the government investing heavily in highways, railways, airports, sea ports and industrial parks. For more, read Choosing China.\n\nNow, China\u2019s unprecedented run of economic growth is stalling. Although the Chinese government still claims that GDP is growing at a 7 percent clip, private economists estimate growth at about 4 percent.\n\nCommodity suppliers that have been feeding the Chinese growth engine have seen demand tapering, indicating a slowdown and uncertainty about the pace of future growth.\n\nFor investors seeking low-cost sourcing opportunities for U.S. companies, China was the place to go, and the country\u2019s own consumers were creating growing, viable markets as well. And until about five years ago, there wasn\u2019t a lot of competition for deals in China, says Rice, who heads up Jordan\u2019s operations support group\u2019s international unit, helping U.S. portfolio companies expand overseas.\n\nBut the field of competitors has become more crowded. Now, companies in China that become targets are chased by domestic Chinese investment firms, along with a growing contingent of international firms, which has pushed valuations much higher.\n\n\u201cAs an investor, if you find a great company but you have to pay too much for it, then it\u2019s not a good deal all of a sudden,\u201d Rice says. \u201cWe\u2019re still interested in China long term, but there\u2019s not the low-hanging fruit like there used to be.\u201d\n\nWhile Jordan has not invested in Southeast Asia since 2000, some of the firm\u2019s portfolio companies have key suppliers in the region, and the firm is looking into several potential strategic partnerships, says Rice, who visited Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam in June.\n\nChina\u2019s labor costs have been rising, particularly in its coastal areas, because fewer Chinese people are migrating to those areas from inland rural areas. To compensate for the labor costs, vendors in those areas are raising their prices and minimum order requirements.\n\n\u201cThe coastal side of China is not the answer to all sourcing needs any more--whether there are labor dynamics or whether there are volume constraints--as the supply of labor tightens up,\u201d says Roberto Ferranti, principal at Baird Capital, the direct private investment arm of Robert W. Baird & Co.\n\nFerranti, who works on improving operations and developing overseas relationships for Baird\u2019s U.S. companies, says that searches for sourcing that used to end with China now typically include Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia or India as well.\n\n\u201cOver the years, we\u2019ve seen the dynamic evolve quite a bit where China used to be the de facto answer for a lot of our sourcing projects, and over the last three or four years, there\u2019s been a quite visible trend where China is one of the solutions, but not the only solution for sourcing needs,\u201d he says.\n\nSoutheast Asian countries can now beat coastal China sources on price for certain types of manufacturing.\n\n\u201cOn the sourcing side, you\u2019re seeing companies realizing that it\u2019s costing a lot more to have a certain product made in China, but they can go down and have it made in Vietnam for 20 to 30 percent less,\u201d Rice says. \u201cSo for products that are not high value-added, you\u2019re starting to see a lot more of that manufacturing move to Vietnam or the Philippines, or Malaysia. Laos has a few areas that are pretty good, but they\u2019re very small, and Cambodia still has a long way to go. Indonesia has some good areas, but overall their infrastructure is very poor.\u201d\n\nNavis Capital\u2019s Marti says the rise in Chinese labor costs are benefitting Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. In addition to cheaper labor, those countries also have a lower blended cost because of cheaper utilities and more efficient logistics.\n\nFor the next couple of years, China and India suppliers will still have the advantage for manufacturing that requires access to large amounts of capital and raw materials, as well as advantages for infrastructure and other capabilities, Ferranti says. But Southeast Asia countries will have the advantage for items with high labor costs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re looking at other industries where there is a high degree of labor content\u2014think about textiles, for example\u2014that\u2019s an area where other regions will emerge, and already are,\u201d such as Cambodia and Vietnam, Ferranti says.\n\nFor example, in 2014, Swiss specialty chemical-maker Archroma, a portfolio company of U.S. PE firm SK Capital Partners, bought BASF SE\u2019s (FRA: BAS) Singapore-based textile chemicals business. Archroma also has a textile business headquartered in Singapore, and the deal allows the company to ship to Asian customers more quickly.\n\nTrains, planes and automobiles\n\n\n\nSoutheast Asian countries are devoting resources to their own infrastructure projects that are expected to pay economic growth dividends and boost their appeal to companies and private equity investors. Singapore and Malaysia are building a high-speed train line between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, with construction scheduled to begin this year, which will lead to industrial park construction along the line. Other countries are planning their own transportation projects.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to start seeing highways and trains going through Vietnam all the way up into China; you\u2019re going to see Vietnam linking into Cambodia and Laos, which gets you over into Thailand,\u201d Rice says. \u201cThese projects are five to 10 years in the making, but they\u2019re massive projects that lead to very real positive value for business.\u201d\n\nMost tariffs between ASEAN member countries are scheduled to end by Jan. 1, 2016, and other steps will help unite the region\u2019s economic community, such as establishing links between stock markets, banks and reinsurance markets in the countries. The effect of the ASEAN changes-- along with trade agreements with India, Australia, China and other Asian countries, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership-- will be to encourage economic development and M&A deals over the long term.\n\n\u201cThe impact of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) for us is a positive,\u201d says Marti. \u201cWe see more activity, more entrepreneurs looking to partner with funds like us to grow.\u201d\n\nThe AEC agreements and other factors are leading to more integrated, cheaper, more efficient logistics for some sectors, and driving more M&A activity and investor interest in logistics businesses, Marti says.\n\nAs large companies seek to establish a presence in Southeast Asia, others will follow, Rice says. \u201cOur view is that as the Fortune 500 companies of the world and the Fortune 1000 and their counterparts in Europe, say: \u2018We need to have a presence in Southeast Asia, because we need to be part of this fast-growing market,\u2019 then they\u2019re going to want their mid-sized companies that are their key suppliers to follow them.\u201d\n\nServing local customers\n\n\n\nRice expects many middle-market companies that come to Southeast Asia initially to supply their large international customers will evolve into serving local customers. Rice says thousands of Chinese companies are setting up factories in Vietnam, so they can sell their products to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and other ASEAN countries, taking advantage of the tariff breaks and remaining competitive. Indian, Korean, Japanese and, lately, U.S. companies are employing the same strategy.\n\n\u201cWhen these tariffs go away for trade between the ASEAN countries, that\u2019s going to mean that if you\u2019re importing from China or Japan or Korea or the U.S., it\u2019s going to cost 5 percent to 10 percent more overnight, compared to competitors with production within ASEAN. That\u2019s causing folks to say: \u2018Man, we\u2019ve got to get inside that tent,\u2019\u201d Rice says.\n\nRajiv Louis, a Jakarta-based managing director on the Carlyle Group\u2019s (Nasdaq: CG) Asia buyout team, says there is some concern within the ASEAN governments about how China will affect the trade pact. Another unknown is how their economies will be affected by the free flow of labor expected between the ASEAN countries and potential influx of goods made in other ASEAN countries.\n\n\u201cTheoretically, this is what people expect\u2014the free flow of labor\u2014but most people, even the people in government, don\u2019t feel it\u2019s going to be as porous in terms of labor movement as someone would have expected with North American Free Trade Agreement or the European Union,\u201d Louis says. \u201cIt\u2019s more the tax-free movement of goods that could be potentially dumped that I think they\u2019re worried about.\u201d\n\nThe middle-market M&A environment in Southeast Asia has been challenged in recent years by currency valuation fluctuations and the slowdown of growth in China, Louis says. \u201cGrowth has slowed down considerably from what it used to be over the last four or five years,\u201d he says. \u201cIn big part, that\u2019s due to the slowdown in China, which is now looking like the new normal rather than a one-off event in China.\u201d\n\nSoutheast Asia is adapting to a new normal as well, with businesses adjusting to a slower pace of growth and consumption than they had been used to, and a lack of major expansion drives with capital requirements, Louis says.\n\nInvestors have needed to take into account the currency fluctuations over last 12 to 18 months when choosing how to invest and considering investment returns. Another factor for U.S. investors has been the prognostication of how those emerging market countries that are running deficits will be affected if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates.\n\nIndonesia, the largest Southeast Asian economy, is running a current account deficit and relies heavily on external financing of its deficit spending, so potential Fed rate increases will impact its economy. Meanwhile, Thailand has a strong financial market and is more insulated, so it doesn\u2019t rely on external financing for government spending.\n\nAnother potential risk for U.S. middle-market companies looking to acquire operations in Southeast Asia is the different customs, cultures and the business practices in the region.\n\n\u201cIt always takes time to build proper relationships, and relationships in Asia are extremely important,\u201d Rice says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a risk that if you want to set up an operation, it\u2019s harder to find good people. Skilled laborers in places like Vietnam and Indonesia are not as readily available as in places like China, and when you want to hire managers, finding somebody\u2014whether it\u2019s accounting, sales, production, and quality control\u2014ideally you want to find somebody who\u2019s worked with other Western firms before, so that they understand the best practices, and the proper procedures and controls of a Western firm.\u201d\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_sponsors/as-dealmaking-in-china-falls-the-rest-of-southeast-asia-rises-258033-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/southeast-asia-rises.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "As China\u2019s Economy Falters, Southeast Asia Attracts Dealmakers"}}, "article_summary": "Retailers are attractive to investors because consumer spending is growing throughout Southeast Asia.\nNavis, headquartered Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, boasts offices throughout Southeast Asia.\nBut Southeast Asia countries will have the advantage for items with high labor costs.\nAnother potential risk for U.S. middle-market companies looking to acquire operations in Southeast Asia is the different customs, cultures and the business practices in the region.\nAs large companies seek to establish a presence in Southeast Asia, others will follow, Rice says."}
