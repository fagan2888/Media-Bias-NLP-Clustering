Over the past decade, thousands of inmates have gotten out of prison early because of an unpatched bug.\n\nIt took 10 full years for the Washington state Department of Corrections to take notice. And even then, technically it apparently wasn\u2019t their own doing. In 2012, officials received word from the family of a victim who was concerned that an offender might be granted release well ahead of schedule.\n\nIt turns out that since 2002, the software that keeps tabs on prisoners has been having trouble figuring out how to properly apply \u201ccredits\u201d for good behavior. That\u2019s led to the early release of around 3% \u2014 reportedly as many as 3,200 \u2014 of Washington\u2019s incarerated population over the past ten years. On the upside, that means the software\u2019s been getting it right 97% of the time, so at least it\u2019s got that going for it, which is nice.\n\nIt\u2019s also not as bad as if, say, some criminals family had mailed him a Community Chest card and the warden figured it was legit.\n\nA fix has reportedly been available for some time now, though it has yet to be deployed. Anyone in the IT business knows there could be any number of good reasons that the patch hasn\u2019t been applied yet, but allowing prisoners to continue making early exits isn\u2019t a good trade-off.\n\nGovernor Jay Inslee says that situation is \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d and \u201cmaddening.\u201d He\u2019s announced a plan to deal with it, which includes retaining two federal prosecutors to head up an independent investigation and fast-tracking the patch. It\u2019s now set to roll out next month.", "article_metadata": {"zdid": 1643065, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "@geekdotcom", "description": "All kinds of problems get blamed on software glitches, but this has to be a new one.
