Maryland’s already-expansive workplace anti-discrimination law will add yet a new dimension when it goes into effect in October.

The state legislature passed legislation adding “gender identity” to the long list of conditions that are protected by the state. Currently, the Maryland law bans workplace discrimination based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, or genetic information.
