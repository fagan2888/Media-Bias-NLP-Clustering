You can say 'Okay, well, we\u2019re going to export oil.' Well, that's terrific. We should have been doing that anyway.\"The problem is that we don\u2019t have guys who can take it to the president and ever make him negotiate anything,\" Huckabee added. \"We surrender before we ever even have the fight.\"We assume he\u2019s going to veto. He probably will \u2014 and we then assume that we\u2019re going to absolutely lose.\"We are going to lose when we don\u2019t have leaders who can go to the president and say: 'You have a line? Well, we have one, too. And if you want to play hardball, then we are going to also play hardball.'\"'We have the power of the purse. You want to veto everything? Fine, we'll defund the White House.'\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "mike huckabee, reaction, spending, bill, deal, republicans", "pubdate": "2015-12-18T22:43:07", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Friday that Republicans got nothing out of the $1.14 trillion spending bill that Congress passed because \"we\u2019ve got a very weak leadership going on in the House and Senate.", "title": "Mike Huckabee on Budget Deal: 'Republicans Basically Got Nothing'", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/mike-huckabee-reaction-spending-bill/2015/12/18/id/706455/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=c6b07bca-b607-4df9-8fcd-618a6844d89f&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/mike-huckabee-reaction-spending-bill/2015/12/18/id/706455/", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Friday that Republicans got nothing out of the $1.14 trillion spending bill that Congress passed because \"we\u2019ve got a very weak leadership going on in the House and Senate.", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Mike Huckabee on Budget Deal: 'Republicans Basically Got Nothing'"}, "epoch": 1450478587, "keywords": "mike huckabee, reaction, spending, bill, deal, republicans", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Headline", "published_time": "2015-12-18T22:43:07"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/mike-huckabee-reaction-spending-bill/2015/12/18/id/706455/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Friday that Republicans got nothing out of the $1.14 trillion spending bill that Congress passed because  we\u2019ve got a very weak leadership going on in the House and Senate."}, "article_summary": "\"Republicans basically got nothing that said conservatives are the majority in the House and Senate.\nGOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Friday that Republicans got nothing out of the $1.14 trillion spending bill that Congress passed because \"we\u2019ve got a very weak leadership going on in the House and Senate.\n\"We are going to lose when we don\u2019t have leaders who can go to the president and say: 'You have a line?\n\"I\u2019m sorry, I thought they were going to do better, but I\u2019m ashamed of them,\" the former Arkansas governor toldin an interview.\n\"The problem is that we don\u2019t have guys who can take it to the president and ever make him negotiate anything,\" Huckabee added."}
