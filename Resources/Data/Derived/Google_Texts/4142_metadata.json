But Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney, makes it both simple and delicious, and is serving up her favorite recipes in her new book.\n\nAnn Romney is making the rounds promoting the new cookbook, \u201cThe Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions.\u201d The former First Lady of Massachusetts shared with Red Alert her motivation for crafting the book and discussed how cooking has helped bring her family together.\n\n\u201cPutting this book together has been such a joy because it has allowed me to collaborate with the whole family,\u201d Ann Romney told Red Alert Politics in an email. \u201cMy sons and daughters-in-law helped collect family recipes and pictures and the grandkids helped taste-test! The result is truly a work of love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Romney Family Table\u201d features more than 125 recipes, some that were passed on from generation to generation and other favorites matriarch Ann Romney makes for her five sons.\n\nWhen the entire Romney family \u2014 all 34 of them \u2014 gathers each summer at Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, Mitt and Ann take care of breakfast for the grandchildren. One of their favorite meals, Ann Romney said, is daughter-in-law Jen\u2019s sweet pork burritos.\n\n\u201cEveryone loves them,\u201d she said, \u201ceven the picky eaters.\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes time for Ann Romney to cook for Mitt, she knows just the way to his heart.\n\n\u201cMitt\u2019s Meatloaf Cakes,\u201d she said of cooking for her husband on a special occasion. \u201cI make it for him every year on his birthday.\u201d\n\nAll proceeds for the book will be donated to the Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Mass., where Ann Romney was treated for multiple sclerosis. And \u201cThe Romney Family Table\u201d gave Ann Romney the opportunity to not only help a cause that is near and dear to her heart, but collaborate with the whole family.\n\n\u201cTraditions and cooking spark conversations about family history, create new family memories and are the glue that binds families together,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I make my grandmother\u2019s pancakes, it brings memories of the time we spent together perfecting this recipe. As I make the recipe with my grandchildren, I tell them about their great-grandmother, sharing funny stories and memories of her.\n\n\u201cHopefully, one day, my grandchildren will carry on this tradition and share stories about Mitt and me with their children, building a lasting legacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Romney Family Table\u201d is Ann Romney\u2019s first foray into book-writing. But it\u2019s not her last.\n\n\u201cI think I have one more book in me, but am not quite ready to reveal the topic,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be very different from \u2018The Romney Family Table.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Cooking for 34 people sure isn't easy.
