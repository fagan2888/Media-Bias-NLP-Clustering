But first: A preview of today's bruising Senate hearing on drug prices.\n\nWHAT VALEANT CEO WILL TELL THE SENATE: WE WERE 'TOO AGGRESSIVE' ON PRICE INCREASE \u2014 That's according to prepared testimony from Michael Pearson, who's striking a conciliatory tone ahead of the Senate Aging Committee\u2019s hearing on drug prices this afternoon, Pro's Sarah Karlin-Smith reports.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 Regrets? The outgoing CEO has a few. The infamous drug company has made \u201cmistakes\u201d Pearson writes, particularly being \u201ctoo aggressive in pursuing price increases on certain drugs.\" He also regrets pursuing transactions where a \u201ccentral premise\u201d was to buy older drugs and increase the price.\n\n\u2014 But he also thinks the Senate's getting Valeant's story wrong. Pearson tried to frame the Valeant drug price hikes as outliers, noting the committee\u2019s investigation has focused on just three of the company\u2019s 1,800 products. He also emphasized Valeant's investment in R&D and its commitment to programs that assist patients in paying for drugs.\n\n\u2014 Moving forward. Pearson may be leaving Valeant, but he said the company is working to rethink its approach to drug pricing, and that it will \u201ctrack industry norms.\u201d And he testifies that its new policies will involve greater formality and \u201creflect the painful lesson we have learned over the last year.\u201d\n\nMore details and witness list for the hearing, which starts at 3:30 p.m. ET: http://1.usa.gov/26sEJkT\n\nSee Pearson's testimony.\n\n12.2 percent. That's how much drug list prices went up last year, according to a recent IMS Health report \u2014 and don't be surprised to hear that number cited at today's hearing. But it's worth noting that list prices don't account for the discounts and rebates that many patients, providers and insurers receive to defray the cost of the drugs.\n\nWHAT HOUSE DEMS ARE SAYING TO VALEANT: YOU'RE NOT PLAYING BALL \u2014 A memo from the House Oversight Committee Democrats obtained by POLITICO indicates Valeant is not fully cooperating with its investigation in drug price hikes.\n\nAccording to the memo, Valeant withheld documents from the committee claiming they were protected by attorney-client privilege, but it later became clear that the documents weren't covered by that privilege. These documents, which included financial analyst reports prepared by multiple firms, indicate \"that the U.S. government is now paying the company more than $1 billion a year because of its massive price increases,\" the Democrats argue.\n\n\u2014 Valeant as symptom of bigger issues. The documents also show how widespread these abuses are across the entire drug industry, Ranking Member Elijah Cummings told POLITICO. The memo indicates that members have ongoing concerns about other documents the company continues to withhold from the House committee too.\n\nWELCOME TO WEDNESDAY PULSE \u2014 Where I'm still counting the votes from last night's primaries. Tips to ddiamond@politico.com or @ddiamond on Twitter.\n\nWith help from Sarah Karlin-Smith (@SarahKarlin).\n\nZIKA FUNDING: LOTS OF SPARRING, NOT A LOT OF PROGRESS \u2014 Sens. Lindsey Graham and Roy Blunt on Tuesday took a dig at their Republican counterparts in the House, as grumbling over Zika funding evolved from a partisan fight to a cameral one, too. \"We're well along in this process,\" Blunt said. \"I think the House is not where we are yet in terms of dealing with this issue and I'd like to see them get a little further along.\"\n\nAccording to Graham, who's helping negotiate the package, it's not clear whether a deal would be unveiled before the Senate departs on Friday for a week-long recess.\n\nAT HOUSE E&C TODAY: OPIOID MARKUP CONTINUES \u2014 The committee at 10 a.m. resumes its multi-day markup of 12 bills intended as a counterpart to the Senate's CARA legislation. Rep. Frank Pallone on Tuesday said he hoped the package could pass the committee this week and be brought to the House floor in May.\n\nDetails: http://1.usa.gov/1T3Fw1m\n\nGROUPS LOBBY SENATE AG APPROPRIATORS ON DRUG COMPOUNDING \u2014 Six groups are calling on Senate appropriators today to ensure that the language in the FY 2017 agricultural spending bill \"does not impede FDA\u2019s ability to ensure patient safety\" by hampering new guidance on drug compounding.\n\nThe groups \u2014 an unusual coalition that includes the American Public Health Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Generic Pharmaceutical Association, Pew Charitable Trusts, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Trust for America\u2019s Health \u2014 urge Sens. Thad Cochran, Barbara Mikulski, Jerry Moran and Jeff Merkley to avoid creating exemptions to the FDA\u2019s recent draft guidance on compounding.\n\n\"As the fungal meningitis outbreak demonstrates, access to compounded medicines must not come at the expense of quality and patient safety,\" the groups write in a letter.\n\nRead the letter: http://bit.ly/1Wp2GVp\n\nUNITEDHEALTH'S OBAMACARE EXIT: THE COST OF BAD PRICING? \u2014 The nation's largest insurer is pulling out of dozens of state marketplaces this year, saying that it's losing money on its Obamacare plans. But a Kaiser Family Foundation expert argues that United only has itself to blame.\n\n\"The thing is, this really says more about UnitedHealthcare than it does about the ACA,\" Larry Levitt writes in the JAMA Forum. \"The company\u2019s plans were often not competitively priced, with UnitedHealthcare offering 1 of the 2 lowest premium plans in only 35 percent of the counties where it participated.\"\n\nMore from Levitt: http://bit.ly/1XVREFT\n\nSee KFF's state-by-state analysis of UnitedHealthcare's exchange participation: http://kaiserf.am/1T3j2O5\n\nICYMI: CENTENE'S OBAMACARE SUCCESS STORY \u2014 The Medicaid health plan operator closed the first quarter with 680,000 exchange customers in 15 states, says it's turning a profit on the ACA exchanges and isn't ruling out expanding into additional markets, CEO Michael Neidorff said on an investor call yesterday. \"Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable,\" he stressed.\n\n\u2014 Don't expect Centene to step in where United fell out, however. The two companies pursued different patient populations on the exchange, Neidorff said, with United customers opting for broader, more expensive plans than the low-price plans that Centene usually offers. \"They're in a different market than we are, from what I can see,\" Neidorff pointed out.\n\n\u2014 Wall Street liked Centene's news. The company's stock price traded up more than 6 percent yesterday, a tidy $500 million bump in Centene's market capitalization.\n\nWONK OUT: 400-PLUS PAGES OF NATIONAL HEALTH CARE STATISTICS \u2014 A comprehensive annual report out from CDC this morning offers loads of national data on everything from coverage expansion and electronic health record adoption to use of colorectal tests and the number of dentists by state. CDC calls it the \"report card on the nation's health,\" but it's essentially an encyclopedia crammed with information on trends across health care. It's accompanied by a special feature on disparities.\n\nRead the report: http://1.usa.gov/1Szvp52\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): More transparency is needed into generic drug pricing and reimbursement rates set by drug plan middlemen. Bipartisan legislation (H.R. 244) would enhance oversight of federal health programs and help ensure pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs reflects market fluctuations.

Doctors Without Borders says the flowers represent the number of children who die from pneumonia around the world each day, although the number would be lower if Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline sliced the price of the pneumonia vaccine to $5 per child.\n\nU.S. GETTING MORE PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES, BUT SOME STATES LAG \u2014 That's according to a new RWJF survey that found a wide range in how states are prepared to handle health emergencies. Overall, the United States scored 6.7 in a 10-point preparedness index, a 3.6 percent increase since the survey launched in 2013.\n\nOne reason why preparedness matters: The threat of Zika virus this summer, especially in Southern states. Many states that could be affected by the virus lagged in the survey, and while much still isn't known about Zika, \"we do know [that] having adequate lab testing for this type of virus is important,\" says Glen Mays, the University of Kentucky professor overseeing the survey. \"Not all states have that capability.\"\n\nSee the report: http://nhspi.org/\n\nStates that are the most prepared\n\n\u00b7 Maryland (7.6)\n\n\u00b7 New York (7.5)\n\n\u00b7 Minnesota (7.4)\n\nStates that are the least prepared\n\n\u00b7 Louisiana (5.6)\n\n\u00b7 Montana (5.7)\n\n\u00b7 Arizona, Mississippi (5.8)\n\nHOW SLOW YOU'LL GET \u2014 An interactive tool developed by a Yale economist is intriguing, if depressing: It predicts how much you'll lose off your peak swimming and running times as you age. Enter your data, if you dare: http://bit.ly/1VBmNRq (via the NYT's Gina Kolata)\n\nWHY NO PUERTO RICO? \u2014 Yesterday's PULSE reported on Leapfrog Group's latest hospital rankings, which found that Washington, D.C.'s hospitals ranked the worst overall on quality and safety. But one reader was less concerned by the poor performance of D.C., and more attuned to which territory was MIA \u2014 as usual.\n\n\"I was surprised that D.C., not Puerto Rico, appeared dead last in the survey,\" former Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock writes PULSE. \"Then I read the fine print \u2014 even though Puerto Rico is part of our nation's health system with six times more population than D.C., Puerto Rico was excluded.\"\n\nHAVE YOU HEARD THE WORD? \u2014 Stay tuned.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nHHS is set to expand the National Diabetes Prevention Program, and leaders from the American Diabetes Association, American Medical Association, YMCA and Omada Health explain why the initiative matters: http://huff.to/26sWX5I\n\nVox's Julia Belluz on how \"Big Tissue\" is engaged in a PR war to make us think that bathroom hand dryers spread disease: http://bit.ly/1SOd7CK\n\nSeniors are taking far too many supplements, Aaron Carroll warns in a new episode of \"Healthcare Triage\": http://bit.ly/234ZPkJ\n\nHospitals' Medicare margins are down to negative 9 percent this year, according to a MedPAC study that Modern Healthcare's Dave Barkholz flagged: http://bit.ly/24iRIDx\n\nAn outbreak of yellow fever has sickened 1,000 people \u2014 and it was totally preventable, WIRED's Sarah Zhang writes: http://bit.ly/1MY1d6Q\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): While approximately 80 percent of prescription drugs dispensed are generic drugs, the reimbursement system for these medications is largely unregulated and a mystery to pharmacists and patients. The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
