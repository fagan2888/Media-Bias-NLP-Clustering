If the GOP thinks Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's Cuban roots will automatically win over Latino voters, then per usual they're not dealing in facts. The polling firm Latino Decisions has consistently produced some of the most informative work on the voting trends of Latinos and none of it looks good for Rubio

First, his favorability ratings with Latino voters are at a net negative nationally, with 31 percent viewing him favorably and 36 percent viewing him unfavorably.

Second, he also has a net negative favorability rating in nearly every state where the Latino vote is considered to be a key influencer.

There's no mystery to why Rubio polls so badly among Latino votersâ€”he's terrible on issues they care about: immigration, Obamacare, and climate change.
