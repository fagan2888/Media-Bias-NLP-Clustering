Trump was registered as a Democrat from 2001 to 2009 and donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates like Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid over the years. (In fairness, he has donated a lot of money to Republican candidates as well.)\n\nAs a native of liberal New York City, it\u2019s not surprising that Trump has a much longer record of being pro-choice than he does of being pro-life.\n\n\u201cI support a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d he said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 2000.\n\nTrump was never a staunch opponent of gay marriage either until recently. In fact, Rick Santorum says that Trump chided him in 2011 for being \u201ctoo hard-core\u201d on gay marriage and abortion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anyone that shares that opinion with you,\u201d Santorum said Trump told him.\n\nSo it\u2019s not too hard to envision Trump running as a socially liberal Democrat. Indeed, it would seemingly be a far easier act for the thrice-married New Yorker to pull off than convincing evangelicals that he is staunchly pro-life and against gay marriage.\n\nOn foreign policy, Trump isn\u2019t all that different from Barack Obama. To the extent his foreign policy worldview is comprehensible, he comes across as the least hawkish candidate in the GOP field, with the possible exception of Rand Paul, even though rhetoric sometimes masks this. While he says he wants to increase military spending and \u201cbomb the shit\u201d out of ISIS, he regularly makes the case for reducing America\u2019s leadership role in world affairs and focusing on nation building at home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, there is going to be nation building. You know what the nation\u2019s going to be? The United States, that\u2019s what the nation\u2019s going to be,\u201d Trump told me in September, speaking of his foreign policy outlook.\n\nAs Trump also repeatedly highlights, he opposed the Iraq war (though the first evidence of this comes from 2004, over a year after the war began). Such a position is far more endearing to the Democratic base than Hillary Clinton\u2019s support for the military action that removed Saddam from power.\n\nTrump wouldn\u2019t be out of place on economic issues in a Democratic primary either. At this anti-Wall Street moment, Trump could paint himself as the insider who is ready to turn enemy of his class for the good of the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Trump has a record of favoring proposals that would be far more vexing to the one percent than anything Bernie Sanders has proposed. In 1999, Trump proposed a one-time 14.25 percent tax on wealthy Americans and trusts over $10 million. Even now he doesn\u2019t back away from that proposal philosophically, even though he says he doesn\u2019t intend to pursue it in the White House.\n\n\u201cAt that time we could have paid off the entire national debt and we could have started the game all even,\u201d Trump told Sean Hannity in August, noting that the proposal was actually \u201cvery conservative.\u201d\n\nTrump is also a supporter of universal health care, if not Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI am going to take care of everybody,\u201d Trump said on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in September. \u201cI don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody\u2019s going to be taken care of much better than they\u2019re taken care of now.\u201d\n\nTrump even praised the single payer health care programs of Canada and Scotland during the first Republican presidential debate in August.\n\n\u201cAs far as single payer, it works in Canada, it works incredibly well in Scotland, it could have worked in a different age, which is the age you are talking about here,\u201d Trump said when asked by the moderators about his past support for single payer health care.\n\nOf course Trump would have had to made the strategic decision to position himself to run in 2016 as a Democrat way back in 2010, before he went on his birther kick. You probably can\u2019t win a Democratic primary as one of the leading birthers in the country.\n\nHis rhetoric on immigration also wouldn\u2019t fly in a Democratic primary. But if he made the decision to position himself as a Democrat contender back in 2010, he would never have called for the deportation of all the illegal immigrants in the country. In fact, after Mitt Romney lost in 2012, Trump criticized the Republican contender\u2019s rhetoric on immigration as \u201cmean-spirited,\u201d which suggests Trump\u2019s instincts on illegal immigration may be less harsh than what we are seeing today\n\n\u201cThe Democrats didn\u2019t have a policy for dealing with illegal immigrants, but what they did have going for them is they weren\u2019t mean-spirited about it,\u201d Trump told Newsmax. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what the policy was, but what they were is they were kind.\u201d\n\nBut if Trump made the decision to run as a Democrat in 2010, he may be even better positioned to win the Democratic presidential nomination today than he is to win the Republican nomination. The Democratic field is far smaller and with Joe Biden\u2019s decision to not enter the race, there is no candidate opposing Hillary Clinton who people can actually imagine winning the nomination, even if Sanders could potentially threaten her in a few states.\n\nTrump may have been that guy. He could have successfully branded Clinton as untrustworthy and even criminal over her email scandal and shady Clinton Foundation dealings, just like he negatively branded so many of his GOP foes. And it very well may have worked, just like it seems to have worked with \u201clow-energy\u201d Jeb Bush.\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t take too much of an imagination to envision a world where Donald Trump is on the verge of winning the Democratic nomination. In fact, it may even be far easier to get your head around than our current reality.\n\nFollow Jamie on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jamie Weinstein", "description": "Imagine for a moment if Donald Trump made the decision to run as a Democrat instead of as a Republican.", "og": {"url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/13/imagine-if-donald-trump-ran-as-a-democrat-its-not-too-hard-to-do/", "site_name": "The Daily Caller", "image": {"width": 313, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trump-clinton-e1460469613396.jpg", "height": 135}, "type": "article", "title": "Imagine If Donald Trump Ran As A Democrat \u2014 It\u2019s Not Too Hard To Do"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's not too hard to do", "creator": "@Jamie_Weinstein", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/13/imagine-if-donald-trump-ran-as-a-democrat-its-not-too-hard-to-do/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/trump-clinton-e1460469613396.jpg"}, "title": "Imagine If Donald Trump Ran As A Democrat \u2014 It\u2019s Not Too Hard To Do Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-13 23:18:28", "sailthru.title": "Imagine If Donald Trump Ran As A Democrat -- It's Not Too Hard To Do", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "donald trump,elections 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "donald-trump,elections-2016,jamie-weinstein", "sailthru.description": "Imagine for a moment if Donald Trump made the decision to run for president as a Democrat instead of as a Republican.
