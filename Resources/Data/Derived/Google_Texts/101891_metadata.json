You want them not just to manage money well but also to be able to put it in its proper perspective. You want to know what role money will play in the life of your children and the lives of their children.\n\n\u201cToo often, wealthy parents and grandparents pass down their money, whether a weekly allowance or a large inheritance, without taking care to pass down their values, their work ethic, passion, motivation and drive for success,\u201d said Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist at Kansas State University.\n\n\u201cValues drive behaviors,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is important to teach them the value of hard work, the benefits of being able to delay gratification, and how to be good stewards of their financial resources, through saving and charitable giving. Without passing along these values and skills, children are likely to mismanage and squander their inheritances.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the amount that you\u2019re leaving to your children that\u2019s so important; it\u2019s whether when they become adults will they understand that this money reflects your hard work and values.\n\n\u201cRegardless of the amount of money you have, helping your children learn the necessary skills to become good stewards of funds, which they earn or eventually inherit, is an essential life skill for them,\u201d said Tom Murphy, certified financial planner at Murphy & Sylvest in Dallas.\n\nTo help them become that, it\u2019s important to start educating them early about money. Murphy said 7 to 9 is generally the age range at which a child begins to understand the concept of money.\n\nTeach responsibility\n\nBob and Susan Murrill of Dallas opened bank accounts for their children, Justin, now 34, and Jennifer, 39, when they were teenagers so they could build up funds for certain purchases.\n\n\u201cThey saved a lot,\u201d said Bob, a retired attorney. \u201cIt was their money, and we allowed them to spend a certain amount of it as long as they kept a certain amount in savings.\u201d\n\nThe Murrills wanted their kids to learn how to make decisions and \u201cjudgments on the value of the dollar,\u201d Bob said.\n\n\u201cIf they bought something frivolously, it doesn\u2019t really have much consequence if it\u2019s a low-dollar amount. But the greater the dollar amount, the more of the consequence,\u201d he said.\n\nJustin and Jennifer learned from each other and their friends.\n\n\u201cOur daughter was the best teacher,\u201d Bob said. \u201cShe was so cheap she didn\u2019t want to spend money for much.\u201d\n\nAs your kids get older, give them more responsibility, said Shellee Henson, senior financial therapist at Dallas-based Financial Strategies Group.\n\n\u201cBy the time they get to high school, help them open a checking account, get a debit card,\u201d she said. \u201cGive them a credit card that they can use to put gas in their car. They may not pay the bill, but they\u2019re responsible for their charges.\u201d\n\nSet boundaries\n\n\u201cThe best outcomes for children, including financial, social and emotional, occur when parents provide high levels of both love and limits,\u201d Klontz said.\n\n\u201cLove without boundaries is harmful and creates spoiled, anxious and depressed children. In the same way, money and gifts without structure and limits can create financially irresponsible and dependent children.\u201d\n\nKlontz said parents should hold a tight rein over allowances.\n\n\u201cDo not give allowances without strings attached and then bemoan the fact that your children spend irresponsibly,\u201d he said. \u201cStructure allowances. The earlier, the better.\n\n\u201cFor example, have your children put their allowance money into three buckets: one for saving, one for spending and one for giving away to charity. This teaches children the value of delaying gratification and service for others, while allowing them to also enjoy reasonable spending.\u201d\n\nAllow for mistakes\n\n\u201cThe best way to teach them financial responsibility is to give them an allowance and give them freedom to spend the money as they choose,\u201d Henson said.\n\n\u201cBut one of the conditions also with it is, \u2018You buy birthday presents for the family, you buy your own Christmas or holiday gifts.\u2019 You give them reason to save some of it.\u201d\n\nInherent in this is the chance that your child may make a mistake and spend their money on something frivolous that they later come to regret.\n\n\u201cWhen the child wants to buy something, you say, \u2018Sure, you can buy it, but since that is not something you really need, you have to use your own money,\u2019\u201d Murphy said. \u201cTwo weeks or two days later, when the child is tired of the item and wants something else, the parent can say, \u2018Since you already spent your money, you will have to wait.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe child will quickly learn the lesson of prioritizing spending ... and will learn the deferred gratification skill you want him or her to master.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t bail them out\n\n\u201cYou help them strategize, but you don\u2019t bail them out,\u201d Henson said.\n\nIf you step in each time they get into financial trouble, she said, \u201cit teaches them that Mom and Dad will bail you out, so it doesn\u2019t really matter what you do because they\u2019ve got your back.\u201d\n\nConsider this example: You tell your son that the money is his to spend, but he must also use it to buy birthday and holiday gifts for family members. Now, his sister\u2019s birthday is approaching and he didn\u2019t save up the money to buy her a gift.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t step in and say, \u2018I\u2019ll give you some money to buy your sister a present,\u2019\u201d Henson said. \u201cYou let them figure out what to do so they experience the consequences of the decisions that they make, to really understand what the consequences are of not being responsible.\u201d\n\nProvide rewards\n\nWhen the Murrills\u2019 children saved money in their bank accounts, their parents matched their contributions.\n\n\u201cThat rewarded them for saving,\u201d Murrill said.\n\nHe and his wife did keep an eye on how their kids were spending their money.\n\n\u201cWe monitored what they were using their money for, not so much for control but to advise,\u201d Murrill said. \u201cThen we gave them an allocated amount before the school year and at Christmas to buy clothes so they could freely use that amount. But if they went over, then it was on their own nickel.\u201d\n\nToday, Justin and Jennifer have grown so financially adept that the Murrills are paying for them to see Murphy, their financial planner, and his partner, Susan Sylvest, each quarter.\n\n\u201cBeing a good steward of money, in essence, means making your money work for you,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cNever spend your principal on anything other than an income-producing asset. Live below your means. Prioritize to use your funds for those things which are really important to you and your family.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter:\n\n@pamelayip", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prepare your children to manage an inheritance by raising them to be good stewards of the assets you leave them.", "og": {"description": "Prepare your children to manage an inheritance by raising them to be good stewards of the assets you leave them.", "title": "Passing along your values as well as your money", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140725-passing-along-your-values-as-well-as-your-money.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140725-nb_19murrill2.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_19murrill2.jpg", "height": 455}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-07-26T02:40:06Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-07-26T02:05:54Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Passing along your values as well as your money\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140725-passing-along-your-values-as-well-as-your-money.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140725-nb_19murrill2.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NB_19murrill2.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1824918\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-07-26T02:05:54Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"PAMELA YIP\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140725-nb_19murrill2.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NB_19murrill2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-07-26T02:05:54Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03bc\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBeing a good steward of money, in essence, means making your money work for you,\u201d Murphy said.\nWithout passing along these values and skills, children are likely to mismanage and squander their inheritances.\u201dIt\u2019s not the amount that you\u2019re leaving to your children that\u2019s so important; it\u2019s whether when they become adults will they understand that this money reflects your hard work and values.\n\u201cDo not give allowances without strings attached and then bemoan the fact that your children spend irresponsibly,\u201d he said.\nIn short, you want to pass along your values, as well as your money.\nYou want to know what role money will play in the life of your children and the lives of their children."}
