They may even violate a Federal Election Commission regulation, Campaign Legal Center expert Paul S. Ryan explained to ThinkProgress.\n\nThe NRCC has set up these pages for various congressional opponents, including Amanda Renteria (CA), Martha Roberston (NY), Kyrsten Sinema (AZ), Ann Kirkpatrick (AZ), Alex Sink (FL), and John Tierney (MA). Each follow a similar format; they list the candidate\u2019s name \u201cfor Congress\u201d to ask for donations:\n\nAccording to Ryan, the websites appear to violate a Federal Election Commission regulation prohibiting political committees and parties from using a candidate\u2019s name in special projects. The FEC considers websites, including microsites, a special project falling under this rule. The only exception is when the site makes it unambiguously clear it is opposed to the candidate. In Ryan\u2019s opinion, the page set up under Tierney\u2019s name \u201cdoes not unambiguously show opposition to Tierney.\u201d However, he noted, the FEC is \u201cnot a nimble organization\u201d and it can take two years to complete an investigation, well past election day.\n\nRay Bellamy of Florida says he was tricked by the page and accidentally made a donation to the NRCC. \u201cIt looked legitimate and had a smiling face of Sink and all the trappings of a legitimate site,\u201d Bellamy told the Tampa Bay Times. The look-alike page uses the same colors as Florida candidate Alex Sink\u2019s campaign, with the URL sinkforcongress2014.com. Once entering information, the person is redirected to an NRCC thank-you page.\n\nWhen a number of mock sites cropped up last month, the NRCC defended its actions as perfectly legal. In the meantime, the NRCC has agreed to return Bellamy\u2019s donation.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "They may even violate a Federal Election Commission regulation.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "They may even violate a Federal Election Commission regulation.", "title": "Trick Websites Dupe Democrats Into Donating To Republicans", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/02/03/3242381/republicans-trick-voters-donating-democratic-candidates/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Capture1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They may even violate a Federal Election Commission regulation.", "creator": "@rebleber", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Capture1-321x214.jpg", "title": "Trick Websites Dupe Democrats Into Donating To Republicans", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Capture1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Capture1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-03T17:17:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7e5\"", "article_summary": "Justice Trick Websites Dupe Democrats Into Donating To Republicans CREDIT:The National Republican Congressional Committee has set up a number of websites that look like they could be a Democratic candidate\u2019s campaign page, unless you read the fine print.\nThey may even violate a Federal Election Commission regulation, Campaign Legal Center expert Paul S.
