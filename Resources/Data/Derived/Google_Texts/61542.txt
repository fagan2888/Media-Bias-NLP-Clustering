As many clients have seen their out-of-pocket health-related expenses rise with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, finding a tax-preferred method for funding those expenses has become more important than ever. The options, however, have expanded in recent years and the rules have grown more complexâ€”meaning that more clients may have difficulty determining which supplemental health account best suits their needs.

For a client who is lucky enough to have access to both a health savings account (HSA) and a health flexible spending account (FSA) to fund these expenses, expert advice as to the rules governing each type of account can prove critical to making sure each client makes the most of his or her health savings vehicle.
