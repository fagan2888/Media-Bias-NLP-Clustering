CHARLESTON, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation’s Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM program is awarding a grant of $191,028 to West Virginia Health Right, Inc. to support its SCALE program, which works to improve cardiovascular health in the community.

The SCALE program (Sustainable Changes and Lifestyle Enhancement) aims to help 50 obese patients achieve sustained weight loss to improve their health and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The program uses personal coaching, group support, nutritional education and improved diet coupled with exercise.

“We are extremely honored and grateful that the AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation has chosen to support West Virginia Health Right’s efforts to improve the cardiovascular health of our patients through weight loss,” said Dr. Angie Settle, executive director, West Virginia Health Right, Inc. “Our SCALE program provides an intense level of treatment that would not be possible without the Foundation’s commitment to improve cardiovascular health for the impoverished, uninsured and medically underserved.”

As a result of previous funding from the AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation, participants have shown improvement in blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), cholesterol levels, A1C levels, tobacco cessation and weight loss. Improvements were greater for those in the “motivated to change” group, and this group comprised nearly 400 of the more than 1,000 participants who were tracked during the most recent grant program year.

“The Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM program is designed with a mission to improve heart health in communities throughout the country,” said L. Kristin Newby, MD, MHS, AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation trustee. “West Virginia Health Right’s innovative program supports that mission by working to reduce cardiovascular disease at the local level.”

The Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM program annually awards grants to U.S.-based nonprofit organizations across the country. More than $2.6 million in grants to 13 organizations will be announced this year. More than $17 million in grants have been awarded through the program since its inception in 2010. In 2015, the Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM program will award grants from $150,000 to $180,000.

Organizations can learn more and apply online for a Connections for Cardiovascular HealthSM grant at www.astrazeneca-us.com/foundation. Applications must be submitted online no later than 5 p.m. EST on Feb. 26, 2015.
