In recent times, there has been a big push for social justice.

But one author is taking a closer look at this movement in his new book, What is Wrong with Social Justice?

Elgin L. Hushbeck, Jr.'s book discusses the good intentions of social justice as well as problems associated with government solutions to societal problems.

"When we pursue social justice, it is at the expense of true justice and in its pursuit of equality, social justice threatens liberty. It is a case of setting contradictory and incompatible goals," the book's description explains.

What happens when the pursuit of social justice takes a wrong turn? Is social justice truly just? Hushbeck answers these questions and more on CBN News.
