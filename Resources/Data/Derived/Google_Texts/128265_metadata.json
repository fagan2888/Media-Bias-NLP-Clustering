The girl told investigators she had spent most of the past five years confined to the basement of her family's home and was denied food despite begging to eat. She said her stepmother beat her and her stepbrother repeatedly forced her to perform sex acts on him.\n\nA jury Friday found the father guilty of reckless endangerment, intentional child abuse and causing mental harm to a child. But it found the Madison man not guilty of a charge of false imprisonment for allegedly keeping his daughter in a basement.\n\nIt was the second trial for the father of the girl, who is now 16. A separate jury in March convicted the father of felony child neglect but acquitted him of a misdemeanor neglect count. They deadlocked on four other charges, and prosecutors decided to retry him on those counts.\n\nThe 42-year-old father took the unusual step of testifying in his own defense during his second trial, saying his daughter suffered from severe behavioral problems and he did his best to get her help. He put her in the basement after a psychologist said she should live on a different level of the home from the rest of the family, he said.\n\nHe boarded up the windows so she wouldn't climb out and raid the neighbors' trash, he said. But he denied ever locking her in or withholding food, saying she simply refused to eat the meals he made for her and chose to dine on crumbs and garbage.\n\nThe trial began Nov. 12, and jurors began deliberating the case on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Father of starved Madison girl is convicted of child abuse", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/father-of-starved-madison-girl-is-convicted-of-child-abuse-b99149175z1-233142191.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Madison \u2014 A Wisconsin man accused of locking his teenage daughter in the basement and starving her down to 68 pounds was convicted Friday of child abuse and other charges, but was acquitted of false imprisonment.", "title": "Father of starved Madison girl is convicted of child abuse"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalsentinel", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Madison \u2014 A Wisconsin man accused of locking his teenage daughter in the basement and starving her down to 68 pounds was convicted Friday of child abuse and other charges, but was acquitted of false imprisonment.", "card": "summary", "title": "Father of starved Madison girl is convicted of child abuse"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3043\"", "article_summary": "A separate jury in March convicted the father of felony child neglect but acquitted him of a misdemeanor neglect count.\nA jury Friday found the father guilty of reckless endangerment, intentional child abuse and causing mental harm to a child.\nIt was the second trial for the father of the girl, who is now 16.\nBut it found the Madison man not guilty of a charge of false imprisonment for allegedly keeping his daughter in a basement.\nThe 42-year-old father took the unusual step of testifying in his own defense during his second trial, saying his daughter suffered from severe behavioral problems and he did his best to get her help."}
