The 13-year-old girl from an impoverished farming family in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh had no experience on a mountain prior to her ascent and completed eight months of rigorous training beforehand.\n\n\"It was very difficult. Every step is a dangerous step,\" Poorna told reporters on Wednesday. \"When I reached the top of Everest, very good experience. I feel great and proud, and I shed joyful tears.\"\n\nPoorna\u2019s climb was sponsored by the Andhra Pradesh Social Welfare Residential Educational Institution Society, a program that encourages and helps underprivileged children in India with achieving their goals, the Associated Press reported. The China Tibet Mountaineering Association in Lhasa verified Poorna\u2019s climbing and confirmed that she was the youngest girl to reach the top.\n\nBack in 2010, 13-year-old Jordan Romero from Big Bear, Calif., became the youngest boy to reach Mt. Everest\u2019s summit. At the age of 13 years and 10 months, Romero still remains the youngest person to ever reach the top over Poorna, who is 13 years and 11 months. Both climbers were forced to complete their hike from the mountain\u2019s southern side in China since the northern side in Tibet carries age restrictions.\n\nOn top of steep slopes, exposed rocks, and deep crevasses, Poorna had to deal with freezing temperatures that reached well below minus 40 degrees. She explained the fear she felt after coming across several dead bodies on her way to the top of the perilous mountain. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cOh my god I got some fear.\"\n\nAfter 26,000 feet, also known as the \u201cdeath zone,\u201d climbers run the risk of high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE) caused by an increase in blood flow to the brain as a part of the body\u2019s attempt to compensate for the lack of oxygen. HACE is a described as a malfunction in the brain caused by swelling that can turn fatal if not immediately treated. Symptoms include dizziness, confusion, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, hallucinations, and paralysis.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "youngest, girl, mt, everest", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 13-year-old from India, who became the youngest girl to reach the top of Mount Everest, was one month shy of becoming the youngest person to ever reach the summit \u2014 a record held by a boy.", "title": "She Climbed Mt.
