Bernie Sanders. She cited her history as \u201ca progressive who likes to gets things done.\u201d Sanders and others, she added, might be \u201cmissing the forest for the trees\u201d by aiming at big banks alone and not the more risky shadow banking system.\n\nClinton also proudly recalled that while serving as U.S. senator from New York she warned bankers early in the financial crisis about their dangerous practices.\n\n\u201cI went to Wall Street in December of 2007 \u2014 before the big crash that we had,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI basically said, \u2018Cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviors.\u2019 \"\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton\u2019s Tax Plan to Soak Investors Won\u2019t Work\n\nAn examination of her remarks to Wall Street in December 2007 and Clinton\u2019s actions as a senator \u2014 a period when she had the best opportunity to translate her words into deeds \u2014 presents a more mixed picture of her record on the banking industry.\n\nClinton steered a middle ground in a 28-minute address to business executives gathered at an office of the NASDAQ stock exchange in New York\u2019s Times Square on Dec. 5, 2007. In the event, she presented a detailed analysis of the burgeoning dangers in the housing market and its threat to the economy. (ProPublica obtained a video of the speech, which hasn\u2019t previously been posted.)\n\nClinton gave a shout-out to her \u201cwonderful donors\u201d in the audience, and asked the bankers to voluntarily suspend foreclosures and freeze interest rates on adjustable subprime mortgages. She praised Wall Street for its role in creating the nation\u2019s wealth, then added that \u201ctoo many American families are not sharing\u201d in that prosperity.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s an Economic Agenda for Hillary Clinton\n\nShe said the brewing economic troubles weren\u2019t mainly the fault of banks, \u201cnot by a long shot,\u201d but added they needed to shoulder responsibility for their role. While there was plenty of blame to go around for the spate of reckless lending, and while Wall Street may not have created the foreclosure crisis, it \u201ccertainly had a hand in making it worse\u201d and \u201cneeds to help us solve it.\u201d\n\nFinally, Clinton said, if the banks didn\u2019t take the voluntary steps she proposed, \u201cI will consider legislation to address the problem.\u201d\n\nThe lenders did not adopt Clinton\u2019s proposals. During 2007 and 2008, when the housing market collapsed and while she was also running for president, the Democrats controlled the Senate. Of the 140 bills Clinton introduced during that period, five were related to housing finance or foreclosures, according to congressional records. Only one of those five secured any co-sponsors. No Senate committee took action on any of them and they died without any further discussion.\n\nWhen a broad housing bill finally became law in 2008, Clinton was not among the more than dozen senators credited by party leaders as playing a key role.\n\nClinton also introduced a bill in 2008 to curb compensation of corporate executives. It too died without any co-sponsors.\n\nRelated: How the FBI Could Derail Hillary Clinton\u2019s Presidential Run\n\nIn dealing with Wall Street, Clinton faced the same challenge as any lawmaker representing New York, where the financial industry includes not only constituents but campaign donors. Wall Street executives were the largest donors to both her 2006 Senate re-election bid and her 2008 presidential race; employees of just eight banking firms gave $2.67 million to those campaigns, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit research group.\n\nClinton in 2007 publicly decried a tax break for hedge fund and private-equity executives \u2014 and continues to do so in her current campaign. But she didn\u2019t sign on as a supporter of a Senate bill that would have curbed the break.\n\nAs a senator, Clinton also had a brush with the shadow-banking world that she now describes as a continuing threat to the financial system. When AIG, the giant insurance company and poster child for lightly regulated finance, began to implode in September 2008, Clinton reached out to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was involved in talks to rescue the firm with government funds. Her little-noticed overture came on behalf of some wealthy investors who stood to lose millions and had hired two longtime associates of the Clintons to represent them.\n\nBrian Fallon, a spokesperson for the Clinton campaign, declined to comment for this story. The Clinton campaign has issued a fact sheet detailing her record with Wall Street as a senator.\n\n\u2018Doesn\u2019t Run Amok\u2019\n\nIn Iowa last month, Clinton underscored the difference between fiery speeches and results when she told Democrats, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just rail against Republicans or the billionaires.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Hillary Clinton\u2019s Plan to Fix the Economy Won\u2019t Get the Job Done\n\nDuring the debate she had called for stronger regulatory oversight of the financial system and addressed the theme of income inequality that has powered the campaign of Sanders, who identifies himself a democratic socialist. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to rein in the excesses of capitalism so it doesn\u2019t run amok and doesn\u2019t cause the kind of inequities that we\u2019re seeing in our economic system,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign referenced her Senate record in the fact sheet issued a few days before the debate titled, \u201cWall Street Should Work for Main Street.\u201d It cited one bill \u2014 the executive compensation legislation that died. It also mentioned four press releases or speeches from 2007 and 2008 \u2014 including a March 15, 2007, talk in which she proposed a series of housing initiatives and her call later that year for higher taxes on hedge fund executives.\n\nClinton had already hit the tax break in her new campaign. In April, during her first official appearance as a presidential candidate, she told students in a classroom for auto technology at an Iowa community college: \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower taxes than the nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here.\u201d\n\nHer aides then told reporters she was referring to the so-called carried-interest loophole, which taxes compensation earned by private equity partners and hedge fund managers at a lower rate than ordinary earned income.\n\nWhat they didn\u2019t say was that Clinton never signed onto the bipartisan June 2007 bill that would have curbed the break. Her rival for the nomination, then-Sen. Barack Obama, became a co-sponsor on July 12. The next day Clinton gave a campaign speech criticizing the tax provision. Yet she still didn\u2019t put her name to the legislation, according to records.\n\nDuring Clinton\u2019s first presidential campaign, her official campaign website gave short shrift to financial or housing matters. In April 2008, the section of the website called \u201cHillary on the Issues\u201d listed 14 topics; none involved housing, mortgages or Wall Street.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton Vows to Overturn the Law That\u2019s Raising Big Bucks for Her Campaign\n\nThe bills she introduced dealt with some of the issues she raised in her speeches \u2014 including one aimed at making it easier for homeowners facing foreclosure to get their loans modified \u2014 but none of them advanced, records show. The only co-sponsor who joined any of them was fellow New York Sen. Charles Schumer, who signed onto a bill that would have helped veterans refinance their mortgages. That bill also died in committee without any action taken.\n\nMeanwhile the Senate moved forward on other bills with wider support. They eventually led to a sweeping housing and mortgage law signed by President Bush in July 2008. That legislation was voted on three times in the Senate in 2008, in addition to a few procedural votes related to the bill. Clinton missed votes in February and April, when she was running for president, but also missed votes in late June, after she had dropped out of the contest. On July 26, when the bill passed, Clinton was there to vote in support.\n\nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, summarized the bill\u2019s journey and, in a floor speech, praised 13 other Senators for their help. Clinton\u2019s name wasn\u2019t among them.\n\n\u2018Closed Door Meetings\u2019\n\nAt the debate last month, Clinton said her campaign plan for Wall Street oversight was tougher than the one proposed by Sanders, in part because it would go beyond making sure banks aren\u2019t too big to fail. \u201cWe also have to worry about some of the other players \u2014 AIG, a big insurance company; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank. There\u2019s this whole area called shadow banking. That\u2019s where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from,\u201d she said.\n\nClinton didn\u2019t need an expert to tell her about AIG.\n\nOn Sept. 18, 2008, as the government grappled with collapsing markets, Clinton took to the Senate floor. \u201cAfter years of laissez-faire policies for the middle class, the Bush administration has acted on behalf of Wall Street, with the largest and most significant Federal interventions in the history of our modern financial system,\u201d she said. \u201cThe largest banks in the world could have closed-door meetings with the White House and the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to discuss their bailout options, but millions of homeowners with mortgages worth more than their homes, or who are facing default and foreclosure, don\u2019t have the same opportunity.\u201d\n\nA day before that speech, Clinton had quietly reached out to Paulson, Bush\u2019s Treasury secretary, on behalf of some wealthy investors in AIG. The giant insurer had made bad bets on the mortgage market, couldn\u2019t pay its debts and faced imminent collapse. Shareholders were poised to lose billions if the company went bankrupt or was taken over by the government.\n\nRelated: Where Hillary Stands on Taxes, Trade, Deficit, Wall Street\n\nA review of Paulson\u2019s calendars shows that he and Clinton talked on Sept. 17 and 20. In his book about the financial crisis, Paulson mentions just the first conversation, saying that Clinton called on behalf of Mickey Kantor, a lawyer, who represented a group interested in staving off AIG\u2019s imminent collapse. The group\u2019s investment banker, according to news accounts at the time, was Roger Altman. Kantor and Altman are long-time friends of Hillary Clinton and served as senior officials in her husband\u2019s administration. Altman headed a secret energy task force for Clinton when she was in the Senate.\n\nIn Paulson\u2019s account of his conversation with Clinton, Kantor represented a group of Middle East investors who were considering a bid for the insurer.\n\nPaulson quoted Clinton as saying the investors hoped to save the government from having to \u201cdo anything,\u201d but Paulson said he told her any private solution would have to guarantee AIG\u2019s billions of dollars in liabilities, a huge, if not impossible, hurdle.\n\nBut in an interview with ProPublica, Kantor said Paulson didn\u2019t have it quite right in the book. Kantor said he was working on behalf of \u201cmajor shareholders\u201d in AIG, not Middle East investors. The shareholders he represented owned about 30 percent of AIG\u2019s shares \u2014 one of them was Eli Broad, a Los Angeles billionaire, philanthropist and friend of the Clintons. Kantor said he couldn\u2019t remember whether he had sought Clinton\u2019s help but said it was possible given their 40-year friendship. Kantor said he hoped to persuade Treasury his clients could raise enough money to \u201cput the ship in order\u201d but by the time Paulson and Clinton talked the Federal Reserve had concluded a private rescue, at a cost of at least $75 billion, was not feasible.\n\nWith its stock in free fall, there was no private solution to AIG. The Treasury and the Fed feared that if AIG defaulted, the ripples might bring down the international banking system.\n\nRelated: Bush, Clinton Are Wall Street's Favorites, Donations Show\n\nBy Sept. 22, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was completing a rescue package that gave the government almost 80 percent of the company in return for a loan of $85 billion. As a result, private shareholders, including Kantor\u2019s clients, lost most of the value of their stock holdings. The U.S. eventually earned a profit of almost $23 billion on its investment.\n\nPaulson declined to comment, Altman did not return a phone call and a spokesperson for Broad and his foundation didn\u2019t respond to emails or phone calls.\n\nMore Bailouts\n\nThe most important action Clinton took related to the financial crisis may have been her vote in favor of the $700 billion bank stabilization plan, essentially a bailout of Wall Street. After a short but tumultuous debate, the Senate approved the Bush administration\u2019s plan, known as TARP, on Oct. 1, 2008. Nine Democratic senators, 15 Republicans and one independent (Sanders) voted no.\n\nClinton told the Senate during the debate:\n\n\u201cFor two years, I and others have called for action as wave after wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed against communities and the broader economy.\u201d She called for an end to the \u201cculture of recklessness in our financial markets endorsed by an ideology of indifference in Washington.\u201d\n\nThe next day Clinton spoke to a New York City radio host and expanded on her support for TARP.\n\n\u201cI think that the banks of New York and our other financial institutions are probably the biggest winners in this,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is one of the reasons why, at the end, despite my serious questions about it, I supported it.\u201d\n\nThis article was published originally at Pro Publica.
