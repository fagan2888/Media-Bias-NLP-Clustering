And that lets the green beans shine through.\n\nIngredients\n\nKosher salt\n\n1 pound green beans, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n\n1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil\n\n2 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped\n\n1-inch piece peeled fresh ginger root, finely chopped\n\n8 ounces lean ground pork\n\n1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, or more as needed\n\n1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce, or more as needed\n\nMethod\n\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Fill a mixing bowl with ice water.\n\nAdd the green beans to the pot. Cook for 6 minutes or until the vegetables are tender; drain, then immediately transfer the beans to the ice-water bath to cool for 5 minutes. Drain the beans and spread them out on a clean dish towel to dry.\n\nMeanwhile, heat the vegetable or peanut oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Once the oil shimmers, stir in the garlic and the ginger.\n\nReduce the heat to medium-low; cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 or 7 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to keep the garlic and ginger from browning.\n\nIncrease the heat to medium-high; stir in the ground pork to incorporate with the ginger and garlic, breaking up any clumps of meat. Lightly salt the mixture; cook, stirring every minute or so, for 6 to 8 minutes, until the meat is cooked through and lightly browned.\n\nAdd the cooked green beans, sesame oil and soy sauce, tossing to incorporate. Cook for 3 or 4 minutes, so the green beans are heated through.\n\nTaste; add sesame oil and/or soy sauce as needed. Makes 6 or 7 servings (5 cups). Serve warm or at room temperature.\n\nNutrition per serving (based on 7):\n\n--150 calories\n\n--10 g protein\n\n--5 g carbohydrates\n\n--11 g fat\n\n--3 g saturated fat\n\n--30 mg cholesterol\n\n--95 mg sodium\n\n--2 g dietary fiber\n\n--n0 g sugar\n\n\u2013Stephanie Witt Sedgwick, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/01/hfnourish28.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe141d\"", "article_summary": "Nutrition per serving (based on 7):--150 calories--10 g protein--5 g carbohydrates--11 g fat--3 g saturated fat--30 mg cholesterol--95 mg sodium--2 g dietary fiber--n0 g sugar\u2013Stephanie Witt Sedgwick, The Washington Post\nAnd that lets the green beans shine through.\nAdd the cooked green beans, sesame oil and soy sauce, tossing to incorporate.\nAdd the green beans to the pot.\nCook for 3 or 4 minutes, so the green beans are heated through."}
