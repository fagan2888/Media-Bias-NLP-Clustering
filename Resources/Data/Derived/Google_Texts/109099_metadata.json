Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., has proved one of the greatest exceptions, and now he's poised to defeated state Rep. Joe Carr and several lesser-known challengers in the Aug. 7 GOP primary.\n\nSo how did Alexander avoid the fate of many of his colleagues? \u201cI mean, on my letter head are most of the people who could run against me and most of the people who could manage a campaign against me, so I have that kind of support from the beginning,\u201d Alexander told CQ Roll Call in an interview in his Washington, D.C. office.\n\nThe Senator made clear he would seek re-election early on, and, in December 2012, announced support from Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam and the state's entire congressional delegation, barring scandal-tarred Rep. Scott DesJarlais. He also had the backing every living former Tennessee GOP chairman.\n\nAlexander also explained he raised formidable from the start of the cycle \u2014 a deterrent to any potential challengers. In April of 2013, for example, he raised $1 million, which he added to the $1 million he already had in his campaign coffers.\n\nIn the last two cycles, conservatives successfully ended the careers of Sen. Richard G. Lugar and Sen. Robert F. Bennett. They've so far failed to oust an incumbent senator this cycle, though Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., only narrowly won his party's nod in June.\n\nAlexander said he was careful not to repeat the mistakes of his former colleagues.\n\n\u201cI think those races where my colleagues were unsuccessful reminded me of what I already knew, which is when you run for re-election, you start over from scratch, and you work your way back up again,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t just step over from one term to another term.\u201d\n\nAlexander has also tended to his home state, unlike some of those now-former colleagues. The efforts appear to have served Alexander well: an internal poll released by his campaign last week showed him at 53 percent, 29 points ahead of Carr.\n\nBut the poll also showed another Alexander strength: His greatest support is in Eastern Tennessee, his home, also the part of the state that historically has the most Republican primary votes.\n\n\u201cOver the last 12 years I\u2019ve spent more nights in Tennessee than I have in Washington,\u201d Alexander said, sitting in his office amidst artifacts curated from the Museum of Appalachia. \u201cMost people who get in trouble in politics usually get in trouble because they\u2019re disconnected from the people they serve, and I don\u2019t think anybody in Tennessee, even people who won\u2019t vote for me, would accuse me of that.\u201d\n\nConservative groups aren't helping Carr, either. According to figures from Open Secrets, only $256,000 in outside money has been spent against Alexander this cycle. Some of the bigger outside groups that often spend money in primaries declined to endorse Carr. Senate Conservatives Fund, for example, spent $45,900 on a radio ad attacking Alexander in August of 2013, but they have not endorsed any of his challengers, and have not spent money on the race since.\n\nCarr is counting on a late surge of momentum, which he told CQ Roll Call is \"clearly in our favor.\"\n\nBoth campaigns said they hope the race will look just like June 10 primary \u2014 but different contests. The Carr campaign is referring to Eric Cantor\u2019s stunning loss to the virtually unknown and underfunded Dave Brat. Alexander\u2019s camp looks to mirror Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s easy coast to victory.\n\nCarr, like Brat, has made his opposition to immigration overhaul the centerpiece of his campaign. He has the support of conservative talking heads Laura Ingraham and Mark Levin, who helped boost Brat\u2019s campaign. Ingraham came to Tennessee to hold a rally for Carr last week.\n\nAlso like Brat, Carr has very little money: He had just $169,000 to spend as of July 18, according to a report filed with the Federal Exchange Commission. Alexander was sitting on $2.2 million.\n\n\u201cThe number one issues is the crisis on our southern border,\u201d Carr told CQ Roll Call in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cAnd that is absolutely the number one issue.\u201d\n\nCarr attacks Alexander for voting for \u201camnesty,\u201d the derisive term used by opponents of the immigration overhaul bill that passed the Senate last year. Alexander was one of 14 Republicans to vote in favor of the bill last year.\n\nThe challenger accuses Alexander of straying from the ideals proclaimed in the Republican Party platform.\n\n\"He says one thing, and he does another,\" Carr said of Alexander.\n\nHe added: \u201cThere is no evidence in anyway from his voting record to suggest he\u2019s a conservative.\u201d\n\nAlexander, who did not once mention Carr\u2019s name during the 20-minute interview, said that the topic immigration \u201ccomes up more now,\u201d but said it was not the top issue. \u201cI\u2019ve heard more about Obamacare, jobs, debt, and schools,\u201d he said.\n\nBut as Carr supporters try to boost his momentum heading into election day, Alexander is shoring up his conservative credentials on the subject. Alexander made a last minute Wednesday trip back to Capitol Hill to take two votes, one of which was against a bill to provide emergency funding to deal with the huge numbers of children illegally crossing the border into the United States.\n\nAlexander had planned to stay in Tennessee and continue his bus tour around the state. But, he wrote on his Little Plaid Blog, which chronicles the trip, the funding plan was not \u201cserious.\u201d He also said he was back to vote for legislation that would overhaul the VA.\n\nThe race is rated Safe Republican by the Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call.\n\nRelated Stories: Lamar Alexander Still Up Big in Internal Primary Poll Scott DesJarlais' Re-Election Hopes Rise, Despite Abortion Scandal (Video) In Kansas, Conservatives Suffer From Mississippi Hangover 6 Reasons Senate Republicans Should Be Optimistic \u2014 and Concerned About Election Day Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives have poured millions into primary challenges to senators this cycle, even in races where chances of success were slim.", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "Conservatives have poured millions into primary challenges to senators this cycle, even in races where chances of success were slim.", "title": "How Lamar Alexander Staved Off His Primary Challenger", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/how-lamar-alexander-staved-off-his-primary-challenge", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/atr/alexander-032-070913-445x302.jpg", "type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2014-08-01T14:36:07Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "Conservatives have poured millions into primary challenges to senators this cycle, even in races where chances of success were slim.", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "Blog ID,Author,author,category,category,category,category,category,CQToday Topic,primaries,republicans,senate-2014,tenn-senate,tennessee,poli", "article": {"section": "home", "published_time": "2014-08-01T14:36:07Z", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T14:36:07Z"}, "twitter": {"description": "Conservatives have poured millions into primary challenges to senators this cycle, even in races where chances of success were slim.", "title": "How Lamar Alexander Staved Off His Primary Challenger", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/how-lamar-alexander-staved-off-his-primary-challenge", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.videos.rollcall.com/atr/alexander-032-070913-445x302.jpg"}, "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc503\"", "article_summary": "The Carr campaign is referring to Eric Cantor\u2019s stunning loss to the virtually unknown and underfunded Dave Brat.\nBut Sen.
