That turned him into a convicted felon, and though he\u2019s been on the right side of the law ever since, he still can\u2019t vote. On any job application, he must check the box next to \u201cHave you ever been convicted of a felony?\u201d\n\nAll this misery for growing a plant whose leaves the past three presidents admit having smoked.\n\nWe know this story because Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky keeps telling it. That a Southern Republican probably running for president is condemning such prosecutions as unfair speaks volumes on the collapsing support for the war on marijuana \u2014 part of the larger war on drugs.\n\nTwo states, Colorado and Washington, have already legalized recreational pot. And the Colorado Supreme Court has been considering a question no one would have dreamed of asking two decades ago: whether an employer may fire a worker for smoking pot.\n\nSo what do we do about the rest of the war \u2014 the war on heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and the other nastier stuff? The answer is legalize them, too.\n\n\u201cWhat is the benefit, what have we derived from this drug war that even begins to offset the horrors we inflict on ourselves via this policy?\u201d asks Dean Becker, a legalization advocate. He is editor of \u201cTo End the War on Drugs,\u201d a collection of politically diverse views published by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nOver the past 40 years, the war has put more than 45 million Americans under arrest and cost taxpayers $1 trillion. And what do we have to show for it? Drugs on the street are cheaper, more powerful and more abundant than ever.\n\nThe war has fueled gang wars in our cities and enriched the criminal foreign cartels. It has created a vile class system, turning millions of poor and working-class Americans into felons while largely turning a blind eye toward users of the same drugs in suburban cul-de-sacs.\n\nAnd again, it\u2019s all been for naught. This summer, counties circling Houston, where Becker lives, have seen eight busts of major marijuana- growing operations. Law enforcement just stumbled across them.\n\n\u201cThere are some indications they were run by Mexicans sent by the cartels,\u201d Becker, formerly a member of the U.S. Air Force security police, told me.\n\nAnd what does the arrest of a drug trafficker do? It creates more business for the other drug traffickers.\n\nAs the conservative economist Milton Friedman once put it, \u201cif you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel.\u201d\n\nWouldn\u2019t legalizing all drugs set off a new explosion of drug use? Good question. Undoubtedly, some would try drugs for the first time. But regulating the sale could limit the problems. Portugal decriminalized drugs in 2000 and saw little rise in use.\n\nBecker is not a big fan of small steps in easing the drug laws, though he thinks that\u2019s better than nothing. He wants full legalization.\n\nJust decriminalizing drugs \u2014 that is, not arresting people possessing them but keeping their sale illegal \u2014 does not take criminals out of the business.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Harrop: Beyond marijuana, legalize all drugs", "title": "Harrop: Beyond marijuana, legalize all drugs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/03/harrop-beyond-marijuana-legalize-all-drugs/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-03T12:36:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-03T12:36:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce09b\"", "article_summary": "Thirty years ago, a college kid in Kentucky was caught growing marijuana plants in his closet.\nThis summer, counties circling Houston, where Becker lives, have seen eight busts of major marijuana- growing operations.\nThat a Southern Republican probably running for president is condemning such prosecutions as unfair speaks volumes on the collapsing support for the war on marijuana \u2014 part of the larger war on drugs.\nSo what do we do about the rest of the war \u2014 the war on heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and the other nastier stuff?\nHe is editor of \u201cTo End the War on Drugs,\u201d a collection of politically diverse views published by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy."}
