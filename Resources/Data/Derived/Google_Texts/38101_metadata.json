I deal in the world as voters believe it is, not as I (or anyone else) thinks it should be. And, I'm far from the only one. In the wake of my piece yesterday, I got two e-mails from very senior Democratic campaign operatives. Here they are verbatim.\n\n\n\nPersonally, it would make me very sad to have a job that was more about explaining who was perceived to be right about important arguments than a job that's about trying to explain who is in fact right.\n\nBut an interesting issue this raises is whether it's really true that perception often trumps reality in campaign politics. My read of the literature is that it mostly doesn't work that way, at least not in big general elections. \"The fundamentals\"\u2014most of all the state of the economy\u2014tend to drive election outcomes. Not exactly because \"reality\" is what matters most. It doesn't make much sense for voters to say \"the economy's doing badly so I blame the president and so I'm also going to vote against state legislature candidates of the president's party,\" but that's how elections appear to work.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "Here's Chris Cillizza on the Congressional Budget Office and Obamacare: My job is to assess not the rightness of each argument but to deal in the real  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Here's Chris Cillizza on the Congressional Budget Office and Obamacare: My job is to assess not the rightness of each argument but to deal in the real  ...", "title": "Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act/465648093-representative-greg-walden-republican-of-oregon-and.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's Chris Cillizza on the Congressional Budget Office and Obamacare: My job is to assess not the rightness of each argument but to deal in the real  ...", "title": "Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act/465648093-representative-greg-walden-republican-of-oregon-and.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@mattyglesias", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-05T13:46:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?", "sailthru.headline": "Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act/465648093-representative-greg-walden-republican-of-oregon-and.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"221140205004\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-05T13:46:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Matthew Yglesias\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"politics\",\n    \"obamacare\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Does Perception Trump Reality in Politics?", "keywords": "public opinion, chris cillizza, obamacare perception, obamacare cbo report, obamacare 2014, obamacare election effect", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "public opinion, chris cillizza, obamacare perception, obamacare cbo report, obamacare 2014, obamacare election effect", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://www.Facebook.com/mattyglesias"}, "sailthru.description": "Here's Chris Cillizza on the Congressional Budget Office and Obamacare: My job is to assess not the rightness of each argument but to deal in the real  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2014/02/05/perception_reality_politics_and_the_affordable_care_act/465648093-representative-greg-walden-republican-of-oregon-and.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc3e0\"", "article_summary": "But an interesting issue this raises is whether it's really true that perception often trumps reality in campaign politics.\nI deal in the world as voters believe it is, not as I (or anyone else) thinks it should be.\nPhoto by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty ImagesHere's Chris Cillizza on the Congressional Budget Office and Obamacare:My job is to assess not the rightness of each argument but to deal in the real world of campaign politics in which perception often (if not always) trumps reality.\nMy read of the literature is that it mostly doesn't work that way, at least not in big general elections.\nPersonally, it would make me very sad to have a job that was more about explaining who was perceived to be right about important arguments than a job that's about trying to explain who is in fact right."}
