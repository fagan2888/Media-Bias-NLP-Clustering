An intoxicated woman who may have shocked herself on an electric fence designed to keep elephants away from humans at the Denver Zoo has been charged with trespassing.

Kelly Flynn, 21, was arrested Monday night after she apparently touched the electric fence after climbing a fence designed to keep people out of the newly constructed Elephant Passage.

“She did touch an electrical fence,” said Charlie Drennan, Denver fire spokesman.

In order to get to the electric fence, zoo visitors would have to first climb a fence built to keep people out of the sprawling elephant enclosure, said Tiffany Barnhart, Denver Zoo spokeswoman.

“We’re obviously very glad the animals were not out,” Barnhart said. “They were inside for the evening.”

The nationally accredited zoo meets the highest safety standards, but it can be hazardous if people disregard warnings and breach animal barriers, she said.

“These animals are still considered wild,” Barnhart said. “We haven’t had an incident like this before. I feel sorry for this person.”

Denver police were called five minutes before the zoo’s closing time at 9 p.m., Barnhart said. Flynn was taken to a Denver hospital following the mishap. Police and fire officials said she was intoxicated.

Barnhart said alcoholic drinks are served during zoo lights, including beer and a hot peppermint cocoa and spiced apple cider drinks with alcohol.

“You’d have to be working pretty hard at it to get drunk at the zoo,” Barnhart said.

It’s possible that she was drinking before she entered the zoo, she said.
