Politics aside, trying combat the spread of communism has never been easy and CIA agents did what was necessary to protect the United States.\n\nBut rest assured, Obama, who swept in to save the day, gave a most sincere apology to Argentina on behalf of the \"early dark days\" of the CIA and the United States.\n\n\"I believe we have a responsibility to confront the past with honesty and transparency,\u201d Obama said. \u201cA memorial like this speaks to the responsibilities that all of us have. We cannot forget the past, but when we find the courage to confront it, and we find the courage to change that past, that's when we build a better future.\"\n\n\"This park is a tribute to their memory but it's also a tribute to the bravery and tenacity of the parents and spouses, siblings and the children who love and remember them,\" Obama said during remarks at the memorial. \"Today, we also commemorate those who fought side-by-side with Argentinians for human rights.\"\n\nAccording to ABC News, Obama said the United States government would declassify U.S. military and intelligence documents related to the \"dirty war,\" at the request of Macri and human rights groups.\n\nI will leave it up to you to decide who Obama was referring to when he said, \"commemorate those who fought side-by-side with Argentinians for human rights.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Takes His Apology Tour to Argentina Over the CIA's \"Early Dark Days.\" .05/26/2016 11:14:56AM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Obama Takes His Apology Tour to Argentina Over the CIA's \"Early Dark Days.\"", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Obama Apologizes to Argentina for CIA's \"Early Dark Days\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/03/25/obama-apologizes-to-argentina-for-cias-early-dark-days-n2138824", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/24/18.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Obama Takes His Apology Tour to Argentina Over the CIA's \"Early Dark Days.\"", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Obama Apologizes to Argentina for CIA's \"Early Dark Days\"", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/03/25/obama-apologizes-to-argentina-for-cias-early-dark-days-n2138824", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/24/18.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Apologizes to Argentina for CIA's \"Early Dark Days\" , Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd49ad\"", "article_summary": "But rest assured, Obama, who swept in to save the day, gave a most sincere apology to Argentina on behalf of the \"early dark days\" of the CIA and the United States.\nI will leave it up to you to decide who Obama was referring to when he said, \"commemorate those who fought side-by-side with Argentinians for human rights.\"\n\"Today, we also commemorate those who fought side-by-side with Argentinians for human rights.\"\nPresident Obama was in Argentina on Thursday and made one of his patented 'American apologies' for actions that the Central Intelligence Agency took during Argentina's \"dirty war.\"\nAccording to ABC News, Obama said the United States government would declassify U.S. military and intelligence documents related to the \"dirty war,\" at the request of Macri and human rights groups."}
