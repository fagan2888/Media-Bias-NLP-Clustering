Mark Pryor, D-Ark., might not be \"booty poppin' in a headstand,\" but he did vote for Obamacare, and the Republican National Committee would like you to know \u2014 in seven web ads attacking 2014 Senate Democrats that seem to lift beats from B.o.B. featuring 2Chainz's song \"Headband.\"\n\nThe 40-second Web-only spots can be viewed here . They hit Pryor, along with Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Mark Udall of Colorado and Mark Warner of Virginia, all of whom are up for re-election in 2014.\n\n\"Out of work? It's tough out there,\" the ad reads, before splicing together clips on the health care law and a Congressional Budget Office report about its impacts on the job market (which, of course, lacks the context for what the report really said, because ... YOLO, it's 40 seconds).\n\nNow, here is the video for the B.o.B./2 Chainz jam. HOH should warn you that many of the lyrics are NSFW and there are quite a few scantily clad ladies featured throughout. But everything is sort of amazing when you think about the RNC's message against the seven vulnerable Democrats set to this beat.\n\n\"She broke it down started moving like Shakira/Like she do it in the mirror,\" a cleaner lyric reads.\n\nInsert \"Jeanne Shaheen\" for \"she\" and you've got a solid sequel for the next \"HeadBand\"-inspired RNC spot: \"Jeanne Shaheen's hips don't lie ... or do they?\"\n\nWhatever. Maybe the beats are different and the RNC added a \"little bitty ting .\"\n\n\"I can assure you we purchased this music and didn't steal anything,\" RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in an e-mail.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
