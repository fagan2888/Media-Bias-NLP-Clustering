You can\u2019t match him when it comes to burning through cash, and it\u2019s dangerous to try.\n\nThat\u2019s one puzzle with Clinton\u2019s proposal to let people of \u201ca certain age\u201d \u2014 say, \u201c55 or 50 and up\u201d \u2014 buy Medicare coverage instead of private insurance. This idea is not likely to win over anyone leaning toward Sanders, because he will always offer more.\n\nHis \u201cMedicare for all\u201d blueprint is extravagantly generous: It would cover everyone, not just those close to the current retirement age, and it would provide far more than what Medicare now offers.\n\nYou can do that when you assume that torrents of money will fall out of the sky to cover the expense. The bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget says that even with the gigantic tax increases Sanders would impose, his health care scheme would add at least $2.6 trillion to the federal debt over a decade. In a less rosy scenario, it could pile on $13.7 trillion \u2014 roughly as much as the entire current publicly held federal debt.\n\nClinton has been a relative model of budgetary sobriety. Oh, she doesn\u2019t mind spending: Her proposals would add an estimated $1.75 trillion in federal outlays by 2026. But she also intends to finance almost all of that sum with higher taxes and various savings measures.\n\nThe CRFB estimates her net addition to the debt would be just $200 billion over 10 years. Donald Trump, by the way, makes Sanders look like a penny-pincher: He would add between $10.7 trillion and $15.4 trillion.\n\nClintons\u2019 Medicare buy-in, the details of which have not been released (or possibly even figured out), may or may not follow her comparatively disciplined fiscal approach. There are two basic paths she could take.\n\nThe first is to charge these new enrollees the full cost of insuring them. In 2008, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that putting 62-to-64-year-olds on Medicare would add costs of about $7,600 per enrollee. Today, that would undoubtedly be larger.\n\nThe problem with option No. 1 is that it wouldn\u2019t be terribly enticing to the voters whose favor she seeks. Thanks to Obamacare, which Clinton has so often extolled, they can already get private insurance, with federal subsidies to help many of them pay the premiums.\n\nHer proposal implies that Obamacare is not the glittering success she claims. \u201cAren\u2019t the exchanges supposed to offer \u2018affordable\u2019 coverage to these same people?\u201d asks economist Joseph Antos of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \u201cWhat is the problem being addressed here?\u201d\n\nCharging full fare would make the Medicare buy-in a good deal only to those afflicted by more than the usual quota of ailments \u2014 because their health care expenses will usually exceed the standard premium. In that case, Medicare would lose money on them, and the taxpaying public would bear the burden.\n\nThat could be what Clinton has in mind \u2014 which brings us to option No. 2. As Sanders has demonstrated, it\u2019s easy to attract voters if you promise them lots of new benefits that will be paid for by someone else.\n\nGeorge W. Bush also chose this route when he pushed through a program to cover prescription drugs for Medicare patients. The premiums they have to pay cover just 15 percent of the cost.\n\nCome to think of it, Medicare itself rests on the same gimmick. The CRFB says the average male earner turning 65 today has paid in $70,000 in taxes for the program and will get $195,000 in benefits. For the average woman, the payback is even bigger \u2014 $227,000. That\u2019s one reason the Medicare trust fund is on track to run out of money by 2030.\n\nThis approach also happens to be the natural tendency of politicians. As president, Clinton would find it far easier to win public support and congressional cooperation if she doesn\u2019t insist on making the program fiscally self-sufficient.\n\nIf we know anything about American voters, it\u2019s that no matter how much they want something from Washington, they strongly prefer not to pay for it. Clinton probably won\u2019t ask them to.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Odessa American", "description": "Decades ago, the wealthy owner of the Washington Redskins lamented the free-spending ways of his head coach, George Allen: \u201cI gave George an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.\u201d Other owners knew there were ways to beat Allen, but outspending him was not one of them.", "title": "CHAPMAN: Clinton\u2019s flawed medicare plan", "url": "http://www.oaoa.com/editorial/columns/opinion_columnist/article_1ca87700-1c3d-11e6-bb0e-bf9b657a24a2.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/oaoa.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/e9/6e9dbaaa-e043-11e1-ab43-0019bb30f31a/5020913220227.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C360", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OdessaAmerican", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Decades ago, the wealthy owner of the Washington Redskins lamented the free-spending ways of his head coach, George Allen: \u201cI gave George an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.\u201d Other owners knew there were ways to beat Allen, but outspending him was not one of them.", "fb": {"app_id": 262976343803266}, "keywords": "stephen chapman,opinion_columnist", "google-site-verification": "C7e6nzDhqJTTTeUDX9X1Id7MX9Idah2bzp4dl3PyUdQ", "news_keywords": "stephen chapman,opinion_columnist"}, "article_summary": "The premiums they have to pay cover just 15 percent of the cost.\nIn 2008, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that putting 62-to-64-year-olds on Medicare would add costs of about $7,600 per enrollee.\nGeorge W.
