The Iraq War was won until, ignoring his own military advisors, he withdrew all troops, destabilized the Middle East and allowed ISIS to form. His \u201cagreement\u201d with Iran gave them everything they want while we got little back \u2014 not even three innocent American prisoners held there. Obama will have almost doubled the federal debt to $20 trillion and he repeatedly lied about Obamacare when he said \u201cyou can keep your doctor.\u201d\n\nAlso a joke: More Americans admire Hillary Clinton than Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai. Clinton is a compulsive liar. There\u2019s her lie about ducking sniper fire in Bosnia. Her lie about being named after Sir Edmund Hillary \u2014 who climbed Mt. Everest years after she was born. Her lie about making a killing in commodities trades thanks to reading the Wall Street Journal. Her lie \u2014 made directly to victims\u2019 relatives \u2014 that four Americans were killed because of a video made in California.\n\nAnd Trump is the second most admired American after Obama? Good luck, America! Manny Martin\n\nObama\u2019s accomplishments\n\nOssining, N.Y.: I wonder where Voicer Richard Doll, who says President Obama is in \u201cover his head,\u201d has been living over the past seven years. Obama has outperformed both Presidents Bush and Reagan under far more difficult circumstances. He entered office while 700,000 people a month were losing their jobs. He created 12 million jobs, made the U.S. the world\u2019s leading energy producer, cut the deficit by two thirds, gave 17 million more people access to health insurance, returned 100,000 troops from the Middle East, forced Muslim countries to confront the threat of radicals, forced Iran to give up its bomb-making fissionable material and brought together 195 nations to combat climate change. All this while facing unrelenting GOP opposition. Doll should take his head out of the ground. Robert Rundbaken\n\nTrump\u2019s immigrant problem\n\nJamaica: We should all remember that Donald Trump\u2019s mother was a Scottish immigrant and his paternal grandparents were German immigrants. And that he has had two wives who were not born in the United States. Ivana Zelnickova is from the Czech Republic and Melania Knauss is a native of Slovenia. Should we send his ex- and current wives back to their countries? Why does he have a problem with immigrants? Shame on him! Charlene Black\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a cookbook!\u2019\n\nMonmouth Beach, N.J.: I\u2019ve been reading your paper for 30 years and have seen it go from a newsworthy source of information to a slanted, back-tracking left-wing rag. The last time I looked, we live in a free country and can like and support whomever we choose. I am not a fan of Tom Brady, but where do you get the balls to tell him whom to like or dislike? It\u2019s none of your business. And by the way, Donald Trump is no bigot. You people are just like all the other radicals: twisting the truth and hearing only what you want to hear. This country is in trouble because of the bleeding-heart liberals who run it. You should watch \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d episode \u201cTo Serve Man.\u201d Maybe that will wake you out of your stupor. Lucie Chimel\n\nBottom line\n\nEast Brunswick, N.J.: I have a question for everyone who cites Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers to defend him: Are these the same polls that had Mitt Romney winning in 2012? David Solomon\n\nLock up the real crooks\n\nManhattan: Voicer Valeria Kondratiev made Voicer Nick Enzminger\u2019s point for him: She says gang members can\u2019t be labeled conservatives because they\u2019d love to have liberal judges to go soft on them. Exactly. She\u2019s saying liberals are soft wimps, not violent criminals who commit crimes out of greed or ego. Liberals don\u2019t like expensive watches and cars. That nonsense is for conservatives with low self-esteem. We liberals support a maximum wage, because too much money is like a drug and it makes people go crazy. Most rich people are miserable, and sometimes more miserable because money just brings more headaches. It brings out the worst in people. I\u2019d add that it\u2019s insane for any grown adult to say Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who admits to hiding the sick video of a police murder \u2014 should resign. Prison is what will teach him, and the other crooked politicians, a real lesson. Firing these guys does no good. They just get a job with a big corporation, for millions a year. Prison is the only option. Janice Amato\n\nFrom reverend to cadet\n\nEast Brunswick, N.J.: Al Sharpton should go to the police academy and become a cop. He\u2019ll soon find out how hard it is to make split-second decisions. What\u2019s really disgraceful is people like him who don\u2019t pay their fines (remember Tawana Brawley?) or their taxes. Evelyn L. Williams\n\nA resolution\n\nManhattan: Although gun violence and traffic accidents remain the leading causes of death among young people, the most dangerous weapon for the rest of us is still our fork. Well over a million Americans are killed each year by high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer and other chronic diseases linked to our meat-based diets. But times are changing. According to Gallup, 22% of American consumers are avoiding meat and 12% are avoiding dairy products. Supermarket chains, along with Target and Walmart, now offer a growing selection of delicious and healthy plant-based \u201cmeats\u201d and dairy products. Hundreds of school, college, hospital and corporate cafeterias have embraced Meatless Mondays and vegan meals. Fast-food chains like Chipotle, Panera, Subway, Taco Bell and White Castle are rolling out vegan options. Let\u2019s make a New Year\u2019s resolution to explore the rich variety of plant-based entrees, meat substitutes, cheeses, ice creams and milks, as well as the more traditional green and yellow veggies. Nelson Yancy\n\nWhat\u2019s really wrong\n\nBronx: Voicer Arvin Anderson tells us he\u2019s 78 years old and has \u201cseen most of it,\u201d then lectures readers on \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with America.\u201d What Anderson proves is that a person can live 78 years without having learned a damned thing. Anderson also reveals that he is a progressive \u2014 and this is what\u2019s really wrong in America. Bob Pascarella\n\nTelling it like it is\n\nLittle Egg Harbor, N.J.: I can\u2019t stand to read Voice of the People lately, as so many people spew hate, prejudice and just plain garbage. For example, I am a 80-year-old lady, so I\u2019m going to be lambasted for telling it like it is. It\u2019s just that people of color are always complaining about how little work they get in entertainment and yet when they get the chance to be inclusive when they have a production, it always ends up all one color. Take \u201cThe Wiz\u201d \u2014 where even the Munchkins were black. And don\u2019t even ask about the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. Disney decided that all major parts were to be given to those with a British accent because apparently there are not enough good American actors out of work. Can you tell me what is going on with the way people think in this day and age? Who is the role model in this show business war? Rose S. Wilson\n\nMail mystery\n\nForest Hills: Between Christmas cards and regular correspondence, I have had more than 20 pieces of mail returned to my office in the last three weeks with a yellow sticker: \u201creturn to sender, not deliverable as addressed, unable to forward.\u201d I know I have the correct addresses because of previous correspondence, including emails, with the recipients. Are some (I know not all) letter carriers just too lazy to deliver mail, so they find it easier just to put the stickers on my envelopes? I should get a refund for every stamp wasted for a service I\u2019ve paid for but not received. Sherri Rosen\n\nFuture shock\n\nBrooklyn: Will hoverboards be insured? Regulated? Bikers and scooters frequently flaunt rules of the road, often causing accidents. What rights will pedestrians have when an accident with a hoverboard occurs? Technology is a wonderful thing , but there is more to think about before they are legalized on city streets. Dorothy Collins\n\nDon\u2019t stop believing\n\nStamford, Conn.: Finally Chicago is in (\u201cRock Hall of fame class with \u2018Attitude,\u2019 \u201d Dec. 18). It was a long time coming. Forty-eight years and still going strong. Aldo Vitti\n\nFirst things first\n\nBrooklyn: Two major problems in this city are violence against women and men who believe shooting guns is the best way to deal with their frustration, Of course, neither of these compares to the Yankees\u2019 need for an All-Star closer (\u201cHe\u2019s no pride of the Yanks,\u201d Dec. 29).
