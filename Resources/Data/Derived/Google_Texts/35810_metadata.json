Those with property and savings worth up to \u00a323,500 should have most of their bill paid by the council.\n\nBut councils only have to offer \u2018affordable\u2019 care home places. Any family that wants a better and more expensive care home for their relatives must pay a weekly top-up fee.\n\nAccording to industry estimates, local councils offer on average to pay \u00a3512 a week for a care home place.\n\nBut analysts Laing Buisson said the real cost of a care home place is between \u00a3554 and \u00a3625 a week, and between \u00a3591 and \u00a3662 for an elderly man or woman with dementia.\n\nThat means that top-ups, usually paid by the children of someone in a care home, can be between \u00a342 a week and \u00a3150 a week. They are paid by families of many of the 170,000 people in England whose care home bills are met by their council.\n\nThe Ombudsman\u2019s report said: \u2018We see cases where councils provide either confusing or incorrect information; do not offer potential residents and their families a genuine choice of affordable care home; or who do not have an affordable option at all.\u2019\n\nA report by the Local Government Ombudsman blamed councils for failing to give families enough information or choice about care home\n\nIt said that council social workers had a duty to provide families with full information in writing at the time they need it.\n\nThe report said: \u2018We have no legal power to force councils or care providers to follow our recommendations, but they almost always do.\u2019\n\nThe problem is highlighted by the case of David and Maureen Butcher. Their council in Bournemouth told them they would have to pay \u00a352 a week towards the \u00a3700-a-week cost of the home they had selected for Mr Butcher\u2019s mother Winnie when her worsening disability and dementia meant they could no longer look after her in their home.\n\nMr Butcher, 68, a retired Pentecostal minister, said he and his wife could not afford that.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Pay,care,home,fees,families,councils,told,Thousands,refunds,total,hundreds,pounds,week", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3248343/Pay-care-home-fees-families-councils-told-Thousands-refunds-total-hundreds-pounds-week.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Watchdog condemned the way families have been wrongly made to pay \u2018top-up fees\u2019 when they choose the care home they think is best for their elderly relative rather than the cheapest one offered.", "title": "Pay back care home 'top-up fees' to families councils are told", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3248343/Pay-care-home-fees-families-councils-told-Thousands-refunds-total-hundreds-pounds-week.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/25/00/0E150C4500000578-0-image-a-29_1443138685034.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3248343/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3248343/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3248343, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Pay,care,home,fees,families,councils,told,Thousands,refunds,total,hundreds,pounds,week", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-09-24T23:51:31.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Steve+Doughty,+Social+Affairs+Correspondent+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T00:12:17.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Pay care home fees families councils told Thousands refunds total hundreds pounds week"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Watchdog condemned the way families have been wrongly made to pay \u2018top-up fees\u2019 when they choose the care home they think is best for their elderly relative rather than the cheapest one offered.", "title": "Pay back care home 'top-up fees' to families councils are told", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3248343/Pay-care-home-fees-families-councils-told-Thousands-refunds-total-hundreds-pounds-week.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/25/00/0E150C4500000578-0-image-a-29_1443138685034.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Watchdog condemned the way families have been wrongly made to pay \u2018top-up fees\u2019 when they choose the care home they think is best for their elderly relative rather than the cheapest one offered."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc091\"", "article_summary": "According to industry estimates, local councils offer on average to pay \u00a3512 a week for a care home place.\nA report by the Local Government Ombudsman blamed councils for failing to give families enough information or choice about care homes, and for breaking the law to extract the top-up fees from them.\nAny family that wants a better and more expensive care home for their relatives must pay a weekly top-up fee.\nUnder the laws governing care home places, anyone with savings and assets of less than \u00a314,250 should have their bills paid by their local councils.\nIt condemned the way families have been wrongly made to pay \u2018top-up fees\u2019 when they choose the care home they think is best for their elderly relative rather than the cheapest one they are offered."}
