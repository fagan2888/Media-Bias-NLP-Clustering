Obamacare. Russia. The NSA. Wealth disparity. Immigration reform. Gun control. What do all of these hot issues for the 2016 election have in common? None of them matter because we\u2019re all going to die.\u201d Beitiks\u2019 platform is singular: Halt government action until climate change is addressed. While the San Franciscan native is certain this message won\u2019t get him elected, he\u2019s hopeful that his extremely narrow campaign will at least offer consolation to those who fear human extinction, if only by letting them know they\u2019re not alone.\n\nThe other day, I spoke with Beitiks \u2014 a licensed lawyer and father of two \u2014 about his first foray into politics.\n\nWhere did the campaign come from?\n\nI\u2019m pretty much just a regular person. I have a law degree and I\u2019m not completely unfamiliar with the political system. But, like many people, I have a certain level of unresolved anxiety about the climate crisis, and was not seeing any political reaction I found satisfactory, or even close to satisfactory. I just decided, well, if no one else is going to be the voice of reason, I\u2019m more than happy to do this.\n\nHow does one throw one\u2019s name into the ring?\n\nIt is initially as simple as just doing a website and reaching out to different media outlets. I am not officially registered with the Department of Elections yet. That\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t have to happen until you raise ten thousand dollars in campaign contributions. It is currently out of my fundraising budget.\n\nWhy are you making climate change your central \u2014 I guess, only \u2014 issue?\n\nIt is very clearly a huge problem that is not being put to rest in any meaningful way. It\u2019s being approached as something that will improve our quality of life, rather than what we\u2019re actually dealing with, which is something more akin to a wartime effort. And I don\u2019t want that to sound extremist, but there\u2019s a certain level of morality that can be removed from the situation. So much of politics is saturated with morality, talking about individual liberty \u2014 things I don\u2019t belittle in any sense \u2014 but I think the climate crisis is something as real as Pearl Harbor, and is being treated as debatable as something that\u2019s a matter of private morality. This is an issue of survival and fact-based rational action rather than a time for nuanced moral debate.\n\nYou say you don\u2019t want to sound extremist, but your website starts with \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die\u201d?\n\nThere is obviously a certain level of absurdity in the way I present myself. But I consider that to be an equal and opposite reaction to what I see as the absurdity of, for example, the Keystone XL pipeline debate \u2014 which, if you\u2019re really grasping climate change, and what\u2019s going on with fossil fuels and the downward spiral we\u2019re having, the absurdity of actively debating expanding our fossil fuel production in a way that would degrade the environment further, it\u2019s equally absurd.\n\nWe exist in a political climate where it\u2019s not okay to treat Americans as adults who understand responsibility. No politician is willing to look us all in the eye and say, \u201cHey, we\u2019re in bad shape. Let me tell you the truth and let\u2019s do what is necessary.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem like politicians are willing to impose tough love on their constituents. No one wants to be the guy who says, \u201cWe have to change our lifestyle dramatically, everything we\u2019re doing is not working out,\u201d because generally folks want to be re-elected.\n\nThis is, let\u2019s say, a two-part question. What\u2019s wrong with the general conversation about climate change? And if you do get elected, how would you change that?\n\nThe amount of kow-towing that happens with climate change deniers and the amount of time you spend politicizing an issue that is not a political issue is, obviously, a huge issue. My solution is using various political tools \u2014 \u2014 such as Senatorial holds and filibusters \u2014 to essentially stop politics until we deal with that. It sounds extreme \u2014 it is extreme \u2014 but that\u2019s my opinion of what\u2019s necessary.\n\nI would like to be the extreme voice on the other side. No one on the left is willing to be as extreme as climate deniers are, and I think that is a failure of the climate realist. Given that I have no desire to have a future in politics, I\u2019d be more than willing to torch my political career to do that.\n\nHow has the response been so far with your campaign? Has there been a response?\n\nIt\u2019s mostly Internet stuff at this point. I was on Reddit, albeit the humor section. I got a couple thousands hits off that, and a few dozen emails from concerned and excited Californians. Part of the absurdity in what I\u2019m trying to do with the website is that I think there\u2019s a large population of people who feel the way I do; what is absurd is that it\u2019s not okay to voice that concern. We are dealing with a very terrifying thing, and the fact that we\u2019re not admitting how terrifying it is is greatly inhibiting how we can realistically address it.\n\nI don\u2019t expect to win the election. I would love to \u2014 I would be more than happy to carry out as many of campaign promises as I can before they kick me out or I get assassinated. But my hope is to remind people who are ultimately going to be having this debate that there are people who feel as strongly about something as they do.\n\nI don\u2019t think climate change is a very distant and slow-moving process, and I want my campaign to attach immediacy to that problem. I use a lot of humor in my pitch because I feel like humor is immediate, humor is right now; you understand directly, you don\u2019t have to run any models. I would like to connect those two energies. The slow-moving terror and quick-moving laughter, basically. There\u2019s so much darkness around climate change. Most of us who are feeling the way I am \u2014 scared or like nothing\u2019s happening \u2014 it\u2019s a bad place to be, mentally and on a day-to-day operations level.\n\nWhat one person can do doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to help at all.\n\nThere\u2019s a certain freezing effect of global warming, for lack of a better\u2026 [laughs] it\u2019s such a weird language term there. But that\u2019s what it feels like. I talk about filibustering and doing what I can to shut down government until this gets addressed, but people don\u2019t change unless they\u2019re forced to change. You don\u2019t sweep your driveway if your neighbor\u2019s not sweeping his driveway. There\u2019s basic human psychology where, I\u2019m not going to do something that someone else is not required to do. A lot of it comes down to individual liberty and what people want to believe, and I\u2019m a full supporter of individual liberty, but there\u2019s a lack of social responsibility when it comes to climate change that I feel should be dealt with, even if it\u2019s some super under-qualified person as myself.\n\nAs afraid that people are of climate change, they\u2019re afraid of what they would have to give up to properly address it, and I am of the belief that there is nothing to be afraid of there. We have become attached to certain ways of life that are not only damaging, but much more unnecessary than we would lead ourselves to believe. I was in Ghana for over two years. I lived in a village that had no electricity, no running water, essentially no real vehicle access in and out of the town. I fear climate change; I do not fear an upheaval of the current level of American comfort. That\u2019s also not a popular opinion. Historically, things like that do work if you can sell it the right way \u2014 rationing for World War II, etc. Americans, or humans in general, are capable in paring down their consumption when persuasively presented with the facts of what needs to happen.\n\nIf this message resonates, what would be the next step for someone to do in regards to your campaign?\n\nYeah, this is as grass roots of a campaign as it gets. I would even say grass root, singular. So, just reach out to me, email me through the website. At this point I\u2019m just building people support, and if anyone wants to connect me to money support, that seems to be necessary for this game. But just contact me through the website. Or just share with other people, let other people know.\n\nLet\u2019s be real. I would be shocked if I got on the ballot. There\u2019s no one willing to put money in the political account of the guy whose platform is, let\u2019s slow the economy down. That\u2019s never going to happen. But don\u2019t be afraid to ask your Congressional or Senatorial candidates why they won\u2019t address it. Ask them what their plan is.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The campaign for U.S. Senate candidate Mike Beitiks begins with a message of comfort to his prospective constituents: \u201cISIS.
