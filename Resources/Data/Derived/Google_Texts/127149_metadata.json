(Justin Wan/Sioux City Journal via AP)\n\nAmid a flurry of legislation to pass in the final days of spring state legislative sessions last week, nurses won two more victories in a long war for independence.\n\nFor decades, most of the country has required physician oversight for nurses to conduct certain procedures, and especially to prescribe drugs. But that\u2019s slowly changing, as the nation\u2019s health-care needs rise, and nurses fight for the right to practice everything they learned in school.\n\nThe most recent wins came in West Virginia and Florida, where after many years of trying, lawmakers passed measures freeing up \u201cadvanced practice\u201d nurses \u2014 those with more graduate education than just a nursing degree \u2014 to administer a wider range of care and prescribe most drugs without having to maintain a relationship with a physician.\n\nFor Beth Baldwin, president of the West Virginia Nurses Association, the measure was aimed at meeting the needs of people who live in rural areas where the nearest physicians might be miles away \u2014 especially as the Affordable Care Act has expanded the pool of those with access to insurance.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s going to provide the care for that? If there\u2019s nowhere for them to take the card and get the care, it\u2019s not helpful,\u201d Baldwin says. In some places, when a doctor retires, another has to be brought in on a temporary basis to make sure patients can still get their medications. \u201cWe in no way feel that we\u2019ll be replacing physicians,\" Baldwin says. \"But physicians can be focusing on the people they need to see.\u201d\n\nPhysicians, whom the nurses call \u201corganized medicine,\" are the main people standing in the way of bills that expand the scope of what nurses are allowed to practice.\n\nThe battle to allow nurses to fulfill all the functions for which they were educated began back in the 1960s, when degree programs for nurse practitioners were created to extend care to people rural areas. A few states gave them early on what\u2019s known as \u201cfull practice authority,\" but many didn\u2019t, and little changed for decades.\n\nThe American Medical Association, the powerful doctors' trade group, has long opposed granting nurses the ability to prescribe drugs or set up their own primary care offices. They say that physician-led medical teams provide better integration and coordination.\n\n\u201cIndependent practice and team-based care take health care delivery in two very different directions,\u201d the Association said in a statement. \u201cOne approach would further compartmentalize and fragment healthcare delivery, while team-based care fosters greater integration and coordination.\u201d\n\nNurses, however, say that they can form their own teams if doctors aren\u2019t available, and refer patients out to specialized services if needed. That perspective was bolstered by a seminal report from the National Academies of Science in 2010, which recommended that states remove barriers to nurses practicing \u201cto the full extent of their education and training.\u201d In 2012, the National Governors Association agreed.\n\nMore states started moving in that direction after 2013. Twenty-one states plus the District of Columbia, including Maryland, now have laws establishing full practice authority for nurses. But especially in the South, it\u2019s been a tough slog; Virginia nurses must practice with a physician.\n\nIn West Virginia, nurses had tried to free themselves of a law that required \u201ccollaborative agreements\u201d with physicians for more than a decade. This year, however, they got some key backing: The Federal Trade Commission endorsed the bill in a staff comment noting that restrictions on their ability to operate without supervision hamper competition.\n\nThey also had political muscle. After years of sitting on the sidelines, AARP made the bill a top priority, arguing that freeing up nurses is essential to care for the state\u2019s aging population. The liberal West Virginia Citizen Action Group got involved. And Americans For Prosperity, the Koch-funded free markets organization, took up the cause as part of a broader push to wipe out barriers to entry in skilled fields.\n\n\"The stars aligned in West Virginia. We felt the political landscape was ripe for us to engage in this issue,\u201d says Gaylene Miller, AARP\u2019s West Virginia state director. The partnership with the conservative Americans For Prosperity helped proponents reach legislators across the political spectrum. \u201cWe utilized our relationships, and they utilized theirs,\u201d Miller says.\n\nIn the last days of the legislative session, however, the motley coalition didn\u2019t get everything it wanted. West Virginia\u2019s opioid-abuse epidemic had made lawmakers concerned that expanding the number of people who could prescribe drugs might worsen the problem, so the final version they passed maintained the prohibition on nurses dispensing Schedule II substances. That significantly confines their powers, says Janet Haebler, senior associate director for state government affairs at the American Nursing Association.\n\n\u201cI want to congratulate the state,\u201d Haebler says. \u201cAt the same time, this is not full practice authority, so it's a bit disappointing.\u201d\n\nOf course, the physicians weren\u2019t happy either. The local chapter of the AMA had maintained that West Virginia doesn\u2019t have a serious doctor shortage, and that nurses need to be supervised to prevent them from over-prescribing medications. But this year, the tide had turned.\n\n\"All we had was data, as well as a sincere concern for public health and safety,\u201d said West Virginia State Medical Association government affairs director Susan Baek. \"The bill that passed does not represent a compromise, and WVSMA feels that it will be detrimental to public health.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "More states are allowing nurses to provide all the kinds of care they learned about in school.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "More states are allowing nurses to provide all the kinds of care they learned about in school.", "title": "In a fight between nurses and doctors, the nurses are slowly winning", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/18/in-a-fight-between-nurses-and-doctors-the-nurses-are-slowly-winning/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2016-03-17/AP/Exchange-Nurse_Practitioner_-06cea.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/03/18/in-a-fight-between-nurses-and-doctors-the-nurses-are-slowly-winning/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "We felt the political landscape was ripe for us to engage in this issue,\u201d says Gaylene Miller, AARP\u2019s West Virginia state director.\nIn West Virginia, nurses had tried to free themselves of a law that required \u201ccollaborative agreements\u201d with physicians for more than a decade.\nBut especially in the South, it\u2019s been a tough slog; Virginia nurses must practice with a physician.\nBut that\u2019s slowly changing, as the nation\u2019s health-care needs rise, and nurses fight for the right to practice everything they learned in school.\n\"All we had was data, as well as a sincere concern for public health and safety,\u201d said West Virginia State Medical Association government affairs director Susan Baek."}
