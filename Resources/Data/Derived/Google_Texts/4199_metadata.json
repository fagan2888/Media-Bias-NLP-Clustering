But it turns out the tax collection agency only holds on to much of its own data for six months.\n\nThe agency\u2019s recent admission that it lost two years\u2019 worth of emails to and from a key figure in ongoing Congressional investigations raises serious questions about the agency\u2019s compliance with federal law.\n\nSeveral Congressional Committees as well as the Justice Department are looking into allegations that in the years prior to the 2012 election, the IRS purposefully delayed applications for tax exempt status coming from groups that appeared to be politically conservative.\n\nRelated: IRS Loses Lerner\u2019s Email, Capping Obama\u2019s Awful Week\n\nThe investigations have required the agency to turn over massive amounts of information, including the emails to and from Lois Lerner, the former head of the agency\u2019s Exempt Organizations Division. Last week, in communication with members of Congress, IRS officials claimed that some emails sent and received by Lerner between 2009 and 2011 were lost because her computer crashed in mid-2011.\n\nIn a document delivered to lawmakers, the agency revealed that it only retains back-up tapes of its email servers for six months before they are recycled. Further, it reported, individual employees are in charge of determining which of their own emails ought to be preserved as part of the public record.\n\nNaturally that raises the question of whether an employee engaged in wrongdoing would have the incentive to delete incriminating emails. But the policy also raises other concerns. Even when an employee does designate an email as an official record, the electronic copy is stored only on the individual employee\u2019s computer hard drive.\n\nThat means, according to the agency, \u201cAn electronic copy of the archived email would not be retained if an employee\u2019s hard drive is recycled, or if the hard drive crashes and cannot be recovered.\u201d To protect against this loss, the agency relies on employees to print every one of the archived emails and place them in a designated file.\n\nRelated: Budget Cuts and Mismanagement Boost IRS Tax Cheats\n\nIt also means that the agency has no means of searching across its entire system for archived material. According to the document delivered to Congress, the only way to find archived material is to individually examine each employee\u2019s computer. The IRS has 90,000 employees.\n\nThe agency was able to reproduce thousands of the lost emails by locating them on the computers of other IRS employees who had either sent or received them. However, that collection is necessarily incomplete, as the agency has no way of knowing how much email Lerner exchanged during the time in question with recipients outside the IRS.\n\nThe news that the agency had lost emails sent and received by one of its executives raised eyebrows in other sections of the government \u2013 specifically the National Archives and Records Administration, which is in charge of preserving and protecting federal records.\n\n\u201cThe National Archives and Records Administration was concerned to learn that the IRS has lost email due to a hard drive failure,\u201d a NARA spokesperson said via email. \u201cThe Office of the Chief Records Officer for the U.S. Government has contacted the IRS to explore specifics of the situation\u2026Managing records effectively ensures that permanently valuable records become part of the National Archives.\u201d\n\nFederal regulations require the heads of all government departments to \u201cestablish and maintain an active, continuing program for the economical and efficient management of the records of the agency\u201d that provides \u201ceffective controls over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records in the conduct of current business.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why the Cash-Strapped IRS Isn\u2019t Ready for Obamacare\n\nIn fact, the IRS\u2019s own Internal Revenue Manual has a section on Managing Electronic Records, which specifically states that \u201cIRS offices will not store the official recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages that are federal records ONLY on the electronic mail system\u201d unless it is specifically designed as a records retention device. Instead, employees must copy emails \u201cto recordkeeping system or produce a hard copy for recordkeeping purposes.\u201d\n\n(The IRS Manual was updated in March of this year, so it is impossible to tell from the web-based version what the specific rules were when Lerner\u2019s computer crashed in 2011. The IRS had not responded to a request for comment at the time this story was posted.)\n\nThe agency\u2019s letter to lawmakers noted that the IRS incurred direct costs of $10 million and other costs of between $6 and $8 million in its efforts to comply with the requests for Lerner\u2019s emails. Ironically, in an attachment to the letter outlining the agency\u2019s document retention policies, it says upgrading the agency\u2019s system to one that would \u201csave and store all email ever sent or received\u201d would cost \u201cwell over ten million dollars.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More than a few people thought that the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s claim that a single computer crash destroyed all records of Lois Lerner\u2019s email was fishy.
