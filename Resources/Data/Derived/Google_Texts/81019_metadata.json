But when pale sores erupted on his body and he lost sensation in his fingertips, a doctor issued the devastating diagnosis: Yadav had leprosy.\n\n\u201cWhat followed was like a nightmare,\u201d said Yadav, who has lived in Kasturba Gram, a leper colony outside New Delhi, since his diagnosis 30 years ago. \u201cI lost my job. My parents felt I would spoil my sisters\u2019 chances of getting married. My family felt it would be better if I left home.\u201d\n\nThe stigma of leprosy endures in India, even though the country has made great strides against the disease, which is neither highly contagious nor fatal. Now the number of new annual cases has risen slightly after years of steady decline, and medical experts say the enormous fear surrounding leprosy is hindering efforts to finally eliminate it.\n\nPeople continue to hide their diagnoses from families and loved ones out of fear they will be ostracized. Employers regularly turn away people who have had the disease, even if they\u2019ve been treated and cured. Many struggle to get driver\u2019s licenses and other routine documents. Even the disease-free children of leprosy patients are shunned.\n\n\u201cWe face a thousand indignities every day,\u201d said Neelawati Devi, a longtime resident of Kasturba Gram. Some 10,000 people live there, including the children of leprosy patients.\n\n\u201cOur children face taunts and slights when they go to school,\u201d said Devi, holding out her hands, the stubs of her fingers wrapped in gauze bandages. \u201cBut we want them to get an education and get jobs. Their future should not be ruined.\u201d\n\nPublic health centers across the country have launched campaigns describing leprosy as the world\u2019s \u201cleast contagious communicable disease.\u201d Health workers are trying to spread the word that leprosy is not hereditary and does not spread through normal contact.\n\nBut the deformities that are the hallmark of leprosy contribute to the fear surrounding the disease, a chronic bacterial infection that often lies dormant for years before attacking the body\u2019s nerves and slowly causing numbness. Hands and feet eventually claw inward and serious injuries often go unnoticed because no pain is felt. Often fingers and toes are lost due to injuries and sores. Scientists believe it is spread through droplets from coughing or sneezing during prolonged contact with someone infected, but they are still not completely sure.\n\nAlso called Hansen\u2019s disease, leprosy has been curable since the 1940s thanks to antibiotics, and the worst physical deformities can be avoided if it is caught in time. About 95 percent of people have a natural immunity.\n\nWorldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year as countries intensified efforts to fight the disease. In India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills mycobacterium leprae, the germ that causes leprosy.\n\nIn 2005, India declared victory, with health authorities reporting less than one case for every 10,000 people. But pockets of the country continue to have problems with leprosy, including in the central state of Chattisgarh, Maharashtra in western India and Bihar and West Bengal in the east.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stigma hinders efforts to combat leprosy in India", "author": "Nirmala George", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Stigma hinders efforts to combat leprosy in India", "title": "Stigma hinders efforts to combat leprosy in India", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/09/stigma_hinders_efforts_to_combat_leprosy_in_india/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/india-leprosy-enduring-stigma.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Stigma hinders efforts to combat leprosy in India", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/india-leprosy-enduring-stigma.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Stigma hinders efforts to combat leprosy in India", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Stigma hinders efforts to combat leprosy in India", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd5f\"", "article_summary": "Some 10,000 people live there, including the children of leprosy patients.\nEven the disease-free children of leprosy patients are shunned.\nAlso called Hansen\u2019s disease, leprosy has been curable since the 1940s thanks to antibiotics, and the worst physical deformities can be avoided if it is caught in time.\nWorldwide, the number of new leprosy patients dropped from around 10 million in 1991 to around 230,000 last year as countries intensified efforts to fight the disease.\nIn India, hospitals and clinics began treating patients with a combination of drugs that effectively kills mycobacterium leprae, the germ that causes leprosy."}
