Col. Allen West says the United States \u201cshould allow Israel to crush Hamas.\u201d\n\nAppearing on WMAL radio in Washington, D.C., West told co-host Brian Wilson and Larry O\u2019Connor, \u201cWe should sit down with \u2026 all those who understand that this move of radical Islamism in the Middle East has to be crushed.\u201d\n\nLeveling harsh criticism on President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, West questioned whether the world knows whose side we are on in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cHe has been an absolute catastrophe,\u201d West said with regard to Kerry. \u201cPresident Obama, I don\u2019t understand who he sides with. We have fled Libya because the \u2018militia and rebels\u2019 who we supported have now caused us to get out of Libya because they are Islamists,\u201d West continued. \u201cHe supported the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and now that General el-Sisi has gotten rid of the Muslim Brotherhood, he does not want to support Egypt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are on the wrong side in the Middle East,\u201d he concluded. \u201cIsrael sees it.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s criticism of the Obama administration didn\u2019t stop at their policies toward Israel. He turned his focus on our crumbling influence in Europe and Russia\u2019s continued aggression in that region.\n\n\u201cA person like Hillary Clinton should not be in the White House because she does not want to take leadership role,\u201d West said when speaking about the former secretary of state\u2019s presidential ambitions. \u201cMaybe she wants to give Vladimir Putin another little toy box with a red button on top of it and say \u2018hey, let\u2019s play reset again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to have someone like a Ronald Reagan to stand up at a Brandenburg Gate and say \u2018Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\u2019 because right now Vladimir Putin is attempting to rebuild it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Former congressman Lt.
