The most popular guy in Washington\n\nWhenever President Barack Obama is down, David Plouffe\u2019s name comes up.\n\nDemocrats have speculated that Plouffe would take over as Obama\u2019s chief of staff since the moment he left the White House in 2013. It flared up last fall during the botched rollout of HealthCare.gov.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAnd now, as Democrats agonize over losing the Senate in November and consider what a post-2014 White House would look like, Plouffe is once again on the mind as the likely successor to Chief of Staff Denis McDonough.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: To pick staff, Scalise turns to lobbyist)\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: McDonough isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nThe White House rarely comments on personnel rumors but took the unusual step Tuesday of rebutting the chatter with an on-the-record statement, one day after Plouffe dismissed the idea during a Playbook lunch.\n\n\u201cMy reading of Mr. Plouffe\u2019s comments to POLITICO is that he\u2019s not making plans to return to the White House as Chief of Staff \u2014 which makes sense because Mr. McDonough has no plans to leave,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in an email when asked to respond to the possibility.\n\nPlouffe\u2019s name keeps surfacing among Democrats inside and outside the White House because he seems like such an obvious choice to them.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Poll: Obama sinks on foreign policy)\n\nHe is essentially the backup quarterback for the West Wing \u2014 the guy who has pulled through for Obama in a pinch. He\u2019s an architect of the president\u2019s rise, a fierce protector of the Obama brand and one of his closest advisers on the outside who is regularly called upon to review major speeches, provide political advice and hash out strategy. As a campaign tactician, Plouffe could buck up the West Wing just as it enters what could be two years of combat with a Republican-controlled Congress. His return would signal that Obama doesn\u2019t have much hope for bipartisan deal making in the final two years.\n\n\u201cHe seems so logical,\u201d said one Democratic official with close ties to the White House who, like others, would speak only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of discussing personnel moves. \u201cHe\u2019s very plugged in with the operation, having served there before. It would be easy thing for him to go in there with a minimal amount of disruption.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, even to those who talk longingly about Plouffe taking over the top job, it\u2019s not inevitable.\n\nObama and McDonough have developed a very close working relationship. They can talk for up to an hour each weeknight before Obama heads off to the residence \u2014 far longer than previous chiefs of staff \u2014 engaging in philosophical discussions about the presidency as well as plotting how to head off troubles awaiting them the next morning. It\u2019s not certain either will want to make a change, even after a November drubbing.\n\nMcDonough maintains the respect and admiration of many in the West Wing after steering it through a difficult and sometimes depressing 18 months since the second inauguration. One reason the White House hasn\u2019t veered further off course, aides have said, is because of McDonough\u2019s regimented style and obsession to detail.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "As Democrats consider what a post-2014 White House would look like, Plouffe is on their minds.", "title": "The most popular guy in Washington", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/david-plouffe-barack-obama-109753.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/08/05/140805_olouffe_obama_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Obamacare,Elections,Denis McDonough,Politics,Affordable Care Act,David Plouffe", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "As Democrats consider what a post-2014 White House would look like, Plouffe is on their minds.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The most popular guy in WashingtonWhenever President Barack Obama is down, David Plouffe\u2019s name comes up.\nOne reason the White House hasn\u2019t veered further off course, aides have said, is because of McDonough\u2019s regimented style and obsession to detail.\nPlouffe\u2019s name keeps surfacing among Democrats inside and outside the White House because he seems like such an obvious choice to them.\n( Also on POLITICO: Poll: Obama sinks on foreign policy)He is essentially the backup quarterback for the West Wing \u2014 the guy who has pulled through for Obama in a pinch.\nDemocrats have speculated that Plouffe would take over as Obama\u2019s chief of staff since the moment he left the White House in 2013."}
