The $54 billion merger between rival health insurance giants Anthem and Cigna is under the regulatory microscope — and antitrust officials don’t like what they see, sources tell The Post.

Anthem and Cigna are the only two big American insurers serving people who are self-insured, and regulators are concerned that combining them could lead to higher prices, according to sources close to the Department of Justice’s review.

“I feel there is a very good chance Cigna gets blocked,” one source said.

Another source said there are “headwinds,” adding that it was too soon to say that the deal is in trouble.

In a worrisome sign, Cigna said earlier this month the deal may not be approved this year, even as Anthem insisted it was still on track to close in the second half of this year.

The merger needs approval from the Justice Department as well as state insurance regulators.

The DOJ has not been clear about the timing for completing its review but is likely to take at least a few more months, giving the companies time to win over regulators, sources said.

“We expect it to be a long, complicated review process,” Cigna said in a statement to The Post.

Anthem did not return calls. The DOJ declined to comment.

Anthem struck a deal in July to buy Cigna, becoming the latest big US health insurer to propose a blockbuster merger, along with Aetna’s pending purchase of Humana.

Cigna has 11 million self-insured customers, and Anthem a similar number. Obamacare is also prompting more employers to turn to less expensive self-insured company plans.

Anthem’s shares rose 1.5 percent to close at $135.73 on Friday. Cigna shares rose 2 percent, to $131.28.
