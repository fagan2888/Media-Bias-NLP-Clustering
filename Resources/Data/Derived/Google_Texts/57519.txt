Sioux Falls, SD

If you were looking for a good deal on a computer or a police car, the city's surplus auction is likely where you spent much of your Saturday.

The Street Maintenance Facility welcome hundreds of people looking to take part in the yearly auction of any items the city may collect over the year.

Video games, bicycles, office furniture and even some vehicles were given to the highest bidder.

The draw to an event like this is the good deals, especially considering the variety of items that are available to anyone that stops by.

The auction generally draws around 500 bidders each year with around $150,000 going back to the city from the sold items.
