Ben Dickinson, usually the magazine\u2019s \u201cbooks editor,\u201d started with flattery: \u201cWith her naughtily mussed blond bob framing her flashing dark blue eyes and perpetually glossed lips, Kelly is an almost self-parodically perfect apotheosis of her species, the FOX fox.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe's \"on top, and there to stay.\" But by the story\u2019s end, Dickinson turned his article into a little lecture on Fox News viewers are in despair because America is changing for the better/leftier:\n\nSoon, the crisis around the rollout of Obamacare inflamed Kelly\u2019s moral indignation and became her abiding preoccupation. And no one does outrage like Kelly: There\u2019s the icy stare. The trembling bob. The slow shake of the head. And the rhetorical eruptions\u2014Millions of insurance policies canceled! The president lied! The promise has fallen apart! Don\u2019t bother arguing that Obamacare was essentially invented by the right-wing Heritage Foundation and implemented in Massachusetts by none other than Mitt Romney. Never mind that liberals basically wanted Medicare for all. You\u2019re putting too fine a point on it\u2014Obamacare is killing the liberal dream, full stop!\n\n\n\nSo\u2014no, Virginia, Megyn Kelly is no liberal Trojan horse at FOX News Channel. Witness her misadventure into the Christmas Wars in mid-December, when she opined that Santa Claus \u201cjust is white\u201d and added the historically misinformed claim that \u201cJesus was a white man too.\u201d And notice that earlier Kelly attributed animosity to the old-school Republicans, not the Tea Partyers\u2014about whom she says, \u201cThere\u2019s something admirable about standing on principle in a town in which principle is sold out in a New York minute! I think the problem for them is that there has been such an organized attempt to marginalize them. They don\u2019t want to be painted with a racist or an extremist brush\u2014they just want to be heard.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne might object that you could say the same about the majority of American voters, who cast over a million more ballots for Democratic candidates than for Republicans but got a GOP-controlled House because of how its districts are carved up. But, at bottom, this is not a conversation about procedural democracy\u2014it\u2019s about communal allegiance and identity. And today, as Tea Partyers speak in ever more apocalyptic terms about the end of Freedom and the coming of godless socialism, their rhetoric is increasingly recognizable as a cry of despair: America really is changing, rapidly and irrevocably. And even liberals might conclude that although Megyn Kelly is clearly not on their side and is just beginning an epic, probably history-making run in broadcast news, it\u2019s going to be one helluva show.\n\nIn one of his complimients, Dickinson strangely compared Kelly to....George Clooney?\n\nThe earthy timbre of her voice\u2014she\u2019s almost incapable of sounding shrill, a great asset in her line of work\u2014and her direct, unpretentious manner of speaking summon to mind, of all people, George Clooney: In both of them you can hear the great, small-d democratic cadence of heartland America talking.\n\nThat's a nice compliment. But who listens to George Clooney talk politics and hears \"heartland America\"? From his lake house in Italy? Dickinson also let Brit Hume lay on the praise thick:\n\nFOX News Channel\u2019s Brit Hume couldn\u2019t understand why ABC\u2019s network-news organization \u201cwouldn\u2019t have snapped her up already\u2014but we were glad they hadn\u2019t. She\u2019s got this incredibly winning, girlish smile she breaks out in all the time,\u201d he says (after twice referring to her as \u201cimpossibly good-looking\u201d in a span of five minutes). \u201cAnd she can be just as tough as nails and bear down on people. I think she\u2019s got the strongest set of qualities of any woman in the news part of the medium in history.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NewsBusters", "description": "Fox News host Megyn Kelly is profiled in the latest edition of the women\u2019s magazine Elle.
