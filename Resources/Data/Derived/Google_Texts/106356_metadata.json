It exempts volunteer firefighters and emergency responders from counting toward an Affordable Care Act provision requiring small businesses over a certain size to provide employer-sponsored health insurance. The amendment extends unemployment insurance payments forward five months, as well as retroactively making payments that would have gone out to long-term unemployed since December, when the benefits expired.\n\nBut Speaker of the House John Boehner has indicated his unwillingness to bring the deal up in the House, citing complaints that the deal's provisions would place too-high burdens on the state agencies issuing the payments. He has also complained that the measure does not include job-creating measures.\n\nNevada Republican Dean Heller, one of the architects of the Senate deal, said he hopes he'll be able to appeal to the leader of House to change his mind.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told my staff: Get me a meeting with Speaker Boehner and let\u2019s see what we can do to motivate them to move this legislation,\" he said at a press conference last week.\n\nAnd at least some of Boehner's Republican colleagues say they support the bill.\n\n\u201cWe want it extended,\u201d said Rep. Peter King of New York, in a letter urging Boehner to move the measure forward. \u201cWe respectfully request that the House immediately consider this bill or a similar measure to restore unemployment benefits to struggling Americans.\"\n\nWashington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers, the head of the Republican Conference, said the caucus would decide what direction to take once the Senate vote was over.\n\n\u201cThere will be a conversation,\" she said. \"We\u2019re waiting to see what the Senate actually passes.\"\n\nSenate will pass #RenewUI tonight. Hope to build on bipartisan momentum & get it passed in House. Pls let House Reps know where you stand. \u2014 Senator Jack Reed (@SenJackReed) April 7, 2014\n\nProud to vote with other Senators on the passage of #RenewUI. Now, it's up to the House. pic.twitter.com/i0m1oQL7hH \u2014 Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) April 7, 2014", "article_metadata": {"description": "After months of negotiating, the Senate passed the bill containing a provision to renew unemployment insurance benefits to the long-term unemployed.", "og": {"site_name": "UPI", "description": "After months of negotiating, the Senate passed the bill containing a provision to renew unemployment insurance benefits to the long-term unemployed.", "title": "Senate passes bill containing unemployment insurance renewal", "url": "http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2014/04/07/Senate-passes-bill-containing-unemployment-insurance-renewal/8261396904715/", "image": "http://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/8261396904715/2014/2/c6064f4aad335cee7d103a01bf8407dd/v2.1/Senate-passes-bill-containing-unemployment-insurance-renewal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 130795020312660}, "keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Dean Heller, John Boehner, Richard Blumenthal, Nancy Pelosi", "google-site-verification": "vnkcuJA1Q89cLmy4OZpuQKOf5Jf6ny_RVh7BpxZ11a0", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Top Stories, U.S., Dean Heller, John Boehner, Richard Blumenthal, Nancy Pelosi"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8dd5\"", "article_summary": "The Senate's version is an amendment wrapped in a House bill.\nWASHINGTON, April 7 (UPI) -- After months of negotiating, the Senate passed the bill containing a provision to renew unemployment insurance benefits to the long-term unemployed on Monday.\n\u201cWe respectfully request that the House immediately consider this bill or a similar measure to restore unemployment benefits to struggling Americans.\"\nWashington Rep.
