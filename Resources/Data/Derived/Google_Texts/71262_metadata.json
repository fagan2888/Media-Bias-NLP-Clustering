The report shows that in spite of uncertainty about the full impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the medical office market has proven to be a more stable property type for tenants and investors during the recession and the recovery. Rents remain stable with tenant demand on the rise and the average vacancy rate is at its lowest level since the recession.\n\n\"The healthcare industry is going through an enormous transition period due to the ACA, advances in technology and the graying of our population,\" said Mary Beth Kuzmanovich, recently appointed as National Director, Healthcare Services for Colliers International. \"In the face of this, the demand for healthcare real estate is rising, especially for the properties that are best suited to meet sector-wide needs for lower-cost and more convenient locations.\"\n\nThe 2015 Medical Office Outlook Report covers the retailization of healthcare\u2014a response to consumer demand for convenient, flexible healthcare services\u2014which is causing providers to seek technology-friendly locations in ground-floor and second-floor urban retail spaces, mixed-use residential buildings and suburban shopping centers. Meanwhile, outdated medical office buildings not well-suited to patient convenience or provider technology needs are experiencing higher vacancy rates. This trend is also mirrored in the investment market, with the highest-quality assets being the most heavily pursued by investors.\n\nAdditional key findings from the report include:\n\nMedical office vacancy rates have dipped below 11 percent nationally and continue to decline, though older buildings have higher vacancies\n\nAbsorption continues to increase, with the highest demand for well-located, flexible spaces capable of handling rapid changes in technology\n\nBoth new supply and the amount of space under construction have been trending down since the recession and remained low in the first half of 2014\n\nRents have remained stable\n\nThe investment climate is very strong\n\nCapitalization rates continue to compress, though there is a wide spread between cap rates for investment-grade and below-investment-grade properties\n\nTo view Colliers International's 2015 Medical Office Outlook Report, visit http://www.colliers.com/en-us/us/insights/marketnews/2015-us-medical-report\n\nAbout Colliers International\n\nColliers International is a global leader in commercial real estate services, with over 15,800 professionals operating out of more than 485 offices in 63 countries.
