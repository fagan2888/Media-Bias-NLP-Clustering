Sanders dismissed the reporter, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t do ambush interviews,\u201d and ignored Watters despite his aggressive sarcastic questioning. During the attempted interview, Watters tossed out obnoxious questions like, \u201cAre you afraid of Hillary Clinton?\u201d and, \u201cO\u2019Reilly is a little concerned that if you do become President, you might seize his house. Should he be worried?\u201d\n\nBernie kept his eyes forward for the most part and ignored O\u2019Reilly\u2019s intentionally unpleasant interviewer until they bumped into each other and quickly blamed one another for the collision.\n\nDespite not getting the answers to any of his questions, Watters returned to the O\u2019Reilly Factor, where he and Bill laughed about the ordeal and speculated that Bernie doesn\u2019t visit Bill anymore because he\u2019s \u201cbig time\u201d and \u201cbeing a politician\u201d now that his poll numbers are surging in the Democratic race for President. After this stunt, it would be no surprise if Sanders doesn\u2019t appear on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show until after the 2016 election, if at all.\n\nWhen O\u2019Reilly\u2019s guerrilla methods didn\u2019t work, he thought it would be a good idea to call out celebrity Sanders endorsers, specifically Will Ferrell, to come on the show and argue, or as Bill put it, \u201cI\u2019ll debate you anytime, you pinhead.\u201d According to Salon, O\u2019Reilly has since backpedaled and softened his language, but still extends an open invitation to any celebrity to join him on the O\u2019Reilly Factor to debate their political views.\n\nOf celebrities who endorse political candidates, O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything. Do you think Will Ferrell knows anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he know what Bernie stands for? Does he know what Bernie wants?\u201d\n\nBill and his O\u2019Reilly Factor guests couldn\u2019t fathom that an actor would know anything about politics and instead assumed that famous people dabble in the political spotlight as a hobby, just to stay relevant. But Ferrell\u2019s showing of support for Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t his first experience in the political crosshairs of the right. In 2012, he reached out to voters on behalf of President Obama by recording an online video for his campaign for re-election. And last year, Ferrell showed his support of the Affordable Care Act, something O\u2019Reilly is staunchly opposed to, by posting a photo of himself on Facebook holding a sign with #GetCovered written on it. The intention was to reach out to those of his fan base who might be uninsured or underinsured to encourage them to sign up for an affordable plan. According to Advertising Age, the post was bombarded with thousands of comments, most of them rather uncomplimentary of the comedian.\n\nSo while Bill O\u2019Reilly and his supporters may think that celebrities are flexing their political muscle just to be trendy or staying the spotlight, many of them are deeply involved in political causes and are using their celebrity to reach out to demographics that may be missed by standard pundits like Bill. It\u2019s possible that O\u2019Reilly is frustrated that those who haven\u2019t been involved in politics their entire careers, like Bill has, are bending more ears and gaining more clout that the argumentative talk show host is.\n\nA question to ponder here is, \u201cIs Bill O\u2019Reilly being hypocritical?\u201d\n\nAfter all, he has recently and very successfully become an author of historically-focused books about the final days of John F. Kennedy, Adolph Hitler, Ronald Reagan, and Jesus Christ, among others. While O\u2019Reilly earned a history degree in 1971 from Marist College, his master\u2019s degree is in broadcast journalism. His bachelor\u2019s degree hardly makes Bill an expert in the subjects he\u2019s making millions writing about, so is Mr. O\u2019Reilly also speaking out of turn?\n\n[Image via Fox News and Entertainment Weekly]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill O'Reilly lashed out at celebrities like Will Ferrell for endorsing political candidates, claiming they don't know anything about politics.", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly lashed out at celebrities like Will Ferrell for endorsing political candidates, claiming they don\u2019t know anything about politics.", "title": "Bill O\u2019Reilly Can\u2019t Get Bernie Sanders On His Show So He Targets Famous Supporters Instead [Video]", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2445411/bill-oreilly-cant-get-bernie-sanders-on-his-show-so-he-targets-famous-supporters-instead-video/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/will_bill2-900x440.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-25T11:18:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T15:38:37+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/will_bill2-900x440.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-09-25T11:18:21+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "ambush,bernie sanders,bill o\\'reilly,foxnews,oreilly factor,will ferrell,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/will_bill2-900x440.jpg", "height": 440, "width": 900}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bill O\u2019Reilly lashed out at celebrities like Will Ferrell for endorsing political candidates, claiming they don\u2019t know anything about politics."}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "Fed up with getting the cold shoulder from Bernie Sanders, Bill O\u2019Reilly sent one of his reporters, Jesse Watters, from his Fox News show, The O\u2019Reilly Factor, to attempt an ambush interview earlier this month.\nBut Ferrell\u2019s showing of support for Bernie Sanders isn\u2019t his first experience in the political crosshairs of the right.\nAfter this stunt, it would be no surprise if Sanders doesn\u2019t appear on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show until after the 2016 election, if at all.\nSanders dismissed the reporter, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t do ambush interviews,\u201d and ignored Watters despite his aggressive sarcastic questioning.\nHis bachelor\u2019s degree hardly makes Bill an expert in the subjects he\u2019s making millions writing about, so is Mr. O\u2019Reilly also speaking out of turn?"}
