Employees of an Upstate special needs agency are accusing management of making threats, mismanaging money, and lacking leadership.

An emergency meeting on the grievances was held Tuesday night at Anderson County Library.

About 30 current employees and nearly a dozen former employees spoke out for two hours, citing serious problems with management at the Anderson County Special Needs Board.

The board is a public agency that helps people with disabilities and their families with both short-term needs and long-term goals.

Employees who attended the meeting said they've tried making formal complaints to management of the special needs board, but were retaliated against.

Grievances made during the meeting include claims of threats made by management to employees and mismanagement of funds.

One employee said some of the special needs clients they serve are unable to access their own money.

Several former employees of the special needs board said they were unfairly forced out of their jobs when new management took over in 2012.

Everyone who spoke Tuesday night agrees: The clients, those with special needs, are the real victims.

“There is no open policy now, and the consumers are the ones that are hurting the most. We are there for them. There are people with disabilities that cannot help themselves and that's why we are there for them,” said Cynthia Paul.

Two board members were at the meeting Tuesday. However, no one from management was there.
