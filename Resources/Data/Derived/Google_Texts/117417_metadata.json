But is he really?\n\nDuring the last GOP Debate, Kasich had his most memorable moment when he said something like, \u201cLook at me, dammit! Listen to how nicely I\u2019ve been speaking and interacting with all of the other Philistines on the stage. I\u2019m so much better than all of them, because I\u2019m NICE.\u201d\n\nWatch it for yourself.\n\nJohn Kasich\u2019s positive vision has launched his campaign forward. He showed that once again tonight. #GOPDebatehttps://t.co/tbS4BJFLeI\u2014 John Kasich (@JohnKasich) February 14, 2016\n\nKasich has been trying to convince voters that he is Mr. Nice Guy, and he\u2019s been pushing this narrative pretty hard, too. In a recent interview with Hugh Hewitt, Kasich referred to himself as \u201cthe prince of light and hope\u201d while likening his opponents to Satan. \u201cI don\u2019t spend all my time getting people riled up about how bad everything is,\u201d he told Hewitt. \u201cI acknowledge the challenges, but then I say, \u2018Look, come together, as Americans first; we can solve these problems.'\u201d\n\nKasich referred to himself as \u2018the prince of light and hope\u2019 while likening his opponents to Satan. When thanking a crowd of voters in New Hampshire after he placed a distant second behind Donald Trump in the primary, he claimed that his campaign has never gone negative. \u201cWe have had tens and tens of millions of dollars spent against us with negative advertising,\u201d he said. \u201cSee that\u2019s the old politics. We never went negative because we have more good to sell than to spend our time being critical of someone else.\u201d\n\nAnother aspect of Kasich\u2019s Pollyanna act is his tendency to invoke St. Peter to justify bad policy decisions, like circumventing the Republican-controlled legislature to implement Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion unilaterally. Here are two of his most obnoxious holier-than-thou moments:\n\n1. \u201cNow, when you die and get to the meeting with Saint Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor.\u201d\n\n2. \u201cWhen ya get to see St. Peter he\u2019s not gonna ask, \u2018Did you balance the budget?\u2019 He\u2019s going to say, whether he\u2019s Peter or whether he\u2019s Jacob, \u2018What\u2019d you do for the least of those?\u2019\u201d\n\nWe get it, Kasich. You think you\u2019re an altar boy. Here\u2019s where this gets complicated, and by complicated, I mean that his Mr. Nice Guy act is actually just a front.\n\nThe Kasich Campaign Is a Pack of Brooding Vipers Those who knew Kasich back in Ohio have said that his recent attempts to come across as a nice guy are just an act. The only reason people are buying it in places like New Hampshire is because they \u201cdon\u2019t know any better.\u201d And his team of advisers and consultants is subtweeting jerkwads. Here are a few gems from their respective timelines:\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see Mike Murphy dragging Jeb Bush\u2019s corpse across the SC landscape just because they have money to burn. #TimeToGiveItUp\u2014 Jai Chabria (@jchabria) February 14, 2016\n\nNot sure I\u2019ve ever seen someone list their mother and brother on a job application.\u2014 John Weaver (@JWGOP) February 16, 2016\n\nImagine a NASCAR driver mentally preparing for a race knowing one of the drivers will be drunk. That\u2019s what prepping for this debate is like\u2014 John Weaver (@JWGOP) July 27, 2015\n\nYeah, these are the people whose job it is to sell Kasich as a nice guy.\n\nThis looks pretty bad for Kasich and pokes holes in his Mr. Nice Guy street cred. Kasich has also been hitting Jeb! pretty aggressively lately. In a web ad the Kasich campaign rolled out three weeks ago, the video basically calls the former Florida governor a loser.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to Jeb?\u201d a voice asks in the ad. \u201cHe had the name, the money, the support. And yet a lukewarm message, weak debates, and sagging polls.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the ad, Kasich is heard saying, \u201cI\u2019m John Kasich, and I approved this message.\u201d\n\nHe has since tried to walk back the ad, claiming he didn\u2019t actually see or approve the ad before it was released. Kasich is either lying, which he is apt to do, or he is telling the truth. Either way, this looks pretty bad for Kasich and pokes holes in his Mr. Nice Guy street cred.\n\nYou Can Stop Yelling Now, Kasich In the most emblematic moment of his campaign so far, Kasich criticized Jeb! last week for being too negative. While at a pancake diner in South Carolina, Kasich smilingly chastised his opponent for not being nice enough, while telltale veins were protruding from his forehead and neck.\n\nThroughout his entire campaign, the proverbial veins in Kasich\u2019s forehead have been bulging as he screams and whines about his opponents while he hides behind his creepy grin. I can picture him nearly shouting these words while banging his fists on the table, upsetting a glass of orange juice or a little pitcher of maple syrup.\n\n\u201cJeb is spending all his time being negative,\u201d he said. \u201cHe needs to start being more positive. \u2026 I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. Does he realize the family legacy? Spending all your time being negative? But I don\u2019t have time for that.\u201d\n\nThose words are classic examples of Fake Nice Kasich. He gets flustered then substitutes what he actually wants to say about another candidate with a \u201cbut he isn\u2019t nice!\u201d line. In fact, throughout his entire campaign, the proverbial veins in Kasich\u2019s forehead have been bulging, as he screams and whines about his opponents while he hides behind his creepy grin.\n\nHe\u2019s even gone so far as to use biblical allegories to describe himself as a favorite of St. Peter while employing a pack of brooding vipers who are rolling out the kinds of attack ads he swears against. And then later he pretends that he had nothing to do with it.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 07:45:09 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Holy roller John Kasich likes to say he's such a nice guy.
