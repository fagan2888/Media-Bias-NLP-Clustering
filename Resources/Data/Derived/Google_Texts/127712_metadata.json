The 26-year-old was producing like the Rockies\u2019 second-best pitcher behind Jorge De La Rosa. But in his last six starts, Bettis is 3-2 with a 6.40 ERA.\n\nOn Saturday, Bettis held the Padres to two hits through five innings. And he worked through two quick outs in the sixth.\n\nBut then he walked two batters, gave up a two-run double to Matt Kemp and walked another.\n\nBettis after the game said he felt arm fatigue in the sixth.\n\n\u201cI got a little tired. I couldn\u2019t find the strike zone after we got two outs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Rockies earlier this season lost closer Adam Ottavino to Tommy John surgery after what seemed like a triceps injury turned out to be an elbow ligament tear. They also have Tyler Chatwood still recovering from Tommy John surgery last year.\n\nWith Bettis, the Rockies are playing cautious.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a concern when we talk about the elbow,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut it\u2019s real preliminary right now. We felt like either way he\u2019s going to need a little bit of a breather here. So right now we\u2019re calling it elbow inflammation.\u201d\n\nWith Butler now part of the rotation, the Rockies have just four healthy starters. David Hale remains out with a strained groin. But Colorado has a scheduled off-day Thursday and won\u2019t need a fifth starter until July 28.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chad Bettis suffers elbow injury, moved to Colorado Rockies DL", "title": "Chad Bettis suffers elbow injury, moved to Colorado Rockies DL", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/19/chad-bettis-suffers-elbow-injury-moved-to-colorado-rockies-dl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_013019_chad-bettis.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150719_013019_chad-bettis.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-19T13:34:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T14:24:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But in his last six starts, Bettis is 3-2 with a 6.40 ERA.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a concern when we talk about the elbow,\u201d Weiss said.\nThe Rockies moved the right-handed starter to the 15-day disabled list with elbow inflammation in his pitching arm.\nSo right now we\u2019re calling it elbow inflammation.\u201dWith Butler now part of the rotation, the Rockies have just four healthy starters.\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Chad Bettis hit a wall in Saturday\u2019s sixth inning \u2014 and on Sunday, it became apparent why."}
