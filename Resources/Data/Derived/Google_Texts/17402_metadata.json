It\u2019s the kettle calling. You\u2019re black.\n\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]\n\nBoehner\u2019s right in that the executive branch has been driving policy changes \u2013 even ones around the edges \u2013 and often using executive orders to do it. Obama is not the only president to do this, and it\u2019s understandable that Congress would be irked at not being made a part of the process.\n\nWhat rings hollow here is that Congress has aggressively chosen not to be part of the process. The 113th Congress is the least effective Congress in recent history, unable to get even basic budget and appropriations items, let alone a comprehensive immigration bill or entitlement reform. This Congress, and the House in particular, has made it a mission to oppose pretty much anything Obama wants to do (even, in some cases, where what Obama wants to do is not that dissimilar to what a lot of Republicans say they want). That\u2019s their right, but it\u2019s not rational for them to expect Obama to just sit by, throw up his hands and say, \"oh, well \u2013 I guess I just won\u2019t have any impact on the nation, even though I\u2019m president.\" (Though that would serve a Republican goal, too, giving them fodder to call Obama \u201cweak\u201d and \u201cineffective.\u201d)\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as though the legislative branch hasn\u2019t tried to flex its muscles and push around other branches of government . The House, in the past, has considered legislation that says, in the text, that the law cannot be subject to judicial review. Another bill would force another branch of government, the Supreme Court, to allow cameras in the room during oral arguments \u2013 something the high court doesn\u2019t want and sees as a legislative branch encroachment on its day-to-day workings.\n\n[READ: Should Boehner Sue Obama?]\n\nAnd is Obama really the only \u201ckinglike\u201d figure here? Mitt Romney, in the 2012 campaign, repeatedly pledged to undo Obamacare \u2013 a law written by Congress and passed by Congress \u2013 by executive order on his first day in office. Obama has been fiddling with enforcement and application of laws and regulations administered by the executive branch. Romney wanted to undo an entire law, just because it was approved by people who were duly elected by their constituents but with whom Romney does not agree. Rick Santorum, running in 2012, listed nine executive orders he planned to issue to undo laws of the land relating to abortion, stem cell research and gay marriage. He also pledged to call on Congress to abolish the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, a court whose rulings Santorum did not like.\n\nPower abhors a vacuum. And if Congress categorically refuses to participate in the law-making process, it can\u2019t expect other branches to follow suit. The Supreme Court has had a major role recently in public policy, especially issues such as gay marriage. It\u2019s not because nine justices are sitting in a room, wringing their collective hands in a menacing way while laughing evilly. It\u2019s because the legislative and executive branches have been unable to work together and recognize each other\u2019s authority.\n\nSo some in Congress think Obama is taking too much power in the way he does his job. Maybe if Congress would do its job, there would be no problem.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Boehner's Obama Lawsuit Is the Fault of the Do-Nothing Congress", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The do-nothing Congress is now taking exception to the president acting alone.", "title": "Congress Does Nothing But Sue Obama", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2014/06/26/boehners-obama-lawsuit-is-the-fault-of-the-do-nothing-congress", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/4f/1cb679ebe20f5cf587b32383303e25/726-67", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Boehner's Obama Lawsuit Is the Fault of the Do-Nothing Congress", "description": "The do-nothing Congress is now taking exception to the president acting alone.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "June 26, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,Congress,Boehner, John,Obama, Barack,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The do-nothing Congress is now taking exception to the president acting alone."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d81\"", "article_summary": "So some in Congress think Obama is taking too much power in the way he does his job.\nObama has been fiddling with enforcement and application of laws and regulations administered by the executive branch.\nObama is not the only president to do this, and it\u2019s understandable that Congress would be irked at not being made a part of the process.\n[SEE: Cartoons on President Obama]Boehner\u2019s right in that the executive branch has been driving policy changes \u2013 even ones around the edges \u2013 and often using executive orders to do it.\nMitt Romney, in the 2012 campaign, repeatedly pledged to undo Obamacare \u2013 a law written by Congress and passed by Congress \u2013 by executive order on his first day in office."}
