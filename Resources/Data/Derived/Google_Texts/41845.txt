CLEVELAND, Ohio - Free tax preparation services will be offered in Cuyahoga County through April for families and individuals who earn less than $53,267 annually.

Visit refund.ohio for more information. Appointments at 25 locations can be scheduled by dialing 2-1-1.

Tax returns will be prepared and e-filed by IRS-certified tax preparation volunteers, who will also help taxpayers verify if they qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Tax Credit, and/or other federal benefits.

Required documentation for tax preparation includes: Current photo identification, Social Security cards for each adult and child, W2 and 1099 income statements, child-care expense statement and provider's Tax I.D. Number, Form 1099-INT for any checking or savings accounts, and bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit.

If taxpayers bought health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, they should bring 1099 tax credit from the issuing health insurance company.

The service by the county and the Cuyahoga Earned Income Tax Credit Coalition, led by Enterprise Community Partners, helped more than 13,000 people last year.

The EITC Coalition offers free training to those who want to volunteer to be an IRS certified tax preparer.
