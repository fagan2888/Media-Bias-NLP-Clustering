The move comes after several months of protests nationwide by retail and fast-food workers demanding higher pay.\n\nThe protests have highlighted a long-standing national debate over who and what will raise living standards for the working poor. Steve Odland of the Committee for Economic Development \u2013 he\u2019s a former CEO of Office Depot and AutoZone \u2013 says that if low-margin companies like retailers and restaurants paid their workers more, company profits and stock prices would drop, undermining value for shareholders and creating problems in other parts of the economy.\n\nAnd David French of the National Retail Federation argues the focus should be on creating jobs, not raising the minimum wage. \u201cFrom a macroeconomic standpoint, the best solution for low wages is more jobs and more competition for fewer workers, which will increase wages,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you make creating jobs more expensive\u2026 employers will create fewer jobs.\u201d\n\nBut Paul Sonn of the National Employment Law Project (NELP), which favors increasing the minimum wage, contends history doesn\u2019t bear that out.\n\nRELATED: ARE FAST-FOOD WORKERS RIGHT ABOUT MINIMUM WAGE?\n\nJob creation and profitability at companies that employ low-wage workers have continued to grow even when the minimum wage has increased, he says. A NELP analysis of corporate data last July, showed 75 percent of the largest U.S. employers of minimum or near minimum-wage workers had higher revenues after the recession (either 2012 or 2011, depending on when the company\u2019s fiscal year ended) than before (2007 or 2008). That period also coincided with two minimum wage increases, one in July 2008 and the other in July 2009, to the current $7.25 an hour.\n\nBut Sonn wouldn\u2019t specify the level at which the minimum wage would start hurting the availability of jobs. \u201cNone of the increases that have been on the table have remotely approached the level that there\u2019s evidence of any harm,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether, theoretically, if you raised the minimum wage to $20 an hour, there would be different impacts \u2013 that\u2019s not a question in the real world.\u201d\n\nWhile those arguments may sound familiar, there are many nuances to the minimum wage debate and plenty of facts that are less well publicized.\n\nHere are six things you don\u2019t know \u2013 or forgot \u2013 about the minimum wage:\n\n1. The minimum wage\u2019s purchasing power has risen and fallen dramatically over time.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, the minimum wage is more than 80 percent higher than it was when it became law in 1938, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. It hit a peak of $10.34 an hour in today\u2019s dollars ($1.60 in real dollars) in 1968. But since then, its purchasing power has fallen 30 percent.\n\nRELATED: RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND GET MINIMUM JOBS\n\n2. The share of workers earning minimum wage has dropped sharply in the past 30 years.\n\nIn 1980 and 1981, at the beginning of what was then the worst recession since World War II, the proportion of workers earning minimum wage, or less, hit 15 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since then, that percentage has fallen to less than 5 percent. (The BLS excludes from its analysis the populations of the 19 states that have minimum wages higher than the federal rate.) There are actually slightly more people making less than minimum wage than making the minimum \u2013 the law exempts employees in certain industries, like workers on small farms, fishing operations, or seasonal amusement parks.\n\n3. Modest increases in the minimum wage raise prices, but not much.\n\nThe available research indicates that raising the minimum wage increases prices, though modestly. A 2007 study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that a 21-percent rise in the minimum wage during the late 1990s resulted in price increases at restaurants of .07 percent, or about $.02 on a $30 meal.\n\nAnd in 2006, two economists, on behalf of the liberal Center for American Progress, analyzed the impact of raising Arizona\u2019s minimum wage by 31 percent, from$5.15 to $6.75 an hour. They projected that to cover the wage increase, a clothing store would need to sell a $20 sweatshirt for $20.02, a restaurant would need to raise a $20 meal to $20.28, and a hotel would need to charge $100.80 for a room instead of $100.\n\nThe bigger disagreement among economists is whether the minimum wage affects job availability. A University of Chicago poll of 38 leading economists this February asked whether raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour would make it harder for low-skilled workers to find jobs. The panel split: 34 percent said yes, 32 percent no, and 24 percent were uncertain\n\n4. Those earning minimum wage tend to be young \u2013 but a lot of hourly workers aren\u2019t.\n\nThose who object to increasing the minimum wage point out that doing so doesn\u2019t target its benefits to working poor adults \u2013 most of those in minimum-wage jobs are young people in transitional jobs. A Heritage Foundation analysis of 2011 and 2012 Census data, for example, concluded that minimum wage workers ages 16\u221224 came from families with an average income of almost $66,000. (The BLS keeps no statistics on the family incomes of those working at minimum wage.) Still, a lot of older adults also work for the minimum: 49 percent of those at minimum wage are age 25 or older, while 18 percent are 45 or older, according to the BLS. They\u2019re often also primary wage earners for their families: An analysis in March by the Economic Policy Institute, which advocates a minimum-wage increase, calculated that those who would benefit from increasing the federal minimum earned, on average, half of their family\u2019s total income.\n\n5. Blue states don\u2019t necessarily have stronger minimum wage laws.\n\nOf the 27 states that went blue in the 2012 presidential election, 11 don\u2019t have minimum wages above the federal rate. Nineteen states have passed such laws, among those that have not are some Democratic bastions. They include New Jersey, which hasn\u2019t elected a Republican senator in 40 years; Maryland, where 56 percent of registered voters are Democrats; and Hawaii, where Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state Senate and House by 24\u22121 and 44\u22127 respectively. And on September 12, the mayor of Democratic stronghold Washington, D.C., vetoed a bill that would have raised the minimum wage for workers at large retailers to $12.50 an hour.\n\n6. Raising the minimum wage will get harder if inflation rises.\n\nParadoxically, raising the minimum wage might be hardest when inflation is high, since many policymakers believe wage growth puts upward pressure on prices. The inflation of the 1970s affected efforts to raise the minimum wage in those years, says Joseph Minarik of the Committee for Economic Development. Today\u2019s low-inflation economy makes arguments for boosting the federal rate a little easier, he says.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are many nuances to the minimum-wage debate in this country@@.
