Among the uninsured, lots of people know about the tax penalty for not buying insurance, but a full third have no idea that subsidies are available to reduce the cost of buying coverage. Here's what they're doing about it:\n\nBased on the survey results, as well as a review of research from a wide range of other sources (including those who have enrolled), Covered California has refined its comprehensive outreach campaign aimed at reaching the uninsured in their communities, through Navigator grants to community organizations; support for more than 18,000 Certified Insurance Agents; and promotion of storefronts where consumers can get free, confidential help enrolling. The outreach campaign will include a new television, radio, digital and outdoor advertising campaign to reach multi-segment, Hispanic, Asian and African-American audiences. Details about the campaign and television ads, the route of the \u201cSpotlight on Coverage\u201d bus tour and new dental coverage will be released next week.\n\nMeh. I have taken the liberty of creating a punchier campaign. Just running this up the ol' flagpole to see if anyone salutes, you understand. Of course, we'll need to rework the website too if we want to create a disruptive culture that appeals to people who like free money. And TV too. I'm thinking of a micro-targeting campaign that uses big data analytics to reach our SES demo, and impacts eyeballs with maximum penetration at minimal cost. And let's not forget social media either. Those guys love free stuff.
