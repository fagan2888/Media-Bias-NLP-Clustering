Before Sunday night\u2019s game, everyone thought the Broncos and Seahawks would have a close one and by the third quarter the Seahawks had so dominated the action, it became necessary to thumb through the rule book to see if pro football had a mercy rule. Traffic from Fort Lee, N.J., is more free-flowing than the Broncos offense. Who knows where the week will end up, but here are three questions worth noodling as it starts:\n\nJohn Dickerson John Dickerson is a Slate political columnist, the moderator of CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, and author of On Her Trail. Read his series on the presidency and on risk.\n\n\n\n1. Chris Christie: Does going on offense reinforce negative views of the governor? Monday at 7 p.m. Gov. Chris Christie will take to the airwaves for his regular \u201cAsk the Governor\u201d segment. Will he go after his critics in the forceful way his aides have or will he try to stay above the fray?\n\nDavid Wildstein was the Port Authority official who ordered the lane closings on the George Washington Bridge, so when he says he has a version of events that contradicts Christie, it creates tremors. But Wildstein\u2019s revelations could be damaging or they could be a bluff. We don\u2019t have any evidence yet. Even if we did, the charges he\u2019s apparently leveling don\u2019t go to the big political issue in the scandal: Whether Christie ordered the lane closures as political retribution or whether he knew about it. Wildstein is silent on this point. What he is saying is that he can contradict what Christie has said about the lane closures once they were under way. If there is a discrepancy, that could further damage the governor\u2019s credibility, but right now we wait and see. But Christie isn\u2019t waiting. His team put out an exfoliating attack against Wildstein on Saturday, questioning his motives and charging that he\u2019s simply trying to save his own hide. In questioning his character, they reached back to his high-school years. (So then why was he entrusted with the Port Authority job in the first place?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Christie posture since the scandal broke has been to focus on getting work done. There were a few caustic comments from his team about MSNBC\u2019s bias, which broke the story about the Hoboken mayor who says she was pressured to approve a development project, but that\u2019s it. This response to Wildstein is an escalation. If others come forward to protect themselves and receive the same pounding, the pattern of Christie throwing punches at former friends and allies could become politically damaging in itself\u2014particularly if Christie starts engaging in it himself. In attacking the character of former aides it raises questions about why people whose low character was obvious since high school were on your team. It also might convey the overall impression that when the governor is unhappy he goes after those that make him so. That\u2019s a risky impression to court when the larger question is whether the governor knew anything about an overreaction by his political team to a perceived slight.\n\n2. GOP infighting: How fast do we get to questioning motives? There are many dangers to inner-party fights\u2014they waste time, they draw attention from highlighting your opponent\u2019s flaws, and they often don\u2019t lead to productive legislative results. One of the big downsides is when combatants start questioning each other\u2019s motives. That takes a policy debate and turns it into a personal fight where people lock in and get emotional. The resulting attacks hand your opponents powerful sound bites they can use against you.\n\nThis is what happened during the government shutdown when Republican senators claimed Sen. Ted Cruz had \u201ctricked the grass roots\u201d to raise his profile for his presidential run. The charge was an insult to grass-roots conservatives, suggesting they were morons to be led around by the nose, and it was an attack on Cruz\u2019s character. When House Speaker John Boehner suggested grass-roots lobbying groups in Washington were fooling the rank and file over the Ryan-Murray budget just to raise money, it was a similar personal attack.\n\nSince then, the skirmishing on the right has been mild. The Ryan-Murray budget, the $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill, and the farm bill all passed the House without too much clubhouse fighting. (The ugly personal stuff has been left to Greta Van Susteren and Erick Erickson . ) Now comes the conservative conversation about immigration. The issue is so fraught that Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol and the editors of the National Review said Republicans shouldn\u2019t touch it for fear they will waste their energy fighting each other and not exploiting the weaknesses of Obamacare. We know it will be a heated debate, but will it be heated in a debilitating personal way that reignites the full fury of the personal war between the populists and establishment? Or, will the recent tactical restraint over budget fights prevail in an election year when Republicans have a shot at taking control of the Senate?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n3. Will Obama wimp out on trade? The administration is boasting about all the ways the president can take direct action to get around Republicans in the House. He\u2019ll do anything he can to get the economy going. He has both a pen and a phone. One thing he could do to help the economy is to fight for authority to make trade deals without congressional interference. It is within his power to do so and has little to do with congressional Republicans who support the idea. But he may not reach for the phone\u2014or at least he won\u2019t engage with the gusto he\u2019s putting toward far smaller items he outlined in the State of the Union. Trade promotion authority, sometimes known as \u201cfast-track,\u201d is the necessary requirement to finalize the trade discussions with Pacific Rim countries that are currently moving along briskly and the European trade deal that\u2019s in a far earlier stage of the process. The administration argues that both will give a real boost to the economy.\n\nTrade is always a tough issue for Democrats. Unions worry this will threaten their workers and environmentalists worry it will lead to greater damage to the planet. \u201cEveryone would be well advised just to not push this right now,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Some Democrats are making the argument similar to the one Republicans are on immigration: Let\u2019s not have this ugly fight in the party during an election year when we should be fighting with the other side. Perhaps, but the Obama administration has argued that these trade deals will help the economy, so the sooner the better. The question is: Will politics win out? U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough have been lobbying lawmakers, but lobbyists for business and politicians who support free trade in both parties are asking for more direct pressure from the president. Will Obama make the push? Given how comfortable Democrats are bucking him, would it matter if he did?\n\nI asked Obama's top economic adviser Jason Furman how important it was to have trade promotion authority pass in 2014 in order to achieve the best result with ongoing trade deals. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that as Ambassador Froman is negotiating with our partners that he can make it very clear to them that as we\u2019re asking for concessions from other countries that we\u2019re going to be able to deliver and implement those agreements in the United States and that's why it is important to strengthen our hand of our negotiator by having forward momentum,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "And the other stories to follow in the week to come.", "fb-share": "Will Christie Go After His Opponents Personally?", "sailthru.author": "John Dickerson", "description": "The start of any week in Washington is as unpredictable as a Super Bowl.
