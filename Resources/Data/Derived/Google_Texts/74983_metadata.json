Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, renewed on Thursday his call for Seymour to step down in a letter to acting Director Beth Cobert. Chaffetz cited a recent claim from OPM\u2019s inspector general that Seymour\u2019s office has withheld information from and deliberately deceived the auditors investigating the hacks and OPM\u2019s response.\n\nSeymour\u2019s first offense, the IG originally said in a recent letter to Cobert later forwarded to Chaffetz and the oversight committee, was shielding the auditors from the fact that personnel records had been breached for a full week. This prevented the IG from conducting oversight and coordinating with law enforcement agencies in a more timely fashion, said Patrick McFarland, OPM\u2019s IG.\n\nLater, during the investigation into the second breach of background investigation data, Seymour\u2019s office told the IG\u2019s office it could not attend meetings between the CIO, the FBI and the Homeland Security Department because the IG\u2019s presence would \u201cinterfere\u201d with their work. This violated federal statute, said McFarland, who eventually circumvented Seymour by going directly to the FBI and DHS to meet with them.\n\nFinally, Seymour reportedly did not inform the IG\u2019s office that it had begun a major overhaul of OPM\u2019s \u201cIT environment.\u201d It took one year for the IG to find out the full scope of the initiative, which prevented the auditors from identifying \u201cserious deficiencies and flaws\u201d in the project.\n\nExamples of Seymour providing incorrect and misleading information to the IG were redacted in documents made public by the oversight committee.\n\n\u201cIn the past, the OIG has had a positive relationship with the OCIO,\u201d McFarland wrote. \u201cAlthough the OIG may have identified problems within the OCIO\u2019s areas of responsibility, we all recognized that we were on the same team, and the OCIO would leverage our findings in an effort to bring much needed attention and resources to OPM\u2019s IT program. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case, and indeed, recent events make the OIG question whether the OCIO is acting in good faith.\u201d\n\nMcFarland originally sent his letter to Cobert on July 22, but -- at the behest of the acting director -- it was just sent to committee members this week. Chaffetz said there was no reason Seymour should still be at OPM.\n\n\u201cIt has been two weeks since the IG informed you of these serious transgressions and Ms. Seymour is still in a position of trust at the agency,\u201d Chaffetz wrote. \u201cMs. Seymour has already failed the American people with her inability to secure OPM\u2019s networks, and to learn that her office may be actively interfering with the work of the inspector general only adds insult to injury.\u201d\n\nChaffetz originally called for Seymour to resign on June 26 for her perceived failures in preventing the hacks. His letter was signed by 17 other House Republicans.\n\nCobert has already responded to McFarland\u2019s letter, an OPM spokesman said, defending Seymour for \u201cworking incredibly hard to enhance the security\u201d of OPM\u2019s networks. The spokesman noted Seymour has been a career civil servant for 37 years and has made significant improvements to OPM\u2019s IT infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThe recent results of the Cybersecurity Sprint demonstrate the progress that has been made, although everyone recognizes there is more to do,\u201d said Sam Schumach, the spokesman. \u201cSince Ms. Seymour\u2019s arrival at OPM in late 2013, OPM has undertaken an aggressive effort to upgrade the agency\u2019s cybersecurity posture, adding numerous tools and capabilities to its various legacy networks. These efforts were critical in helping OPM to identify the recent cybersecurity incidents.\u201d\n\nMcFarland said the IG\u2019s office will release a report on OPM\u2019s response to the hacks \u201cin a few weeks.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Eric Katz", "description": "Interfering with work of IG \\\"adds insult to injury,\\\" oversight committee chairman says.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Interfering with work of IG \\\"adds insult to injury,\\\" oversight committee chairman says.", "title": "Lawmaker Calls for More Heads to Roll at OPM Amid Alleged Interference With Hack Investigations", "url": "http://www.govexec.com/oversight/2015/08/lawmaker-calls-more-heads-roll-opm-amid-alleged-interference-hack-investigations/118938/", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/06/080615chaffetz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Interfering with work of IG \"adds insult to injury,\" oversight committee chairman says.", "creator": "@EricM_Katz", "image": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/06/080615chaffetz/open-graph.jpg", "title": "Lawmaker Calls for More Heads to Roll at OPM Amid Alleged Interference With Hack Investigations", "site": "@govexec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-06T20:19:51Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/06/080615chaffetz.jpg", "sailthru.title": "Lawmaker Calls for More Heads to Roll at OPM Amid Alleged Interference With Hack Investigations", "keywords": "opm, data breach, cybersecurity, inspectors general, personal data, opm data breach, opm hack, credit monitoring", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.govexec.com/media/img/upload/2015/08/06/080615chaffetz/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "cybersecurity,inspectors-general,personal-data,opm-data-breach,channel-oversight,type-story,length-medium,site-govexec", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/GovernmentExecutive"}, "sailthru.description": "Interfering with work of IG \"adds insult to injury,\" oversight committee chairman says."}, "article_summary": "This prevented the IG from conducting oversight and coordinating with law enforcement agencies in a more timely fashion, said Patrick McFarland, OPM\u2019s IG.\nCobert has already responded to McFarland\u2019s letter, an OPM spokesman said, defending Seymour for \u201cworking incredibly hard to enhance the security\u201d of OPM\u2019s networks.\nThese efforts were critical in helping OPM to identify the recent cybersecurity incidents.\u201dMcFarland said the IG\u2019s office will release a report on OPM\u2019s response to the hacks \u201cin a few weeks.\u201d\nExamples of Seymour providing incorrect and misleading information to the IG were redacted in documents made public by the oversight committee.\nChaffetz said there was no reason Seymour should still be at OPM."}
