As a result, these high-priced construction projects must be undertaken with both the present and the future in mind.\n\nBefore green lighting a project, hospital executives must confirm that new construction will address existing pressures, as well as attract and serve patients for decades to come. With that in mind, to what extent should evidence-based design and sustainability features factor into hospitals\u2019 new building plans?\n\nAs Sheila Bosch, director of research in the healthcare sector at planning and design firm Gresham, Smith and Partners, sees it, most health systems these days expect their design firms to have experience in both areas. While hospitals may at one time have considered sustainability features like green roofs to be too costly an upfront investment, they now see the advantages such designs offer. One example is the thermal performance of the roof system, \u201cto reduce the cost of facility operations,\u201d she said, not to mention improving patient views. \u201cAnd there is an extreme need amid healthcare reform to reduce costs and improve the patient experience,\u201d given the impact the Affordable Care Act is expected to have on hospital reimbursements.\n\n[See also: Maine hospital lowers costs by design.]\n\nConstructing facilities with an eye toward evidence-based design should also help lower the cost of care and improve its quality. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is figuring patient satisfaction scores into reimbursement metrics, and won\u2019t \u2013 for example \u2013 compensate institutions for care delivered to a patient who sustains an injury in a fall on-premises, or to patients who acquire certain infections while in the facility. One example of how smart design may contribute to meeting some of these challenges can be found in a replacement hospital that Gresham, Smith and Partners designed. The facility includes \u201cgrab bars\u201d on the wall leading from the bed to the toilet, and has seen an 80 percent reduction in falls after opening the replacement facility.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say for sure that the reduction in falls was solely because of the design,\u201d said Bosch. Factors such as individual patients\u2019 conditions and medication prescriptions also can influence results. But, \u201cwe know that the built environment matters. Now we just need to strengthen our knowledge base with additional rigorous, empirical research to better quantify the relationship between the built environment and the quality and safety of the care we provide.\u201d\n\nBuilding the knowledge base\n\nStudies pointing to the value of evidence-based design go back at least as far as 1984, with the publication of \u201cView Through A Window May Influence Recovery From Surgery,\u201d which demonstrated that patients who had rooms with natural views had shorter postoperative hospital stays and slightly lower scores for minor postsurgical complications than those who had wall views. But, says Bosch, \u201cwe need much more rigorous research to inform specific design recommendations.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to take the scientific evidence embedded in academic literature, the quality and safety data that exist in facility records, and the information held by staff and patients, and make it all more readily accessible to design professionals, facility managers, and healthcare leaders, said Rana Zadeh, co-director of Cornell\u2019s HealthDesign Innovations Lab. Zadeh is one of the authors of a study the Lab has underway, \u201cAn Economic Analysis of Healthcare Design Evidence-based Interventions,\u201d that will provide a practical framework to explain evidence-based design interventions and their related outcomes in financial terms.\n\nThe study\u2019s aim is \u201cto contribute to transparent and informed decision-making about up-front capital investment in healthcare facilities. Evidence-based design, and related research, contains invaluable information that was traditionally hidden and not accessible to healthcare decision-makers.\u201d Providing this information in financial terms, to effectively communicate both costs and benefits to these parties, will help them to invest smarter by incorporating the latest evidence.\n\n\u201cIn the near future, EBD will become an inseparable part of capital investment decision-making in healthcare facilities as it contributes to safety, liability, quality, and economic success,\u201d Zadeh said, with outcomes that range from improving staff retention, satisfaction, and performance, to reducing falls, infections, and errors, and increasing efficiency and usability.\n\nPrepping for the long-term\n\nExamining design and construction teams\u2019 proposed solutions in light of evidence-based design principals is important prior to beginning a construction project. In fact, it\u2019s just as important as continuously evaluating and improving the components of the healthcare environment in line with EBD goals in order to keep a facility cost-efficient and relevant into the future.\n\n\u201cAs designers of buildings with a 40-year lifespan, or a renovation cycle of every 15 years, we have to use evidence-based design to plan for that,\u201d said Rosalyn Cama, president and principal interior designer at professional design firm CAMA, Inc. and board of directors chair at The Center for Health Design. \u201cThe economic model has to go over the lifecycle of the investment.\u201d\n\nA hospital being planned today, for instance, should be designed to accommodate the senior citizen of tomorrow, in terms of their expectations around sustainable living and services delivery. It may be a little more expensive to make some forward-looking design changes \u2013 including embracing technology \u2013 that may matter to the patient of the future, but it\u2019s a must. \u201cAs these populations become more sophisticated and their expectations rise, you can\u2019t operate under old models anymore,\u201d Cama said.\n\nHospitals are thinking increasingly about these challenges and opportunities, she said. \u201cI am intrigued with how many hospitals have developed innovation departments,\u201d said Cama. \u201cFrom our perspective, evidence-based design is about improving the human experience in a complex building type.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/evidence-based-hospital-design-it-worth-big-investment", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Hospitals are one of the most expensive commercial structures to build or renovate.
