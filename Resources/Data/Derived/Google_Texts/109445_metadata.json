(J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nBALTIMORE \u2014 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dismissed portions of Bernie Sanders\u2019s agenda Wednesday, welcoming the Vermont senator\u2019s energetic support for his presidential bid but declaring that some of his deeply liberal ideas were unrealistic.\n\nKicking off a three-day retreat of House Democrats in her childhood home town, Pelosi said that the party\u2019s agenda would not include a call to raise taxes and would continue to embrace the Affordable Care Act that Democrats bitterly fought for in 2010. Pelosi\u2019s remarks came two days after Sanders, in an Iowa town-hall gathering, explicitly endorsed higher taxes to fund a sweeping revision of health laws.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not running on any platform of raising taxes,\u201d Pelosi told reporters inside the Hyatt Regency in Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor, less than a mile from her childhood home. While the liberal House leader has remained publicly neutral in the Democratic primary process, Pelosi\u2019s position echoed some of the themes that former secretary of state Hillary Clinton has hit on in trying to say that Sanders\u2019s ideas, while appealing to liberals\u2019 instincts, are out of touch in an era when Congress is so sharply divided.\n\nShe reiterated her previous remarks embracing Sanders\u2019s surge in recent weeks \u2014 \u201cGod bless all the people who have gotten enthusiastic\u201d \u2014 but stressed that Sanders needs to bring those voters into the Democratic fold in the November general election.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that Bernie Sanders is enlarging the universe of people who are paying attention to the election, and we hope that he will bring them to the polls in November to support the Democratic nominee,\u201d she said.\n\nPresident Obama will appear before the Democratic caucus Thursday night over dinner, following his own meeting with Sanders on Wednesday in the Oval Office. It was only the second time the two men have met one-on-one in the Oval Office. Vice President Biden will appear here in Baltimore for a Thursday luncheon meeting with the Democrats.\n\n[Read about the Obama-Sanders relationship]\n\nWith 188 seats, House Democrats gather here this week in their deepest minority standing since the late 1940s, with little hope being expressed by even the most optimistic of party leaders that they can win back the majority anytime soon. That\u2019s left most leading congressional Democrats concerned first with protecting the laws that were enacted in Obama\u2019s first years in office, when he had bulging Democratic majorities in both the House and Senate.\n\nClinton, in debates with Sanders and in speeches, has increasingly made her pitch to voters on that same theme, embracing Obama\u2019s legislative agenda and saying that she is best positioned to win a general election and, therefore, protect those policy gains. The critique of Sanders is that his ideas, including a Medicare-for-all policy for health care funded through large tax hikes, are out of the mainstream and might lead to a Democratic defeat in November.\n\nWithout commenting on how Sanders would fare in a general election, Pelosi said the health-care agenda ahead was protecting the ACA rather than pushing a bolder new health proposal.\n\n\u201cSo we have, I think, a very realistic plan that is out there. Can it be improved upon? Everything can. But it\u2019s no use having a conversation about something that\u2019s not going to happen. \u2026 Again, we\u2019re very proud of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe\u2019re not running on any platform of raising taxes,\" Pelosi told reporters. \"...
