He believes there remain pockets of traditional retail sales that will continue to do well.\n\n\"E-commerce is taking over the world, but here are two brick-and-mortar consumer companies that are insulated from it,\" Nelson said.\n\nLithia Motors Inc. (LAD, $116.66), Medford, Ore., sells new and used vehicles, provides parts and services, and offers related financing.\n\nMany potential buyers use the Internet to search for vehicles, but would prefer to buy them in person, Nelson said.\n\nLithia has 129 dealership locations in 14 states, mostly in the western half of the U.S., and one of the best management teams in the industry, he said.\n\n\"Management has really got its finger on the pulse of their business; they're quick to identify underperforming areas and fix them,\" Nelson said. \"I give management an A+.\"\n\nThe company has the potential to increase earnings per share at an annual rate of 15% or more over the next several years, he said. That's partly because a gradually improving economy is boosting auto sales.\n\nDrivers logging more miles because of low gas prices and an older fleet of cars on the road are helping parts and service businesses, Nelson said.\n\nAlso, Lithia operates in a fragmented industry where the top 10 auto dealers only have a 7% share of the market, he said.\n\nNelson says management has identified another 2,500 dealership locations it could potentially acquire.\n\nAnd legendary investor Warren Buffett's first auto dealership acquisition late last year adds credibility to the business and Lithia's strategy, he added.\n\nThe biggest risk is the possibility that the economy could contract again, hurting overall auto sales, Nelson said.\n\nBut Lithia just needs a benign, not a booming, environment to be successful, he said.\n\nThese shares have a 52-week range of $63.05 to $122.01. They could reach as high as $170 in the next 12 to 18 months, Nelson said.\n\nJack in the Box Inc. (JACK, $90.17), San Diego, Calif., operates and franchises Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants and Qdoba Mexican Grill fast-casual restaurants.\n\nRestaurants provide a consumer experience and convenience that can't be replicated by e-commerce, and the company had 2,249 Jack in the Box (1,838 franchised) and 659 Qdoba (339 franchised) restaurants as of July, Nelson said.\n\nTim Casey, who became Qdoba's president in 2013, has turned that part of the business around, driving growth in number of stores by about 13% a year, Nelson said.\n\nCasey's tactics \u2014 menu innovation, along with use of data analytics and more focus on social media \u2014 are being used at Jack in the Box to spur growth there as well, he said.\n\nOne of the most underappreciated parts of this story is the annuity-like income the company receives from renting store buildings to franchisees \u2014 a business line that provides 30% of its cash flows, Nelson said. Jack in the Box management is also aggressively buying back shares, spending $177 million for repurchases so far this year, he said.\n\nThe biggest risk here is competitive, particularly if McDonald's were to stop struggling and its bleeding market share weren't so up for grabs, Nelson said.\n\nOther risks include the possibility that the company's growing same-store sales might slide into the low single digits, or that gas prices would rise, potentially hurting traffic, he added.\n\nThese shares have a 52-week range of $55.14 to $99.99. They could reach as high as $140 in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nABOUT THIS\n\nThe Journal Sentinel focuses on one Wisconsin money manager or analyst in this weekly feature, looking at a trend that helps investment pros make their decisions.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Jack in the Box, Lithia worth look from investors", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/jack-in-the-box-lithia-worth-look-from-investors-b99541220z1-321134601.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Brick-and-mortar consumer companies Lithia and Jack in the Box are insulated from consumers shift to e-commerce, an investment officer says.", "title": "Jack in the Box, Lithia worth look from investors"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "description": "Brick-and-mortar consumer companies Lithia and Jack in the Box are insulated from consumers shift to e-commerce, an investment officer says.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary", "title": "Jack in the Box, Lithia worth look from investors"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe00fa\"", "article_summary": "Jack in the Box Inc.
