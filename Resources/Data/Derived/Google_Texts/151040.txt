The Nuggets are expected to sign free agent Marcus Williams, according to a source.

RealGM’s Shams Charania first reported news of any potential with Williams.

Williams, not to be confused with the former NBA veteran out of Connecticut, would sign as a training camp invite, meaning he will be among the few players fighting for the last two roster spots. The Nuggets can have 17 players on their roster during training camp and in the preseason, but only 15 can be under contract by opening night.

Denver already has 13 players on guaranteed deals, so Williams will join Jerrelle Benimon, Erick Green and Quincy Miller in a fight for for the final two spots.

A 6-foot-7 forward out of Arizona, Williams has played only 39 minutes in the NBA since the Spurs selected him with the No. 33 pick in the 2007 draft. The majority of that time has been with the Clippers, who signed him in March of 2008. Williams has also spent time in the NBA’s Development League, with the Austin Toros, and the Chinese Basketball Association, with Shanxi Zhongyu.

In January of 2013, Williams was suspended by the CBA for six games after testing positive for marijuana.

Williams played two years at Arizona, from 2005-07, starting 63 games and averaging 14.7 points and 5.6 rebounds per game.
