Bush, was the country\u2019s first openly gay presidential candidate from a major political party \u2013 and he was a Republican, which made his journey as a political anomaly a worthy watch. This month, Karger is back campaigning in New Hampshire, but now it's for a new film by John Fitzgerald Keitel. Called \"Fred,\" it's a documentary that details Karger's presidential run.\n\n\u201cI knew it was a long shot for me to be successful,\u201d Karger told Whispers. \u201cBut I was really hopeful that if I did run and did get some attention and word got out, that I would send a message to particularly young, LGBT people around the country.\u201d\n\nThe film shows some of the adversity Karger faced running as a Republican. In Iowa, for instance, the state\u2019s Republican National Committeeman Steve Scheffler sent Karger a letter alleging that he and \u201cthe radical homosexual community\u201d were harassing supporters of \u201cREAL marriage.\u201d Additionally, Scheffler threatened to ensure that Karger\u2019s campaign was \u201caborted right here in Iowa.\u201d\n\nBut that reaction to his candidacy was the exception, not the rule, Karger said.\n\n\u201cWe had a few problems with the Steve Schefflers of the world, but overall the Republican Party, particularly in New Hampshire and Iowa, where I spent most of my time, [was] as cordial and inclusive as I could have ever dreamed,\" Karger said.\n\n[READ: Rep. Lee Terry Makes Awkward Joke at GM Hearing]\n\nKarger actually got along great with former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who\u2019s practically famous for his anti-gay marriage stance. Karger found Santorum to be \u201cone of the nicest\u201d GOP hopefuls, even with their political differences. (Karger ran as a pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion rights, independent Republican.) \u201cAfter the campaign was over, I wanted to congratulate him on running a spectacular campaign, which he did, and he was just really completely surprised that I would compliment him,\" Karger said.\n\nKarger said former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, happily met with him. He became friends with the entire Jon Huntsman clan. (He even went to see daughter Mary Anne Huntsman play piano at Carnegie Hall in January.) And the Reince Priebus-led Republican National Committee gave Karger equal access to all the organization\u2019s research and the RNC\u2019s voter lists. \u201c[Priebus] insisted to his chief of staff that I be afforded every opportunity that every other candidate was,\u201d Karger recalled.\n\nAt the same time, Karger wasn\u2019t given a booth at the Conservative Political Action Conference. (Instead, Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson shared his booth with Karger.) He also was excluded from the Iowa Republican presidential debate \u2013 hosted by Fox News and the Washington Examiner \u2013 and every other debate thereafter.\n\n[ALSO: Al Franken, Cigars the Butts of Bill Clinton's Forgotten Jokes]\n\nBut it was the more liberal, pro-gay groups, Karger told Whispers, who really wanted nothing to do with him. \u201cI had more problems, far more problems, with the LGBT community as far as acceptance there,\u201d Karger said. \u201cHow do you sit out the first openly gay candidate for president\u2019s campaign completely? And snub him?\u201d he asked. The Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, which works to elect LGBT leaders, wouldn\u2019t get on board, and the Human Rights Campaign wouldn't introduce him at events, Karger said.\n\nIn the end, Karger concluded his 2 1/2-year presidential campaign in June 2012 in Utah. He never got into an official presidential debate, but appeared on the primary or caucus ballot in six states. In Puerto Rico, he placed fourth.\n\nKarger said he has no ambitions to run again. \u201cMy main objective now is to get the film around, to show it to as many audiences as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cFred\u201d opened Friday in New Hampshire and Karger will travel with the film in advance of Outfest, a film festival that takes place in Los Angeles in June. A good reaction there could lead to wider distribution in theaters. The documentary eventually will be made available online.\n\n\u201cI was very satisfied when I hung up my spurs after 2 1/2 years that we ran a campaign that was pretty much error-free,\u201d Karger said. \u201cAnd I think that it reflects [well] on the Republican Party and it\u2019s a shock to so many people that the first openly gay candidate of a major political party was a Republican.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "New Doc Details the Adventures of the First Gay GOP Presidential Candidate", "og": {"url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/04/07/new-doc-details-the-adventures-of-the-first-gay-gop-presidential-candidate", "type": "article", "site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Fred Karger knew he was a 2012 long shot, but wanted to make history.", "title": "Doc Details Adventures of the First Gay GOP Presidential Candidate"}, "twitter": {"title": "New Doc Details the Adventures of the First Gay GOP Presidential Candidate", "description": "Fred Karger knew he was a 2012 long shot, but wanted to make history.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "April 7, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Nikki Schwab,2012 presidential election,Pulse,Republican Party,RNC,Washington Whispers [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Fred Karger knew he was a 2012 long shot, but wanted to make history."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf462\"", "article_summary": "Called \"Fred,\" it's a documentary that details Karger's presidential run.\nBush, was the country\u2019s first openly gay presidential candidate from a major political party \u2013 and he was a Republican, which made his journey as a political anomaly a worthy watch.\nHe also was excluded from the Iowa Republican presidential debate \u2013 hosted by Fox News and the Washington Examiner \u2013 and every other debate thereafter.\n\u201cHow do you sit out the first openly gay candidate for president\u2019s campaign completely?\n\u201cAnd I think that it reflects [well] on the Republican Party and it\u2019s a shock to so many people that the first openly gay candidate of a major political party was a Republican.\u201d"}
