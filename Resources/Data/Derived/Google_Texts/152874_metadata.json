That strategy worked well against the Colts\u2019 Andrew Luck and the Jaguars\u2019 Chad Henne. Tarver need only watch the tape from last season\u2019s game against the Broncos in Oakland to see Manning\u2019s skill at counteracting blitzes from the secondary. The Raiders threw a season-high 25 blitzes against Manning and the Broncos in the teams\u2019 second meeting, with Manning completing 15 of 18 passes for 177 yards on those plays.\n\nFor some context: Manning has been blitzed 19 times this season, according to Pro Football Focus. Furthermore, not one of the three times he\u2019s been sacked has occurred when he was blitzed. On those 19 dropbacks when blitzed, Manning has completed 10 passes, three for touchdowns, and he\u2019s accrued a 129.6 QB rating. That\u2019s nearly as good as his overall 131.1 QB rating.\n\nThis is not to say that the Raiders\u2019 pass rush isn\u2019t good \u2014 it is \u2014 or that it won\u2019t plague Manning, especially with the lack of Ryan Clady on the offensive line. However, the Broncos will be Oakland\u2019s toughest test in terms of the pass rush so far this season, and it will be interesting to see how that challenge manifests itself.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Andrew Luck,Chad Henne,offensive line,Peyton Manning,Ryan Clady", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2013/09/21/blitzing-vs-denver-may-not-have-same-effect-for-raiders-as-it-had-in-first-two-weeks/21813/", "site_name": "First-and-Orange", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Blitzing vs. Denver may not have same effect for Raiders as it had in first two weeks"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Blitzing vs. Denver may not have same effect for Raiders as it had in first two weeks", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2013/09/21/blitzing-vs-denver-may-not-have-same-effect-for-raiders-as-it-had-in-first-two-weeks/21813/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The Raiders' pass rush -- perhaps their most celebrated accomplishment thus far in 2013 -- will face a challenge against Peyton Manning and the Broncos."}, "article_summary": "On those 19 dropbacks when blitzed, Manning has completed 10 passes, three for touchdowns, and he\u2019s accrued a 129.6 QB rating.\nThis is not to say that the Raiders\u2019 pass rush isn\u2019t good \u2014 it is \u2014 or that it won\u2019t plague Manning, especially with the lack of Ryan Clady on the offensive line.\nFor some context: Manning has been blitzed 19 times this season, according to Pro Football Focus.\nIn an interesting story in the San Jose Mercury News, Steve Corkran discusses the Raiders\u2019 pass rush \u2014 perhaps their most celebrated accomplishment thus far in 2013 \u2014 and why it may not have the same effect against Peyton Manning and the Broncos.\nHowever, the Broncos will be Oakland\u2019s toughest test in terms of the pass rush so far this season, and it will be interesting to see how that challenge manifests itself."}
