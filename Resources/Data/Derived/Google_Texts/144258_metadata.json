Under the new law, those who don't have health insurance are penalized. In other words, the government is forcing people to get insurance or be punished.\n\nLike many other aspects of Obamacare, the special enrollment period was an abysmal failure.\n\nAccording to Americans For Tax Reform, not a single person enrolled in Hawaii's Obamacare exchange during the extended special session.\n\nWhile Hawaii enrolled zero individuals and is the worst performing state, it is not alone. Vermont signed up only 97 households, while Rhode Island enrolled just 25 households.\n\n\n\nHawaii\u2019s dismal performance should not be surprising. The website cost taxpayers $205 million but could only enroll 8,592 individuals in year one. Cost to taxpayers per enroll: $23,899.\n\n\n\nThe state legislature recently rejected a $28 million bailout for the website meaning that a contingency plan to dismantle the exchange and migrate to the federal exchange will be implemented immediately. Unfortunately, taxpayers are not off the hook yet as it is expected that moving to the federally run healthcare.gov will cost $30 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the ongoing failures aren't isolated to the island state.\n\nHawaii is not the first website to implode. Oregon\u2019s $305 million exchange was officially abolished earlier this year at an additional cost and of $41 million. The exchange is currently under investigation by numerous federal organizations for how it wasted so much money.\n\n\n\nIn all, states received $5.4 billion from the federal government for state-based Obamacare exchanges with no strings attached and zero oversight over spending decisions.\n\n\n\nBut remember everyone, Obamacare is a success...or something.\n\nKeep working America!", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Success\".05/26/2016 19:59:55PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"Success\"", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Oh Boy: During Special Obamacare Enrollment Period, Zero People Enrolled in Expensive Hawaii Exchange", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/05/21/oh-boy-nobody-enrolled-in-hawaii-obamacare-exchange-n2001753", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/319/2014-11-15T233444Z_2_LYNXNPEAAE06O_RTROPTP_3_OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"Success\"", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Oh Boy: During Special Obamacare Enrollment Period, Zero People Enrolled in Expensive Hawaii Exchange", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/05/21/oh-boy-nobody-enrolled-in-hawaii-obamacare-exchange-n2001753", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/319/2014-11-15T233444Z_2_LYNXNPEAAE06O_RTROPTP_3_OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Oh Boy: During Special Obamacare Enrollment Period, Zero People Enrolled in Expensive Hawaii Exchange, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "According to Americans For Tax Reform, not a single person enrolled in Hawaii's Obamacare exchange during the extended special session.\nWhile Hawaii enrolled zero individuals and is the worst performing state, it is not alone.\nOregon\u2019s $305 million exchange was officially abolished earlier this year at an additional cost and of $41 million.\nThe website cost taxpayers $205 million but could only enroll 8,592 individuals in year one.\nLike many other aspects of Obamacare, the special enrollment period was an abysmal failure."}
