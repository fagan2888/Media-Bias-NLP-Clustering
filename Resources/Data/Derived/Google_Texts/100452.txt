All of the cadets are using their free spring break time to put up walls of a three-bedroom home.

A group of 10 U.S. Air Force Academy cadets are in town to help out an Oklahoma family. This week, they’re volunteering with Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity.

“This was all volunteer, so all of us signed up to do this and we were fortunate enough to get Oklahoma City,” said Cadet 2nd Class Robert Pahissa.

All of the cadets are using their free spring break time to put up walls of a three-bedroom home.

“I’m very grateful for these young people,” said Central Oklahoma Habitat for Humanity CEO, Ann Felton.

Felton tells News 9 the home is going to a family of four. The Martinez family includes a mom, dad and two of their young sons. The family will live in a house built with honor by cadets of the United States Air Force.

Pahissa says it’s a privilege to help out.

“A lot of things we receive as cadets that are great, so we really appreciate it. This is one way for us to give back,” he said.

The home will take about eight to 10 weeks to complete depending on the weather. In total, 142 homes will be built in this new neighborhood called Legacy Estates. There will be a community park and each home will have a storm shelter.
