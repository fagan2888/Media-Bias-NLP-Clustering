At 1,600 pages, the bill is longer than the 1,300 page classic novel War and Peace \u2013 no light read. And Congress has until midnight tonight to take action or the federal government will shut down. Here\u2019s an initial overview of how Congress is dealing with hot topics in the budget, and a few controversial surprises:\n\nUpdate 12/15/14: What's in a Cromnibus: Extended Analysis\n\nSpending Caps and Immigration\n\nThe bill adheres to the Ryan-Murray spending caps negotiated during last year\u2019s government shutdown, for a total of $1.1 trillion in federal spending.\n\nThe bill funds most of the government through September 30, 2015 (the end of the fiscal year), but funds the Department of Homeland Security only through February 27, since lawmakers intend to return to the subject of immigration following President Obama\u2019s executive order.\n\nMilitary Spending, the F-35, and Military Pay Raises\n\nThe bill provides $490.2 billion in base Pentagon spending. On top of that, it provides war funding (also called Overseas Contingency Operations) of another $64 billion, for a total of $554 billion in Pentagon spending.\n\nIt includes a 1% military and civilian pay raise, which is lower than the 1.8% previously planned, and permits an increase in military prescription co-pays and a decrease in military housing allowances.\n\nThe bill provides $5 billion for fighting ISIS, compared to $5.6 billion the President requested.\n\nWhile cutting military benefits, the bill includes a spending spree for defense contractors, including an additional $479 million to purchase four F-35s for the Air Force and Navy (two each) that the Pentagon didn\u2019t request, as well as an additional three Littoral Combat Ships.\n\nSurprises: Dodd-Frank and Campaign Contributions\n\nThe bill includes a reform of the Dodd-Frank law which would remove some of the separation between financial derivatives and traditional bank accounts protected by FDIC. This would weaken protections that were supposed to help prevent another financial crisis like the one that spurred the Great Recession.\n\nThere is a proposal to increase limits for personal contributions to political parties by ten times, from $32,400 to $324,000.\n\nAccording to the official budget process, all of these features should have been debated as part of 12 separate bills over a period of months. Instead, Congress has crammed them all into a 1,600 page monster and given themselves only a few days to sort out some of the most important decisions they\u2019ll make all year \u2013 all with the threat of a government shutdown looming over the nation.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileColor": "#222222", "description": "Spending caps, immigration, the F-35, military pay raises, Dodd-Frank, campaign contributions and more: here's what's in the budget bill.", "og": {"site_name": "National Priorities Project", "description": "Spending caps, immigration, the F-35, military pay raises, Dodd-Frank, campaign contributions and more: here's what's in the budget bill.", "title": "What's in a Cromnibus?", "url": "https://www.nationalpriorities.org/blog/2014/12/11/whats-cromnibus/", "image": "https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/war_and_peace_5_large.png", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nationalpriorities.org/blog/2014/12/11/whats-cromnibus/", "site": "@natpriorities", "card": "summary", "creator": "@natpriorities"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NPP", "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"admins": 1753588182, "app_id": 115413204199}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.nationalpriorities.org/images/touch/apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "keywords": "Budget Process, omnibus, gridlock, cromnibus", "google-site-verification": "vfX71PVId8YsbwgIogEKgfZbGYufZgsDvHkcl_bMWNk", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb318\"", "article_summary": "Military Spending, the F-35, and Military Pay RaisesThe bill provides $490.2 billion in base Pentagon spending.\nThe bill provides $5 billion for fighting ISIS, compared to $5.6 billion the President requested.\nSurprises: Dodd-Frank and Campaign ContributionsThe bill includes a reform of the Dodd-Frank law which would remove some of the separation between financial derivatives and traditional bank accounts protected by FDIC.\nOn top of that, it provides war funding (also called Overseas Contingency Operations) of another $64 billion, for a total of $554 billion in Pentagon spending.\nAt 1,600 pages, the bill is longer than the 1,300 page classic novel War and Peace \u2013 no light read."}
