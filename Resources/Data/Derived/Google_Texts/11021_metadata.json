Earlier this summer, I met Aiken for lunch at a dairy bar in the aforementioned Sanford after he\u2019d spent the morning meeting with the mayor and reporters at the local newspaper. He was dressed for the occasion in a rough approximation of political casual, wearing a pink-and-green checked Oxford shirt and unlaced wingtips over white ankle socks. Now 35, Aiken has tamer hair and a thicker midsection than he did when he was one of People\u2019s \u201cSexiest Men Alive\u201d a decade ago. He says he has gained ten pounds in just the last few months. \u201cDo you see how fat I\u2019m getting?\u201d he objected when the waitress asked whether he wanted dessert. Then he ordered the banana pudding.\n\nAiken is still easily recognizable, though, and his meal was continuously interrupted by autograph seekers.\n\n\u201cDON\u201dT FORGET TO VOTE NOV 4TH,\u201d he wrote above his signature every time. It was a message, he conceded, that people were still getting used to. \u201cThe first reaction from everybody is \u2018What the\u2019\u201d\u2014Aiken paused and theatrically mouthed the word fuck. He continued, \u201cWe call it the \u2018What the Heck\u2019 mountain, except we may not call it that. That\u2019s the mountain we have to climb.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Aiken strives to be serious and sober while campaigning, even boring. He\u2019s not a \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d\u2013style quote machine. Nor is he running a hopeless race just for the cameras, like Thomas Ravenel on \u201cSouthern Charm.\u201d Aiken spends much of his time on the stump talking about his trips to Afghanistan and South Sudan as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF and his experiences as a special-education teacher\u2014the career path he was on before he auditioned for \u201cIdol\u201d on a lark. In fact, it can be hard to shut him up about education policy, a topic he seems to understand better than probably 400 of the 435 people in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn a profession where even losers are increasingly winners\u2014where longshots launch hopeless bids for the White House with the goal of landing a TV talk show and incumbent congressmen go down in defeat secure in the knowledge that a huge lobbying payday awaits them\u2014Aiken is the rare politician who\u2019s actually risking something. When he revealed in 2008 that he\u2019s gay, Aiken estimates that he lost about 5 to 10 percent of his fans. Running for Congress, he believes, has taken a far greater toll. \u201cThe minute you go into politics, the minute you put an R or a D behind your name, you cut your fan base in half,\u201d he says. Aiken is concerned enough about money that, shortly before declaring his candidacy, he sold his mansion, at a substantial loss, and moved into a smaller rental house. \u201cI\u2019m not working right now, so I\u2019m not going to pay a mortgage,\u201d he says. (On the plus side, he has been able to store the furniture that doesn\u2019t fit in his new place at campaign headquarters.)\n\nAiken\u2019s gamble seems even more profound when you consider the particulars of his race. To the extent national Democrats are paying attention to North Carolina this year, it\u2019s to help keep Senator Kay Hagan in office. And by choosing to run from his current address rather than district-shop, he has consigned himself to inhospitable political terrain. Aiken acknowledges that parts of his home district are so red that Democrats \u201clearn to put their campaign signs deep in the yard so that when someone shoots at them they don\u2019t hit the house.\u201d To compensate, he has staked out moderate\u2014and sometimes vague\u2014positions on everything from Obamacare to gun control to immigration. There\u2019s almost no issue he doesn\u2019t look at through the prism of how conservatives might object. During a recent lunch meeting at a greasy spoon in Moore County, Aiken ate a ham and cheese omelet while he listened to a local Democrat pitch him on a more robust spay-and-neuter policy. Aiken was skeptical. \u201cWhat about the people who say, \u2018Keep your damn hands off my dog\u2014and his nuts\u2019?\u201d he asked.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s one thing about Aiken that might not sit that well with some conservatives, which is why, although Aiken is no longer in the closet, he doesn\u2019t talk about his sexuality unless asked\u2014and then reluctantly. \u201cCertainly from a political standpoint it\u2019s not going to make it easier for me to run here,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut it\u2019s just not why I\u2019m running. There are few if any LGBT issues which can be affected by a congressman from a federal level.\u201d\n\nInstead, Aiken is focusing on local concerns, like trying to prevent the Pentagon from moving the 440th Air Wing from Fort Bragg to Arkansas. In true challenger fashion, he argues that Ellmers has \u201cgone Washington\u201d and forgotten about her district. \u201cJesse Helms spoiled this state when it came to being attentive, and people are used to a certain level of constituent services,\u201d Aiken says. \u201cRenee just doesn\u2019t pay attention or show up, and people see that.\u201d Where Helms\u2019s constituent-services operation once converted Democrats into \u201cJessecrats,\u201d Aiken is hoping he can pull a similar trick by turning Republicans into what he calls \u201cRepublAikens.\u201d\n\nBut What the Heck Mountain looms. When Aiken embarked on his campaign, he made a promise. It was as much to himself as to the voters, and he still feels it\u2019s the key to his political success and to starting the next stage of his life. He promised not to sing.\n\nKeeping that pledge hasn\u2019t always been easy. When he appeared on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d earlier this year, he declined the host\u2019s offer to do a duet of the \u201cThe Star Spangled Banner.\u201d (To which Colbert replied, \u201cHeadline: CLAY AIKEN REFUSES TO SING NATIONAL ANTHEM.\u201d) In July, Aiken participated in a women\u2019s issues forum at a restaurant and nightclub in Pinehurst. After the event, I watched him gently turn down an invitation from the establishment\u2019s heavily tattooed assistant manager to come back and do a gig some time. \u201cI\u2019m not singing anymore,\u201d Aiken explained. \u201cYou gotta change the dynamic.\u201d\n\nEven Penn Jillette, who after competing against Aiken on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d suggested that he\u2019d prefer waterboarding to talking to the singer, chipped in $500 to the campaign.\n\nBut on a recent afternoon, as he sat in his campaign office in a plush red chair that once graced the game room in his old house, Aiken told me he had a confession to make. He had transgressed. It happened on a Friday night a few months earlier. He was stumping for votes at a senior-citizens center that was hosting a dance party. There was a live band. As he walked in, he was mobbed by septuagenarian women. He realized that, if he didn\u2019t sing for them, he\u2019d \u201clook like such a jerk.\u201d\n\nSo Aiken turned to the musicians and asked them to play \u201cUnchained Melody,\u201d the Righteous Brothers classic he\u2019d performed to great success on \u201cIdol.\u201d As soon as he started up with Ohhhh my love, \u201cIt was complete pandemonium.\u201d When the song was over, he tried to slip out the door, but one of the elderly women abandoned her date and asked Aiken to dance. Soon, other women were jockeying to cut in. \u201cThere were more fights on the dance floor than there are in Iraq right now,\u201d he recalled. Eventually, Aiken managed to oblige every request, sometimes dancing with two women at a time, their male companions standing by themselves against the wall. In the parking lot afterward, Aiken considered what his broken promise had wrought. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got the vote of every woman in there,\u201d he told a campaign aide, \u201cand every man in there wants to burn me in effigy.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "But this American Idol will do just about anything else to win", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "But this American Idol will do just about anything else to win.", "title": "Clay Aiken Won't Sing for Your Vote", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/9ad57635bcb8ec523a26f64b6838297f62b3cffc.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119004/clay-aikens-congress-campaign-american-idol-wont-sing-vote", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/9ad57635bcb8ec523a26f64b6838297f62b3cffc.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "description": "But this American Idol will do just about anything else to win.", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Clay Aiken Won't Sing for Your Vote"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/9ad57635bcb8ec523a26f64b6838297f62b3cffc.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Clay Aiken Won't Sing for Your Vote\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119004/clay-aikens-congress-campaign-american-idol-wont-sing-vote\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-12T00:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119004,\"author\":\"Jason Zengerle\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Elections\",\"2014 Midterms\",\"Clay Aiken\",\"American Idol\",\"Celebrity\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-08-12"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cd5\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut it\u2019s just not why I\u2019m running.\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve got the vote of every woman in there,\u201d he told a campaign aide, \u201cand every man in there wants to burn me in effigy.\u201d\n(On the plus side, he has been able to store the furniture that doesn\u2019t fit in his new place at campaign headquarters.)\nBut on a recent afternoon, as he sat in his campaign office in a plush red chair that once graced the game room in his old house, Aiken told me he had a confession to make.\nThat\u2019s the mountain we have to climb.\u201dTo that end, Aiken strives to be serious and sober while campaigning, even boring."}
