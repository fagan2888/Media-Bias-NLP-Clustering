Ted Yoho, a Gainesville Republican elected with tea party support, criticized President Obama on a number of fronts at a town hall Saturday.\n\nBut Yoho also said his own party shared responsibility for congressional dysfunction, adding he is working on bipartisan bills to, among other issues, curb mandatory minimum sentences for crimes, such as drug possession.\n\nThe town hall was held Saturday morning at Kanapaha Middle School with a crowd that, from the questions asked and applause given, appeared to be made up of predominantly Yoho supporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting to that build bridge across the aisle ... We don\u2019t have an option anymore,\u201d Yoho said. \u201cThis is something we as a nation have to fix. It\u2019s not a Republican problem and it\u2019s not a Democratic problem. It\u2019s an American problem.\u201d\n\nYoho was a strong detractor of former House speaker, Republican John Boehner, who resigned last year. But he praised current speaker Paul Ryan.\n\nRyan has a vision and communicates that vision to Congress, Yoho said. That vision primarily deals with the process of appropriating money.\n\nYoho said the process hasn\u2019t been done properly since the early 1980s, resulting in continuing resolutions to fund government while failing to shore up key programs such as Social Security.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to help Paul Ryan get that accomplished,\u201d Yoho said. \u201cThe other thing he wants to do is true tax reform.\u201d\n\nOther big issues for Yoho are national security and killing the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the health care program known as Obamacare \u2014 and replacing it with something better. Regulation and immigration are also key issues for the Republican party, Yoho said.\n\nIn addition to Obamacare, Yoho took shots at the president on several topics, including the Iran nuclear agreement and his handling of the tangled morass in the Middle East in general, and for what Yoho called Obama\u2019s lack of leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, the rule-making authority of federal agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency is the subject of a Yoho bill.\n\n\u201cThat power would be revoked or repealed and that power needs to come back to Congress so when the EPA comes out with a rule ... before they can implement it, it has to come back to the committee with jurisdiction that can vote yes or no or change that rule,\u201d Yoho said.\n\nYoho said he is working on a bill with Democrats about sentencing reform \u2014 a cause Obama has also embraced.\n\nThe bill's goal is to have mentorship programs to help offenders to straighten out their lives without going to prison.\n\n\u201cTo take a person who had a bad moment or made a bad choice, that really is not criminal, and to put him into our criminal system, they get that stamp on them and people won\u2019t hire them,\u201d Yoho said. \u201cAnother bipartisan bill is to reduce mandatory sentences. Some of these guys are going to prison for getting Oxycontin tablets, which is a terrible, terrible problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Rep.
