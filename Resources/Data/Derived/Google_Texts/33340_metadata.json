Democratic approval was at its highest \u2014 76 percent. ( Jacquelyn Martin /AP)\n\nIt is not often that the liberals at Netroots Nation and tea party favorite Ted Cruz would both convene tribunals to investigate a group they consider a threat to America\u2019s future.\n\nSo a tip of the hat to the Supreme Court of the United States, bringing people together.\n\nOr at least upending presumptions. When the nine justices broke camp and went off to their summer pursuits at the end of last month, they left behind a political world knocked akilter by the court\u2019s recent decisions.\n\nAs has been the case for decades, the court still has a majority appointed by Republican presidents. But a recent Gallup poll showed Republican approval of the court\u2019s work at 18 percent, a record low. Democratic approval was at its highest \u2014 76 percent \u2014 creating the largest gap in partisan opinion about the court in the poll\u2019s history.\n\nPolitical scientists and Supreme Court observers consider the court conservative. But a CNN poll showed that 37 percent of Americans say the court is too liberal, the highest share to say this since the network started asking the question in 1993. (Twenty percent said it is too conservative.)\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was once seen by Republican politicians as the archetype of an ideal Supreme Court nominee. But Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, said Roberts has traded the referee persona he offered at his confirmation hearings in 2005 for \u201can Obama jersey.\u201d In the Gallup poll, 43 percent of Republicans had an unfavorable opinion of Roberts \u2014 far more than those with a favorable feeling \u2014 while only 15 percent of Democrats were down on him.\n\nAnd even when the court takes a position that seems to be in line with popular opinion, the public has its doubts.\n\nBefore the court\u2019s 5-to-4 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which said that states may not bar gay couples from marrying, a Washington Post-ABC poll showed 61 percent of Americans approved of same-sex marriage.\n\nBut a Post poll taken after the decision said only 52 percent favored the court\u2019s decision legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide, and an Associated Press poll showed the public more closely divided than that.\n\nThe court\u2019s just-completed term will be defined by the marriage ruling and a separate 6-to-3 decision upholding a portion of the Affordable Care Act that was facing what could have been a debilitating challenge. These cases were among a surprising number of wins by the court\u2019s usually outnumbered liberals. Roberts was a dissenter on same-sex marriage and wrote the majority decision protecting Obamacare.\n\nPublic opinion of the court is always most strongly affected by what it has done lately, and conservative reaction to both decisions was so strong it probably influenced those who might otherwise have been more sanguine about the court\u2019s rulings.\n\nCruz, a former Supreme Court clerk and practitioner who of course is seeking the Republican nomination for president, labeled the back-to-back rulings \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d He titled last Wednesday\u2019s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing \u201cWith Prejudice: Supreme Court Activism and Possible Solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe court crossed a line, continued its long descent into lawlessness to a level that I believe demands action,\u201d Cruz said solemnly in his opening statement.\n\nDemocrats countered with the court\u2019s decisions in Citizens United v. FEC in 2010, which loosened restrictions on corporate political spending, and Shelby County v. Holder in 2013, which weakened federal authority over some states under the Voting Rights Act. Those were brought up at the Netroots discussion \u201cThe First 10 Years of the Roberts Court \u2014 and How to Change its Direction,\u201d and by Senate Democrats.\n\n\u201cWhen the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions served Republicans\u2019 political interests, I heard nothing about\u201d curbing the court\u2019s power, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said in a statement.\n\nHow much the justices care about the controversy is probably somewhere between a little and not that much. Everyone wants to be well-thought-of, of course, and the justices would surely be wary of proposals such as one of Cruz\u2019s that would call for national retention votes for the court\u2019s members. But that has little support.\n\nThe justices sometimes take a bit of perverse pride in unpopular decisions, saying they prove the value of an independent judiciary. The worst that can be said of justices, Justice Stephen G. Breyer has said, is that they become \u201cjunior varsity politicians.\u201d\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in the same-sex marriage case, said in a recent speech to judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that more-controversial rulings have faded with time. He was in the majority in the court\u2019s 1989 ruling that flag-burning was protected free speech.\n\n\u201cEighty senators went to the floor of the Senate to denounce the court,\u201d Kennedy said, according to an Associated Press report. \u201cPresident Bush took the week off and visited flag factories, but I noticed that after two or three months people began thinking about the issues.\u201d\n\nKennedy, who just turned 79 and has served on the court for 27 years, said there is a rhythm to the process.\n\n\u201cWe have to reflect on what these issues mean, and when we have a controversial case \u2014 and a very difficult case like [same-sex marriage] \u2014 we draw down on a capital of trust, a deposit of trust,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe spend that capital of trust, and we have to rebuild that capital. We have to put new deposits, new substance into this reservoir of trust.\u201d\n\nConservatives roll their eyes at such talk, especially from Kennedy, who is the least reliable conservative vote among the Republican appointees. There is no doubt that the past term was one of the most successful for liberals in years.\n\nBut affirmative action, election laws and challenges to organized labor\u2019s authority are lined up for next fall\u2019s docket.
