Hayek described how markets take into account an array of local knowledge that governments do not possess. It is \u201cknowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place,\u201d which enters into everyday exchanges, but central authorities cannot access it. That\u2019s because it \u201cnever exists in concentrated or integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess.\u201d This sort of knowledge is tacit and subjective, so \u201cby its nature cannot enter into statistics and therefore cannot be conveyed to any central authority in statistical form.\u201d\n\nCato adjunct scholar Jeff Singer is a surgeon practicing in Phoenix, and his op-ed today in the Wall Street Journal illustrates Hayek\u2019s point. The federal government has mandated that health providers adopt electronic records to the specifications of the central planners in Washington. A theme in Jeff\u2019s piece is that there is tacit and localized aspects of his practice that the government did not know about, and did not bother to find out about, before it imposed its top-down rules.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government has mandated that health providers adopt electronic records to the specifications of the central planners in Washington.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The federal government has mandated that health providers adopt electronic records to the specifications of the central planners in Washington.", "title": "Hayek vs. Government Health Care", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/hayek-vs-government-health-care", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/hayek-vs-government-health-care", "title": "Hayek vs. Government Health Care", "description": "The federal government has mandated that health providers adopt electronic records to the specifications of the central planners in Washington.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2015/2/17", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-17T16:03:42-05:00"}, "publication_date": "2015/2/17", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The federal government has mandated that health providers adopt electronic records to the specifications of the central planners in Washington.\nHayek described how markets take into account an array of local knowledge that governments do not possess.\nIt is \u201cknowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place,\u201d which enters into everyday exchanges, but central authorities cannot access it.\nIn \u201cThe Use of Knowledge in Society,\u201d economist F.A.\nA theme in Jeff\u2019s piece is that there is tacit and localized aspects of his practice that the government did not know about, and did not bother to find out about, before it imposed its top-down rules."}
