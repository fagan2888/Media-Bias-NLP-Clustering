According to the author of the research, the shift in the hospital EHR market reflects transformations in healthcare consolidation and reimbursement.\n\n\u201cHospitals understand they must establish new business models in order to survive under a dramatically transformed provider landscape,\u201d Frost & Sullivan Connected Health Principal Analyst Nancy Fabozzi said in a public statement.\n\n\u201cMost impactful will be cuts in Medicare reimbursement required by the Affordable Care Act as well as the shift to value-based reimbursement by commercial payers,\u201d she continued. \u201cAdditional concerns are the growing competitive pressures from retail pharmacy clinics and third-party telehealth providers as well as the rise of the health insurance marketplace that requires individuals to select their own health plans and provider networks.\u201d\n\nThe most immediate driver of new health information system (HIS) investments is reimbursement based on quality and efficiency, which hospital report as a major focus over the next one to two years. Provider consolidation and increasing demand healthcare services are expected to influence IT implementations more dramatically as EHR data increases in volume and hospitals work to contain costs and participate in new value-based reimbursements care models.\n\nAs for HIS market restraints, financial challenges related to shifting reimbursement away from fee-for-service are likely to continue through the next five years whereas the effects of provider consolidation on pricing and uncertainly about the future of meaningful use are not expected to persist beyond a couple years.\n\nHere\u2019s rundown of key findings from the Frost & Sullivan research:\n\nUS HIS market was valued at $11.1 billion in 2013 and expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.7 percent between 2014 and 2020.\n\nTotal market revenue is expected to increase steadily, reaching $17.6 billion by 2020, representing a 58.9 percent rise from 2013.\n\nAdministrative information systems will be the fastest growing market segment with a CAGR of 10.4 percent over the forecast period.\n\nFinancial information systems will follow, registering a CAGR of 9.7 percent over the same period.\n\nClinical information systems will grow more slowly than the other segments with a CAGR of 0.6 percent.\n\nThe projections support previous findings by Black Book Rankings indicating an increased focus on revenue cycle management among healthcare executives whose non-clinical systems lag behind their clinical counterparts, due in large part to the timetable for EHR adoption required by the EHR Incentive Programs.\n\nA survey from last June indicated that 93 percent of chief financial officers at struggling hospital had prioritized investments in RCM software, coding and collections solutions, and infrastructure to support the move to value-based reimbursements.\n\n\u201cWith so many organizations facing operating margins below the minimal thresholds for long-term financial stability and sustainability, boards and CEO\u2019s are moving financial support solutions and outsourcing initiatives to the top of their 2015 capital expenditure priorities,\u201d Doug Brown, Managing Partner of Black Book Market Research, said at the time.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research forecasts changes in hospital IT investments as organizations make significant investments in non-clinical IT, ushering in a post-EHR era.", "author": "EHRIntelligence", "og": {"url": "https://ehrintelligence.com/news/research-predicts-post-ehr-era-of-hospital-it-investments", "site_name": "EHRIntelligence", "image": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-02-04-frost-sulllivan.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Research Predicts Post-EHR Era of Hospital IT Investments"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research forecasts changes in hospital IT investments as organizations make significant investments in non-clinical IT, ushering in a post-EHR era.", "creator": "@", "image": {"src": "https://ehrintelligence.com/images/site/articles/2015-02-04-frost-sulllivan.jpg"}, "title": "Research Predicts Post-EHR Era of Hospital IT Investments", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bdd\"", "article_summary": "New Frost & Sullivan research forecasts changes in hospital IT investments as healthcare organizations make significant investments in business and administrative information systems, ushering in a post-EHR era.\nFinancial information systems will follow, registering a CAGR of 9.7 percent over the same period.\nAccording to the author of the research, the shift in the hospital EHR market reflects transformations in healthcare consolidation and reimbursement.\nClinical information systems will grow more slowly than the other segments with a CAGR of 0.6 percent.\nAdministrative information systems will be the fastest growing market segment with a CAGR of 10.4 percent over the forecast period."}
