According to CNN, Obama apologizes for the insurance cancellations due to Obamacare.\n\nFacebook\n\nEven though Obama said repeatedly that no one would lose their coverage due to Obamacare, it happened. His apology appeared sincere to some, with the President saying: \"I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\u201d Others are calling this a \"half-hearted\" apology, like Fox News today. The essence of what Obama said was \"I am sorry you lost your plans because you believed me,\" according to Monica Crowley, Fox News contributor.\n\nThe President apologizes just days after he attempted to clarify what he originally meant when saying folks wouldn\u2019t lose their coverage, but that didn\u2019t satisfy the critics who hammered back at him through the media.\n\nApparently some of the blame is going to the Insurance companies pulling their plans, some from just specific states, to save money. Obamacare resulting in folks losing their insurance policies coupled with the website for Obamacare, which is still somewhat dead in the water due to all kinds of glitches, is creating a mess.\n\nFox News had a technical engineer on their morning show who pointed out that all the questions being answered on the failed website seem to have one thing in common. Most folks admit they are not a technology expert, but these were the people in charge of getting the Obamacare website up and running.\n\nApparently that was one of the biggest mistakes made over the Obamacare website, not having a technology expert as part of the team to narrow down just what they needed this website to do and for what type of load it was expected to carry daily. This should have been in place before millions upon millions of dollars were thrown into a failing website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama apologizes on a clip that\u2019s played over and over again on the morning news shows Friday, Nov. 8.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/obama-apologizes-to-the-tune-of-brenda-lee-s-i-m-sorry-on-morning-news-show", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/f0/f0/f0f06f8f3f2f20b955f9ca35b117152c.jpg?itok=wD9CEW04", "type": "article", "title": "Obama apologizes to the tune of Brenda Lee's 'I'm Sorry' on morning news show"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama apologizes on a clip that\u2019s played over and over again on the morning news shows Friday, Nov. 8.", "creator": "@roz124", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/f0/f0/f0f06f8f3f2f20b955f9ca35b117152c.jpg?itok=wD9CEW04", "title": "Obama apologizes to the tune of Brenda Lee's 'I'm Sorry' on morning news show", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2013-11-08T09:14:25-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Top News, Obama apologizes, Obama apology, president apologizes, Obamacare", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-08T09:14"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb6b6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFox and Friends\u201d added a little background music as Obama apologizes, \u201cI\u2019m Sorry, So Sorry\u201d by Brenda Lee.\nObama apologizes on a clip that\u2019s played over and over again on the morning news shows Friday, Nov. 8.\nAccording to CNN, Obama apologizes for the insurance cancellations due to Obamacare.\nMost folks admit they are not a technology expert, but these were the people in charge of getting the Obamacare website up and running.\nThe essence of what Obama said was \"I am sorry you lost your plans because you believed me,\" according to Monica Crowley, Fox News contributor."}
