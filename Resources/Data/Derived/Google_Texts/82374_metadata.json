And John McCain. And Susan Collins, Roger Wicker, Kelly Ayotte, Deb Fischer, Richard Burr, Lindsey Graham, and Rand Paul, and at least three other GOP Senators too timid to allow a reporter to quote them by name as they disparaged a fellow Republican.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBless their hearts, they apparently haven\u2019t had time to read a law that was enacted more than five years ago. Nor, apparently and ironically, have their staffs.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s the only benign conclusion one can draw, after reading their on-the-record quotes in Politico\u2019s latest defense of the indefensible: Congress\u2019 special exemption from Obamacare.\n\nEntitled, \u201cVitter\u2019s Anti-Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from GOP,\u201d and reported by Manu Raju, the piece contains quote after quote from GOP Senators, each in turn explaining how Sen. David Vitter\u2019s \u201ccrusade\u201d to end Congress\u2019 special treatment is misdirected, or misguided, or political, or (my favorite!) \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\nAt issue, for those who are yet unaware, is the extraordinary and illegal treatment granted Members of Congress and their staffs, stemming from an August 2013 ruling by the Office of Personnel Management, at the direction of the President.\n\nSection 1312 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act says specifically that upon enactment of the law, \u201cthe only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and congressional staff \u2026 shall be health plans that are \u2013 (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act).\u201d\n\nFurther, according to Section 1512 of the law, employees who purchase their health insurance through the exchanges \u201close the employer contribution\u201d many received to help defray the cost of their premiums.\n\nIn other words, Members of Congress and their staffs shall, upon enactment of the law, be required to give up their generous Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan health benefits \u2013 which included a generous taxpayer-funded subsidy to cover upwards of 70 percent of the cost of individual and family insurance premiums \u2013 and, instead, must purchase their health insurance through the Obamacare exchanges, without benefit of any employer contributions to subsidize the cost of their insurance.\n\nThat is the law, as written. Unfortunately, that is not the law as practiced, at least not since OPM ruled in clear violation of the law that Members and their staffs would continue to receive taxpayer-funded subsidies to help defray the cost of their premiums. And the absurdity of the OPM ruling is demonstrated by the lengths to which Congress had to go to pretend to stay within the confines of the law \u2013 Congress had to declare itself a \u201csmall business\u201d with \u201cfewer than 50 employees.\u201d\n\nSen. Vitter believes the law should be implemented as it was enacted, not as some Members \u2013 apparently, many Members \u2013 want it to be enacted. In his determination to force Congress to live under the law as it was enacted, he is using his position as Chairman of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee to seek records of Congress\u2019 application to the D.C. small business exchange.\n\nSen. Vitter is right to be incensed. The American people agree with him. In survey research conducted at the time the special exemption was created, and again just a few weeks ago, almost 90 percent of the public agreed that Congress\u2019 special exemption was wrong and should be overturned.\n\nSo what\u2019s up with these GOP Senators who oppose Sen. Vitter\u2019s efforts?\n\nSays Sen. Flake, for example, \u201cI just think we ought to be treated like everybody else.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a noble sentiment, Senator. Of course, being \u201ctreated like everybody else,\u201d presumably, means you would like to live under the law you and your colleagues enacted \u2013 that\u2019s the conclusion one reasonably draws when she reads a Senator saying he wants \u201cto be treated like everybody else.\u201d\n\nIn America, after all, no man is above the law, and that means Congress must live under the same laws it imposes on the rest of us. It matters not whether you personally voted for that law, or against it; it passed, and was signed into law, and is now the law of the land \u2013 at least until it is repealed, an outcome we want to make happen. For you to \u201cbe treated like everybody else\u201d would mean that you, like everybody else who purchases insurance through the exchanges, would do so without benefit of employer subsidies.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Sen. Vitter is demanding, so why are you opposing him?\n\nPerhaps more ironic is the quote attributed to Sen. Ayotte, who explained her vote against Sen. Vitter\u2019s request by saying, \u201cI thought there were better uses for the Small Business Committee.\u201d Well, Senator Ayotte, seeing as how Congress\u2019 declaration that it is a small business is an essential element of the subterfuge required to continue the illegal subsidy flow, what do you think is a better use of the committee?\n\nThe quote that angers me most, however, is attributed to Sen Collins: \u201cVirtually all large employers subsidize the health insurance of their employees, and I don\u2019t see a basis for taking away the standard employer contribution to health insurance benefits for Members of Congress or their staffs. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nReally, Sen. Collins? You \u201cdon\u2019t see a basis\u201d for taking away the \u201cstandard employer contribution?\u201d How about \u2026 the law? See Section 1512, mentioned above. Yours would have been an appropriate response five and a half years ago, while the proposed law was being debated. But that decision was made, and it went against you \u2013 see the plain language of Section 1312. And while we\u2019re at it, you\u2019re talking about \u201clarge employers.\u201d But Congress declared itself a small business so that it could enroll in the D.C. small business exchange, so it could continue the illegal subsidies. In fact, that (false) application is the exact subject of Sen. Vitter\u2019s subpoena request. Pay attention, Sen. Collins.\n\nClearly, not a single one of the GOP Senators quoted in the Politico piece have read the Affordable Care Act. And neither have their staffs. (Ironically, these are the very staffs Members say they are so afraid of losing to higher-paying jobs on K Street if they lose their illegal subsidies.) How else to explain their clear disregard for the law itself?\n\nUltimately, they should do the right thing \u2013 exempt not just themselves, but all of America from this law. They can do that by repealing it. In the meantime, they must live under the law.\n\nFor decades now, the largest political gap in this nation has not been the gap between Republicans and Democrats, nor even that between conservatives and liberals \u2013 it has been the gap between the Washington Ruling Class on the one hand, and the rest of us who pay for them on the other. And no issue provides a contrast as stark as Congress\u2019 special exemption. When Republicans on Capitol Hill don\u2019t get that, and won\u2019t act to overturn the special exemption, they provide fuel to fire the anger of those who insist there\u2019s no difference between Republicans and Democrats. That\u2019s not a good place to be as a crucial presidential election kicks into gear.\n\nJenny Beth Martin is co-founder and CEO of Tea Party Patriots", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP Senators\u2019 Pro-Congressional Exemption from Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from America", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "GOP Senators\u2019 Pro-Congressional Exemption from Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from America", "title": "GOP Senators\u2019 Pro-Congressional Exemption from Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from America - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/12/gop-senators-pro-congressional-exemption-from-obamacare-crusade-draws-scorn-from-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP Senators\u2019 Pro-Congressional Exemption from Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from America", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/11/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "title": "GOP Senators\u2019 Pro-Congressional Exemption from Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from America - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-05-12T12:19:16-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "At least, that\u2019s the only benign conclusion one can draw, after reading their on-the-record quotes in Politico\u2019s latest defense of the indefensible: Congress\u2019 special exemption from Obamacare.\nAnd no issue provides a contrast as stark as Congress\u2019 special exemption.\nEntitled, \u201cVitter\u2019s Anti-Obamacare Crusade Draws Scorn \u2013 from GOP,\u201d and reported by Manu Raju, the piece contains quote after quote from GOP Senators, each in turn explaining how Sen.
