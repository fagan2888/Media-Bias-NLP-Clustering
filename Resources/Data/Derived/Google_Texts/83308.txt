In a discussion centered on the scandal involving veterans being put on secret waiting lists by the Veterans Administration and dying while waiting for care, Fox News liberal analyst Kirsten Powers said President Obama is “disengaged” in the crisis.

“He seems disengaged, I think it would be fair to say,” Powers said on Tuesday during an appearance on “The O’Reilly Factor.”

“What the cause of it is, whether he’s bored or doesn’t like his job, I have no idea,” she said in response to possible motivations, as suggested by host Bill O’Reilly. “But it’s clear he is disengaged.”

When asked if she was “profoundly disappointed” in Obama, Powers replied: “Yes, I am. I’m extremely disappointed in him.”

Surprisingly, Powers admitted that she did not vote in the 2012 presidential election because she was “so underwhelmed” with her options.

When given the last word, Powers agreed with O’Reilly that the president has reached critical mass with the American people and will not recover from the VA scandal.
