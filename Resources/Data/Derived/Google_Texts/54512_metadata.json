Tom Harkin, Iowa voters must choose between a feisty Iraq War veteran and Republican state legislator who boasts that she learned something about cutting government pork by castrating pigs on her family farm \u2013 and an articulate liberal Democratic lawmaker who occasionally shoots himself in the foot.\n\nFor a while, it looked as if Joni Ernst might run away with the election \u2013 boosting the GOP in its drive to regain Senate control after nearly a decade in the minority. She may still pull it off. But Iowans may be having second thoughts about putting two conservative Republicans in the Senate \u2013 Ernst and veteran Sen. Chuck Grassley.\n\nWith just three weeks to go, a recent Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll shows the race in a virtual dead heat, with Ernst leading Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley by just 47 percent to 46 percent.\n\nRelated: Senate Race 2014: Dems Have 30 Days to Turn It Around and Prove the Polls Wrong\n\nErnst was ahead by six percentage points two weeks ago, but Braley began to catch up after a recent debate punctuated by heated exchanges on abortion, climate change and environmental regulations \u2013 as well as biting attacks and rejoinders that sent a buzz through the state.\n\nBraley tried to portray Ernst as a Tea Party radical conservative, in step with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who would have \u201cvoted to shut down the federal government\u201d and who thinks the impeachment of President Obama should be on the table. Ernst calmly replied, \u201cCongressman, you threatened to sue a neighbor over chickens that came on your property,\u201d recalling a legal feud between Braley and his wife and a neighbor.\n\n\u201cHow do we expect as Iowans to believe that you will work across the aisle when you can\u2019t walk across your yard?\u201d she added.\n\nBraley has been hurt by some flubs and missteps. He fired his pollster and media consultant last June to try to regain momentum after Ernst emerged from a hard-fought GOP primary. At one point, he complained about no towel service in the House gym during last year\u2019s government shutdown.\n\nHe was also caught on tape disparaging Grassley as a \u201cfarmer from Iowa who never went to law school.\u201d Last week, First Lady Michelle Obama repeatedly mispronounced the Democrat\u2019s last name as \u201cBailey\u201d instead of \u201cBraley\u201d during a rally.\n\nRelated: Louisiana\u2019s Messy Senate Race Could Hijack the Election: Welcome to the Jungle\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to gauge precisely how close the race may be. A new Rassmussen Reports poll has Ernst with a three-point lead. The Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll, conducted October 3 to 8, lists three likely explanations for why the race is now so tight:\n\nThe Democrats mounted an impressive early voting drive on behalf of Braley, a four-term House member from Waterloo, and it\u2019s beginning to pay dividends.\n\nA majority of likely Iowa voters \u201cappreciate having a U.S. senator from each political party.\u201d Harkin, 74, has battled for liberal caucuses in the Senate for three decades, and many voters are inclined to replace him with another liberal Democrat.\n\nWhile Ernst radiates conservative political star power, her stands on critical issues may be out of step with many Iowa voters. A majority of likely voters agree with Braley over Ernst on six of 10 key issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PLAYERS\n\n\n\nJoni Ernst, 43, grew up on an Iowa farm and earned a bachelor of science at Iowa State University and a master\u2019s in public administration from Columbus College. In 1989, she completed an agricultural college exchange on a family farm in Ukraine.\n\nErnst spent 21 years in the Army Reserves and the Iowa Army National Guard, including 14 months in Kuwait in 2003 and 2004 as a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom. She says the experience prepared her for just about any challenge in public life. She parlayed a stint as Montgomery County, Iowa, auditor to election to the Iowa State Senate in 2011.\n\nErnst embraces \u201cIowa values,\u201d meaning self-reliance and limits on federal intervention in local and state matters \u2013 especially in education: \u201cThe states know best what needs to be taught in their school systems and what and how children should be educated and what works in those particular states.\u201d She wants to scale back or totally eliminate the Department of Education, and she believes in redirecting many federal agency roles to state and local government.\n\nRelated: Why the GOP Can\u2019t Count on a Midterm Wave Election\n\nBruce L. Braley, 56, a native of Brooklyn, Iowa, grew up in a family that struggled financially for years after his father, a farmer, died from injuries from a fall in a grain elevator. Braley graduated from Iowa State University and earned his law degree from the University of Iowa. He helped put himself through school by tending bar and won his first term in the House in 2006.\n\nHe has staunchly backed Democratic Party leaders, especially on social issues. He joined with liberals in 2011 in calling for a transaction tax on stock and bond trades, according to the Almanac of Political Politics. During the 2009 health care reform debate, he rebuked Grassley for using \u201cscare tactics\u201d about end-of-life counseling in the House version of Obamacare. He is a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and served as vice chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n\nTHE ISSUES\n\nErnst, a critic of big government, wants to cut the Department of Education, the IRS and the Environmental Protection Agency to save money. She\u2019s an ardent foe of abortion. She opposes gun control and says \u201claw-abiding citizens\u201d should be able to \u201cfreely carry\u201d weapons except in public buildings and school.\n\nShe opposes an increase in the federal minimum wage, supports repealing the Affordable Care Act and favors an overhaul of Social Security that would \u201ctransition\u201d younger Americans into \u201cindividual plans\u201d or individual savings accounts.\n\nRelated: The 5 Key Issues Most 2014 Candidates Have Ignored\n\nShe questions whether industry and humans contribute to global warming, hedges on whether she supported President Obama\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq last August, and opposes immigration reforms until the borders are secured.\n\nBraley\u2019s stands are virtually the opposite of Ernst\u2019s \u2013 which helps explain why he did so well in the latest Iowa Poll. He favors keeping Social Security as it is, raising the federal minimum wage, and keeping abortions legal. He would press for tougher reforms of the financial industry, favor measures to combat global warming and agree that manmade pollution has contributed to climate change.\n\nHe supports the ACA, favors tougher gun control laws \u2013 which earned him an \u201cF\u201d from the National Rifle Association \u2013 and opposes the Keystone XL pipeline. On immigration, Braley says the government should secure the borders and enforce existing law but not grant \u201camnesty\u201d to undocumented workers.\n\nMONEY\n\nBraley raised nearly three times as much as Ernst through June 30, $7.1 million to $2.5 million, and he outspent her, $4.4 million to $1.4 million, according to Open Secrets. However, that spending is just the tip of the iceberg and much more has been poured into the race since then. The candidates and outside groups have spent a total of $13.8 million on 30,000 television ads, according to The Des Moines Register. \u201cThat breaks down to $7.21 for each of the state\u2019s 1.9 million registered voters,\u201d according to a joint analysis of public records by The Register and seven other Iowa newspapers.\n\nRelated: Obama Remains a Big Drag on Democrats\u2019 Prospects\n\nAccording to a breakdown: A total of $7.8 million was spent on 14,499 spots in six Iowa TV markets for Braley and his supporters, and $5.9 million was spent on 16,113 commercials for Ernst and her supporters.\n\nPOLLS\n\nWILDCARD\n\nDr. Douglas Butzier, a Libertarian Party candidate, was killed in the crash of a small airplane near Dubuque Regional Airport in Iowa late Monday. The political novice had two percent support in a recent survey. It\u2019s possible that whatever conservative support he was receiving will gravitate to Ernst \u2013 which could help her in the very tight contest.\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "For a while, it looked as if GOP state legislator Joni Ernst might run away with the Iowa Senate election \u2013 helping the GOP to regain control of the Senate.
