Most women who are trying to get pregnant as soon as possible put down their birth control but neglect to do the same with alcohol – and this behavior can have devastating consequences on their babies’ health.

So says a report out Tuesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found that 3 in 4 women who plan to get pregnant soon are still drinking alcohol. It also found that overall – whether women plan to get pregnant or not – an estimated 3.3 million from the ages of 15 to 44 are at risk of harming their developing baby with alcohol because they are drinking, having sex and not using birth control.

“It’s important to note that women who are drinking during pregnancy are not trying to harm their babies,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC principal deputy director, said in a call with reporters Tuesday. “They are either not aware of their risks, are not aware they are pregnant, or need help to stop drinking.”
