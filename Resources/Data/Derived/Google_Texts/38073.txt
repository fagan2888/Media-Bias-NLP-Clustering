Obamacare's "other" big program is more than keeping pace with its better-known sibling.

The Medicaid and CHIP health-care programs that cover the poor and children now have 10.1 million extra people covered since the period just before Obamacare insurance marketplaces launched in the fall of 2013, federal officials said Monday.

That's a 17.5 percent jump in the Medicaid/CHIP rolls since the summer of 2013, according to the Health and Human Services Department.

The most significant enrollment increases came in states that have loosened eligibility requirements for Medicaid, as allowed by the Affordable Care Act. Medicaid expansion to cover nearly all poor adults is a key pillar of the ACA, along with the creation of government-run exchanges selling private Obamacare insurance plans.

Officials said 444,324 people were added in November 2014 to the Medicaid/Children's Health Insurance Program rolls.

As of November, there was a total of 68.97 million people on Medicaid and CHIP, which are jointly funded by the federal government and individual states.
