One hundred thirty-eight nonpartisan investigations prepared for Congress \u2014 count them, 138 \u2014 have shown corruption and dysfunction throughout the VA system. And our ailing vets bear the brunt.\n\nThe latest report \u2014 a whopping 4,000-page, $68 million review by RAND Corp. and others \u2014 looked at 87 VA facilities and found, once again, a culture of distrust and retaliation. \u201cThis culture permeates across all levels \u2014 from the front lines to Medical Center leaders to people at the VHA Central Office.\u201d\n\nThe deaths at the Phoenix VA facility, which made headlines last year, are the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAmid shortages of doctors and nurses, VA headquarters staff soared a shocking 160 percent over the last five years. More highly paid bureaucrats pushing scandals under the rug.\n\nVA Secretary Robert McDonald \u2014 installed 14 months ago to turn around the agency \u2014 pushed back on this latest report and insists he\u2019s getting the job done. Truth is, he\u2019s become a defender of the status quo, defying congressional oversight and lying about how long sick vets currently are waiting for care. Nothing will improve until he gets the boot.\n\nThe arrogance is breathtaking. Last week, five VA executives stonewalled the House Veterans Affairs Committee, refusing to testify about how they manipulated job assignments and expense claims to enrich themselves by hundreds of thousands of dollars. At taxpayers\u2019 expense, of course.\n\nAn inspector general who uncovered this has referred the culprits to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. Here\u2019s the shocker: McDonald hasn\u2019t fired them (though last year\u2019s reform law supposedly makes it easier). In fact, he\u2019s encouraging them to duck congressional questioning. Like a mafia boss protecting his underlings with a code of silence.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about politics. The nonpartisan American Legion National Commander Dale Barnett deplored the fact that these five administrators took \u201cthe evasive route\u201d rather than explaining their actions. But Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) isn\u2019t rolling over. He\u2019s taking the unprecedented step of subpoenaing the five VA employees \u2014 forcing them to answer to Congress.\n\n\u201cWe cannot sit still and wait while VA hopes this blows over,\u201d Miller insisted.\n\nTop VA executives also are continuing to cover up the truth about patients\u2019 wait times and falsely boasting that they\u2019re making improvements. Internal documents uncovered by CNN show \u201cwait times are increasing significantly.\u201d\n\nThe VA brass always have an excuse at the ready. This time they\u2019re claiming that they\u2019ve changed how wait times are calculated, no longer measuring the time from the request date and instead measuring the time from the date the vet said he\u2019d like to be seen. They must think the public is stupid.\n\nObviously that\u2019s what Hillary thinks. But more and more evidence shows the VA dysfunction is widespread, and McDonald\u2019s team isn\u2019t turning it around. Last Thursday, the Government Accountability Office told Congress that six out of the seven medical centers it investigated had no clue how many doctors were needed there or how many patients were being seen. If this were the private sector, heads would be rolling.\n\nBut not at Veterans Affairs. That\u2019s the problem that Hillary\u2019s possible presidential rival, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), wants to fix. Last Tuesday he tried to bring a bill to the Senate floor that would make it easier to fire VA employees for poor performance or misconduct. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing your job, you should be fired,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) blocked Rubio\u2019s bill. He and fellow Democrats claimed it would violate federal workers\u2019 rights and \u201cscare away top talent.\u201d\n\nMaybe they mean a talent for deception and fraud. That\u2019s what vets are up against, even as they wait in wheelchairs for medical care.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is the author of \u201cBeating ObamaCare\u201d and a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton says the furor over sick vets waiting for health care is overblown and \u201cnot as widespread as it has been made out to be.\u201d Last Friday, Clinton accused Republicans of", "title": "Hillary's outrageous effort to whitewash the VA hospital crisis", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/usa_clinton_benghazi1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664&h=441&crop=1", "creator": "@nypost", "site": "@nypost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"post_id\":\"nypost-9914037\"}", "sailthru.tags": "department-of-veterans-affairs,healthcare,hillary-clinton,robert-mcdonald,", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nypost.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/0b14d9dbf0c711522a906102b60f3da0?s=16", "generator": "WordPress.com", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-26 19:49:09", "sailthru.title": "Hillary\u2019s outrageous effort to whitewash the VA hospital\u00a0crisis", "nypost-section": "Opinion", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/usa_clinton_benghazi1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231&h=154&crop=1", "description": "Hillary Rodham Clinton says the furor over sick vets waiting for health care is overblown and \u201cnot as widespread as it has been made out to be.\u201d Last Friday, Clinton accused Republicans of concocting complaints against the Veterans Affairs Department as part of an ideological war against big government.\r\n\r\nWrong.
