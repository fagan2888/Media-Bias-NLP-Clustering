KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Alex Smith threw two touchdown passes, Kansas City sacked Oakland Raiders quarterback Derek Carr six times, and the Chiefs held on for a 23-17 victory Sunday to give them a franchise-best 10 straight wins entering the postseason.

The Chiefs were awaiting the result of the Denver-San Diego game to learn their playoff fate. If the Broncos win, they’ll head to Houston as the fifth seed. If the Chargers win, the Chiefs win the AFC West for the first time since 2010 and will host Pittsburgh in the first round.

Regardless, the Chiefs (11-5) are somehow in the dance after a 1-5 start.

The Raiders (7-9), who accounted for two of those victories, had the ball with 1:34 left. But Carr was sacked one last time, and the clock expired before they came close to a go-ahead touchdown.
