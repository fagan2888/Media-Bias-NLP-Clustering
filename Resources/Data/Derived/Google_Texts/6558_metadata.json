His opponent\u2019s accent was Australian.\n\nKen Ham had been a high school science teacher in his native Queensland, where he co-founded the Creation Science Foundation in 1979, before moving to the Institute for Creation Research in the United States in 1987.\n\nSeveral schisms and realignments later, Ham heads the CSF\u2019s U.S. and U.K. descendant, Answers in Genesis, promoting the idea that the Earth is some 6,000 years old, created directly by God over six 24-hour days, and subsequently devastated by a worldwide flood that killed all human and animal life except the elect breeding stock sequestered in a wooden boat built, at God\u2019s command, by its captain, Noah.\n\nA distinctly American combination of religious zeal and showmanship, producing media sensations from the 1925 Scopes Trial to this week\u2019s debate, has created the impression of creationism as a U.S. phenomenon.\n\nBut creationism\u2019s foremost historian, Ronald L. Numbers, wrote in his monumental study \u201cThe Creationists\u201d that \u201cno country outside the United States gave creationism a warmer welcome than Australia.\u201d For the movement\u2019s global reach, Numbers concluded, \u201cAmerican and Australian organizations\u201d shared \u201cmuch of the credit \u2014 or blame.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, surveys suggest anywhere from half to two-thirds of Americans believe some variant of the creationist view, compared with only 10 percent to one-quarter of Australians (depending on the survey). But Australian creationists are now showing the way.\n\nThe recent revelation that creationism-teaching schools in at least nine states were receiving over $11 million of taxpayers\u2019 money per year might have startled Americans. But that is tiny compared to the taxpayer funds pushing creationism in Australia.\n\nSince the 1970s, Australia has ratcheted up public funding to private schools, such that, in 2013, more than 34 percent of all school students attend them. More than 90 percent of these private schools are Christian. These include a large Catholic sector, and some old, establishment schools, which parents choose more for lavish facilities and old-school-tie networks than any religious content.\n\nNonetheless, the fastest growth is in more strictly religious schools such as the 91 affiliated with Australian Association of Christian Schools, whose members must assent to a Statement of Faith declaring \u201cthe supreme authority of the Bible,\u201d meaning that \u201cthe Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are God\u2019s infallible and inerrant revelation to man\u201d and \u201cthe supreme standard by which all things are to be judged.\u201d The Statement also affirms that, \u201cin pursuit of their task, Christian schools only employ Christian teachers and Christian non-teaching staff who are able to subscribe to this Statement.\u201d\n\nTo proponents of \u201cinerrant revelation,\u201d the Genesis six days of creation are a touchstone.\n\nIn 2010 (the most recent figures available), AACS schools received over $357 million from state and federal governments.\n\nAlso in 2010, AACS was one of three umbrella associations of Christian schools (along with Adventist Education and Christian Schools Australia) that wrote to the South Australian Non-Government Schools Registration Board objecting to a new policy on science teaching.\n\nThe policy stated that the board did not \u201caccept as satisfactory a science curriculum in a nongovernment school which is based on, espouses or reflects the literal interpretation of a religious text in its treatment of either creationism or intelligent design.\u201d The associations successfully objected to the board\u2019s attempt \u201cto determine what cannot be taught within a non-government school or how materials will be taught,\u201d and the statement was removed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ken Ham's debate with Bill Nye is a reminder: Many creationist tactics from Ham's native Australia could come here", "author": "Marion Maddox", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ken Ham's debate with Bill Nye is a reminder: Many creationist tactics from Ham's native Australia could come here", "title": "The scary future of creationism in America", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/the_scary_future_of_creationism_in_america/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/ken_ham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ken Ham's debate with Bill Nye is a reminder: Many creationist tactics from Ham's native Australia could come here", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/ken_ham.jpg", "title": "The scary future of creationism in America", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The scary future of creationism in America", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Answers In Genesis, Atheism, Australia, Australian Association of Christian Schools, Bill Nye, Creation Museum, Creationism, Editor's Picks, ken ham", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc98b9\"", "article_summary": "But that is tiny compared to the taxpayer funds pushing creationism in Australia.\nAlso in 2010, AACS was one of three umbrella associations of Christian schools (along with Adventist Education and Christian Schools Australia) that wrote to the South Australian Non-Government Schools Registration Board objecting to a new policy on science teaching.\nKen Ham had been a high school science teacher in his native Queensland, where he co-founded the Creation Science Foundation in 1979, before moving to the Institute for Creation Research in the United States in 1987.\nNye had the smooth tones expected of a fourth-generation Washington, D.C., resident, Cornell graduate and PBS regular.\nIn 2010 (the most recent figures available), AACS schools received over $357 million from state and federal governments."}
