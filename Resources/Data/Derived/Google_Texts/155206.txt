New research suggests a popular sugar substitute could lead to new treatments for some of the most common types of cancers.



For years, negative reports have surrounded artificial sweeteners, claiming evidence of being a carcinogen.



But in findings presented at the national meeting and exposition of the American Chemical Society, a team of researchers from the University of Florida College of Medicine examined how saccharin, the artificial sweetener that is the main ingredient in Sweet 'N Low, Sweet Twin and Necta reacted with a protein found in aggressive cancer cells.



The protein allows tumors to thrive and potentially metastasize to other parts of the body.



The study suggests saccharin would selectively block the activity of that protein stopping the cancer cells from growing and spreading.



Researchers warn the findings don't warrant adding large quantities of artificial sweeteners to your diet, but they say their findings may offer promise for the development of an anti-cancer drug derived from an ingredient that ironically was once considered a possible carcinogen.

About 50 million people in the United States suffer from allergies and those numbers keep growing.



Scientists say air pollutants linked to climate change could be a major cause for the increasing number of allergies worldwide.



The research is being presented at a meeting for the American Chemical Society.



It appears that pollutants provoke chemical changes in airborne allergens that could increase their potency.



Researchers are continuing to study the effects of smog and pollution on the human immune system.

Obamacare turned five years old Monday.



President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law on this date in 2010.



The White House says more than 16 million Americans have been able to purchase health insurance thanks to Obamacare, but the future of the Affordable Care Act remains up in the air.



The Supreme Court is expected to rule this summer on the legality of subsidies under the law.
