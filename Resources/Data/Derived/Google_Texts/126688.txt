A day after confronting President Obama on immigration, Jorge Ramos faced off with Sean Hannity on the same issue, telling Hannity he shouldn’t be condemning all the immigrants whose work he benefits from in his daily life.

Hannity commended Ramos for putting Obama’s feet to the fire, but aside from the pleasantries, the two men threw down over how to fix the immigration problem. Hannity said that illegal immigration has a “massive detrimental impact” on the U.S. economy, while Ramos claimed immigrants “contribute billions of dollars to the economy.”

He told Hannity that he’s served by immigrants and his fruit was probably picked by immigrants, and so “you criticize them and then benefit from their work.” Hannity took some offense at that and harangued Ramos about how hard he’s worked in his life.

They went on for several minutes over making border security a priority. Ramos said he would favor tackling border security and the immigration crisis at the same time, but Hannity was adamant about securing the border first, otherwise it would never happen.
