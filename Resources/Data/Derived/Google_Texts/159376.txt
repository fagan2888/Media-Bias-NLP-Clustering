Troy Tulowitzki entered Sunday on a hitting tear to start the season, sporting a .409 average with six doubles in five games.

Rockies manager Walt Weiss, though, sat him down. Colorado’s all-star shortstop was given a built-in day off for Sunday’s Chicago Cubs-Rockies rubber game at Coors Field.

“Looking at the big picture, I targeted this day for Tulo. It just makes sense,” Weiss said.

Tulowitzki is coming back from surgery to repair a hip labrum that ended his 2014 season after just 91 games. He rebounded ahead of schedule in spring training and is playing at 100 percent, he said.

But Weiss wants to angle Tulowitzki toward the big picture, trying to maximize his output over the full season.

“A lot of his off days are going to be built into the schedule,” Weiss said. “Day game after a night game — that’s one scenario. This was a day I targeted for him.”

Tulowitzki, though, was needed in the ninth inning. He pinch hit in the pitcher’s spot and struck out against Chicago’s Hector Rondon.

Tulowitzki will probably be back in the lineup Monday for a day game at San Francisco.

Oberg’s chance. Scott Oberg, a 15th-round draft pick by the Rockies in 2012, made a surprising spring surge toward breaking camp on the big-league roster.

He missed out on opening day. But he’ll quickly get a chance. Oberg was called up to replace John Axford, who went on family leave to care for his son.

“Great makeup with this kid,” Weiss said. “Plus stuff. Mid-90s with a good breaking ball. Great competitor. A lot of poise.”

Oberg was edged by Brooks Brown and Rafael Betancourt for the final spots in the bullpen out of spring.

McKenry starts at catcher. Michael McKenry started behind the plate for the first time this season in place of Nick Hundley. Weiss had planned to play him earlier, but Hundley was on a roll.

“Things had gone so well, I didn’t want to disrupt anything,” Weiss said. “Mac will play more than once a week.” Nick Groke, The Denver Post
