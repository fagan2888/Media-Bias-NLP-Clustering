Update on March 31: Revised to include the man’s name.

Authorities are investigating the death of a man whose body was found in a burning motel room earlier this month.

The fire was reported about 11 a.m. on March 19 at the Tampico Motel on 7201 E. Grand Ave., just north of the Tenison Park Golf Course.

Firefighters found Brian Francis Holscher, 59, unresponsive in a second-floor unit while they were trying to extinguish flames coming from the unit, officials said.

Paramedics began CPR at the scene, but Holscher died shortly after he was taken to a hospital.

The medical examiner’s office said on March 31 that it was waiting on his toxicology report to determine his cause of death.

This was not the first time someone has been found dead at the low-rent motel.

A woman was beaten to death there in 2010. Officers found her dead in a room and arrested her boyfriend on a murder charge.

And in 2014, a man was accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend in a hallway while she was on the phone with a 911 call taker.
