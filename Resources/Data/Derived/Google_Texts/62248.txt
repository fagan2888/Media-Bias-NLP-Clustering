In a letter to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong reversed the company’s recent decision to change some 401(k) benefits. The move had caused controversy inside the company, especially after Armstrong made a mess of an already tense situation with staffers by rationalizing the cuts because of higher health-care costs.

Worse still, he used the example of two “distressed babies” of employees — claiming that each cost $1 million to care for — as one of those expenses.

Said Armstrong, in part, at an employee meeting:

“We had a $7.1 million bill from the Obamacare act in general and we had multiple other things that happened at the company healthcare-wise. Two things that happened in 2012 we had two AOLers that had distressed babies that were born that we paid a million dollars each to make sure those babies were okay in general. And those are the things that add up into our benefits cost.”
