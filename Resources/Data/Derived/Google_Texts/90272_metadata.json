Tim Huelskamp over the next seven months.\n\nMarshall\u2019s campaign filed its quarterly report with the Federal Election Commission on Friday, showing the campaign has raised $524,731 since Marshall launched his bid in May.\n\n\u201cOur early success, not only in fundraising, but with key endorsements like the Kansas Livestock Association and the Kansas Contractors Association, has been a humbling process and we are just getting started,\u201d Marshall, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nStill, the Great Bend obstetrician\u2019s $341,344 on hand is less than half of what Huelskamp\u2019s campaign claims to have at its disposal.\n\nMark Kelly, the Republican congressman\u2019s campaign spokesman, said it had $774,000 on hand at the end of December.\n\n\u201cAfter reviewing Roger Marshall\u2019s report, it is clear the rich hospital CEO is desperate,\" Kelly said.\n\nMarshall loaned his campaign $70,000 between October and December of 2015. Since his campaign began, Marshall has loaned it $149,000, according to FEC records.\n\nHuelskamp, Marshall and student retention specialist Alan LaPolice will face off in a Republican primary Aug. 2. The race, which has grown contentious in recent weeks, will likely determine who represents the overwhelmingly conservative 1st Congressional District.\n\nLaPolice, who lost to Huelskamp in 2014, has continued his strategy of raising very little money and decrying the role fundraising plays in modern elections. He raised $375 last quarter and had $10,408 on hand at the end of 2015, according to FEC records.\n\n\u201cIn seven months, I\u2019ll either be called a genius or a fool,\u201d LaPolice said. \u201cEither way, I\u2019ll never be called a sellout and I\u2019ll proudly tell my children I fought for what I believed in, I fought for the soul of my country.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil someone has the guts to say no to the money, money will tear this nation apart,\u201d he added.\n\nOf the $111,612 raised by Marshall last quarter, $21,500 of it came from political action committees. Huelskamp\u2019s campaign has been critical of one PAC donation in particular.\n\n\u201cNot only is Marshall trying to buy this seat by giving his campaign a massive $160,000, but now he is asking for and taking money from a Washington organization that is pro-abortion and pro-Obamacare expansion in Kansas \u2014 a group with which he has close ties,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nOn Dec. 21, Marshall received a $2,500 donation from the American Congress of OB-GYNs PAC, which doled out more than a million dollars in 2014 to 137 candidates, a majority of whom were Democrats.\n\nThe American Congress of OB-GYNs supports a woman\u2019s right to an abortion, according to its website, and has urged states to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Marshall donated $1,000 to the group on Oct. 30, 2015, according to FEC records.\n\nBrent Robertson, Marshall\u2019s campaign spokesman, defended the candidate\u2019s anti-abortion bona fides.\n\n\u201cDr. Marshall is staunchly pro-life and lives it out every day, having delivered over 5,000 babies throughout our state. To even suggest Dr. Marshall is anything else is pure fable,\u201d Robertson said.\n\n\u201cAn attack with this level of absurdity proves once again that Tim Huelskamp is a career politician desperate to stay in Washington drawing his $174,000 salary and elite congressional subsidy for Obamacare,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, State, Justin Wingerter", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The campaign for congressional candidate Roger Marshall raised a half-million dollars in 2015, funds that will allow the political novice to compete against the fundraising machine of U.S. Rep.
