(She spent another fifteen at the gridiron-gaga University of Alabama.)\n\nThe kicker is that Roberts, an avowed feminist who contributes to National Public Radio and The New York Times, is a passionate fan of the Seminoles. In the midst of another glorious and thus far undefeated season for FSU, Roberts sat down with Salon to discuss what her new book says about old loyalties.\n\nEarly on in \u201cTribal\u201d you talk about how fandom \u201ctakes the edge off this painful self-examination, offering a kind of energetic clarity.\u201d But the book complicates the experience of fandom, by suggesting all the toxic attitudes and outcomes football fosters. Does the game still provide you with that clarity?\n\nI can still disappear into the hold-your-breath moment of the game. I holler. I cheer. I sing. I clap. If I\u2019m home watching on television, I coach. I\u2019m really good at calling plays when nobody can hear me. It\u2019s so comfortable and fine to belong, to be part of the tribe, to know that the people around you in the stadium \u2014 people who don\u2019t see the world as you do, who might hate your politics \u2014 will share the general triumph when your guys score. For a moment, you\u2019re all one family.\n\nIt\u2019s why people join churches, political parties, sororities, fraternities, gangs, book clubs. Most of us live tangled in paradox. Loving a college football team is simple and comforting \u2014 even when that team loses. When I\u2019m praying that FSU\u2019s quarterback can actually get the ball to that open receiver, I forget all about climate change, Syria and the NRA. When the ball lands in the boy\u2019s waiting hands, the world falls away. Joy takes over.\n\nAs a devout fan for many years, I get it. But can I just ask why you decided to open this particular can of worms?\n\nBecause it\u2019s my can of worms. I\u2019m trying to figure out how and why this absurd (and gorgeous and thrilling and destructive) game has such a hold on me and other people. I\u2019m particularly interested in the way we often love things that aren\u2019t good for us: chocolate, booze, narcissists, football.\n\nI\u2019m also a product of my culture \u2014 a culture I love and celebrate, a culture I deplore and critique, a culture I also try to understand so that its less attractive aspects (those little issues with racism, sexism, glorified violence and the like, all deep-rooted in the history of America and, particularly, the South) don\u2019t prevail unchallenged. Maybe I\u2019m trying to have my tailgate and eat it, too. I dissect the game, disparage it and yet keep on consuming. It\u2019s a part of me.\n\nSometimes I suspect I\u2019m just creating a cover story that allows me to feed my addiction. You know, like some fundamentalist who assures the faithful that he\u2019s an expert on sin; he\u2019s studied the decadent works of secular society and can declare that, Yes! It\u2019s all filth and wickedness!\n\nAs a \u201cfeminist with a football problem\u201d how do you feel about cheering for Jameis Winston, the FSU quarterback famously accused of raping a classmate? You write about the accusations, and the negligent police investigation of those accusations, with such disgust. Do you feel that same disgust toward the accused?\n\nI still don\u2019t know what to think. Winston plays with such joy and grace (I will admit to sneaking a look at him quarterbacking the Tampa Bay Bucs). He\u2019s an extraordinary athlete. I think he\u2019s also a bit of an idiot. Most young men are idiots. It\u2019s not entirely their fault: their brains don\u2019t get fully formed until they\u2019re in their late twenties, especially the judgment centers.\n\nThanks to the half-assed investigation carried out by the Tallahassee cops and the collusion of the athletic department, we\u2019ll never know if Jameis committed rape. Erica Kinsman thinks he did, though her story was not terribly credible in some ways. Clearly something happened that distressed her. I hate to get all postmodern on you, but it may be that each kid is utterly convinced that he or she is telling the truth. As a college professor for more than 20 years, I can say with authority that 19 and 20 year-old boys are the stupidest creatures on the planet.\n\nOne of the most fascinating sections of \u201cTribal\u201d is the investigation of so-called \u201cmuscular Christianity.\u201d Can you tell the folks at home what it is and how it fits into America\u2019s football addiction?\n\nI always wondered about all the praying and the thanking the Lord for a touchdown and Tim Tebow advertising Bible verses in his eye-black. I mean, I grew up in the South, where people would say Jesus is Love, then go nuts for a vicious open-field tackle. We went to football on Saturday and divine service on Sunday, often wearing the same kind of clothes \u2014 this was back when we dressed properly for a game. But the knitting of Church and football has increased over the past 20 or 30 years, along with the rise of the Evangelicals in American society. Clemson University coach Dabo Swinney is aggressively Christian, even letting one of his players get baptized on the 50-yard-line during practice, never mind that Clemson is a state school. Swinney\u2019s not alone. Many college football teams have chaplains, often hired by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes but given offices on campus and allowed to travel with the team. Many coaches take their players to church. Bobby Bowden at Florida State was completely unapologetic about it. He saw his job as saving souls as well as winning championships.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Diane Roberts is a feminist and English professor at Florida State.
