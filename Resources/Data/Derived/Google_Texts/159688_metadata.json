He was joined by columnists Kathleen Parker and Charles Krauthammer, Wall Street Journal editorial page editor Paul Gigot and National Review reporter Robert Costa.\n\nThough there was relatively little outcry on the right about the meeting, at least some conservative outlets, such as Breitbart, chided the journalists for speaking to Obama.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, York responded to apparent questions about his decision:\n\nTo interested tweeps: Yes, I was at WH meeting Tuesday with President Obama. I agreed beforehand that content would be off the record\u2026 \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013\n\nIt was good meeting; really helped me better understand WH perspective on current matters\u2026 \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013\n\nAs far as OTR is concerned, on Monday I had long talk with a leader of the defund Obamacare effort, combo background and off-the-record\u2026 \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013\n\nI understand the suspicions, but in my experience these meetings do not involve exchange of any secrets; rather, they are way\u2026 \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013\n\n\u2026for officials to expand and explain their positions in little more open way that allows me to better understand what is going on. \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013\n\nFinally, I was impressed Obama invited conservative journalists in. He didn't have to, but he did, and I thought that was a good thing. \u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Barack Obama Style Evolution Barack Obama Style Evolution\n\n1 of 52 1971 Obama (back row) Share this slide:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the conservative journalists who met with President Obama on Tuesday night responded to what he called \"suspicions\" about the off-the-record sessi...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-10-10 08:08:59 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "One of the conservative journalists who met with President Obama on Tuesday night responded to what he called \"suspicions\" about the off-the-record sessi...", "title": "Conservative Journalist Responds To 'Suspicions' About Obama Meeting", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/09/conservative-reporters-obama-byron-york_n_4069393.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1396827/images/o-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the conservative journalists who met with President Obama on Tuesday night responded to what he called \"suspicions\" about the off-the-record sessi...", "creator": "jackmirkinson", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1396827/images/o-OBAMA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Conservative Journalist Responds To 'Suspicions' About Obama Meeting", "site": "@HuffPostMedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-09 08:08:59 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4069393", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "media", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Byron York,obama,obama conservative journalists,obama conservative meeting", "article": {"section": "Media", "tag": "Byron York,obama,obama conservative journalists,obama conservative meeting", "published_time": "2013-10-09 08:08:59 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-12-09 05:12:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "APOne of the conservative journalists who met with President Obama on Tuesday night responded to what he called \"suspicions\" about the off-the-record session.\n\u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013Also on HuffPost: Barack Obama Style Evolution Barack Obama Style Evolution1 of 52 1971 Obama (back row) Share this slide:\nOn Wednesday morning, York responded to apparent questions about his decision:To interested tweeps: Yes, I was at WH meeting Tuesday with President Obama.\n\u2014 Byron York (@ByronYork) October 9, 2013Finally, I was impressed Obama invited conservative journalists in.\nThe Washington Examiner's Byron York was one of a small group of reporters and columnists who sat down with the president."}
