Analysts on average were expecting 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\nThe company said it now expects to earn $1.37-$1.47 in the second half, compared to $1.14-$1.44 per share it forecast in July.\n\n\"After cutting guidance significantly in the second quarter, there were fears of another big guidance reduction in the third quarter, but that didn't materialize,\" Citi analyst Carl McDonald wrote in a note.\n\nWellCare said it expects to pay about $100 million more in 2015 towards a tax introduced by Obamacare, calling it a substantial \"headwind\".\n\nLeerink's Gupte told Reuters she \"fully expected\" WellCare to get reimbursed for this tax through agreements made with states where the company operates.\n\nWellCare's net profit fell about 60 percent to $19.3 million, or 44 cents per share, in the third quarter due to a delay in tax reimbursement.\n\nExcluding items, net profit was 77 cents per share, above average analyst estimate of 69 cents.\n\nPremium revenue rose 35 percent to $3.3 billion, beating estimate of $3.28 billion.\n\nWellCare's medical benefit expenses rose 40 percent to $3 billion primarily due to the growth in Medicaid programs in Florida and Kentucky as well as membership gain through a recent acquisition in New Jersey.
