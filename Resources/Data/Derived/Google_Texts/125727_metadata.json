This week, attorneys for Whole Food and Wegmans asked a judge to move the litigation into federal court because they say the case involves litigants from different states. Whole Foods is based in Austin, Texas, and Wegmans in Rochester, N.Y.\n\nAngelova is seeking to have the two lawsuits certified as class-actions so that any judgment would benefit consumers who have purchased their bread at Wegmans and Whole Foods stores in New Jersey since 2008.\n\nAttorneys representing both food chains could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe Whole Foods lawsuit accuses the supermarket of engaging in \u201cdeceptive, false, misleading, fraudulent and unconscionable commercial practices in their sale and marketing of bread and bakery products sold in its stores.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit also challenges claims that Whole Foods makes its own bagels, croissants, cookies, cakes, pies, muffins and rolls.\n\nIt claims the items are either pre-baked elsewhere, frozen and reheated, or half-baked prior to sale.\n\n\u201cIt was defendant\u2019s intent to mislead consumers they are buying bread and bakery products that were \u2018made in-house\u2019 from scratch when defendant sold bread and bakery products that were frozen, delivered to its stores, and then re-baked or partially baked in store,\u201d the lawsuit against Whole Foods claims.\n\nThe Wegmans lawsuit says the company misleads the public with signs that advertise \"Store Baked Rolls.\"\n\n\"It was defendant's intent to induce consumers to purchase its bread and bakery products by falsely stating they are baked in stores,\" the lawsuit says.\n\nAngelova said her clients \u2013 Martchela Popova Mladenov, Mladen Mladenov and Chan Mao \u2013 are health-conscious consumers willing to pay extra for store-baked bread and bakery products.\n\n\u201cThis is about our health,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth lawsuits accuse the supermarkets of violating the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act by making false or misleading claims.\n\nThomas Zambito may be reached at tzambito@njadvancemedia.com.
