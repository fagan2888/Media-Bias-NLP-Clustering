And it\u2019s not at all manipulative or dishonest.\n\nDoesn\u2019t the Bible say \u201cHonor thy father and thy mother,\u201d you dumb wingnuts? Well, there you go. The government is your mother.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what you want. It doesn\u2019t matter what you need. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it makes sense. It definitely doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s even Constitutional. Mommy says so. Don\u2019t you love Mommy? Don\u2019t you want Mommy to be happy? Why are you hurting your mother?\n\nThanks to Kathy Sebelius for yet again proving that evil and incompetence aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\n\nThat\u2019s not my mom. My mom isn\u2019t stupid.
