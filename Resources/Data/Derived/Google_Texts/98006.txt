Yet more good news for Sen. Pat Toomey: A new poll out Wednesday shows the Lehigh Valley Republican and incumbent continues to lead the Democratic field in the 2016 race for his Senate seat.

The new poll from Public Policy Polling shows Toomey with mediocre approval numbers, but ahead of the two named Democratic challengers to date, former Pennsylvania Congressman Joe Sestak and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski.

The PPP poll found that 30 percent of voters give Toomey a job approval while 37 percent disapprove with his job performance.

A weak approval rating aside, Toomey holds a comfortable lead over half a dozen announced and hypothetical candidates tested by PPP.

Sestak, who lost to Toomey in 2010 by a narrow margin, trails the Republican by 4 points at 42/38. PPP notes that the point margin is similar to the 2 point margin of defeat the first time the two faced off.

A year out before any Democratic primary, Toomey has recently enjoyed a string of favorable assessments. Earlier this month, Harper Polling found Toomey leading Sestak by 21 percent. Another earlier poll by Quinnipiac University found Toomey also with a commanding lead.

Last week, a Larry Sabato's "Crystal Ball" ranking, moved the 2016 Pennsylvania Senate race from the "Toss-Up" to "Leans Republican" list.

Sestak, who is fighting a name recognition battle, seems to have lost most of it, with 54 percent of voters noting no opinion either way about him.

Toomey leads Pawlowski, 44/34.

PPL also tested four other Democrats, all of whom posted lower numbers to Toomey's and even lower name recognition. They include: Seth Williams, Chris Carney and Vincent Hughes.

Montgomery County Commissioner Josh Shapiro this past weekend ruled out a bid for the race.

PPP's analysis this go-around: as long as Democrats do well in the Presidential race in Pennsylvania, the Senate race should be close.
