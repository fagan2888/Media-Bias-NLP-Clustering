(AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nRICHMOND, Va. (AP) \u2014 Fewer Virginia inmates are being sent back to prison for new crimes committed after their release.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe says the state\u2019s recidivism rate has dropped to 22.8 percent, the state\u2019s lowest rate on record. He says this means Virginia\u2019s prison system is returning offenders to their communities better prepared to be productive citizens.\n\nVirginia calculates its official recidivism rate as the percentage of offenders who return to prison within three years of being released. The latest figure counts inmates who were released in 2009 and were back in prison in 2012. The previous year\u2019s recidivism rate was 23.4 percent.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
