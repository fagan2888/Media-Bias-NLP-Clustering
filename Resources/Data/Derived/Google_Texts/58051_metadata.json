These six innovations in the area of cancer care, we predict, will transform patient treatment in the coming years.\n\nBIG DATA\n\nKey to your battle against cancer will be data, highly personal and technologically-derived data. Whatever type of cancer you have, your doctor will not only genetically test the tumor but also sequence some portion or even all of your genome. This means you will soon be seeing (and possessing) secure, high tech devices to accommodate this explosion of necessary data.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with three billion bits of data, and you need to have this information before you start treatment but now it takes weeks months before you can access this data,\u201d said Patrick Soon-Shiong, chairman and chief executive officer of NantHealth. \u201cWhat we\u2019re building is a next generation micro device.\u201d The exact size of a passport, his forthcoming device is the equivalent of possessing the \u201ccloud in your pocket.\u201d Its most important feature is the ability to capture your medical records, including your genome, in one succinct place and also analyze and move all that data at a previously unheard of speed: 6,000 megabits per second. Forget your cell phone, medical technology will be your go-to device.\n\nMolecular Stethoscope\n\nAnother aspect of big data working in your favor will be the molecular stethoscope, described by Richard Klausner, chief medical officer of Illumina (and former director of National Cancer Institute) and used by your doctors to screen you for cancer. \u201cTumors put out \u2014 at very early stages \u2014 their DNA into the circulation,\u201d said Klausner. \u201cWe can now measure that with incredible precision, with incredible specificity.\u201d This means there could be, in Klausner\u2019s words, \u201ca blood test or urine test that detects very early stage cancer.\u201d So not only might there be population wide screening for early cancer, using such detection tests, your doctors will be able to understand whether they got all the cancer out after you have undergone a particular treatment. In other words, patients will likely avoid unnecessary chemotherapy or other possibly painful treatments and their side effects. \u201cYou know, 70 to 80 percent of current cancer therapy doesn\u2019t do the patient much good,\" Klausner observed. In the future, costly ineffective overtreatment will be easily avoided.\n\nNot One but Hundreds of Diseases\n\nIn the coming years, your cancer will not be identified and treated as a part of your anatomy but by its genetic subtype. In other words, gone are the days where a cancer patient will be classified as suffering from breast cancer, say, or lung cancer. Instead each patient\u2019s cancer will be categorized and more importantly treated as part of a small group of other people, most likely around the world, all suffering from different types of cancer though with a similar genetic disease profile. \u201cIn my mind we\u2019re going to break cancer into so many hundreds of diseases and patient types and be able to find individual appropriate therapies \u2014 if not a cure \u2014 to make it more of a chronic disease,\u201d said Bob Hugin, Chairman & CEO of Celgene. Naturally, this means treatment will transform.\n\nDrugs\n\nGoing forward your immune system, fortified by highly specialized drugs, will help fight the cancer, and, instead of taking one, two, or even three approved chemotherapy drugs, you will treat your illness with a succession of different drugs given in low doses through stages of treatment. How does that differ from today?\n\nGenerally, all current cancer treatments are intended to attack the genetic mutation. \u201cThe [incorrect] assumption we made is that cancer was a form of a single mutation, a single gene, or single clone,\u201d explained Soon-Shiong. \u201cAnd some of these genes are asleep, some are awake.\u201d But as a patient takes a particular drug, \u201cthose genes that are asleep waken,\u201d said Soon-Shiong. One drug may beat one type of mutation, but not the others which pop up as the treatment (and disease) progresses. Meanwhile unavoidable resistance develops among the thousands of mutated genes and their expressed proteins. Each individual cancer, then, is essentially its own separate rare disease and must be treated as such through a series of precision attacks. Metaphorically, cancer will be attacked by a series of small drones, instead of dropping a single bomb.\n\nPatient Participation\n\nYou will become an active participant in your own treatment. There will be a panoply of new, highly targeted drugs created. Necessarily, then, the way drugs are developed by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and the way they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 along with the profit structure surrounding them \u2014 must transform. \u201cWe\u2019re totally changing the paradigm of clinical trials,\u201d said Klausner. \u201cIt\u2019s very different now and we need to get away from what we\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\n\nIn fact, according to Hugin, \u201cdrug approvals may come from data that comes from post-approval settings.\u201d In other words, each subset of patients being treat for a particular genetic subtype of cancer will be part of the data flow determining whether an approved drug works and whether it is effective. With new technological devices, patients may be remotely monitored while taking a particular drug, in addition, they may be noting their own side effects into an electronic medical record. Essentially, then, your personal physiological experience will be directly entered into and a key part of the architecture of information available to doctors, drug companies, and the FDA.\n\nGreater Hope\n\nIn dare we say the overwhelming majority of cases, patients will not think of cancer as a death sentence (or potential death sentence) but simply a chronic, manageable disease \u2014 even when it is detected at a late-stage. Fortunately, this is already true for many people suffering from cancer today, yet it will be even more so in the future. \u201cThere\u2019s much more hope today and the patients understand that,\u201d said Sandra Swain, Medical Director Washington Cancer Institute at MedStar Washington Hospital Center; first hand she has seen how her patients learn and understand more about cancer and their own possibility of long survival. Additionally, she has observed how the changes in treatment, including genetic testing, has prevented over-treating patients while alleviatiating fear. \u201cNow with the current oncotype tests\u2026 we have been able to decrease the number of women who get chemotherapy. This is huge,\" Swain said. \"This is one of the biggest advances I\u2019ve seen in my career.\u201d\n\nAccording to Peter Bach, director of Memorial Sloan Kettering\u2019s Center for Health Policy and Outcomes, doctors and patients alike have adopted a \u201cfalse construct\u201d that \u201cthere are two populations of humans, sick ones and healthy ones. We need to think in this new age that we\u2019re all sort of pre-affected and affected,\u201d he stated. In short, since we all will sometimes make a trip to the land of the sick, wouldn't it be best if we are carrying the appropriate passport and understand the cultural norms?\n\nIncreasingly, cancer is a treatable condition of aging. Going forward, doctors, scientists and professionals working in high technology and pharmacology will be creating new and more effective treatments. Meanwhile our healthcare system has already begun to transform to accommodate these innovations and their attendant costs. Just as the Internet, in the words of Forbes \u201cblasted away the traditional boundaries for all media companies,\u201d high tech and smart data will do the same within the Healthcare sector. More and more of the decision-making will be shifted to consumers \u2014 you, the patient.
