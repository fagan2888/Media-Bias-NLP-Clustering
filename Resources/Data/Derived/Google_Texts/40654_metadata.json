He was one of the FBI\u2019s most wanted fugitives until he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011. He and Greig had been living together in a rent-controlled apartment.\n\nWhen Greig was sentenced on the original charges in 2012, her lawyer, Kevin Reddington, said Greig was in love with Bulger when she fled with him and did not believe that Bulger was capable of murder.\n\nIn 2013, Bulger was convicted of playing a role in 11 murders and other charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment.\n\nProsecutors said Greig had numerous opportunities to leave Bulger during their time on the run. Instead, they said she helped him remain a fugitive by using false identities and posing as his wife so she could pick up his prescriptions.\n\nThe couple posed as married retirees from Chicago. After they were captured, authorities found a stash of more than $800,000 in cash and 30 weapons in their apartment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The longtime girlfriend and fugitive companion of James \"Whitey\" Bulger is expected in federal court to face a contempt charge for refusing to tell whether other people helped the Boston mobster during his 16 years on the run.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The longtime girlfriend and fugitive companion of James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger is expected in federal court to face a contempt charge for refusing to tell whether other people helped the Boston mobster during his 16 years on the run.", "title": "\u2018Whitey\u2019 Bulger\u2019s lover heads to court on contempt charge", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/19/whitey-bulgers-lover-heads-court-contempt-charge/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/19/c7d877a0fee63c2e850f6a7067006f6f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/19/c7d877a0fee63c2e850f6a7067006f6f.jpg", "description": "The longtime girlfriend and fugitive companion of James \"Whitey\" Bulger is expected in federal court to face a contempt charge for refusing to tell whether other people helped the Boston mobster durin", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Whitey\u2019 Bulger\u2019s lover heads to court on contempt c"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, James  Whitey  Bulger, Catherine Greig"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc775\"", "article_summary": "Greig, 64, already is serving an eight-year sentence for conspiracy to harbor a fugitive, identity fraud and conspiracy to commit identity fraud.\nCatherine Greig is scheduled to make an initial appearance on the new charge Monday in U.S. District Court.\nBulger, now 86, fled Boston just before being indicted in early 1995.\nBOSTON \u2014 The longtime girlfriend and fugitive companion of James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger is expected in federal court to face a contempt charge for refusing to tell whether other people helped the Boston mobster during his 16 years on the run.\nIn 2013, Bulger was convicted of playing a role in 11 murders and other charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment."}
