TWO years after the Tracy Aged Care home was shut for commercial reasons, leaving dozens of elderly residents in the lurch, plans to redevelop the Darwin CBD site have been revealed.

A development application has now been lodged to convert the existing buildings into a 55-room motel.

The site, at the intersection of Woods and McLachlan streets, will operate as a motel for a maximum of five years.

“The proposal allows the positive reuse of the existing buildings with minimal capital outlay, with benefits in avoiding any proliferation of vacant buildings,” according to the planning report submitted to the Development Consent Authority.

“The proposal intends a limitation on the time frame of the permit, with the proposed use allowing a return on ­investment until such time as the land is redeveloped.”

The two-floor motel will consist of 42 ensuite rooms and 13 rooms with shared bathroom facilities.

It also makes allowances for a caretaker’s residence and a convenience store and cafe.

The cafe would include an alfresco dining space with an awning reaching out over the Woods Rd reserve.

The Tracy Aged Care facility was put on the market by then-owner the Uniting Church in 2014, leaving its 30 clients in aged care looking for new homes.

Federal money, which was intended to help put a dent in the Territory’s extensive waiting list for aged care places, was controversially redirected to refurbish the church’s Terrace Gardens home in Palmerston, allowing it to take on the ­displaced Tracy Aged Care ­residents.

By filling Terrace Gardens with Tracy Aged Care residents instead of new clients, the Uniting Church was free to act on the prime Woods St real estate.

The proposed motel will ­include a swimming pool and a circular drop-off area, as well as a 32-bay carpark.
