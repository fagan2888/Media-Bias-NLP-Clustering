Ted Cruz is about to find out what a full-on Trump assault can do when it is coupled with a coordinated attack from another key player in the GOP field.\n\nRelated: With South Carolina in Hand, Trump Continues His War with the GOP\n\nCruz on Monday fired his communications director, Rick Tyler, after he publicized a video that \u2013 however improbably \u2013 appeared to show Florida Sen. Marco Rubio \u201cinsulting\u201d the Bible in a crowded hotel lobby. The details are here, but the short version is that the video included misleading subtitles that were promptly refuted by the Rubio campaign.\n\nUnder different circumstances, the Cruz campaign might have been able to sweep that particular mistake under the rug, but the Texas senator\u2019s opponents, arguably without real evidence, have been working hard to paint him as a \u201cdirty\u201d campaigner.\n\nAnd his campaign has played into their hands. Surrogates in Iowa incorrectly spread a rumor that retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson was ending his campaign even as that state\u2019s voters were caucusing, and a Cruz-supporting super PAC in South Carolina financed controversial robo-calls in advance of that state\u2019s Saturday primary.\n\nOn balance, it\u2019s created the impression \u2013 one that opponents have been anxious to reinforce \u2013 that Cruz is a cheater. And while his decision to get rid of Tyler was an obvious effort to blunt that criticism, Trump and Rubio don\u2019t appear to be ready to let it go.\n\nRelated: Rubio, the Unlikely Establishment Candidate, Is Now Trump\u2019s Main Rival\n\nNot long after Cruz took the all-but-inevitable pro-active step of requesting Tyler\u2019s resignation, the Trump assault was launched.\n\nThis time, though, it was coupled with an attack from the Rubio campaign as well.\n\nJust in -- @marcorubio campaign responds to @tedcruz asking for Rick Tyler's resignation: pic.twitter.com/GVGidNBSmE \u2014 Patrick Svitek (@PatrickSvitek) February 22, 2016\n\nConsidering how recently this most story broke, it\u2019s unlikely that it will have much effect on tonight\u2019s Nevada caucus. But with Super Tuesday just a week away, attacks on Cruz\u2019s honesty are likely to be a daily feature of the campaign until next Wednesday \u2013 the day both Trump and Rubio are hoping will be the first without the Texas senator as a major competitor.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As resident mean girl of the Republican primary field, Donald Trump has never been reluctant to poke and prod at his opponents\u2019 weak spots, and when he\u2019s been able to find one that resonates with the GOP electorate, the effect has been dramatic.
