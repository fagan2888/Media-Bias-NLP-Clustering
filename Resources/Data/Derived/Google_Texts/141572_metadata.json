While the speaker's proposed lawsuit has the backing of some Republicans in Congress, 51 percent of American voters view it as a \"political stunt,\" according to Public Policy Polling. Only 41 percent of voters consider the lawsuit to be legitimate.\n\nPublic Policy Polling, in a poll commissioned by liberal advocacy group Americans United for Change, surveyed 1,161 registered voters and found a great majority viewed the lawsuit as a misappropriation of Congress' time and money. Fifty-eight percent said the lawsuit won't benefit people like them, and 63 percent said Congress should prioritize jobs over the lawsuit.\n\nWhile Democrats have accused Boehner of using the lawsuit to bolster conservative support ahead of the midterm elections, 46 percent of those surveyed said they were less likely to vote for Republican candidates in November.\n\nThe poll from July 11 to July 13 and has a margin of error of 2.9 percent.\n\nAmerican voters aren't the only ones viewing the lawsuit as a political stunt. RedState.com editor Erick Erickson called it \"political theater and a further Republican waste of taxpayer dollars.\" Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Republicans would be better off pursuing impeachment.\n\n\"You don\u2019t bring a lawsuit to a gunfight, and there\u2019s no room for lawyers on our front lines,\" Palin told Fox News' Hannity.\n\nA third of Americans, and two-thirds of Republicans, think Obama should be impeached, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: John Boehner's Lips Are Sealed John Boehner's Lips Are Sealed\n\n1 of 27 Boehner Holds Press Briefing At The Capitol U.S. Speaker of the House Rep.
