After reviewing new evidence regarding health dangers, the FDA is reconsidering the way over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are marketed to the public. Drugs like ibuprofen, most commonly sold as Advil, and naproxen, known as Aleve, already contain warnings that say they \u201cmay cause\u201d an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. New labels, however, will make the link explicit, stating that they \u201ccause an increased risk\u201d of heart attack and stroke.\n\nCountless studies from the past have proven that painkillers come with a series of health problems in addition to their relief. A 2013 study examined 600 trials and found that high doses of NSAIDs increase the risk of heart attacks by one-third. What\u2019s more, ibuprofen was found to more than double the likelihood of a major coronary event. All types of NSAIDs saw a two- to four-fold increased risk of gastrointestinal problems. Even more concerning, a 2014 study found that deaths associated with strokes were 19 percent higher in patients who had been taking NSAIDs.\n\nThe FDA first warned of the risks associated with OTC painkillers in 2005, but is now tightening its belt thanks to new evidence. Overall, it found that the risk of heart problems is present indiscriminate of the duration taking the drugs or previous health issues. \u201cThere is no period of use shown to be without risk,\u201d said Dr. Judy Racoosin, director of the FDA\u2019s Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products in a statement.\n\nPrevious studies have proven that the risk increases when NSAIDs are used in higher doses. Also, the FDA states that those who have underlying heart disease are at an even greater risk of complications. That being said, health hazards exist for everyone. \u201cToday we know that the risk of heart attack and stroke may occur early in treatment, even in the first weeks,\u201d the FDA says.\n\nThe FDA also plans to put additional warnings for those who have preexisting heart problems, and have experienced a heart attack in the past. \u201cThis vulnerable population is at an increased risk of having another heart attack or dying of heart attack-related causes if they\u2019re treated with NSAIDs, according to studies,\u201d the FDA said.\n\nIn order to minimize chances of experiencing heart complications when taking these painkillers, the FDA recommends that you should take the drug at the lowest dose possible, over the shortest span of time you can. Also, it is advised that you consult a doctor to see if you have preexisting high blood pressure or symptoms of possible heart disease.\n\nSource: Schmidt M, S\u00f8rensen H, Petersen K, et al.
