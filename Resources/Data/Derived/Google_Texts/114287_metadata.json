According to garnered results, higher quality care is being effectively delivered annually to Medicare beneficiaries thanks to ACOs, confirms CMS.\n\nAccording to CMS, ACOs are especially helping those Medicare beneficiaries who are chronically ill receive care while avoiding unnecessary duplication of services and thwarting medical errors.\n\nFinancial highlights from CMS\u2019s results:\n\nDuring the third performance year, Pioneer ACOs generated total model savings of $120 million, an increase of 24% from Performance Year 2 ($96 million), which was itself an increase from Performance Year 1 ($88 million).\n\nOf 15 Pioneer ACOs who generated savings, 11 generated savings outside a minimum savings rate and earned shared savings. These 11 ACOs qualify for shared savings payments of $82 million. Of 5 Pioneer ACOs who generated losses, three generated losses outside a minimum loss rate and owed shared losses. These ACOs are paying CMS $9 million in shared losses.\n\nTotal model savings per ACO increased from $2.7 million per ACO in Performance Year 1 to $4.2 million per ACO in Performance Year 2 to $6.0 million per ACO in Performance Year 3.\n\n\u201cThese results show that accountable care organizations as a group are on the path towards transforming how care is provided,\" states Andy Slavitt, CMS\u2019s Acting Administrator, in reference to collective findings. \u201cMany of these ACOs are demonstrating that they can deliver a higher level of coordinated care that leads to healthier people and smarter spending,\u201d he maintains.\n\nACO growth is here to stay, says CMS\n\nCMS claims its results demonstrate the 20 ACOs in the Pioneer ACO Model and 333 Medicare Shared Shavings Program ACOs generated over $411 million in total savings within 2014. This amount includes all ACOs\u2019 financial gains and losses, says CMS. Concurrently, 97 ACOs qualified for shared savings payments topping $422 million by meeting both quality standards and their savings threshold. CMS maintains more experienced ACOs operate more efficiently.\n\nThe number of beneficiaries served by ACOs is expected to increase, says CMS, as consistent increases are noted year after year. CMS confirms since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) implementation, over 420 Medicare ACOs have come into existence to serve a population of nearly 8 million via Original Medicare as of January 1 of this year. Strong buzz from both new and established applicants reverberates around the Shared Savings Program, CMS says.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act takes important steps toward a more accessible, affordable, and higher-quality health care system,\u201d CMS states. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is part of a broader effort to seize on this historic moment and transform our health care system into one that works better for the American people. We have a vision of a system that delivers better care, spends our dollars in a smarter way, and puts patients in the center of their care to keep them healthy.\u201d\n\nConsidering the other ACO perspective\n\nConsidering the flipside, the future of ACOs is not always depicted in alignment with financial sunshine and revenue rainbows. As RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, interoperability challenges are perhaps hindering the performance of ACOs. Restrictive capital may be creating significant snags in the streamlining of financial operations for ACOs. Seventy-two percent of practices earning reimbursements during the Medicare Shared Savings program\u2019s initial year were physician-led, as RevCycleIntelligence.com also reported. Although such are \u201cuniquely positioned to lead accountable care organizations,\u201d other research suggests they may not be well-equipped to do so. Other data demonstrates Medicare Shared Savings ACOs are associated with mixed financial performance results, confirmed EHRIntelligence.com.\n\nAccountable care success \u2013 keeping quality high and cost low \u2013 is not effortless. This year, as RevCycleIntelligence.com stated, will indeed be a \u201cdeciding year\u201d as to whether or not ACOs will effectively execute the transition from exploration to mainstream implementation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Medicare ACOs advance Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 care quality and yield financial savings, confirm CMS's newly released quality and financial performance results.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/cms-medicare-acos-boost-care-quality-yield-shared-savings", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/heart.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "CMS: Medicare ACOs Boost Care Quality, Yield Shared Savings"}, "twitter": {"description": "Medicare ACOs advance Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 care quality and yield financial savings, confirm CMS's newly released quality and financial performance results.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/heart.jpg"}, "title": "CMS: Medicare ACOs Boost Care Quality, Yield Shared Savings", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcd4\"", "article_summary": "Of 15 Pioneer ACOs who generated savings, 11 generated savings outside a minimum savings rate and earned shared savings.\nOther data demonstrates Medicare Shared Savings ACOs are associated with mixed financial performance results, confirmed EHRIntelligence.com.\nSeventy-two percent of practices earning reimbursements during the Medicare Shared Savings program\u2019s initial year were physician-led, as RevCycleIntelligence.com also reported.\nConcurrently, 97 ACOs qualified for shared savings payments topping $422 million by meeting both quality standards and their savings threshold.\nAccording to garnered results, higher quality care is being effectively delivered annually to Medicare beneficiaries thanks to ACOs, confirms CMS."}
