But, the proposal satisfied many House Republicans\u2019 priorities.\n\nThe budget balanced. It addressed entitlement reform, increased defense spending, and garnered support from the conference.\n\n\u201cWe got the majority of the majority of Republicans,\u201d Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., told The Daily Signal in an interview. \u201cWe had a lot of positive comments regarding how we structured the RSC budget and the fact that it\u2019s very clear, it\u2019s bold, and it achieved the principles that are important to a lot of our folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got the majority of the majority of Republicans,\u201d said @RepStutzman.\n\nThe RSC\u2019s budget\u2014crafted in just over a month with input from many of the group\u2019s members\u2014balanced in six years and boosted defense spending to $570 billion. It also repealed the Affordable Care Act through budget reconciliation and enacted reforms to grow the economy.\n\nWhile Republicans in the past have shied away from entitlement reform, Stutzman\u2019s blueprint also reformed safety-net programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid by enacting premium support to Medicare and allocating money for Medicaid as a block grant, in which states receive a lump sum of money from the government to use at their discretion.\n\nEnacting these reforms, Stutzman said, ensures the programs remain solvent for decades to come.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only fair from generation to generation that we keep commitments to seniors today, but let future generations have the opportunity to save for themselves and make sure the tax burden is not so high that they don\u2019t have opportunities to be successful in life,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong Republican lawmakers in the House, spending on defense proved to be a point of contention as leadership worked to satisfy the concerns of both defense and fiscal hawks. Defense hawks called for additional spending for the Defense Department, while fiscal hawks wanted to enforce mandatory spending caps.\n\n>>> Meet the Lawmaker Picked to Produce a Conservative Alternative to Obama\u2019s Budget\n\nThe House budget that was ultimately approved boosted the Pentagon\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations fund to $96 billion.\n\nStutzman told The Daily Signal he considers himself both a defense and fiscal hawk, and praised the RSC budget for increasing the Pentagon\u2019s spending while cutting non-defense spending. However, he urged those calling for more money for the Defense Department to find ways to offset spending.\n\n\u201cThe place we\u2019re going to have to reform for savings is our entitlement programs,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish defense hawks would help us with that. Now that the budget is passed, let\u2019s go back and take a look at the big picture, and look at the other 70 percent of the budget that is primarily non-defense spending.\u201d\n\nThe RSC is a 170-member caucus established in 1973 that advocates for a conservative agenda. RSC Chairman Bill Flores, R-Texas, named Stutzman chair of the Budget and Spending Task Force last month.\n\nThe Indiana Republican co-owns Stutzman Family Farms in Howe, Ind. The farm grows soybeans, green beans and seed corn.\n\nBefore becoming a member of the House, he served nearly a decade in the state legislature. Stutzman ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2010, finishing behind Dan Coats in the Republican primary. Coats currently holds the Senate seat, but announced this week he would be retiring.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely thinking about it,\u201d @RepStutzman said of a Senate run in 2016.\n\nSpeculation of Stutzman making another run for the Senate in 2016 has already begun to spread. Stutzman told The Daily Signal that he, his wife and two sons are in a place where they can \u201cseriously evaluate both sides.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely thinking about it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m talking to my wife and family, and as we talk with folks, [we\u2019ll] find out where I can make the best difference for conservative values and reforms. If it\u2019s in the Senate, we\u2019ll definitely consider that. If it\u2019s better to be in the House, we\u2019ll consider that as well.\u201d\n\n>>> Commentary: How Republicans Could Use Budget Maneuver to Repeal Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"description": "The RSC's budget didn\u2019t pass the House, but the lawmaker in charge of crafting the proposal is reflecting on the mark it\u2019s made on the GOP conference.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The RSC's budget didn\u2019t pass the House, but the lawmaker in charge of crafting the proposal is reflecting on the mark it\u2019s made on the GOP conference.", "title": "Reflections on RSC Budget from the Lawmaker Who Crafted It", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150326_Stutzman_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-26T17:50:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1yeMZ4q"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The RSC's budget didn\u2019t pass the House, but the lawmaker in charge of crafting the proposal is reflecting on the mark it\u2019s made on the GOP conference.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150326_Stutzman_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "Reflections on RSC Budget from the Lawmaker Who Crafted It", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-03-26T17:34:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-26T17:50:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Republican Study Committee, RSC budget, Marlin Stutzman, Bill Flores, Affordable Care Act, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Queen of the Hill, Dan Coats, Budget and Spending Task Force"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0675\"", "article_summary": ">>> Meet the Lawmaker Picked to Produce a Conservative Alternative to Obama\u2019s BudgetThe House budget that was ultimately approved boosted the Pentagon\u2019s Overseas Contingency Operations fund to $96 billion.\nIt addressed entitlement reform, increased defense spending, and garnered support from the conference.\nRSC Chairman Bill Flores, R-Texas, named Stutzman chair of the Budget and Spending Task Force last month.\nThe RSC\u2019s budget\u2014crafted in just over a month with input from many of the group\u2019s members\u2014balanced in six years and boosted defense spending to $570 billion.\nStutzman told The Daily Signal he considers himself both a defense and fiscal hawk, and praised the RSC budget for increasing the Pentagon\u2019s spending while cutting non-defense spending."}
