It found that products cost an average of 7 percent more than those meant for men, and that stuff marketed to women cost more 42 percent of the time, compared with men\u2019s products, which cost more 18 percent of the time.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of some products where it found a gender gap. It includes two scooters sold by Target that appear identical \u2014 except the one for girls is pink, and it costs twice as much.\n\nWashington Post asked Target about the scooter discrepancy:\n\nA Target spokesperson said the company lowered the price of the pink scooter after the report was released Friday, calling the discrepancy a \u201csystem error.\u201d (The retailer blamed the same kind of glitch last year after catching heat for selling black Barbies at more than double the price of white Barbies.)\n\nThe agency looked at stores in New York City, but it\u2019s part of a larger problem, DCA Commissioner Julie Menin said, noting that women are generally paid less than men.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy,\u201d she told the Washington Post. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just happening in New York. You see in the aisles the issue is clearly applicable to consumers across the country.\u201d\n\nThe biggest gaps in prices were found in hair care, which cost women an average of 48 percent more than men, according to The Post. That\u2019s more than four times the second place category, razor cartridges, which cost 11 percent more than they do for men.\n\nThis gender gap has existed for a while, as The Post notes.\n\nIn 1991, Ayres, a professor at Yale Law School, sent men and women to car dealerships across the Chicago area. He learned white women were charged 40 percent more than white men, supporting the stereotype that dealers assume women knew less about car values.\n\nThere\u2019s no federal law against pricing based on gender, though California and Dade County in Florida both have laws on the books. California banned it in 1996, citing a study that found \u201cadult women effectively pay a gender tax which costs each woman approximately $1,351 annually, or about $15 billion for all women in California.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "The City of New York in a recent study of 800 products found that those marketed to women tend to cost more than those for men.
