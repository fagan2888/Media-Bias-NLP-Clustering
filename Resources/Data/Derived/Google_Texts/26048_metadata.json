Again, I said \u201cno\u201d but said if I were running for anything, it would be in Florida and that 2018 would make more sense than 2016. Hugh then said he was going to trumpet the breaking news that I was running in 2018. I laughed and said \"Well, you can make that up if you want to.\u201d\n\nWe then got on to the topics I called in to discuss. Proving that it takes very little to make news these days, several blogs began talking about a future Senate run. The Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple wrote and asked whether I was serious about a run.\n\nThis was my response by email:\n\nNever given it a serious thought. I've always thought about getting back in public service one day but was just responding to 2016 question he always asks. I said no to POTUS run and 2016 Senate run and then suggested 2018 was more realistic, but that's not realistic either. I'm in a contract with NBC until 2019 and have a 6 year old and 11 year old in school very far away from Florida. Besides, I love what I am doing.\n\nIf I ever get back into public service, I suspect it is at least a decade away. And I doubt I will even then. Hugh got me talking when I was on my commute home on a Friday at the end of a long week. It's not going to happen.\n\nThanks for the question.\n\nAll the best,\n\nJoe\n\nNow back to painting Easter eggs with the kids.\n\nHappy Easter!", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>On my long commute home at the start of this holiday weekend, I did an interview with Hugh Hewitt.</p>", "title": "Commuting thoughts of a run", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/joe-scarborough/2015/04/commuting-thoughts-of-a-run-205005.html", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>On my long commute home at the start of this holiday weekend, I did an interview with Hugh Hewitt.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b00\"", "article_summary": "I said no to POTUS run and 2016 Senate run and then suggested 2018 was more realistic, but that's not realistic either.\nProving that it takes very little to make news these days, several blogs began talking about a future Senate run.\nThis was my response by email:Never given it a serious thought.\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Erik Wemple wrote and asked whether I was serious about a run.\nCommuting thoughts of a runOn my long commute home at the start of this holiday weekend, I did an interview with Hugh Hewitt, who asked as he always does if I am thinking of running for president next year."}
