It found that in five cases the builders paid about 11 percent of the cost, while the service picked up the remaining 89 percent.\n\nRelated: Why the Navy\u2019s New Combat Ship May Fail Against Real-World Threats\n\nEven though the Navy uses guaranty mechanisms in the contracts, the methods \u201cgenerally [have] no effect on improving cost and quality outcomes,\u201d the study said.\n\nIn one instance, GAO found that the exterior hull paint of an amphibious ship delivered by Huntington Ingalls Industries began to peel shortly after delivery.\n\nThe Navy \u201cdetermined that the shipbuilder did not adequately prepare the surface of the ship prior to applying a second coat of paint and submitted the issue as a guaranty claim,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe Navy docked the ship and the shipbuilder re-painted the vessel. The shipbuilder submitted invoices for the work completed and the Navy paid the shipbuilder $315,000 \u2014 even though the shipbuilder was responsible for the failure.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Navy\u2019s New $362 Million Ship Needs a Tow to Get Home\n\nThe GAO noted that the same amphibious ship, the Somerset, was delivered after a 32 percent cost overrun, which reduced Huntington\u2019s profit margin by just12 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, a destroyer built by General Dynamics needed $1.3 million in repairs. The government paid $900,000, while the defense company paid $460,000 worth of the tab.\n\nAll hope isn\u2019t lost, though. The GAO applauded the Coast Guard for the use of warranties for its Fast Response Cutter program. When one of the vessels required over $2.1 million in repairs, the government paid $630,000, while the shipbuilder ponied up $1.5 million.\n\nThe issue of fixed-price contracts has bubbled up in recent weeks as the Air Force looks to use the mechanism to cover some of the development and early deliveries of the its budget-busting B-21 bomber program.\n\nRelated: Half a Trillion for the Pentagon? Why Defense Spending Is Only Going Higher\n\nSenate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.), who has expressed displeasure over the contracting method in the past, has voiced concerns about the practice being used for a program where each plane is already expected to cost about $560 million.\n\nHe and other senators could take on the issue in the next few weeks when they sit down to write the fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. The bill serves as policy blueprint for all Defense Department policies and programs.\n\nIn the Navy\u2019s case, the GAO suggested that the service reconfigure its contracts so builders wouldn\u2019t profit from fixing mistakes they make. It also suggested that the Navy do a better job of tracking who is liable when screw-ups occur, the government or the contractor.\n\nThe Navy somewhat agreed with the watchdog\u2019s recommendations but pushed back on several points, including the idea that the service isn\u2019t adequately tracking shipbuilding mistakes.\n\nThe service generally promised to study the issues raised by the GAO, meaning observers shouldn\u2019t hold their breath for changes in contracting any time soon.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. Navy is paying shipbuilders a profit to fix mistakes they made constructing the service\u2019s vessels, even though the contracts used are supposed to prevent overpayment from happening, according to a new watchdog study.", "title": "The Navy Is Paying Contractors Millions to Fix Their Own Screw-ups", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/04/Navy-Paying-Contractors-Millions-Fix-Their-Own-Screw-ups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12222015_Littoral_Combat_Ship.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/04/Navy-Paying-Contractors-Millions-Fix-Their-Own-Screw-ups", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12222015_Littoral_Combat_Ship.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The U.S. Navy is paying shipbuilders a profit to fix mistakes they made constructing the service\u2019s vessels, even though the contracts used are supposed to prevent overpayment from happening, according to a new watchdog study.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It also suggested that the Navy do a better job of tracking who is liable when screw-ups occur, the government or the contractor.\n\u201cThe Navy docked the ship and the shipbuilder re-painted the vessel.\nThe Navy somewhat agreed with the watchdog\u2019s recommendations but pushed back on several points, including the idea that the service isn\u2019t adequately tracking shipbuilding mistakes.\nThe government paid $900,000, while the defense company paid $460,000 worth of the tab.\nIt found that in five cases the builders paid about 11 percent of the cost, while the service picked up the remaining 89 percent."}
