Lazarus has died, and his sister Mary is reproaching Jesus for not having been there because he might have saved his friend from death. She's weeping, everyone else gathered around her is weeping, and as The King James version has it: \"Jesus groaned in the spirit, and was troubled.\"\n\nWhen asked to see where Lazarus has been laid out (in a cave), he weeps, too. It's a very powerful scene, given wonderful life by Bernado Bertolucci in his celebrated Jesus of Nazareth mini-series.\n\nNow, can the former governor seriously compare anything in this highly dramatic and emotional scene of public mourning over the death of a beloved individual to the liberation of a whole class of people? Gays and lesbians who only want to share their love, devotion and commitment with each other? And compare the scene to the joyous normalization of the family life of hundreds of thousands of children living with same-sex parents, children who like their parents will no longer be second class citizens in the eyes of the law?\n\nIsn't Mike Huckabee, someone who considers himself a man of faith, taking his Lord's name in vain?\n\nLev Raphael is the author of 25 books in many genres including the memoir/travelogue My Germany.\n\nFollow Lev Raphael on Twitter: www.twitter.com/LevRaphael", "article_metadata": {"description": "In response to the 5-4 Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage yesterday, Mike Huckabee tweeted a number of things, including this:", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-06-28 12:05:38 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "In response to the 5-4 Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage yesterday, Mike Huckabee tweeted a number of things, including this:", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lev-raphael/mike-huckabees-blasphemy_b_7677996.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3125548/images/o-MIKE-HUCKABEE-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3125548/images/o-MIKE-HUCKABEE-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "creator": "LevRaphael", "site": "@HuffPostRelig", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "In response to the 5-4 Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage yesterday, Mike Huckabee tweeted a number of things, including this:"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-27 12:05:38 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7677996", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "religion", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "lazarus,jesus,gospel of john,King James Bible,Mike Huckabee,marriage equality,scotus,SCOTUS gay marriage,New Testament,14th Amendment,equal rights,bible stories,bible", "article": {"section": "Religion", "tag": "lazarus,jesus,gospel of john,King James Bible,Mike Huckabee,marriage equality,scotus,SCOTUS gay marriage,New Testament,14th Amendment,equal rights,bible stories,bible", "published_time": "2015-06-27 12:05:38 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-06-27 14:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23d0\"", "article_summary": "Isn't Mike Huckabee, someone who considers himself a man of faith, taking his Lord's name in vain?\nIt's a very powerful scene, given wonderful life by Bernado Bertolucci in his celebrated Jesus of Nazareth mini-series.\nIn response to the 5-4 Supreme Court decision that legalized gay marriage yesterday, Mike Huckabee tweeted a number of things, including this:My thoughts on the SCOTUS ruling that determined that same sex marriage is okay: \"Jesus wept.\"\nLev Raphael is the author of 25 books in many genres including the memoir/travelogue My Germany.\nLazarus has died, and his sister Mary is reproaching Jesus for not having been there because he might have saved his friend from death."}
