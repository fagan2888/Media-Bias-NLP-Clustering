They argue that since intelligence agencies were not able to pick up any of the Paris group\u2019s online chatter, it must have been using encryption. That was the conclusion of a French police report obtained by the Times.\n\nOfficials think Friday\u2019s capture of Salah Abdeslam \u2014 believed to be the last surviving participant from the attacks \u2014 could help shed light on this matter.\n\nThe Paris attacks have been used by policymakers and law enforcement officials as evidence that encryption is making it harder to detect terrorist plots before they can be carried out. On Capitol Hill, legislators are moving forward with a bill that would give authorities guaranteed access to secure data.\n\nBut digital rights groups and privacy advocates have accused these lawmakers of fear mongering, arguing there is scant evidence the Paris attackers relied on encryption. They believe robust encryption is necessary to maintain global security and online privacy.\n\nThe Times report offered some brief evidence that encryption software was in use on at least one of the attackers\u2019 laptops. A witness during the attack recounted seeing one of the terrorists pull out a laptop.\n\n\u201cIt was bizarre \u2014 he was looking at a bunch of lines, like lines of code. There was no image, no Internet,\u201d the witness said.\n\n\"Her description matches the look of certain encryption software, which ISIS claims to have used during the Paris attacks,\u201d the Times said.\n\nHowever, tech experts were quick to criticize the connection.\n\nJulian Sanchez, a tech and privacy-focused senior fellow at the Cato Institute, tweeted that the incident is more \u201csuggestive of a verbose boot,\" which starts up a device in a single-user mode.\n\n\u201cUsing encryption looks like \u2018reading a message\u2019 because you decrypt it first,\u201d he added.\n\n--This report was updated at 3:56 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Paris attackers reportedly used dozens of disposable phones.", "description": "The Paris attackers reportedly used dozens of disposable phones.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Paris attackers reportedly used dozens of disposable phones.", "title": "Report: Paris attackers relied on disposable phones", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/273747-paris-attackers-relied-on-burner-phones-not-encryption-report", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/paris_111815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-21T15:56:48-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-21T15:56-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/273747-paris-attackers-relied-on-burner-phones-not-encryption-report", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-21T11:26-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-21T11:26:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T15:56:48-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/273747-paris-attackers-relied-on-burner-phones-not-encryption-report", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Paris attackers reportedly used dozens of disposable phones.", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Paris attackers relied on disposable phones"}, "dcterms.title": "Report: Paris attackers relied on disposable phones"}, "article_summary": "The terrorists behind last November\u2019s Paris attacks relied on disposable phones to help plan their deadly assault, according to a published report.\nBut digital rights groups and privacy advocates have accused these lawmakers of fear mongering, arguing there is scant evidence the Paris attackers relied on encryption.\nThe Times report offered some brief evidence that encryption software was in use on at least one of the attackers\u2019 laptops.\n\u201cThey used only new phones that they would then discard, including several activated minutes before the attacks, or phones seized from their victims,\u201d the newspaper reported.\n\"Her description matches the look of certain encryption software, which ISIS claims to have used during the Paris attacks,\u201d the Times said."}
