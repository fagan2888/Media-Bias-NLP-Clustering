The list of most hated stocks also features a ton of companies slammed by the crash in oil prices.\n\n1) Chesapeake Energy, Southwestern Energy, Consul Energy 2015 performance: -77% to -80%\n\nCheap oil and gas have crushed profits in the energy industry. Oil prices have been clobbered this year, collapsing below $34 a barrel this week for the first time since early 2009. Natural gas prices too recently dropped to 2002 levels.\n\nShares of Chesapeake Energy have plummeted 80% so far this year, making it the worst S&P 500 performer through Monday.\n\nThe other two biggest S&P 500 losers this year are also in the same industry: Southwestern Energy and Consol Energy. Both companies are exposed to depressed oil and natural gas prices. Consol has the added trouble of being a major producer of coal, an energy source that has fallen badly out of favor due a push away from dirty fossil fuels.\n\nSome of the other worst S&P 500 performers this year include the following energy stocks: Kinder Morgan (-66%), Range Resources (-61%), ONEOK (-60%), Murphy Oil (-58%), Marathon Oil (-57%), Devon Energy (-53%), Ensco (-53%), Williams Companies (-52%) and National Oilwell Varco (-49%).\n\n2) Freeport-McMoRan 2015 performance: -73%\n\nFreeport-McMoRan is the biggest U.S. miner so it\u2019s poor performance makes sense given that copper and iron ore prices have plummeted to crisis levels.\n\nBut the company exacerbated the pain by doubling its commodity exposure in 2013 when it invested $9 billion in oil and gas assets.\n\nThat\u2019s why Freeport\u2019s shares have plummeted and the company was forced to slash spending and ditch its dividend. All of this is bad news for Carl Icahn, who owns 9% of the company.\n\n3) Fossil Group 2015 performance: -70%\n\nThe clock can\u2019t strike midnight on 2015 fast enough for Fossil Group.\n\nThe watch maker\u2019s shares have plunged to five-year lows due to a number of major challenges, including new competition from wearables and smartwatches made by Apple and others.\n\nFossil has also been slammed by the fizzling of the fashion-watch trend. That\u2019s especially true for its big moneymaker, the line of Michael Kors branded watches.\n\n4) NRG Energy 2015 performance: -62%\n\nNRG Energy\u2019s $1 billion investment in wind and solar power failed to create the profits its former CEO David Crane had envisioned. After 12 years on the job, Crane stepped down earlier this month.\n\nLike other independent power producers, NRG has also been hurt by cheap natural gas prices.\n\n5) Micron/Seagate 2015 performance: -59%, -48%\n\nMicron is really hurting from the drop in the price for memory chips.\n\nMicron makes chips that lets PC, smartphone and tablet users store data. That business has been hurt by tougher competition from Western Digital and Intel.\n\nLike Micron, Seagate has cornered an unsexy part of the tech world: the market for disk drives. But sales of disk drives have stalled out in recent years due to the weak PC industry and new technology.\n\nThat\u2019s why Seagate\u2019s profits have tumbled and the company was forced to recently slash more than 1,000 jobs.\n\n6) Wynn Resorts 2015 performance: -58%\n\nCasino investors have been dealt an awful hand lately.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true for Wynn Resorts shareholders. Wynn has been punished by a plunge in gambling revenue in Macau after the Chinese government cracked down on corruption in that gambling mecca.\n\nBut Steve Wynn, the company\u2019s CEO and largest shareholder, is gung ho about the future of his company and recently doubled down by purchasing 1 million shares.\n\nRival Las Vegas Sands is down \u201conly\u201d 27% this year, while MGM Resorts International is actually eking out a slight gain.\n\n7) Staples 2015 performance: -48%\n\nHalf of the market value of Staples has been \u201cerased\u201d this year.\n\nConsumers continue to cut back on office supplies due to a decline in printing. Sales have declined the past two years and its store footprint is shrinking.\n\nBut Staples suffered a big blow this month when the U.S. government announced plans to block its acquisition of Office Depot. The plan had been to join forces to take on competition from Amazon and Wal-Mart.\n\nStaples and Office Depot have vowed to fight the government\u2019s antitrust lawsuit, but it\u2019s not clear they\u2019ll win that fight.\n\n8) Viacom 2015 performance: -48%\n\nFears about consumers cutting cords have rippled throughout the media industry this year. Nowhere is that more true than at Viacom, which has suffered recent ratings trouble at MTV and Comedy Central.\n\nViacom has been hurt by a general decline in advertising for non-sports and non-live programming. The company posted a 7% fall in domestic ad sales last quarter.\n\nThere\u2019s also considerable uncertainty over the future of Sumner Redstone, the 92-year-old Viacom chairman. Manuela Herzer, Redstone\u2019s ex-girlfriend, has argued in court that the media mogul is a \u201cliving ghost\u201d who is practically unable to make decisions for himself.\n\n9) Macy\u2019s, Michael Kors 2015 performance: -47% (each)\n\nThe unseasonably warm weather and even warmer U.S. dollar have caused real problems for Macy\u2019s.\n\nThe department store chain blamed its poor November sales on the weather. It also warned that there are fewer foreign tourists because of the strength in the U.S. dollar.\n\nMichael Kors has been in free fall since early 2014 amid pressure from Kate Spade and others. Prices at Kors have been dropping \u2014 something that\u2019s never good for profits \u2014 due to heavy markdowns and a switch to smaller bags.\n\nOf course, they aren\u2019t the only two struggling retail stocks. The biggest S&P 500 losers this year include Ralph Lauren and Gap, whose Banana Republic brand continues to get crushed by fast fashion.\n\n10) Tenet Healthcare 2015 performance: 44%\n\nJust like the company\u2019s former director, Jeb Bush, 2015 hasn\u2019t been a year to remember for Tenet Healthcare.\n\nThe hospital operator\u2019s stock price has tumbled due to declines in hospital patient volumes, after experiencing an increase in 2014 from Obamacare. Tenet has also raised concerns by racking up nearly $15 billion of debt, partially from a pair of major acquisitions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- An alarming number of big U.S. stocks lost half their value in 2015.
