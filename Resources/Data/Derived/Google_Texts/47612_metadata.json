Our guys will behave themselves.\" - Richard Preston\n\nA Maryland-based Ku Klux Klan group apparently once again has been granted permission to rally at the Gettysburg National Military Park.\n\nRichard Preston, head of the Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said Saturday that the group will be at the battlefield from noon to 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 9.\n\nBecause of the government shutdown, the National Park Service canceled the group's permit to assemble Oct. 5 on the lawn north of Meade\u2019s Headquarters along Taneytown Road. The group marched in downtown Gettysburg that day instead.\n\nPreston said he filed revised paperwork Friday and his group, which is based in Rosedale in Baltimore County, and was given the Nov. 9 date by the park service.\n\nAttempts to reach representatives with the parks service in Gettysburg on Saturday afternoon were unsuccessful.\n\n\"We weren't going to forget about the permit,\" Preston said. \"We're not going to stop telling the American people what is going on in their country.\"\n\nPreston said he expects about five to 10 members of his group to attend the rally, plus members from as many as three other Klan groups.\n\n\"It will be peaceful,\" Preston said. \"Our guys will behave themselves.\"\n\nPreston said speakers at the rally will talk about the \"illegitimacy of the presidency of Barrack Obama,\" \"the unconstitutionality of Obamacare\" and illegal immigration.\n\n\"We believe Obama is not the legitimate president because of his dual citizenship in another country,\" Preston said. \"Any other president would have been removed from office by now.\"\n\nHopes that Obama would be in Gettysburg on Nov. 19 to take part in ceremonies commemorating the 150th anniversary of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address were dashed Wednesday when the administration announced Obama will not attend.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@topstories','gettysburg','gettysburg150','kkk','richard preston'", "title": "Ku Klux Klan group says it will assemble at Gettysburg battlefield next week", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Ku Klux Klan group says it will assemble at Gettysburg battlefield next week\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/ku_klux_klan_group_says_it_wil.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/richard-preston-kkk-7ef66d28886e7ac8.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11561486\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-02T16:30:08Z\", \"author\": \"Joe Elias | jelias@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@topstories\",\"gettysburg\",\"gettysburg150\",\"kkk\",\"richard preston\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/13511479-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@josephmelias", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary", "description": "Richard Preston, the head of the Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the group will be at the battlefield from noon to 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 9."}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, November 04, 2013,  7:28 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/richard-preston-kkk-7ef66d28886e7ac8.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jelias\", \"author_nickname\": \"Joe Elias | jelias@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"471\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Breaking News on PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "Richard Preston, the head of the Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the group will be at the battlefield from noon to 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 9.", "title": "Ku Klux Klan group says it will assemble at Gettysburg battlefield next week", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2013/11/ku_klux_klan_group_says_it_wil.html", "image": "http://www.pennlive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, November 02, 2013, 12:29 PM", "article_author": "Joe Elias | jelias@pennlive.com", "Description": "Richard Preston, the head of the Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the group will be at the battlefield from noon to 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 9."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd224\"", "article_summary": "- Richard PrestonA Maryland-based Ku Klux Klan group apparently once again has been granted permission to rally at the Gettysburg National Military Park.\nRichard Preston, head of the Confederate White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said Saturday that the group will be at the battlefield from noon to 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 9.\nAttempts to reach representatives with the parks service in Gettysburg on Saturday afternoon were unsuccessful.\nPreston said he expects about five to 10 members of his group to attend the rally, plus members from as many as three other Klan groups.\nThe group marched in downtown Gettysburg that day instead."}
