Her blithe endorsement of the health-care insurance available neglects what is really happening in the individual insurance market.\n\nOnce upon a time, my husband and I paid a comfortable $350 a month for a high-deductible, catastrophic health-care plan. That premium inched up every year as we got older, which, while annoying, was understandable. Enter the Affordable Care Act and the requirement that we buy a new plan that would \u201ccomply\u201d with it. Our $543 monthly premium skyrocketed to $1,432 per month, an unsustainable amount for us. We had to cancel that insurance and find another plan that \u201conly\u201d costs $990 a month and bumps two of our three long-term doctors out of our network.
