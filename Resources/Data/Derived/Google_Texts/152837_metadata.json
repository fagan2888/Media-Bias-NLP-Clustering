From its K Street headquarters in Sacramento, the \u201cCal Chamber,\u201d as it\u2019s colloquially known, analyzes some 3,000 pieces of legislation every year. In the past 10 years, 341 of 353 \u2014 nearly 97 percent \u2014 of the bills identified by the California Chamber of Commerce failed to become law. The vast majority of these were never passed by the Legislature and sent to the Governor. Instead, they were killed in committee or voted down by the Legislature or amended to take out provisions opposed by the chamber.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s weapon of choice is its highly publicized \u201cJob Killers List,\u201d a roll call of bills the chamber claims threaten the interests of business, though its press releases tend to stress the bills\u2019 menace to California\u2019s economy and its workers\u2019 jobs.\n\nThe chamber\u2019s job killers list has nearly been as effective under the governorship of the Democrat Jerry Brown as under that of the Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, begging the question, How can the chamber stop so many bills in a state Legislature in which Democrats enjoy supermajorities in both houses? Despite repeated requests for interviews, representatives of the Cal Chamber did not to speak to Capital and Main. A spokesperson did, however, provide requested statistics on its job killers project and offered this explanation of the chamber\u2019s success in an email:\n\nThe reason the Chamber has been so successful over the years with our Job Killer campaign is that we have done an excellent job of educating legislators and Governors about how these bills will hurt job creators and California\u2019s competitiveness.\n\nExactly how that is accomplished will be a subject for discussion in a later feature. For now, we offer a survey of bills that were shot down over the last two years, thanks in part to the chamber branding them as job killers. (Read about more targets of the job killers list in Bill Raden\u2019s \u201cCapitol Punishment\u201d sidebar.)\n\nThe Walmart Loophole\n\nThis year Los Angeles Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez, a Democrat, thought he had found a solution to a vexing problem involving medical coverage for low-wage workers. The federal Affordable Care Act requires large employers to pay a penalty to offset the costs of public subsidies for their employees\u2019 healthcare. But under a loophole, there is no penalty for the employers whose approximately 250,000 California workers are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program for the poor. That is because large companies that pay low wages can shift full-time workers to part-time status. For Walmart employees that shift would mean they are no longer eligible for company health benefits and would instead become eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\nGomez proposed to close the loophole by imposing stiff penalties on large companies that push their employees onto the Medi-Cal rolls. Assembly Bill 880 would have done that by fining companies with at least 500 employees about $5,000 for each employee who became eligible for Medi-Cal.\n\nAB 880 seemed like a winner in an Assembly controlled by a Democratic supermajority, and it also enjoyed a powerful ally in organized labor. But then one of the state\u2019s most effective business lobbies swung into action on behalf of the country\u2019s biggest private employer.\n\nGomez\u2019s bill, the Chamber of Commerce claimed, would discourage the hiring of entry or re-entry workers, harm California\u2019s fragile economy and unfairly punish state employers. The chamber wasn\u2019t alone in fighting Walmart\u2019s war: Other business groups piled on, including the California Retailers Association, the California Grocers Association, the California Hotel and Lodging Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers and the Orange Council Business Council. The chamber released a video that opened with a montage of California workers picking fruit, labeling boxes at a distribution center and driving trucks. Those hardest hit by AB 880, the video claimed, would be farmers, restaurants, students and nonprofit organizations, such as the California Community College Foundation. Nowhere was Walmart\u2019s name heard or seen in the two and a half minute clip, which stated that violating companies would be on the hook for fines ranging from $6,000 to $15,000.\n\nAB 880 made it onto the chamber\u2019s Job Killer list on April 25; on June 27 it was declared dead after it failed to win a supermajority in the assembly. It received 46 Yes votes, with 27 lawmakers voting against it and six abstaining. A total of 54 Yes votes, or a two-thirds majority, was required.\n\nPaid Family Leave: A Mega Job Killer?\n\nDoes the chamber really believe its own rhetoric about nearly any new regulatory law being a job killer? A recently published book that details the chamber\u2019s opposition to California\u2019s landmark paid family leave law \u2014 despite being on the chamber\u2019s job-killer list \u2013 suggests it doesn\u2019t. The book, Unfinished Business, is based on original data from fieldwork and surveys of employers, employees and the larger California population. It challenges the chamber\u2019s claims of job loss and economic disarray.\n\nCalifornia passed the nation\u2019s first comprehensive paid family leave program in 2002. The law, which provides employees with up to six weeks of paid leave to care for a new baby or seriously ill child, parent or spouse, was approved by the Legislature and signed by then Governor Gray Davis in September, 2002.\n\nAt the time, the bill was bitterly opposed by business groups led by the California Chamber of Commerce, which placed it on its job killer list. After it passed, Cal Chamber president Allan Zaremberg said, \u201cWe\u2019ve opposed a lot of bills, but this is one of the worst.\u201d And in an opinion column in the San Diego Union-Tribune after its passage, Zaremberg and the presidents of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association, and the California Business Roundtable denounced the new family leave law as a \u201cmega job-killing bill.\u201d\n\nHave, nearly a decade after the law went into effect in 2004, any of those job killing predictions come true? Not according to Unfinished Business\u2019 authors, Ruth Milkman, a professor of sociology at the City University of New York Graduate Center, and Eileen Appelbaum, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cThese widely expressed fears regarding [the bill\u2019s] potentially negative effects on business have not materialized,\u201d the authors write. They say that large majorities of employers reported that its impact on productivity, profitability and performance was negligible or positive. \u201cMost of the managers we interviewed felt that the positive benefits of [the law] outweighed its negative features and some were positively enthusiastic,\u201d they conclude.\n\nWhile their results show that the family leave act hasn\u2019t been a job killer after all, Milkman says that the California Chamber is quick to put that label on bills it simply doesn\u2019t like.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the rhetoric,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cPeople want growth. If they can link a proposed bill and say it retards growth and kills jobs, that can be very persuasive. They take that approach. They basically oppose anything that affects their members. They don\u2019t want to be told what to do.\u201d\n\nA decade after the family paid act successfully went into effect, the California Chamber continues to fight against expansion of the law. Its 2013 job killer list targeted a bill from state Senator Mark DeSaulnier (D-Concord) that would have prevented California businesses from firing or otherwise retaliating against employees who take advantage of the paid family leave program.\n\nSupporters said Senate Bill 761 was needed since many people did not seek the program\u2019s benefits because they were afraid of being fired or retaliated against in other ways. The California Chamber branded the bill a job killer because it would transform the family leave program from a wage replacement program to a new protected leave of absence that would burden businesses. DeSaulnier\u2019s bill failed to pass the Legislature.\n\nKilling the Sugary Drinks Tax\n\nThe chamber\u2019s efforts to stop a bill intended to curb childhood obesity shows how it uses its job-killer label to fight legislation that could help millions of Californians \u2013 in order to protect a narrow spectrum of business interests.\n\nLast February, state Senator Bill Monning (D-Carmel) introduced Senate Bill 622, which would have raised $1.7 billion annually by imposing a penny per ounce tax on soda and other sugary drinks. The money was intended to help solve the childhood obesity and diabetes epidemics in California by funding school and community programs, according to California Center for Public Health Advocacy, a nonprofit organization and the bill\u2019s sponsor.\n\nThe group noted that obesity rates have more than doubled among children and tripled among adolescents in the past three decades; the center claims that unless the obesity epidemic is reversed, one in three children born after 2000 \u2014 and nearly half of Latino and African-American children \u2014 will develop Type 2 diabetes in their lifetime.\n\nElizabeth Velten, state and national policy coordinator for the center, says that soda and other sugary drinks play a \u201cunique role in development of obesity and diabetes and obesity,\u201d and that the bill called on the manufacturers of those products to \u201ctake responsibility.\u201d\n\nGenoveva Islas-Hooker, program director of the Fresno-based Central California Regional Obesity Prevention Program, adds, \u201cA soda tax would have tremendous benefits in helping to provide resources to the communities such as the one I work in.\u201d Islas-Hooker\u2019s motivation is fueled in part by her own history: As a sixth grader, she gave her aunt insulin injections for diabetes.\n\nSB 622 targeted sugary drinks and no other junk food because sugary drinks are the worst culprits, supporters said. Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has stated that taxing sugary drinks could be the \u201csingle most effective measure to reverse the obesity epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe soda tax wasn\u2019t favored solely by health-care advocates. A 2012 Field poll of likely California voters found that 68 percent would support a sugar-sweetened beverage tax to fund childhood obesity prevention programs, such as healthier school menus and more physical education.\n\nThe chamber vehemently disagreed. In an April letter to the state Senate Committee on Governance and Finance, it stated, \u201cThe California Chamber of Commerce OPPOSES SB 622, as introduced on February 22, 2013, which has been labeled as a JOB KILLER, as it is a targeted tax on one industry that will ultimately harm consumers or workers within the beverage industry.\u201d\n\nOpposition to the bill also came from more than a dozen other groups, including PepsiCo, the California Distributors Association, California Grocers Association, California Nevada Soft Drink Association, California Restaurant Association, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association and the National Organization of Theater Owners of California and Nevada.\n\nNonetheless, the bill was approved by the Senate Governance and Finance Committee in April and by the Senate Health and Appropriations committees in May. But it never came up for a floor vote because it was held on the Senate Appropriations suspense file in late May. (Placing a bill in the suspense file is a maneuver that allows legislative leaders to quietly kill or place on hold bills that a majority of legislators might support if the bills were allowed to be voted on in public sessions.)\n\nPrior to SB 622\u2019s introduction, studies conducted by the Institute for Health Research and Policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago discredited beverage industry claims that sweet-drink taxes would kill jobs. AnApril 2013 letter, sent to the California state Governance and Finance Committee, specifically addressed industry charges against AB 622. The letter, signed by four senior researchers at the institute, first attacked the methodology of business-hired research \u201cproving\u201d the bill\u2019s devastating effect on jobs, then concluded that the institute\u2019s own research showed that the opposite was true:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bills deemed hurtful to businesses have a tendency to go nowhere in the state Legislature", "title": "California business group uses \u201cjob killer\u201d list to help Wal-Mart", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bills deemed hurtful to businesses have a tendency to go nowhere in the state Legislature", "title": "California business group uses \u201cjob killer\u201d list to help Wal-Mart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/07/calif_business_group_uses_job_killer_list_to_help_walmart_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/walmart_strike4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bills deemed hurtful to businesses have a tendency to go nowhere in the state Legislature", "title": "California business group uses \u201cjob killer\u201d list to help Wal-Mart", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/walmart_strike4.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gary Cohn", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California, Capital & Main, chamber of commerce, Poverty, Retail, Walmart", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "At the time, the bill was bitterly opposed by business groups led by the California Chamber of Commerce, which placed it on its job killer list.\nA recently published book that details the chamber\u2019s opposition to California\u2019s landmark paid family leave law \u2014 despite being on the chamber\u2019s job-killer list \u2013 suggests it doesn\u2019t.\nIn the past 10 years, 341 of 353 \u2014 nearly 97 percent \u2014 of the bills identified by the California Chamber of Commerce failed to become law.\nThe chamber wasn\u2019t alone in fighting Walmart\u2019s war: Other business groups piled on, including the California Retailers Association, the California Grocers Association, the California Hotel and Lodging Association, the International Council of Shopping Centers and the Orange Council Business Council.\nDoes the chamber really believe its own rhetoric about nearly any new regulatory law being a job killer?"}
