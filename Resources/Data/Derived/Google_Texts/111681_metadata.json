(WLFI) \u2013 Presidential hopefuls have been making their rounds throughout the Hoosier state for the past couple weeks now, grasping support from Hoosier voters.\n\nFor the second time this week, a presidential candidate has paid a visit to Tippecanoe County. On Wednesday, Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a stop at Purdue University.\n\nSunday afternoon, Texas senator and GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz held a rally at Faith East Community Center in Lafayette.\n\nCandidates are making a last ditch effort to gain support from Hoosiers around the state before Tuesday\u2019s primary election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the people of Indiana who decide this state,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nRight now, Cruz is behind GOP front runner Donald Trump in the delegate count.\n\nTrump is just 241 delegates shy of clenching the nomination, which makes Indiana crucial for his campaign.\n\nCruz said all eyes are on the Hoosier state leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cIndiana is a battle ground. Right now, Donald Trump and I are neck and neck in this state,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe entire country is looking to Indiana. Indiana has a national platform, a national megaphone, and it really is a choice for the people of Indiana.\u201d\n\nLast week, Cruz gained the support of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.\n\nAfter meeting privately with all three GOP candidates, Pence announced that he would be endorsing Cruz.\n\nCruz said he supports Pence and is happy to have his backing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Governor Pence. I think he\u2019s a strong conservative, you look at his economic policies. He\u2019s cut taxes, he\u2019s reduced regulation, and we\u2019ve seen private sector jobs growing here in Indiana,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nBy repealing ObamaCare, passing a simple flat tax and reigning in those regulators who drove American jobs across seas, Cruz said more Americans will be back at work under his watch.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to see millions and millions of new, high-paying jobs, jobs coming back to America, manufacturing jobs coming back to the state of Indiana,\u201d said Cruz.\n\nHe also touched on topics such as religious liberties and illegal immigration.\n\nFor now, Cruz is focused on meeting with voters and listening to what they have to say.\n\n\u201cI think anyone running for president owes it to the voters to look them in the eyes, to shake their hands, to answer their questions \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nOn Monday, Cruz will appear at rallies organized by the Keep the Promise PAC in Fort Wayne and Indianapolis.\n\nThere will also be a rally at the Indiana State Fairgrounds Monday night where Cruz will be joined by running mate Carly Fiorina and radio host Glenn Beck.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAFAYETTE, Ind.
