As Attorney General, Holder defended the ObamaCare HHS Mandate forcing employers to provide and fund contraceptives in their health plans.\n\nFormer U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu consistently voted for abortion-on-demand. Landrieu, who is described by the university as a \u201clong standing civil servant and agent of change,\u201d was the speaker Xavier President Norman Francis speculated Archbishop Aymond had a problem with, according to a local media report.\n\nPro-abortion Landrieu lost her Senate seat by a wide-margin in a December 6 run-off election against pro-life Republican Bill Cassidy.\n\nA Roman Catholic, she opposed the 2012-proposed Respect for Rights of Conscience Act, which would secure Catholic organizations' conscience rights, and she was part of a group of senators supporting legislation that would overturn the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision that upheld employers\u2019 right not to pay for abortion-inducing drugs under ObamaCare's HHS mandate.\n\n\"Although I personally believe that life begins at conception, I believe the last place the government needs to be is in the church, in the doctor\u2019s office, or in the bedroom,\u201d Landrieu said.\n\n\"Some of the bills being passed around the country are just very intrusive to personal decisions and very harmful to women and girls, you know, to their physical health and life,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\u201d\n\nShe opposed fetal pain legislation, saying that \u201c20 weeks is not the norm for being able to live outside of a hospital.\u201d\n\nBasketball star Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson, the L.A. Lakers legend who has been HIV-positive for more than 20 years, has advocated for HIV/AIDS prevention and so-called \u201csafe sex,\u201d which entails condom use.\n\nCarnegie Corporation President Vartan Gregorian is also scheduled to address Xavier\u2019s 2015 graduating class in May.\n\nFounded by St. Katharine Drexel and the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, the school is America\u2019s only historically black and Catholic university, according to the Xavier website. And the university is standing by its choices.\n\n\u201cFour distinguished national servant leaders from differing professions will share life lessons with graduates,\u201d the university news release stated. Each will receive an honorary degree.\n\nIn his letter, Archbishop Aymond cited the 2004 USCCB document Catholics in Political Life when recently writing Xavier, which says the Catholic community and Catholic institutions should not publicly honor those who oppose the teachings of the Church.\n\n\u201cThey should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions,\u201d the US Bishops\u2019 document says.\n\nThe bishops\u2019 statement specifically addresses lawmakers, saying, \u201cThose who formulate law therefore have an obligation in conscience to work toward correcting morally defective laws, lest they be guilty of cooperating in evil and in sinning against the common good.\u201d\n\nXavier responded this week via a statement that says it stands by its choices.\n\nThe school called the speakers \"leaders who have made extraordinary contributions to humanity,\" \u2013 while saying at the same time Xavier remains committed to its Catholic identity. The administration said it based its selection of speakers on the honorees' \"individual accomplishments and steadfast commitments, especially in the area of civil rights and social justice.\"\n\nClick \"like\" to support Catholics Restoring the Culture!\n\nXavier University\u2019s commencement is scheduled for Saturday, May 9.\n\nArchbishop Aymond has a history of advocating for the Catholic position on public issues and standing up to dissenting Catholic organizations and institutions.
