The future of one landmark building in downtown Meridian has long been in question. And now the Threefoot family is sharing their hopes for their family's legacy.

The city has been vying for an investor to come in and bring the Threefoot building back to life. An offer hasn't come yet. The Threefoot family isn't involved in the discussions of the building's future, but David M. Threefoot says his dream is to see the building used as a hotel with a convention center and more living spaces above.

"And then maybe on the top 8 or 10 floors there would be private condos," he says. "And then the family's talked about maybe if it's affordable, maybe buying a small condo, so we could have a presence in the city again. "

There are still no official plans for the Threefoot building's future.
