I enjoy observing the look on people\u2019s faces when I reveal this preference. \u201cBut how can you like him?\u201d some people ask. The reason is quite simple. I prefer characters who aren\u2019t clearly good or evil. Give me a mix of both over a hero. We all know heroes don\u2019t really exist.\n\nBut there\u2019s one other reason that I adore Snape. I\u2019m attracted to English and Scottish snark. I like assholes with a British accent. From Hugh Laurie as Dr. House to Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock to even Dylan Moran (not British, but Irish accents work well enough for these purposes, too) playing a misanthropic, wiseass bookstore owner in \u201cBlack Books,\u201d I\u2019m all about this trope.\n\nThe British \u201chave the world\u2019s sexiest accents,\u201d the Guardian reported in February. This information comes from a Time Out Global Dating Survey. But I think it\u2019s even sexier when matched with a dry wit.\n\nSo I was more than pleased to discover two new shows this season that satisfy my itch. Steve Coogan plays an unhappy middle-aged ad executive in \u201cHappyish,\u201d a show created by the novelist Shalom Auslander for Showtime, which just concluded its first season, with the fate of a second still up in the air. \u201cHappyish\u201d isn\u2019t afraid to use a bunch of profanity and poke fun at the brands we\u2019re inundated with (the Keebler Elves and the Geico Gecko, for instance.) The writing really shines in the moments when Coogan delivers his negative views on the world:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Prozac. It\u2019s a hard-on killer,\u201d he tells his wife while they\u2019re in bed.\n\n\u201cTry some Viagra,\u201d she suggests.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that the Viagra will interfere with the Prozac. That\u2019s life. I\u2019m either soft and happy, or miserable and hard.\u201d\n\nGive me the miserable and hard any day of the week. Or the completely ridiculous manchild I wouldn\u2019t be attracted to if he had an American accent. Another 2015 debut with the worst title ever, Netflix\u2019s \u201cScrotal Recall\u201d is a charming romantic comedy about a man who discovers he has chlamydia, and is forced to go through his list of all of the women he has slept with in order to inform them. The show flashes between the present and the past, and it\u2019s addictive in a tender way. Dylan\u2019s friend Luke is silly, a bit of a commitment-phobe, and reminiscent of Will Arnett\u2019s charmingly oblivious character, G.O.B., in \u201cArrested Development.\u201d He\u2019s sexy in his complete lack of self-awareness. I find that trait infuriating in American men, but it works when the guy sounds posh. Most importantly: he makes me laugh. One of the best moments in the show is when he reenacts \u201cPoint Break\u201d in a moment of unfiltered enthusiasm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-deprecating? Sarcastic?
