The growing potato salad account is going to sprout up quite a hefty tax bill.\n\nSince funds raised through the Kickstarter and similar sites are considered income (though some expenses are deductible if they are related to the project) the Tax Foundation estimates that if the campaign stopped right now, with a total of $70,912, Brown would have to pay about $21,000 in taxes on his hilarious Internet joke. That\u2019s a lot of salad.\n\nHere\u2019s the Tax Foundation\u2019s rundown, which includes some assumptions about Brown\u2019s tax filing and the expenses he could deduct:\n\n*Update: According to The Huffington Post, the campaign lost nearly $30,000 on Thursday, since donors apparently began changing their minds and pulling their donations. On Wednesday evening Brown, had raised more than $70,000, on Thursday morning, that number had fallen to $43,984--which will, of course, mean a lower tax bill.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s only been a few days since a top contender for the world\u2019s most obnoxious Kicksta", "title": "Kickstarter\u2019s Potato Salad Guy Faces a $21,000 Tax Bill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/09/Kickstarter-s-Potato-Salad-Guy-Faces-21000-Tax-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07072014_Potato_Salad.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/09/Kickstarter-s-Potato-Salad-Guy-Faces-21000-Tax-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07072014_Potato_Salad.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "It\u2019s only been a few days since a top contender for the world\u2019s most obnoxious Kicksta", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa5e\"", "article_summary": "The growing potato salad account is going to sprout up quite a hefty tax bill.\nThat\u2019s a lot of dough for potato salad \u2014 but as the good people at the Tax Foundation point out, \u201cDanger\u201d Brown\u2019s fundraising comes with some financial peril.\nRelated: Potato Salad Kickstarter Sprouts Up Thousands of DollarsYou read that right: 70 Grand in about three days\u2026and Brown has several weeks to go until his fundraising campaign ends.\nYou can thank Ohio native Zack \u201cDanger\u201d Brown for creating the now infamous potato salad Kickstarter, which has now raised more than $70,000 from about 5,000 donors (who presumably have nothing else to do with their money).\nOn Wednesday evening Brown, had raised more than $70,000, on Thursday morning, that number had fallen to $43,984--which will, of course, mean a lower tax bill."}
