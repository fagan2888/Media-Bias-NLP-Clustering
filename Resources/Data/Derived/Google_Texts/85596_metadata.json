Among other impediments, the Volcker Rule torched his candidacy. He was against it, while those eager to ward off another financial meltdown \u2013 and to punish bankers -- are for it.\n\nSummers has been sharply criticized by those on the left for having championed financial deregulation in the past, and for having a jaundiced view of newly proposed rules. The reality is that Summers understands financial markets, and appreciates the difficulty \u2013 and the risks \u2013 of overregulation.\n\nSummers is not the only banking savant who thinks the Volcker Rule \u2013 that prohibits most large financial firms for trading for their own account -- could damage our financial industry, and possibly our system. Charles Calomiris, professor at ColumbiaBusinessSchool, questions whether adopting the controversial measure could topple our global financial leadership.\n\nIn a recent piece in The American, Mr. Calomiris describes the Volcker Rule as a \u201cmajor threat to banks\u2019 ability to continue acting as market makers\u2026\u201d, observing that it is almost impossible to distinguish proprietary trading from market making. He\u2019s right. Three years in, and regulators cannot figure out how to write a law that makes that distinction.\n\nIn Calomiris\u2019 view, what he calls \u201cglobal universal banks\u201d (and the rest of the world calls banks too big to fail) are uniquely capable of making markets across the world in financial instruments; there are no other firms large enough to perform that role. He argues that the efficiencies delivered from these behemoths have led to unprecedented liquidity. He further suggests that if U.S. banks don\u2019t play this role, European and Asian banks will step in, operating outside the U.S. The damage to New York, and to the U.S., in his view, would be substantial.\n\nRELATED: WHY LARRY SUMMERS IS THE WRONG MAN FOR THE FED JOB\n\nThese alarms are not politically correct in a nation still struggling to bounce back from the worst financial crisis of our lifetimes. \u201cToo big to fail\u201d has become a clich\u00e9, and also a political football as memories of the financial bailouts enrage both the right and the left. There is no better way for financial types to seek political rehabilitation than to vilify their own industry. Former Barclay\u2019s CEO Bob Diamond wrote an op-ed in The Financial Times this week voicing concerns that our banks are still \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d Talk about biting the hand that (over) fed you!\n\nA great many Americans (including President Obama) blame bankers for the horrifying losses of jobs and income that trailed behind the collapse of Lehman five years ago. They are partly correct, but the damaging chain reaction was more complex and possible future safeguards are more problematic than people want to hear. The popular view is that ladling even more regulations on top of our financial institutions will cure all ills. It is not true.\n\nNumerous weak links brought down financial markets \u2013 and most remain in place. They include the government\u2019s push to weaken lending standards for home loans, the outsized role in the housing markets of Fannie and Freddie, the vulnerability of money market funds to sudden outflows of cash, the influence of and ineptness of the credit rating agencies, and a securitization process in which the lender had no \u201cskin in the game.\u201d Few of these troublesome issues have been fixed.\n\nFannie and Freddie actually became more dominant players in the mortgage arena in the years after the crash, accounting for 77 percent of all mortgages in 2012, up from 40 percent before the collapse. The government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) are providing credit to a marketplace that is still extremely risk-averse and are annoying the White House by favoring the safest credits. It won\u2019t be long before advocates of broad home ownership push them to lower credit standards to accommodate less capable borrowers.\n\nRELATED: YELLIN\u2019 FOR YELLEN: WHY THE MARKET RALLY MAY NOT LAST\n\nMoney market funds, with $2.5 trillion in assets, remain vulnerable to sudden outflows of cash. Regulators are trying to solve the problem by dislodging funds from their traditional $1 net asset value, saying a fixed net asset value (NAV) produces an unrealistic sense of security among investors.\n\nThey argue that it was when the Reserve Primary Funds \u201cbroke the buck\u201d in 2008 that investors ran for the hills, pulling out more nearly half a trillion dollars overnight, and destabilizing the short-term credit markets. That\u2019s akin to suggesting that it\u2019s the flashing \u201cWarning\u201d sign on a crashing airliner that most alarms passengers.\n\nMeanwhile, the credit rating agencies continue in the drivers\u2019 seats. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s have had to make some cosmetic alterations, but their business model is unchanged. At the end of the day, regulators could not pin down how exactly the agencies misjudged the securities that ultimately foundered, and therefore gave up trying to fix the problem.\n\nAn Australian court may have stumbled on the truth, when a judge determined that a \u201creasonably competent\u201d firm would not have rated an overvalued security triple A, but then admitted that the issue in question was \u201cgrotesquely complicated.\u201d\n\nYes, these issues are \u201cgrotesquely complicated,\u201d which is why creating safeguards is not only difficult, but also risky. The unintended consequences of changing our financial regulations can be as harmful as the problems they are meant to solve. Recently, regulators overturned the Dodd-Frank rule that banks retain a portion of most mortgages they write, noting that the requirement that lenders have \u201cskin in the game\u201d would hold back the housing recovery.\n\nIn a similar vein, New York Fed chief Bill Dudley declared earlier this year that Dodd-Frank heightened the possibility of a run on money market funds. The law, he said in a speech, \u201craised the hurdle for the Federal Reserve to exercise its Section 13.3 emergency lending authority and because Congress has explicitly precluded the U.S. Treasury from guaranteeing money market mutual fund assets\u2026this may cause investors to be even more skittish in the future.\u201d In other words, in their zeal to protect taxpayers, authorities may have brought a crisis closer.\n\nLarry Summers understands this reality, and the workings of the financial markets, better than most. In my view, it was his provocative personality, and not his common sense approach to financial regulation, that disqualified him.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Larry Summers is out \u2013 having withdrawn his name from the short list of possible succe", "title": "5 Years Later: Overregulation Can Cripple Our Economy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/09/18/5-Years-Later-Overregulation-Can-Cripple-Our-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08292011_Economy_Causes_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2013/09/18/5-Years-Later-Overregulation-Can-Cripple-Our-Economy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08292011_Economy_Causes_article.jpg", "creator": "@lizpeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Larry Summers is out \u2013 having withdrawn his name from the short list of possible succe", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ddd\"", "article_summary": "The reality is that Summers understands financial markets, and appreciates the difficulty \u2013 and the risks \u2013 of overregulation.\nRELATED: YELLIN\u2019 FOR YELLEN: WHY THE MARKET RALLY MAY NOT LASTMoney market funds, with $2.5 trillion in assets, remain vulnerable to sudden outflows of cash.\nIn a similar vein, New York Fed chief Bill Dudley declared earlier this year that Dodd-Frank heightened the possibility of a run on money market funds.\nNumerous weak links brought down financial markets \u2013 and most remain in place.\nLarry Summers understands this reality, and the workings of the financial markets, better than most."}
