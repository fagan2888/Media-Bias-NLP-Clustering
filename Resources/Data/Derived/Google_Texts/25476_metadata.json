March 20, 2016. (Carl Ackerman/Clemson sports information)\n\nCLEMSON \u2013 Seth Beer should still be in high school. Instead, the freshman outfielder is single-handedly lifting the Clemson baseball team back to national relevance.\n\nBeer blasted a walkoff home run to button up the Tigers\u2019 3-2 victory over Boston College in ten innings Sunday, sealing a series sweep and improving Clemson to 16-3 overall, 5-1 in the ACC. Clemson is now tied with Florida State and North Carolina for the ACC\u2019s best conference records, looking for a better finish than recent seasons around the .500 mark in league play.\n\nBeer enrolled at Clemson in January, and quickly elevated to the Tigers\u2019 cleanup spot. He stroked his ninth home run of the season, already more than halfway to the Clemson freshman single-season record, on a 1-0 count facing BC reliever John Nicklas with two out in the bottom of the tenth. That is Clemson\u2019s first walk-off home run since Kevin Bradley\u2019s bomb beat USC Upstate on May 14, 2013.\n\nThe 19-year-old Beer has been on a tear since the season began. Since going 0-for-4 on Opening Day, Beer has hit safely in all 17 games with a plate appearance (he departed with a lacerated cheek before his first at-bat vs. South Carolina on March 6.) Beer is hitting .453 with 25 RBIs through 19 games.\n\nThe Tigers set up Beer\u2019s heroics in the bottom of the ninth with Chris Williams\u2019 infield single to bring home K.J. Bryant, tying the game at 2. Shortstop Eli White, who has struggled early this season, knocked his first home run in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nStarting pitcher Alex Eubanks worked 6 2/3 innings, striking out ten Eagles without walking a batter, but left with BC leading 2-0. Center fielder Michael Strem and second baseman Jake Palomaki had RBI hits in the first and second innings, respectively, for the early lead.\n\nTigers reliever Alex Bostic earned the victory with 1 2/3 innings of work. On the weekend, Clemson\u2019s pitchers produced a 1.61 ERA, walking three batters and notching 33 strikeouts.\n\nClemson will host Presbyterian College Tuesday night before visiting sixth-ranked Miami (16-4, 4-2 ACC) this coming weekend.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beer\u2019s walk-off homer helps Clemson baseball sweep BC, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Clemson baseball,Seth Beer", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "CLEMSON \u2013 Seth Beer should still be in high school.
