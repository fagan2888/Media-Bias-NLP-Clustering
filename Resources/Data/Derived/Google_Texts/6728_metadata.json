I wonder what Shep really said.\u201d Then a bunch of other people tweeted that Podhoretz was right, so I thought, \u201cOkay, but obviously a joke.\u201d Then I watched the clip.\n\nActual quote about an honest to goodness police state, no apparent irony intended: \u201cThe last thing they need is a Taco Bell and a Lowe\u2019s.\u201d\n\nTwo ways to read that, I guess. One is that he\u2019s objecting to having the wrong priorities, not to American businesses invading the island. Cubans need basic necessities, not fast food. Get a couple of Charmin factories in there churning out TP and that\u2019d be a corporate move worth applauding. But wait \u2014 if that\u2019s his point, why\u2019s he reminiscing at the start of the segment about the sweet-ass four-dollar Cuban rum he likes to bring back whenever he travels there? That\u2019s not a necessity. Which brings us to theory two: This is exactly what it sounds like, a guy seemingly willing to trade away greater prosperity for Cubans if it means Americanizing the island in return for preserving the quaint, simple culture that decades of authoritarianism and economic retardation have produced. It\u2019s basically the \u201cnoble savage\u201d view of economics. What doth it profit a Cuban to gain a middle-American depot for cheap building materials if he lose his cheap-rum-making soul? Where are we going to go to watch people riding around in 60-year-old Studebakers now?\n\nLot of that going around on the left today, as it turns out. As an emetic, go read Michael Totten\u2019s account from earlier this year of what Havana is really like.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cAre we about to get up in there and ruin that place?\u201d", "title": "Shep Smith wonders: Is America about to \u201cruin\u201d Cuba?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/17/shep-smith-wonders-is-america-about-to-ruin-cuba/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "capitalism, Cuba, embargo, lowe's, Shepard Smith, taco bell,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T23:01:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-17T22:15:11+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc941a\"", "article_summary": "Shep Smith wonders: Is America about to \u201cruin\u201d Cuba?\nposted at 6:01 pm on December 17, 2014 by AllahpunditI first heard of this when John Podhoretz tweeted about it and I thought, \u201cNope, John\u2019s exaggerating.\nI wonder what Shep really said.\u201d Then a bunch of other people tweeted that Podhoretz was right, so I thought, \u201cOkay, but obviously a joke.\u201d Then I watched the clip.\nAs an emetic, go read Michael Totten\u2019s account from earlier this year of what Havana is really like.\nGet a couple of Charmin factories in there churning out TP and that\u2019d be a corporate move worth applauding."}
