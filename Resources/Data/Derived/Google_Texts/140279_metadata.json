Not on my watch.\"\n\nClinton plans to use the coming week -- and a series of events in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Des Moines, Iowa -- to outline what she feels is working in Obamacare, and more notably, what isn't.\n\nOn Monday, Clinton said she would \"build on the progress\" made by Obamacare, singling out bringing down health care costs, easing burdens on small businesses and increasing choice.\n\nClinton highlighted \"skyrocketing out of pocket health care costs and particularly run away prescription drug prices.\"\n\nShe said she would announce this week a plan to cap \"how much you have to pay out of pocket for prescription drugs each month\" and promised to \"hold drug companies accountable as we work to drive down prices.\"\n\nPrice gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous. Tomorrow I'll lay out a plan to take it on. -H https://t.co/9Z0Aw7aI6h \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 21, 2015\n\nClinton's speech offered a stark contrast to Republican members of Congress and presidential hopefuls who oppose the plan and pledge to take it apart as president.\n\nBecause she was standing in his home state, Clinton singled out Louisiana's Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal for rejecting \"federal dollars that would have paid to expand Medicaid.\"\n\n\"He put ideology ahead of the well being of the people of this state,\" she said.\n\nThe largely African-American audience, which included a 170-person marching band that played Clinton in and out of the event, booed Jindal at every mention of his name.\n\nJindal, a GOP presindential candidate, called Clinton the \"godmother of socialized medicine\" in a statement Monday, arguing that the only reason Clinton came to Louisiana was to \"distract the voters from her email scandal.\"\n\nThe former first lady has pledged to defend the law throughout the presidential race and routinely mentions that she failed to pass health care reform in the early 1990s.\n\n\"I still have the scars to show it,\" she said of the effort at a August event in Las Vegas.\n\nAlthough Clinton regularly touts Obamacare -- she told a cheering audience in New Hampshire earlier this month that \"the Affordable Care Act is here to stay\" -- she has previously outlined aspects of the law that she doesn't support and would like to see changed.\n\nThe candidate has lately embraced addressing rising prescription drug costs by bargaining with drug companies for lower prices and examining the tax on the premium health care plans, something unpopular with political important unions.\n\n\"I would be the first to say if things aren't working, then we need people of good faith to come together and make evidence-based changes,\" Clinton said in February 2014.\n\nThe most concrete change Clinton has embraced is the law's small business mandate, which requires businesses with 50 or more full-time employees to offer health insurance of pay a penalty. At the same February speech Clinton endorsed addressing businesses \"moving people from full-time work to part-time work to try to avoid contributing to their health care.\"\n\nClinton also suggested at a paid health care speech in October 2014 that people who disagree about Obamacare's medical device tax should be able to \"begin to sort it out.\"\n\nThe medical device tax is a 2.3% excise tax created in part to fund Obamacare; it went into effect at the beginning of 2013. The tax, which helps fund the law, is unpopular with Democrats and Republicans alike, especially those with ties to the medical devices industry.\n\nThe Clinton campaign, as part of the health care push, will also urge their supporters to get involved by starting an online petition against the law's repeal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton will roll out her fixes to the Affordable Care Act this week and will do so by hitting Republicans for outright opposing the law.", "pubdate": "2015-09-20T15:11:17Z", "author": "Dan Merica, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Hillary Clinton will roll out her fixes to the Affordable Care Act this week and will do so by hitting Republicans for outright opposing the law.", "pubdate": "2015-09-20T15:11:17Z", "title": "Hillary Clinton on repealing Obamacare: 'Not on my watch'", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-obamacare-fixes/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150919192941-11b-week-in-politics-0919-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150919192941-11b-week-in-politics-0919-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,bra-2016-elections,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/20/politics/hillary-clinton-obamacare-fixes/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Hillary Clinton on repealing Obamacare: 'Not on my watch' - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-09-21T19:44:14Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Because she was standing in his home state, Clinton singled out Louisiana's Republican Gov.\nClinton highlighted \"skyrocketing out of pocket health care costs and particularly run away prescription drug prices.\"\nOn Monday, Clinton said she would \"build on the progress\" made by Obamacare, singling out bringing down health care costs, easing burdens on small businesses and increasing choice.\nThe Clinton campaign, as part of the health care push, will also urge their supporters to get involved by starting an online petition against the law's repeal.\nAt the same February speech Clinton endorsed addressing businesses \"moving people from full-time work to part-time work to try to avoid contributing to their health care.\""}
