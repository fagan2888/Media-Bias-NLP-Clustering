They have four children ages 3 to 14.\n\nThe Angels outfielder filed for the divorce in late February, around the time when reports of his offseason substance abuse relapse surfaced.\n\nJosh Hamilton\u2019s divorce petition doesn\u2019t say much about the couple\u2019s problems, but it cites conflict between them as a reason for the split.\n\nHamilton outlined 34 requests in the petition. Among the requests: prohibit her from using the Maserati and 1972 Chevrolet Blazer in his possession; prohibit her from \u201chiding\u201d the children from him; prohibit her from making disparaging remarks against him or his family; prohibit someone who has an intimate relationship with her from staying in the same home as the children overnight.\n\nIn March, Katie Hamilton submitted in court a general denial to Josh Hamilton\u2019s petition.\n\nThis month, the couple agreed not to communicate with each other as the case proceeds. They also filed a mutual injunction outlining dozens of rules about expenses, interactions with each other and their children for the time being.\n\nCourt records say Josh Hamilton can\u2019t see the children without supervision. He is also prohibited from going to the couple\u2019s properties in Westlake, Texas; Newport Coast, Calif.; and Valley Mills, Texas.\n\nThe $16.5-million home in Newport Coast went up for sale on Friday.\n\nJosh Hamilton\u2019s agent and Katie Hamilton\u2019s attorney did not respond to a request seeking comment Saturday.\n\nKatie Hamilton was reportedly cast in Real Housewives of Orange County for its 10th season, which will air this month. It is unclear whether or not the divorce proceedings will impact Katie Hamilton\u2019s spot on the reality television show.\n\nHer father, Michael Dean Chadwick, battled drug addiction for 15 years before becoming a faith-based motivational speaker. Chadwick helped Josh Hamilton deal with his substance abuse in the early 2000s.\n\nJosh and Katie Hamilton married in 2004.\n\n\u201cGod told me he was going to give Josh baseball back, but it wasn\u2019t going to be for baseball,\u201d Katie Hamilton said in a public talk in 2005. \u201cIt was going to be for something much bigger. He was going to give Josh a platform to help others. It\u2019s not by accident that all the things that have happened in our lives have happened.\u201d\n\nHamilton played with the Texas Rangers for five seasons, including both World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011.\n\nHe had two publicized relapses with public drinking while with the Rangers, the last coming before the 2012 season.\n\nHamilton and the Rangers engaged in superficial contract talks after the 2012 season, but Los Angeles owner Arte Moreno flew to Texas in December and pushed Hamilton on a take-it-or-leave-it five year, $125 million deal.\n\nAt Hamilton\u2019s introductory press conference in Los Angeles, Katie Hamilton, criticized the Rangers\u2019 approach.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to date somebody and that\u2019s going to be your man or your woman, you make it official and you make it known pretty quick or at some point that you want to be with them,\u201d Katie Hamilton said. \u201cThey let us date other teams.\u201d\n\nJosh Hamilton interjected: \u201cShe said, \u2018You should have put a ring on it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I\u2019m so glad they didn\u2019t,\u201d Katie said. \u201cWe feel so strongly that this is where God has moved us and planted us and we could not be more thankful to the organization and more excited about our family\u2019s adventure out here.\u201d\n\nHamilton\u2019s time in Los Angeles, however, has not been productive nor happy. He had two subpar seasons with the Angels before the offseason relapse.\n\nHe acknowledged the relapse, then met with MLB officials about potential discipline. With MLB and Players\u2019 Association officials unable to reach an agreement on whether Hamilton\u2019s relapse constituted a violation of the Joint Drug Agreement between the league and the association, it was sent to an outside arbitrator for a ruling. The arbitrator ruled in favor of Hamilton, prohibiting MLB from suspending him.\n\nHamilton underwent shoulder surgery this offseason and has stayed outside Houston for most of the offseason. He was not assigned a locker in spring training. Merchandise with his name has been removed from the club\u2019s stadium store.\n\nThe Angels, who still have $83 million left in their commitment to Hamilton, have been outspoken in criticism of both Hamilton and the decision. Last week, Moreno told reporters he could not guarantee Hamilton would again play for the Angels. He also threatened to pursue legal recourse, claiming that Hamilton\u2019s contract had special language that allowed the team to terminate the deal in the event of a substance-abuse relapse.\n\nHamilton met face-to-face with some Angels teammates on Friday when the club visited Houston with long-time teammate and Players\u2019 Association rep C.J. Wilson saying he felt Hamilton was ready to return to playing.\n\nStaff writer Evan Grant contributed to this report.\n\nMore Josh Hamilton\n\nCowlishaw: Why the Rangers should trade for Josh Hamilton\n\nInside Josh Hamilton\u2019s $16.5 million house for sale: Dream garage; 3-level elevator\n\nEx-Rangers star Josh Hamilton, wife getting divorce\n\nPhotos: Looking back at Josh Hamilton\u2019s 10 greatest moments with the Texas Rangers\n\nReport: How ex-Ranger Josh Hamilton relapsed into cocaine\n\nJosh Hamilton: Critical reception from Texas fans hurt during return\n\nPhotos: The best pics of Josh Hamilton", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzA0L2V4LXJhbmdlci1qb3NoLWhhbWlsdG9uLWZpbGVkLWZvci1kaXZvcmNlLWF0LXRpbWUtcmVsYXBzZS13ZW50LXB1YmxpYy1jb3VydC1yZWNvcmRzLXNob3cuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Former Rangers outfielder Josh Hamilton and his wife, Katie, are in the process of getting a divorce, according to court documents filed in Tarrant County earlier this year.
