So far the bromance has been one-sided, thankfully. Putin is nothing if not a shrewd operator, and whoever in his inner circle has been tasked with making sense of the Trump phenomenon has no doubt advised him to steer clear.\n\nBut if Putin and Trump seem like satirical or symbolic figures out of novels or movies, they come from different kinds of stories and, more to the point, from radically different fictional traditions. Trump is a larger-than-life caricature taken from a Sinclair Lewis novel or an early Frank Capra film, a vicious and merciless plutocrat-turned-politician who appeals (as I have previously suggested) to deep, ugly currents within human nature and American history. Putin may look like a similarly blunt instrument from this distance, an old-time Russian strongman who invades neighboring nations, imprisons political opponents and causes voices of dissent to die or disappear under mysterious circumstances.\n\nBut the man who consolidated power in post-Soviet Russia 15 years ago with startling rapidity \u2013 in a process that has been much investigated but never entirely explained \u2013 is a subtler and more shadowy creation than that outline suggests. He\u2019s a character out of a postmodern, metafictional work by Don DeLillo or Philip K. Dick, about whom so little is certain that the reader begins to suspect he does not exist. Certain facts about Putin\u2019s life and career can be ascertained, but the more you examine them, the more they seem like \u201cfacts\u201d in quotation marks, or come to resemble the constant Russian media images of Putin fighting forest fires in Siberia, diving beneath the Black Sea in a submersible or riding a motorbike with the Russian equivalent of the Hell\u2019s Angels. I mean, he really went to those places and put on those uniforms, right? Those are facts too.\n\nClear across the American political spectrum, from those eager to cast Putin as an unhinged, power-mad tyrant who is singlehandedly relaunching the Cold War to those on the radical left who halfheartedly try to cast him as a hero standing up to the American empire (i.e., because he is singlehandedly relaunching the Cold War), our problem is that we think we have Putin figured out but we don\u2019t. We don\u2019t understand Putin because we know almost nothing about Russian society or Russian political history, and we don\u2019t understand him because the invented or self-invented character called \u201cPutin\u201d is not meant to be understood. If those sound like contradictory proposals, well, welcome to Putin-land.\n\nWhen I waded into \u201cMr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin,\u201d a whopping volume by the Brookings Institution scholars Fiona Hill and Clifford G. Gaddy that is viewed as the authoritative work on Putin in English, I did not suspect that the American foreign policy establishment would embrace this sort of literary or philosophical ambiguity. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden are all said to have read this book, which was expressly intended to provide Western policy-makers and bureaucrats with a psychological and historical framework for understanding this most perplexing of contemporary world leaders.\n\nBut you barely get five pages into \u201cMr. Putin\u201d before Hill and Gaddy start to sound like bright liberal-arts undergrads who just got stoned and read Jacques Derrida or Slavoj \u017di\u017eek for the first time. \u201cAttempting to write about Vladimir Putin,\u201d they observe, presented challenges they had not noticed or imagined until they were well into the project. When you \u201cdelve into his hidden aspects, whether in the past or present, you are playing a game with Putin. It is a game where he is in charge. He controls the facts and the \u2018stories.\u2019\u201d They could not afford to \u201ctake any story or so-called fact at face value when it comes to Vladimir Putin,\u201d they continue, because \u201cwe are dealing with someone who is a master at manipulating information, suppressing information, and creating pseudo-information \u2026 after 15 years, we remain ignorant of some of the most basic facts about a man who is arguably the most powerful individual in the world, the leader of an important nation.\u201d\n\nVery little is known about Putin\u2019s childhood in Leningrad (as it was then called), and almost all the so-called information comes either from stories he has told himself or official campaign biographies. Putin was married for more than 30 years (he is now divorced) and has two adult daughters, but his wife and children \u201care conspicuously absent from the public domain,\u201d as Hill and Gaddy put it. During the latter stages of the Soviet era, he was a KGB officer for about 15 years, a fact often reported as if it explained anything. But Putin was nowhere near the top of the Soviet bureaucracy, and there are any number of onetime KGB officials and Communist Party apparatchiks among the ruling elite of contemporary Russia. Only one of them rose to undisputed control of the entire country.\n\nHow that happened is the great mystery of Putin\u2019s career, one he appears to have purposefully clouded in doubt and one that \u201cMr. Putin\u201d makes only tentative efforts to unpack. Somehow or other, Putin went from being the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg in 1996 (who was nearly brought down by a local corruption scandal that threatened the city\u2019s food supply) to becoming the acting president of Russia on the last day of 1999, following Boris Yeltsin\u2019s abrupt resignation. He has run the show in Moscow ever since, and whether that outcome resulted from a coordinated backroom coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or represents the unintended consequence of a chaotic chain of events remains a huge unanswered question.\n\nIn the grand tradition of political science doorstops, \u201cMr. Putin\u201d includes considerable wonky dissection of power struggles within the Russian oligarchy and the contributory factors behind specific policy decisions of the Putin era. I particularly enjoyed the detective work that leads Hill and Gaddy to conclude, purely on circumstantial evidence, that Putin\u2019s strategic thinking was shaped by an American business-school textbook from 1978 that was apparently in vogue at the KGB academy when he studied there. On a more substantive level, the book offers a succinct account of how Putin came to feel increasingly disrespected and undermined by both the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations between 1999 and the Iraq invasion in 2003, and moved from a generally pro-American position to the view that the United States was a fatally arrogant and grossly incompetent player on the world stage. You don\u2019t have to like the guy to concede that he had a point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP frontrunner can't conceal his love for the Kremlin strongman -- but they're characters in different tales", "title": "Trump and Putin\u2019s crazy bromance: Two guys too weird for fiction who long to rule the world", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP frontrunner can't conceal his love for the Kremlin strongman -- but they're characters in different tales", "title": "Trump and Putin\u2019s crazy bromance: Two guys too weird for fiction who long to rule the world", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/03/trump_and_putins_crazy_bromance_two_guys_too_weird_for_fiction_who_long_to_rule_the_world/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/trump_putin_horse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP frontrunner can't conceal his love for the Kremlin strongman -- but they're characters in different tales", "title": "Trump and Putin\u2019s crazy bromance: Two guys too weird for fiction who long to rule the world", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/trump_putin_horse.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Presidential Campaign, 2016 presidential candidates, 2016 presidential race, 2016 Republican primary, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, Nationalism, Populism, Russia, Vladimir Putin", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAttempting to write about Vladimir Putin,\u201d they observe, presented challenges they had not noticed or imagined until they were well into the project.\nHow that happened is the great mystery of Putin\u2019s career, one he appears to have purposefully clouded in doubt and one that \u201cMr.\nPutin\u201d includes considerable wonky dissection of power struggles within the Russian oligarchy and the contributory factors behind specific policy decisions of the Putin era.\nWhen you \u201cdelve into his hidden aspects, whether in the past or present, you are playing a game with Putin.\nWe don\u2019t understand Putin because we know almost nothing about Russian society or Russian political history, and we don\u2019t understand him because the invented or self-invented character called \u201cPutin\u201d is not meant to be understood."}
