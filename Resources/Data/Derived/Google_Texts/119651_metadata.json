(As long as waterparks are your thing, of course.)\n\nThe perks of KeyLime Cove are plentiful \u2013 it's only an hour away, the prices are generally a little less than other waterparks in Wisconsin and it's 84-degrees regardless of what Mother Nature decides.\n\nKeyLime Cove is an entirely indoor experience and contained to one building \u2013 a massive building, mind you, that's 65,000 square feet. Whereas other waterparks have an outdoor component and multiple buildings, the fact it's contained to one large space is appealing to some people because it makes the visit seemingly more manageable.\n\nThe waterslides range in thrill level, from tame to dramatic, and there's also an onsite arcade, multiple restaurants including D.W. Anderson's Eatery and Ice Cream Parlor, The Crazy Toucan Margarita Grille, Paradise Mist Spa and a large banquet and meeting space.\n\nHowever, these are the more obvious offerings at KeyLime Cove. During a recent visit \u2013 it was Kids' Weekend which meant even more special activities for the little fishes than usual \u2013 we found that the simple stuff made our overnight at KeyLime Cove a true treasure trove of fun.\n\n1. Easy-access bar\n\n\n\n\n\nObviously, this is good news for grown ups \u2013 the proximity of the bar to the waterpark action makes it very easy for the parents of older kids to sip a beer or pi\u00f1a colada while still being able to witness much of the \"watch this, mom or dad\" stuff.\n\n2. Penny squisher\n\n\n\n\n\nNext to the Mold-A-Rama, the penny squisher (technically, it's called a \"penny press\" but \"squisher\" is a way more fun word) is the most classic old school souvenir maker. This is quite possibly the most fun you can have with 51 cents.\n\n3. Crazy-huge jawbreakers\n\nThese jawbreakers range in size from golf ball- to softball-sized. And, best of all, they're on a stick \u2013 it's like a little piece of the Wisconsin State Fair in the state of Illinois. (Most likely no one in the history of confectionaries has finished one of 'em.)\n\n4. \"The toilet\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, it's called the Hurricane Vortex, but whether you have a 12-year-old boy in tow or are just one at heart, referring to this as \"the toilet\" is as much fun to say as it is to swirl down. Especially after one of the aforementioned pi\u00f1a coladas from the delightfully-so-accessible bar.\n\n5. Fish faces\n\nMaking a \"fish face\" at least one time while at KeyLime Cove is mandatory. Taking a photo or selfie while doing it earns you bonus points.\n\n6. Relaxing\n\nThere is so much going on at a waterpark, you might have to remind yourself to relax. But relax! The lazy river and / or one of the many colorful chairs are ideal for such glorious non-activity.\n\n7. The pineapple dump\n\nStand under the ginormous pineapple and allow 250-gallons of water to wash over you. It's a tropical baptism of sorts and one most grown ups don't take advantage of often enough. SpongeBob not included in this experience.\n\n8. Wish making\n\nThere's a lot to look at on Duvall Street \u2013 the faux street in the common area of the waterpark where most of the shops, services, cafes and restaurants are located \u2013 including an indoor stream. What if a penny or a quarter really did grant your wish? Only one way to find out.\n\n9. Jumping on the bed\n\nLet's not forget what happened to those naughty monkeys, but bouncing on the bed in a hotel room is a memory maker and a childhood dream come true. Sometimes, the mantra must be \"safety second.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "KeyLime Cove has a lot of offerings, from thrilling water slides to decadent food items, but it's the simple stuff that makes an overnight at KeyLime Cove a true treasure trove of fun.", "title": "9 must-try treasures of KeyLime Cove", "og": {"site_name": "OnMilwaukee.com", "description": "KeyLime Cove has a lot of offerings, from thrilling water slides to decadent food items, but it's the simple stuff that makes an overnight at KeyLime Cove a true treasure trove of fun.", "title": "9 must-try treasures of KeyLime Cove", "url": "http://onmilwaukee.com/visitors/articles/keylimecovemusttry.html", "image": "http://onmilwaukee.com/images/articles/ke/keylimecovemusttry/keylimecovemusttry_fullsize_story1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "onmilwaukee.com", "account_id": 9232292, "title": "9 must-try treasures of KeyLime Cove", "image": {"src": "http://onmilwaukee.com/images/articles/ke/keylimecovemusttry/keylimecovemusttry_fullsize_story1.jpg"}, "site": "@onmilwaukee", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "KeyLime Cove has a lot of offerings, from thrilling water slides to decadent food items, but it's the simple stuff that makes an overnight at KeyLime Cove a true treasure trove of fun."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "p": {"domain_verify": "7e7fcf309f01685c4efa6d90170d4062"}, "fb": {"app_id": 166926470123765}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "KeyLime Cove, waterpark, kids, parenting, vacation, slides", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3913\"", "article_summary": "KeyLime Cove is an entirely indoor experience and contained to one building \u2013 a massive building, mind you, that's 65,000 square feet.\nFish facesMaking a \"fish face\" at least one time while at KeyLime Cove is mandatory.\nHowever, these are the more obvious offerings at KeyLime Cove.\nThe perks of KeyLime Cove are plentiful \u2013 it's only an hour away, the prices are generally a little less than other waterparks in Wisconsin and it's 84-degrees regardless of what Mother Nature decides.\nDuring a recent visit \u2013 it was Kids' Weekend which meant even more special activities for the little fishes than usual \u2013 we found that the simple stuff made our overnight at KeyLime Cove a true treasure trove of fun."}
