NEW BRUNSWICK - A city firefighter was charged Friday with stealing thousands of dollars by filing a phony disability claim while continuing to work for the city and collect a paycheck, Middlesex County Prosecutor Andrew C. Carey and Police Director Anthony A. Caputo said.

Dell Walker, 54, was charged with a second-degree count of insurance fraud, a third-degree count of theft and a fourth-degree charge of forgery. Bail was set at $30,000.

He was charged during an investigation by Detective Thierry Lemmerling of the New Brunswick Police Department and Detective Linda Infusino of the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office.

The investigation began when city officials uncovered the theft and contacted police.

The charges were filed after detectives determined that Walker filed the disability claim in December 2013 and collected payments totaling $42,000.

It also was determined that he forged paperwork to continue receiving the disability checks while he continued working as a firefighter.

The investigation is active and is continuing. Anyone with information is asked to call Detective Lemmerling of the New Brunswick Police Department at 732-745-5200 or Detective Infusino of the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office at 732-745-3300.
