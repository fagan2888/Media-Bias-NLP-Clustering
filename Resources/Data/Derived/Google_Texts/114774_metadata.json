The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel recently reported that the comparison is \u201cnot lost on advocates who support the law.\u201d\n\nActually, a lot of the comparison is lost on them, and that\u2019s too bad. It would considerably improve our national conversation if supporters of Obamacare had a better understanding of why the law\u2019s critics dislike it so much. Here is one reason: The intermingling of federal and state finances is rife with opportunities for the federal government to coerce states into doing things they don\u2019t want to do, in areas where their autonomy is supposed to be protected by the Constitution. And Obamacare is particularly rife with examples of such coercion, of which the insurer tax and Medicaid expansion are only two.\n\nWhen Nancy Pelosi, then speaker of the House, was asked whether the proposed Obamacare bill might not be unconstitutional, she famously asked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Well, yes, we are. The Supreme Court has many times insisted that that the powers of the federal government are limited and that the separation of state and federal powers is a vital protection of our Constitution.\n\nRELATED: The Obamacare Bait-and-Switch No One Noticed\n\nAs Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in Printz v. United States (1997), states \u201cmust remain independent and autonomous within their proper sphere of authority.\u201d As Sandra Day O\u2019Connor wrote in New York v. United States (1992), \u201caccountability is . . . diminished when, due to federal coercion, elected state officials cannot regulate in accordance with the views of the local electorate in matters not pre-empted by federal regulation.\u201d In Bond v. United States (2011), Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that the division of government power into federal and state spheres \u201cprotects the liberty of the individual from arbitrary power.\u201d The principle of state autonomy matters.\n\n\n\nWhy States Have Turned Down Medicaid Expansion\n\nHence, it should have come as no surprise in 2012 that the Supreme Court struck down a major element of Obamacare because it passed the point at which pressure turns into coercion. The federal government spent most of the last century trying to find out just how far the Supreme Court would let it go in its incremental takeover of state governments, and it finally found the answer in Obamacare\u2019s requirement that states expand Medicaid. The provision threatened the states with the loss of all funds under the original Medicaid program (about 10 percent of the average state\u2019s budget) if they did not expand the program to cover an entirely new population, in effect accepting an entirely new program.\n\nForcing the states to accept an entirely new program or lose the largest single source of funds in the state budget was, in Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019s memorable phrase, a \u201cgun to the head.\u201d When Medicaid was originally created in 1965, it was sold to the public as a federal match for state health-care programs. It was actually something else \u2014 a forced state match of a federal health-care program \u2014 but the Supreme Court nonetheless sustained the original Medicaid against charges of coercion.\n\nIdeology cannot explain why politicians in some 22 states have refused tens of billions of dollars of free money.\n\nWith Obamacare, however, the federal government finally went too far. The Supreme Court ruled that the Medicaid expansion could be optional but not mandatory. Since the Medicaid expansion still came with its own substantial federal subsidy, which states would lose if they didn\u2019t take the deal, states were still under considerable pressure to play ball. But Medicaid programs were notoriously prone to cost overruns, and with an expansion of the size contemplated by Obamacare, any cost overruns could be catastrophic for the state budget, even with federal subsidies. And then there is the unsustainable federal debt, which virtually guarantees that the federal subsidies will not always be there. The deal was so unattractive that nearly half the states have refused to take it, forgoing the return of billions of their own tax dollars \u2014 a considerable penalty.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Governor Scott Walker implemented an imaginative solution that considerably expanded the state\u2019s insurance rolls, while preserving the state\u2019s autonomy. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Wisconsin is the only state in the nation that managed to refuse Medicaid expansion without creating any gap in coverage. That\u2019s because Walker\u2019s predecessor, Jim Doyle, had expanded Medicaid beyond what even Obamacare required, to cover everyone earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nRELATED: How Is Obamacare Doing?\n\nPredictably, just four months after Doyle expanded the program, Wisconsin ran out of funds and suspended enrollment. Tens of thousands of Wisconsin residents who were eligible to enroll in Medicaid \u2014 by law \u2014 were unable to enroll and left to fend for themselves. That was the situation Walker confronted on becoming governor. So rather than accept federal funds for Medicaid expansion under the ACA, Walker devised a hybrid.\n\nHe reduced Medicaid eligibility to 100 percent of federal poverty and moved everyone earning above that threshold to the federal health-insurance exchange, where they could buy private coverage with a federal subsidy. In the end, Walker\u2019s plan made private coverage available to 62,776 Wisconsinites who had previously been in the state\u2019s Medicaid program, while opening up spots in the Medicaid program to more than 97,000 adults earning less than the federal poverty level.\n\nRELATED: Health Care in a Spending Deal\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Walker go all-in for expansion? For one thing, it isn\u2019t cheap. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the federal government will spend more than $930 billion on Medicaid between 2014 and 2022, and in its most recent report found that Medicaid spending grew 16 percent last year after increasing by 14 percent in 2014, accounting for the largest increase of all federal health-care expenditures. As Governor Walker\u2019s press secretary says in an e-mail:\n\nIf anyone thinks the federal government, which is currently $18 trillion in debt, will not renege on its future funding promises, they are not living in reality. The federal government cannot meet its current Medicaid obligations and in order to deal with this deficit, the Congressional Budget Office has offered Medicaid caps, and members of both parties have proposed decreasing federal funding for Medicaid programs as potential options.\n\nSupporters of expansion say that because the federal government has agreed to cover 90 percent of the cost, states should just take the money. But it\u2019s not that simple. States are still responsible for part of the cost, and since they must cover anyone who is eligible, it\u2019s very hard for them to predict what those costs will be. More than a dozen states that expanded Medicaid in 2014 have seen enrollment and costs surpass estimates. In California, nearly three times as many people have enrolled under the expanded Medicaid as the state expected. In January, Governor Jerry Brown asked for an 8 percent increase in state spending to cover the cost of more than 13 million residents now on Medicaid. In 2013, enrollment was less than 8 million. Similarly painful overruns have happened in Colorado, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, and nearly every other state that expanded the program.\n\nAdvocates who think the opposition to Obamacare is \u201cideological\u201d or \u201clocked into the politics,\u201d are deluding themselves about the health-care law\u2019s very serious flaws. Ideology cannot explain why politicians in some 22 states have refused tens of billions of dollars of free money. What explains it is that the money isn\u2019t really free. On that contrary, it\u2019s really expensive \u2014 not just in terms of the state\u2019s own budget down the road, but also, at a more basic level, in terms of the state\u2019s constitutional autonomy.\n\nWhy States Are Suing for That Tax Money Back\n\nSection 9010 of Obamacare creates a tax on health-insurance providers, including managed-care organizations that play a prominent role in Medicaid programs. The tax is determined by the net premiums on various kinds of insurance plans. In the case of Medicaid managed-care providers, the problem is that states end up paying for the tax. In other words, Obamacare pays for itself partly by indirectly taxing state governments.\n\nThe shakedown here is so convoluted that it took states several years to realize what was happening.\n\nThe shakedown here is so convoluted that it took states several years to realize what was happening. Basically, federal law requires that state Medicaid programs pay managed care-organizations (MCOs) according to rates that are \u201cactuarially sound.\u201d That in turn requires an actuary\u2019s certification that under the standards established by the American Academy of Actuaries, the payout (or \u201ccapitation\u201d) rates are sufficient to cover all MCOs\u2019 costs and insurance risks for the coming year. In March 2015, the Actuaries Standards Board (a private organization) decided that to be \u201cactuarially sound,\u201d the state capitation rates had to compensate the MCOs for all taxes \u2014 including the insurance providers\u2019 tax. Abracadabra, state were suddenly on the hook for tens of millions of dollars in taxes, which they had to pay or risk that the providers would exit the market, and perhaps risk that the Medicaid program itself would be disqualified.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the federal government can pass a tax (or other law) that applies incidentally to state governments \u2014 as long as it applies generally to everyone and doesn\u2019t violate the \u201cdual sovereignty\u201d of the states by interfering with the states\u2019 core functions. So the federal minimum wage applies to state employees, and the federal government can impose payroll taxes that apply to state employees \u2014 because those measures apply to all employers, whether public or private. But the federal government can\u2019t tax or regulate states as states by passing laws that apply principally (rather than incidentally) to them. It can\u2019t pass a law that says: \u201cA tax is hereby imposed on the budget of every state in the amount of x.\u201d That, according to the Supreme Court, would violate the states\u2019 reserved sovereignty.\n\nThe problem with the forced state reimbursement of the insurance-provider tax for Medicaid MCOs is that it forces states to subsidize the insurance providers in ways not contemplated in the Medicaid agreements. States had no notice of this expense, until a private board exercising powers delegated by Congress imposed it on them. Under federal rules, states are specifically commanded \u2014 as states \u2014 to pay this tax. And that is so close to being a tax on state government that it makes no difference, and it\u2019s imposed by a private party, no less.\n\nThe amount of money involved in the MCO tax fiasco is not great. It has cost the Wisconsin only about $23 million so far. But there\u2019s a principle at stake. And the law\u2019s proponents act is if that principle \u2014 which is nothing less than the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of the states \u2014 was a totally irrelevant bit of ideological fluff.\n\nThese dramatically differing perceptions of how constitutional government is supposed to work go a long ways toward explaining the sorry state of our national conversation. Let\u2019s hope that more mutual understanding will bring a better conversation soon. In the meantime, to borrow a phrase, the myopia of Obamacare proponents is not lost on the law\u2019s critics.\n\n\u2014 Mario Loyola is a contributing editor to National Review and a senior fellow at the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty.
