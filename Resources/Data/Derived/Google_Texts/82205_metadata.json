Who jumped first? The brunette. The blonde had to ask for directions.\n\nThe stereotype of the dumb blonde has been around since the beginning of time \u2013 or at least since the development of hydrogen peroxide. But new research published in the journal Economics Bulletin has determined that the stereotype is false.\n\nRelated: The Physical Traits That Can Get You Promoted\n\nAlthough joking about blondes may seem harmless, the jokes can have serious implications in the real world. \u201cResearch shows that stereotypes often have an impact on hiring, promotions and other social experiences,\u201d Jay Zagorsky, author of the study, told the Ohio State University news office. \u201cThis study provides compelling evidence that there shouldn\u2019t be any discrimination against blondes based on their intelligence.\u201d\n\nResearchers at OSU analyzed the IQ scores of 10,878 Americans and found that white women who said their natural hair color was blonde had an average IQ score within three points of those with brunette, black or red hair.\n\nIn fact, the average IQs of blondes -- 103.2 -- was slightly higher than those with other hair colors. The average IQ of women with brown hair was 102.7, red heads scored 101.2, and women with black hair came in at 100.5. However, those variations are not statistically significant, according to the report.\n\nThe report also contradicted the stereotype about blonde males, who were found to have IQs about equal to men with other hair colors.\n\nRelated: Why Plastic Surgery Is No Quick Fix for Getting a Job\n\nThe study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, a national survey of people between 14 and 21 years old when they were first interviewed in 1979. The initial interview asked participant\u2019s IQ and a survey of the same group in 1985 asked participants their natural hair color.\n\nAlthough the study didn\u2019t determine any relationship between hair color and intelligence, it did come up with one potential explanation for why blondes reported marginally higher intelligence: They were raised in homes with more access to reading materials than those with any other hair color.\n\nThe report notes that other factors may contribute to differences in IQ, but \u201cif living in a more literate environment is truly the driving reason for higher blonde intelligence, then the solution for people who wish they or their children were smarter is not to dye or bleach their hair,\u201d the report reads.
