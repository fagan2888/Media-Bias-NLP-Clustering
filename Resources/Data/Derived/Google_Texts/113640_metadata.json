But congressional leaders are far from reaching an agreement, raising the possibility of yet another budget crisis by the end of the week.\n\nRepublican and Democratic leaders in Congress spent last weekend desperately seeking a compromise on spending, taxes and key policy measures that would enable lawmakers to adjourn for the remainder of the holiday season and then turn their attention to the 2016 campaign and a new House GOP agenda in January. But they came up empty handed.\n\nRelated: Ryan\u2019s Next Big Challenge: Prevent Another Government Shutdown\n\nWhile there appears to be little appetite even among the most rabid of conservative Republicans for a repeat of the 2013 partial government shutdown, the early signs this week is that a final deal is highly elusive and that Congress may have no choice but to kick the can down the road by adopting another short-term extensions of spending authority -- a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d -- to keep the government afloat.\n\nNew House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-WI) made it clear in a speech last week that he has no patience with another government spending crisis and that his \u201cnumber one goal for next year is to put together a complete alternative to the left\u2019s agenda,\u201d including a comprehensive GOP replacement for the Affordable Care Act. But in an interview on Monday with a radio station in his home town of Janesville, Ryan voiced doubt that Congress could complete its work by the end of this week, according to Politico.\n\nNoting that there was still much to do in resolving differences over funding the government and renewing hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of expiring tax breaks and credits, the speaker said that \u201cit might take us more than just this week to get these issues put together correctly.\u201d Ryan also said that he doesn't have an \"exact timeline\" for releasing an Obamacare replacement next year.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) did Ryan a huge favor in late October by negotiating a fiscal 2016 budget agreement with the Obama administration and congressional Democrats setting the parameters for overall government spending through next Sept. 30 without Ryan having to leave his fingerprints on highly controversial legislation.\n\nRelated: Congress Finally Passes a $300 Billion Highway Bill\n\nThe agreement added $50 billion to fiscal 2016 spending, equally divided between defense and domestic programs, along with $16 billion of emergency spending on the war and State Department programs. The agreement pleased many GOP defense hawks and champions of Obama\u2019s domestic programs, but it angered many GOP conservatives who complained that it cost too much and would add to the deficit.\n\nBoehner left it to Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House and Senate appropriators to pass legislation to divvy up the new spending in one massive appropriations bill. But the year-long spending bill has become bogged down and jeopardized by a series of disputes over policy riders or amendments ranging from the treatment of Syrian refugees and Obama environmental policy to oil exports.\n\nRyan has had it easy so far, helping to shepherd through a major highway bill and reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind legislation. But now he may be getting a taste of what Boehner experienced numerous times over the years in trying to amass a majority of Republican votes on controversial spending legislation.\n\nThe rocky weekend negotiating sessions followed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s outright rejection of a House GOP spending plan unveiled on Friday that contained dozens of policy riders -- or \u201cpoison pills,\u201d as some Democrats have called them. House Appropriations Committee Chair Hal Rogers (R-KY) told reporters late last week that he hoped to have a final package ready for House action by early this week, although that now seems well out of reach.\n\nRelated: Paul Ryan Flexes His Conservative Muscles in Contrast to Boehner\n\nAmong the Republicans\u2019 latest list of demands, according to The Washington Post, are the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress must approve more than $1.1 trillion of funding by Friday to keep the governm", "title": "Is Congress Stumbling into Another Budget Crisis?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/07/Congress-Stumbling-Another-Budget-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paul_ryan_gavel.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/07/Congress-Stumbling-Another-Budget-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/paul_ryan_gavel.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Congress must approve more than $1.1 trillion of funding by Friday to keep the governm", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But congressional leaders are far from reaching an agreement, raising the possibility of yet another budget crisis by the end of the week.\nCongress must approve more than $1.1 trillion of funding by Friday to keep the government operating for the remainder of fiscal 2016.\nThe rocky weekend negotiating sessions followed House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi\u2019s outright rejection of a House GOP spending plan unveiled on Friday that contained dozens of policy riders -- or \u201cpoison pills,\u201d as some Democrats have called them.\nRelated: Congress Finally Passes a $300 Billion Highway BillThe agreement added $50 billion to fiscal 2016 spending, equally divided between defense and domestic programs, along with $16 billion of emergency spending on the war and State Department programs.\nRelated: Paul Ryan Flexes His Conservative Muscles in Contrast to BoehnerAmong the Republicans\u2019 latest list of demands, according to The Washington Post, are the following:"}
