If they had closed the borders decades ago, they might have avoided this attack.\n\nSomeone once said that the First World War was the most stupid thing that European nations ever did. Countries on both sides of that war ended up worse off than before, whether they were on the winning side or the losing side.\n\nHistory may yet record that an even greater stupidity, with even more catastrophic consequences in the long run, was the European nations' decisions to import millions of people with a culture that was not merely very different, but hostile, to the culture, the values and the people of the Western world.\n\nEven now, people who publicly warn of the dangers can be prosecuted in various European countries under \"hate speech\" laws.\n\nAnd what about us? When, if ever, are we going to close our borders? When will we even take control of our borders, so that we can decide who, and how many, will be admitted? Certainly not before a new president takes office in January 2017 \u2014 and maybe not even then.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans are responsible for failing to take control of the borders. In all the years that have been spent talking back and forth about every conceivable immigration policy \u2014 and some that are inconceivable \u2014 we could have built the biggest fence of all time, backed up by electronics, boots on the ground and whatever else it takes.\n\nInstead, many have been pursuing the will-o'-the-wisp called \"comprehensive\" immigration reform. In other words, we are supposed to do everything all at once, like Obamacare. How well did that turn out?\n\nThere are very serious and complex questions to be confronted before immigration issues are laid to rest by new laws. But none of that stops us from taking control of the borders now.\n\nWhen someone is brought into a hospital, bleeding profusely, he may also have other medical problems that will need to be addressed at some point. But, first of all, you STOP THE BLEEDING. Nobody is stopping the bleeding across our borders. The fact that the main border that people have been pouring across, at will, is the border with Mexico, does not mean that everyone crossing that border is Mexican.\n\nMiddle East terrorists can cross that border just as easily \u2014 and probably have crossed it. And will continue to cross it.\n\nThere are lots of complicated issues revolving around the open borders \u2014 drugs, visas, employers, refugees, crime syndicates, sanctuary cities, amnesty and more. But first we need to stop the bleeding.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing to stop us from discussing what kind of immigration policy we need to have, while the border is being secured. And, if the border is not secured, it does not matter what kind of immigration policy we have \u2014 or think we have \u2014 because people will cross the borders when they want to, regardless of what the policy turns out to be.\n\nAmong all the seemingly endless words that are thrown around about immigration issues, there is remarkably little being said about getting hard facts about illegal immigrants. Basic things like crime rates, welfare rates, school performances \u2014 all compared to the general population.\n\nIt may turn out that none of those things is as bad as some believe. Or it may turn out that they are far worse. But we certainly ought to know which it is before rushing \"comprehensive\" immigration reform through Congress, the way we rushed Obamacare through.\n\nSuch questions cannot be answered with rhetoric or anecdotes. It so happens that my own interactions with Hispanic people have been at least as good as my interactions with black or white people. But a colleague and friend whom I greatly respect tells of wholly different experiences where he lives.\n\nAt least a year of multiple Congressional hearings and fact-finding ought to precede any legislation. But none of this should slow down the securing of the borders. If we don't stop the bleeding at the borders, there are going to be a lot of Americans bleeding \u2014 and dying \u2014 inside our borders, just like in France.\n\nThomas Sowell, a National Humanities Medal winner, is an American economist, social theorist, political philosopher and author.
