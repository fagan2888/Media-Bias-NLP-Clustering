Mustafah Abdulaziz for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFew roads lead to this fishing village on the eastern shores of Africa. Drinking water and electricity are in short supply. Hazards include venomous snakes, malaria-bearing mosquitoes and gun-toting antigovernment rebels.\n\nBut this is where Anadarko Petroleum wants to build one of the biggest projects ever attempted by a Western energy company. It has pledged to install acres of air-conditioned housing, an airstrip and a port\u2014and to relocate almost 3,000 villagers currently living in mud huts.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to be notified when we launch the new WSJ Frontiers weekly email newsletter\n\nThe search for oil has drawn companies to remote locations throughout the petroleum industry\u2019s history. But Anadarko isn\u2019t here for black gold. The American company is after something more abundant, albeit less lucrative: natural gas located about 30 miles offshore.\n\nThere is more than just one catch, though, with one of the largest energy discoveries in decades. The nearest viable customers are a hemisphere away. And it may cost tens of billions of dollars to tap the gas. Deep-pocketed buyers have expressed interest in the project, but some have yet to commit.\n\n\u201cOil is probably easier,\u201d concedes Don MacLiver, the executive in charge of the Mozambique project\u2019s development. But like many major oil companies, Texas-based Anadarko has to go with the opportunities available. These, he says, include \u201clarge gas discoveries in remote locations.\u201d\n\nThis is the challenge for many of the biggest energy companies operating around the globe: Natural gas, not oil, accounts for two-thirds of the petroleum reserves discovered over the last decade, according to data from consulting firm IHS. And many of the largest finds are nowhere near homes and businesses that can burn the fuel.\n\nThe Mozambique project, which has run up about $1 billion in costs for Anadarko thus far, is among the most extreme efforts to convert such huge discoveries into marketable energy. With customers so far away, Anadarko plans to build giant freezer-like devices to chill the gas to the temperature of the ice-encrusted moon that orbits Jupiter. The process converts gas into a liquid state so that it can be loaded onto refrigerated tankers and shipped by sea, like oil.\n\nExporting this fuel can provide companies with a longer, steadier stream of cash flow than pumping oil, but without crude\u2019s heftier profit margin.\n\nOther big energy outfits are working on similar projects. Italy\u2019s Eni, for instance, is planning one adjacent to Anadarko\u2019s.\n\nCompanies including the U.K.\u2019s BG Group and Norway\u2019s Statoil are planning another such venture to capitalize on gas they\u2019ve struck off the coast of Tanzania, Mozambique\u2019s neighbor to the north.\n\nMany analysts estimate the global demand for liquid natural gas, or LNG, will double in 20 years, led by fast-growing economies in Asia. Europe\u2019s demand for ocean-borne gas imports may also rise as countries look for alternatives to gas piped in from Russia.\n\nRead the full story at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Despite costs in the billions and faraway customers, Anadarko Petroleum is proceeding with one of the most difficult projects envisioned by a Western energy company.", "title": "Anadarko\u2019s Mozambique Project Shows Appetite for Natural Gas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/08/12/anadarkos-mozambique-project-shows-appetite-for-natural-gas/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BQ990_MOZGAS_P_20140811165249.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Anadarko\u2019s Mozambique Project Shows Appetite for Natural Gas", "description": "Despite costs in the billions and faraway customers, Anadarko Petroleum is proceeding with one of the most difficult projects envisioned by a Western energy company.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Devon Maylie and Daniel Gilbert", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Despite costs in the billions and faraway customers, Anadarko Petroleum is proceeding with one of the most difficult projects envisioned by a Western energy company.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-12T18:05:00-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/08/12/anadarkos-mozambique-project-shows-appetite-for-natural-gas/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1073", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Despite costs in the billions and faraway customers, Anadarko Petroleum is proceeding with one of the most difficult projects envisioned by a Western energy company.", "title": "Anadarko\u2019s Mozambique Project Shows Appetite for Natural Gas", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/08/12/anadarkos-mozambique-project-shows-appetite-for-natural-gas/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/P1-BQ990_MOZGAS_P_20140811165249.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1073", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-09-08T21:18:49-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e62\"", "article_summary": "The American company is after something more abundant, albeit less lucrative: natural gas located about 30 miles offshore.\nMany analysts estimate the global demand for liquid natural gas, or LNG, will double in 20 years, led by fast-growing economies in Asia.\nThere is more than just one catch, though, with one of the largest energy discoveries in decades.\n\u201cOil is probably easier,\u201d concedes Don MacLiver, the executive in charge of the Mozambique project\u2019s development.\nBut this is where Anadarko Petroleum wants to build one of the biggest projects ever attempted by a Western energy company."}
