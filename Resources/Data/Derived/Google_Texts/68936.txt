Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Saturday Night Live skewered the recent woes of President Barack Obama and the parade of scandals and stumbles the administration has suffered in the past months with a hilariously on-point sketch for "Paxil -- Second-Term Strength."

Jay Pharaoh retuned as the president, starring in an ad for "presidential depression" medication, for when "it feels like even your friends have turned against you" (cue Bill Clinton clip).

"Ask your doctor Paxil -- Second-Term Strength, the only anti-depressant strong enough for an embattled second term," the voice-over urges, as a solemn dirge turns to an upbeat back track and the ad switches from black and white to color, "so you can get back on your feet and start running the country again."

"Feel like you’re giving a speech at a college campus in 2008, or getting bin Laden -- all over again,” it goes on.

The ad says Paxil -- Second-Term Strength treats "symptoms like Benghazi, the NSA scandal, the IRS scandal, the AP scandal, the Petraeus scandal, that time Jay Z and Beyoncé went to Cuba, and of course, Obamacare website problems."

The ad's fine-print talk warns that Paxil is not covered by Obamacare.

“We promised that it would be, but it’s not," it says. "And for that, we apologize.”

Paxil -- Republican Strength works for "tea party-related depression."
