For the almost 11 million uninsured who are eligible for Affordable Care Act plans, paying the penalty would still be cheaper than the least-expensive insurance option, that analysis found.\n\nSuch is the case for some young adults interviewed by the AP, many of whom plan to hedge their bets by paying the fine rather than insurance premiums. Others say they think the fine is unfair to lower-income individuals.\n\n\"Do you really think people who can't afford healthcare should have to pay a penalty?\" asked Julian Rostain, a cook from the Philadelphia suburbs who is in his 20s.\n\nCMS has said enrollees this year are trending younger, a seemingly good sign for the government; it has identified this demographic as a key enrollment target. Perhaps reflecting the difficulty of reaching the remaining uninsured, however, the Congressional Budget Office recently lowered its estimate for ACA exchange enrollment in 2016.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the AP article\n\n- here's the Enroll America statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMore than 8 million enroll in Healthcare.gov plans, including more young customers\n\nCBO lowers estimate for Affordable Care Act enrollment\n\nSome Americans see fine as better option than health insurance\n\nHow effective actually is the ACA's individual mandate?", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the Obama administration and outreach organizations drive home the point about increasing fines for remaining uninsured, that strategy is putting added pressure on many young, healthy individuals who believe they are unable to afford health insurance,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Associated Press.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "As the Obama administration and outreach organizations drive home the point about increasing fines for remaining uninsured, that strategy is putting added pressure on many young, healthy individuals who believe they are unable to afford health insurance,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Associated Press.", "title": "Young consumers balk at fine for avoiding health insurance", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/young-consumers-balk-fine-avoiding-health-insurance/2016-01-27", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act,Andy Slavitt,Enroll America,Health Insurance Exchanges,individual mandate,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Marketing & Consumer Engagement,Open Enrollment Period,tax penalties", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Health Insurance Exchanges,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Marketing & Consumer Engagement"}, "article_summary": "Groups such as Enroll America are emphasizing the fine in this year's open enrollment push.\nSuch is the case for some young adults interviewed by the AP, many of whom plan to hedge their bets by paying the fine rather than insurance premiums.\nAs the Obama administration and outreach organizations drive home the point about increasing fines for remaining uninsured, that strategy is putting added pressure on many young, healthy individuals who believe they are unable to afford health insurance, according to the Associated Press.\nPerhaps reflecting the difficulty of reaching the remaining uninsured, however, the Congressional Budget Office recently lowered its estimate for ACA exchange enrollment in 2016.\nFor the almost 11 million uninsured who are eligible for Affordable Care Act plans, paying the penalty would still be cheaper than the least-expensive insurance option, that analysis found."}
