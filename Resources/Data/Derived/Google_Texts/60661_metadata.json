(Yes, even Nickleback.)\n\nThat's according to two new Gallup polls released this week.\n\nRelated: GOP Doesn\u2019t Blink on DHS Funding\n\nThe first, released today, shows Obama\u2019s approval rating up 7 points to 47 percent from a low of 40 percent in November, right after the midterm elections.\n\nSeparately, Gallup reported that Congress\u2019 rating rose to 20 percent from 16 percent at the beginning of the year--a major improvement over its record low of 9 percent following the government shutdown in 2013. Congress\u2019s approval rating tends to be quite low: its long-term average hovers in the 30 percent range, with the exception of an 84 percent rating right after the September 11 attack.\n\nRelated: Obamacare\u2019s Approval at Lowest Rating on Record\n\nObviously the new (still dismal) ratings aren\u2019t exactly something to celebrate. But they are noticeably improving, so at least for now, public sentiment is warming toward Washington\u2026 but why?\n\nLast year, when Gallup asked respondents to rank the reasons they disapprove of Congress, partisan gridlock came out on top.\n\nFrom every angle, it would appear that D.C. gridlock is just as bad \u2013 perhaps worse than it\u2019s ever been\u2014with the newly Republican-controlled Congress at war with the president over his executive actions on immigration. And though the looming showdown could result in a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, Congress\u2019s approval rating doesn\u2019t seem to be taking much of a hit.\n\nGallup\u2019s experts say the slight uptick in Congress\u2019 popularity is in line with historical trends--Congressional approval ratings tend to be higher at the beginning of the legislative session. Gallup\u2019s Andrew Dugan cautions that because Congress has plenty of major legislation to take up, its approval rating is likely to fluctuate significantly in the coming months.\n\n\u201cGiven the raft of legislation that may be forthcoming in the following months -- involving authorization of use of military force in Iraq/Syria, granting the president greater power in negotiating trade deals, as well as a potentially contentious bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security -- there may be significant movement on how the public rates Congress, be it good or bad,\u201d Dugan wrote in a blog post. \u201cBut for now, even as Washington adjusts to a new political balance, most Americans seem to be taking their time in assessing the new leadership.\u201d\n\nRelated: Congress Ends 2014 with Near Record Low Approval Rating\n\nSeparately, Gallup credited Obama\u2019s rise in ratings to the improving economy.\n\n\u201cThe increase has been aided by more positive economic news, including lower gas prices, which have boosted Americans' perceptions of the U.S. economy's health to the best they have been since the 2007-2009 recession.\u201d\n\nGallup also broke down the approval ratings by issue and found that while Obama\u2019s handling of the economy received better ratings, his strategies to combat ISIS remained low.\n\n\u201cThe more positive economic news may also explain why his economic approval rating has increased more (up 10 percentage points) than his foreign affairs approval rating (up five points) since November. While the economy is getting better, Obama continues to deal with a challenging international environment, including the Ukraine conflict, the Islamic State's presence in Iraq and Syria, as well as the ongoing threats of international terrorism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and North Korea and Iran. As a result, his foreign affairs rating remains on the low side relative to his 2009-2013 ratings.\u201d Gallup noted.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama and Congress are slowly climbing their way out of record-low approval", "title": "Here\u2019s Why Obama and Congress\u2019 Approval Ratings Are Up", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/Here-s-Why-Obama-and-Congress-s-Approval-Ratings-Are", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Washington_DC_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/18/Here-s-Why-Obama-and-Congress-s-Approval-Ratings-Are", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Washington_DC_Capitol.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama and Congress are slowly climbing their way out of record-low approval", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce51a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe more positive economic news may also explain why his economic approval rating has increased more (up 10 percentage points) than his foreign affairs approval rating (up five points) since November.\nGallup\u2019s experts say the slight uptick in Congress\u2019 popularity is in line with historical trends--Congressional approval ratings tend to be higher at the beginning of the legislative session.\nAs a result, his foreign affairs rating remains on the low side relative to his 2009-2013 ratings.\u201d Gallup noted.\nGallup\u2019s Andrew Dugan cautions that because Congress has plenty of major legislation to take up, its approval rating is likely to fluctuate significantly in the coming months.\nAnd though the looming showdown could result in a partial shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, Congress\u2019s approval rating doesn\u2019t seem to be taking much of a hit."}
