The solidarity of the nation should be reflected in how it treats the ones who are weak, poor, old or young,\u201d he said in an interview shortly after he delivered the public lecture.\n\nHealth as social justice\n\nNyarang\u2019o said health is a social justice or human rights issue and so nations must strive to ensure that all their nationals get the best health care possible.\n\nHe said what makes the difference between developed and developing countries\u2019 quality of health care are the systems put in place to provide that care. He opined that the time has come to question whether governments should be seen as primary providers of services. His view is that governments must slowly move away from direct service delivery to become regulators, standards setters and allocators of resources.\n\nRecently President Hifikepunye Pohamba appointed a commission to go to the roots of this issue. The Presidential Commission on Health has since produced a scathing report, which some people say is a litany of indictments of the country\u2019s health care system.\n\nAlthough the report did not say when the rain started to beat the system, it is emphatic in saying that there were few health workers; that the quality of health care was doubtful and unsatisfactory; and that the resource basket was leaking too much along the way to the actual patient.\n\nOther studies indicate that the cost of health care delivery in the country is too high as not to be affordable in the future.\n\nRunaway, unclear costs\n\nEarlier in his presentation, Nyarang\u2019o had called for the generation of hard, counterfactual evidence given that the actual cost of the package of services that patients got was not known for certain.\n\nHe gave the example of caesarean section operations, which have been done since the middle ages. In some instances women who desperately need them die before they can have them, while some of those that access them pay through the nose for the service.\n\n\u201cThis is something that should be readily available and affordable. We should be able to link such costs to outcomes and the costs should be clearly broken down so that we can see why we are spending so much.\u201d\n\nAvailable evidence indicates that in Namibia more caesarean section operations than are necessary are performed.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), all over the world, caesarean section rates should not be more than 15 percent of all deliveries, while Namibia\u2019s national average rates for caesarean sections are estimated to be at 25 percent, 10 percent more than necessary. Reasons vary.\n\nSome women opt for caesarean section because they think it is \u2018cool\u2019. Others think since it is done under general anesthesia, it is less painful, while others choose it to keep unmentionable parts of their anatomy tight. However, women who deliver their babies normally say the pain disappears within a week, while those who opt to go under the knife need up to six weeks to heal.\n\nHis view is that although health care services at public health facilities may appear cheap at face value to the patient, there are hidden costs, which can hemorrhage the state and the patient if not reigned in.\n\nRampant wastage\n\nHe also called for developing countries to develop strategies to avoid wastage, which he said is a major problem in their health systems. He reasoned that in some instances wastage in the use of drugs could be attributed to the manner in which patients procure medicine.\n\nMany people who have medical aid seldom pay for drugs from their pockets at the pharmacy. They do so through deductions from their earnings to an almost faceless entity. For that reason they seldom ask their doctor or pharmacist if they really need all the medicines prescribed when they fall sick.\n\nTales of promiscuous use of drugs abound. A woman who once took her child who had a sore throat to a doctor said she was given an anti-biotic, a pain killer, a cough mixture, multivitamin and lactobacillus, which is used to replenish useful bacteria which antibiotics would have removed in the intestines. Experts say one can get lactobacillus from yoghurt.\n\n\u201cI ended up with so many drugs that I simply kept them in the house until I gave some to my neighbour and threw away the ones that had expired,\u201d she said.\n\nNyarang\u2019o said whereas rational use of drugs requires that pharmacists use the simplest and cheapest (generic) preparations to treat diseases before using stronger drugs that is not always the case.\n\nHe said the offshoot of this indiscriminate use of drugs is very high resistance in some cases, even to second and third generation antimicrobials.\n\n\u201cThe sum total of all these factors is that health care costs for any country can easily go out of control without a corresponding decline in the burden of disease or improvement in the health of the nation,\u201d Nyarang\u2019o, who is the Founding Dean of the Unam School of Medicine as well as Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences, said.\n\nThe Kenyan experience\n\nHe drew parallels between his native Kenya and Namibia. He said Kenya has very little resources to spare for health. As a result the country spent only 2.6 percent of its Gross Domestic Product on health. Namibia spends about three times more. Dollar for dollar, Kenya, whose population is about 40 million, spends the same amount on health as Namibia, whose population is about two million.\n\nAs part of a broader strategy, the country took a bold step to give power to the patient by making health care affordable. Kenya eliminated the need to put the hand in the pocket at the point of care.\n\nMandatory health insurance?\n\nIn line with this thinking, Kenya set up a mandatory health insurance scheme nearly 50 years ago. A state corporation called National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) was set up to keep the money.\n\nHowever, a recent study revealed that the NHIF was shortchanging almost everybody in that its operational costs were very high (nearly 50 percent) and it had become a state monopoly. The study also found that the NHIF was not ambitious enough to expand coverage, particularly to the informal sector.\n\nNamibia does not have mandatory health insurance. It is only employees of government or the private sector who contribute.\n\nHe said a free market does not work in health and so there is need for safeguards for the contributors, who often do not know how much the services and products offered really cost or if they are necessary.\n\n\u201cIdeally there must be an intermediary who negotiates good rates on behalf of the user,\u201d Nyarang\u2019o said.\n\nIn addition to universal health insurance, Nyarang\u2019o advocates the establishment of a health trust into which donors and philanthropists can put money. The money can be used to subsidize the poor as part of universal health coverage. He said health insurance was too complicated to be run as a government bureaucracy.\n\nWell-placed sources say that Namibia is already discussing within the context of social security, whose Act among other things requires support to health care. Observers say this is a major breakthrough in terms of having an existing law on social health protection.\n\nBy Moses Magadza", "article_metadata": {"author": "New Era Publication Corporation", "og": {"url": "https://www.newera.com.na/2013/11/11/health-health-expert/", "site_name": "New Era Newspaper Namibia", "image": "https://www.newera.com.na/wp-content/uploads/Nyarango.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Health for all is possible \u2013 health expert"}, "twitter": {"site": "@neweranewspaper", "card": "photo"}, "fb": {"app_id": "131485450303317\u200e"}, "article": {"section": "Features", "tag": "WHO", "published_time": "2013-11-11", "modified_time": "2013-11-11", "author": "https://www.newera.com.na/author/appking/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd92e5\"", "article_summary": "Health as social justiceNyarang\u2019o said health is a social justice or human rights issue and so nations must strive to ensure that all their nationals get the best health care possible.\nHe said what makes the difference between developed and developing countries\u2019 quality of health care are the systems put in place to provide that care.\nThe Presidential Commission on Health has since produced a scathing report, which some people say is a litany of indictments of the country\u2019s health care system.\nIn addition to universal health insurance, Nyarang\u2019o advocates the establishment of a health trust into which donors and philanthropists can put money.\nThe title of his lecture was: Is universal access to quality health care attainable in low and medium countries or are we simply feeding a white elephant?"}
