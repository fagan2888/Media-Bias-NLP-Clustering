She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.\n\nPreet Bharara, the Indian-born U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, also claimed Ms. Khobragade violated U.S. minimum-wage laws by paying Sangeeta Richard, an Indian citizen employed as a housekeeper and baby sitter, about one-third of what she was due.\n\n\u201cForeign nationals brought to the United States to serve as domestic workers are entitled to the same protections against exploitation as those afforded to United States citizens,\u201d Mr. Bharara said after announcing the arrest and charges last week. \u201cThis type of fraud on the United States and the exploitation of an individual will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nMr. Bharara emphasized the seriousness of the case against Ms. Khobragade, noting that the Justice Department\u2019s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit played an integral role in the investigation and that his office\u2019s Organized Crime Unit will handle the trial.\n\nThe Indian Embassy denounced Ms. Khobragade\u2019s arrest and called on the State Department to sort out the case.\n\n\u201cThe government of India is shocked and appalled at the manner in which she has been humiliated by the U.S. authorities,\u201d said embassy spokesman Sridharan Madhusudhanan.\n\nIn New Delhi, Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid called the arrest \u201can insult.\u201d The Foreign Ministry over the weekend summoned U.S. Ambassador Nancy J. Powell to complain about the arrest.\n\nIndia claims that Ms. Khobragade has immunity under an international treaty on consular relations, but the State Department says the protection covers only her work in the consul-general\u2019s office, which issues visas and passports and deals with matters involving Indian citizens in the New York area.\n\n\u201cWe are handling this incident through law-enforcement channels,\u201d the State Department said.\n\nMs. Khobragade is accused of encouraging Ms. Richard to falsify documents and lie to U.S. diplomats in India to get a work visa as her domestic servant.\n\nThe criminal charges against Ms. Khobragade say she paid Ms. Richard about $3 an hour for a workweek that often extended beyond the normal 40 hours from November 2012 to June. Prosecutors say Ms. Richard should have received $9.75 an hour.\n\nA magistrate released Ms. Khobragade on a $250,000 bond Thursday.\n\nMs. Khobragade\u2019s case is the second action against foreign diplomats in New York since Dec. 5, when prosecutors announced charges against 50 current or former Russian diplomats and their spouses in a $1.5 million Medicaid scam.\n\nDIPLOMATIC TRAFFIC\n\nForeign visitors in Washington this week include:\n\nMonday\n\n\u2022 Michitaka Nakatomi of the Japan External Trade Organization and Yorizumi Watanabe, a professor of international political economy at Japan\u2019s Keio University. They address the Brookings Institution on U.S.-Japanese trade agreements.\n\nTuesday\n\n\u2022 Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian nuclear negotiator who addresses the Asia Society on U.S.-Iranian relations.\n\n\u2022 Embassy Row is published on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.
