Do you recommend vitamin supplements for healthy people?

MURALI DORAISWAMY: No. A balanced diet is all that is necessary. When Linus Pauling (the winner of two Nobel Prizes) first claimed in the 1950s that high dose vitamins may have health benefits (especially vitamin C for prevention of common cold and cancer) he was called a quack by the medical community. Some 20 years later the medical and alternative medicine community began touting high-dose vitamins for ailments from cancer to heart disease to stress to Alzheimer’s–many of the same conditions that Linus Pauling was criticized for!

Now after millions of Americans have taken daily vitamins for two decades, the results of the clinical trials are in and the news is not good. Most vitamin supplement trials (with a few exceptions) for healthy people have shown no benefit and some showed they may be harmful. For example, a 19-year study of 38,000 women showed that multivitamins, vitamin B6, folic acid, iron, magnesium, zinc and copper supplements were all linked with a 2-5% increased risk of death. A 12-year trial of 35,000 men showed that vitamin E raised risk for prostate cancer. And a study of over 180,000 people showed that antioxidant supplements were linked to a 5% greater risk of dying.

Vitamins are now being compared to snake oil, a sure sign that we have come full cycle again. Denmark took the wise step of banning foods and drinks from being fortified with vitamins.
