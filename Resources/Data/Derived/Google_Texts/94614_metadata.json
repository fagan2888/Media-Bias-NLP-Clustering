I'm on the verge of exploding,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nRobinson said Florida Blue told him they can't cancel his policy unless the marketplace notifies them of his new insurance, but the marketplace told Robinson that's something they can't do.\n\nHe\u2019s now considering closing his bank account, which he said will cause all sorts of hassle.\n\n\u201cAll this because Florida Blue just won't cancel my account,\" he said.\n\nA representative with Florida Blue told Brown that she would look into it.\n\nWFTV contacted the Department of Health and Human Services to find out why people are having so much trouble canceling plans they signed up for at Healthcare.gov, but they have not responded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WFTV learned some people who signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act are finding it impossible to cancel their plans.", "author": "EndPlay", "og": {"site_name": "WFTV", "description": "WFTV learned some people who signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act are finding it impossible to cancel their plans.", "title": "Obamacare plans nearly impossible to cancel", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/obamacare-plans-nearly-impossible-cancel/107363672", "image": {"width": 160, "altText": "Affordable Care Act plans hard to cancel_4671432", "title": "Affordable Care Act plans hard to cancel_4671432", "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2014/02/27/ORCO_FL_BLUE_PAYMENTS.trans_2297718_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "height": 90}, "locale": "en_US", "video": {"height": 0, "width": 0, "thumbnailUrl": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2016/02/22/Obamacare%20plans%20nearly%20impossible%20to%20cancel_6337287_1456135549075_2218208_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "content-type": "video", "title": "Obamacare plans nearly impossible to cancel"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WFTV learned some people who signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act are finding it impossible to cancel their plans.", "title": "Obamacare plans nearly impossible to cancel", "url": "http://www.wftv.com/news/local/obamacare-plans-nearly-impossible-cancel/107363672", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://mediaweb.wftv.com/photo/2014/02/27/ORCO_FL_BLUE_PAYMENTS.trans_2297718_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@WFTV", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "orange county, StoryKeywords", "article": {"section": "Local", "tag": "orange county", "published_time": "2014-02-27T20:14:10+0000", "modified_time": "2014-02-27T20:14:10+0000"}, "news_keywords": "Obamacare plans nearly impossible to cancel", "content_id": 107363672, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde382\"", "article_summary": "A representative with Florida Blue told Brown that she would look into it.\n\u201cI immediately called back Florida Blue and asked them to cancel the policy,\" Robinson said.\nHe said Florida Blue officials told him if he signed up for the other policy, his Florida Blue policy would cancel automatically, but the exact opposite happened instead.\nUpdated: Feb 27, 2014 - 3:14 PMWFTV learned some people who signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act are finding it impossible to cancel their plans.\nRobinson said Florida Blue told him they can't cancel his policy unless the marketplace notifies them of his new insurance, but the marketplace told Robinson that's something they can't do."}
