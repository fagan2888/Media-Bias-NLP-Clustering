Hanging on the outside of the refrigerator are a wide assortment of photos of those dear to Murthy, as well as wedding and birth announcements of close friends and family.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe has a deep investment in people,\u201d said Dr. Ali Khan, 29, a close friend who has worked with Murthy \u2014 President Obama\u2019s intended nominee as the nation\u2019s surgeon general \u2014 to push for many of Obama\u2019s health policy initiatives. \u201cHe\u2019s driven by social interaction.\u201d\n\nAt 36, Murthy has also strived to use his medical degree to help patients beyond the hospital walls through starting health care companies and nonprofits. His supporters hope that his record stands out as he heads into a potentially difficult confirmation process before the Senate.\n\nOn Thursday night, Obama announced that he would nominate Murthy to the four-year post that carries little formal power but can be a bully pulpit for public health issues. A hearing has not been scheduled.\n\nIn the nation\u2019s bitter partisan climate, many of Obama\u2019s nominees have been held up for months. Murthy could face some tough questions about his close association with Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which has been hit with criticism over its flawed implementation.\n\nIn 2009, Murthy founded Doctors for America, a grass-roots organization of some 16,000 doctors and medical students nationwide that has been a strong advocate of Obama\u2019s signature legislation before and after its passage. Still, some of Obama\u2019s critics say Murthy may get less scrutiny than some other nominees have because the surgeon general is seen as largely a figurehead position.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople view the surgeon general\u2019s office as about as effective as the Obamacare website, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of concern about who\u2019s in the job,\u201d said Barney Keller, a spokesman for Club for Growth, an influential conservative group that worked against two other Obama appointments in recent years.\n\nThe last surgeon general to attract widespread attention was the late C. Everett Koop, who in the 1980s spoke out about the dangers of smoking and in favor of AIDS and HIV education.\n\nDr. Norris Kamo, a physician from Seattle who met Murthy while studying public policy at Harvard and worked with Doctors for America, said he hopes the Senate will concentrate on Murthy\u2019s impressive record. \u201cIdeally they\u2019d focus on his credentials, but who knows with the political environment now,\u201d Kamo said.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Friday, Senate staffers said they were researching Murthy\u2019s record and qualifications. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, called him \u201ca great choice\u201d and said she was \u201cproud to see someone with such strong Boston roots nominated.\u201d She will have a prominent role in Murthy\u2019s confirmation because she serves on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which will be in charge of the initial public vetting.\n\nDon Stewart, deputy chief of staff for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, said McConnell typically waits until after a nominee speaks at a committee hearing to weigh support. But he said Murthy\u2019s advocacy for the health law may not play a prominent role in that final decision.\n\n\u201cThe entire administration is closely associated with Obamacare,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIf you have that filter, then nobody would get confirmed.\u201d\n\nMurthy declined to be interviewed. Born in England to parents who are originally from South India, he spent most of his childhood in Miami, where his father was a primary care doctor and his mother worked in his practice, said Khan, who works for a health startup in Cambridge.\n\n\u2018He has a deep investment in people. He\u2019s driven by social interaction.\u2019 Dr. Ali Khan, who works for a health start-up in Cambridge, speaking of Dr. Vivek Murthy, a close friend\n\nMurthy excelled academically early on. He graduated as valedictorian from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in Pinecrest, Fla., in 1994, and graduated from Harvard College in three years, distinguishing himself with a magna cum laude degree in biochemical sciences in 1997, according to officials at both schools. He then earned a combined medical and business degree from Yale, and about a decade ago, began working at Brigham and Women\u2019s, first as an intern and now as a hospitalist. His supervisors at the Brigham describe him in outsized glowing terms, emphasizing they are not just praising him because they want him to win confirmation.\n\nHis colleagues and friends said Murthy is humble, soft-spoken, and passionately idealistic, throwing himself into his work and friendships. While he is of the age where many of his friends are marrying and having children, he is the single, honorary uncle to many, sending gifts as soon as a happy occasion is announced.\n\nHis job at the Brigham is part-time, largely so he can devote energies to his other professional interests. Those include TrialNetworks, a software start-up company in Needham that he founded in 2007, to help drug developers efficiently collect information from clinical trials. In 1995, he founded VISIONS Worldwide, a nonprofit dedicated to AIDS and HIV education in India.\n\nIn the past five years, his work mobilizing the medical profession around Obama\u2019s universal health care law has been a prime focus. In an article in Hospitalist News in January 2012, he gave his thoughts about why he helped start Doctors for Obama in 2008, which worked to get Obama elected and was later reborn as Doctors for America. He said he was \u201cstruck by how few physicians were organizing and gathering their ideas to actually make an impact on the candidates\u2019 platforms and, ultimately, on a health reform bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few colleagues and I began Doctors for America with a simple belief that physicians should play a leadership role in designing and running our nation\u2019s health care system,\u201d he said.\n\nOther than his work with Doctors for America, Murthy\u2019s other political efforts have been modest. Campaign finance records show just two donations: In August 2011, he gave $500 to a Democratic congressional candidate from Illinois, Raja Krishnamoorthi, and this May, he gave $500 to Dr. Donald Berwick, a Massachusetts gubernatorial candidate and former administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n\nKhan said he called Murthy Thursday night as soon as he heard the news, and virtually \u201cscreamed\u201d into the phone with excitement. When asked what Murthy said, Khan declined to elaborate other than to say, \u201cHe was honored and humbled.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "2.2.652494669", "eomportal-id": 566439, "description": "Dr. Vivek Murthy\u2019s refrigerator in his Brookline apartment, one close friend says, reveals a lot about his priorities outside his busy professional life as a Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital physician, start-up entrepreneur, and political activist.
