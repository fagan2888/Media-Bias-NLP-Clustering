When it comes to giving back, Americans rank second in the world, according to a new report by the U.K.-based Charities Aid Foundation.

The report finds that 63 percent of Americans donated to charity last year, down from 68 percent last year. The study found that 65 percent of Americans said they had helped a stranger and 44 percent had volunteered.

The most generous country, according to the report, is Myanmar, which edged out the United States after the two nations were tied last year. That country’s generosity may reflect its culture of Theravada Buddhism. More than 90 percent of residents gave money last year, and half volunteered.

Rounding out the top five countries on the World Giving Index are New Zealand, Canada and Australia. The list of the top 20 most generous countries also includes some extremely poor nations, including Sri Lanka, Kenya and Guatemala.

Globally, the report found that 1.4 billion people gave money to charity in 2014, a participation rate of 31.5 percent, up from 28.3 percent in 2013.

“The world is becoming a more generous place,” CAF Chief Executive John Low said in a statement. “It is heartening to see that, even during these times of economic uncertainty across the world, people are increasingly likely to donate money to causes to help others.”

Even as they’re giving more money, people are less likely to donate their time. The study found that 21 percent of people volunteered in 2014, a slight decline from the previous year.

The report also reveals some interesting gender divides. In developed countries, women are more likely to give than men, but men are more likely to give overall.
