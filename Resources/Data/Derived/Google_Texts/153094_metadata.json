B. O'Reilly William F. B. O'Reilly is a consultant to Republicans.\n\nOne of my favorite people in the world, a local mom and friend, pulled up next to me in her minivan last week outside our neighborhood Target with the warmest, I\u2019m-so-glad-to-see-you-we-have-a-million-things-to-catch-up-on smiles.\n\nI felt the same way. She and I are among a handful of town conservatives who commiserate whenever we can, usually for just a few seconds in a shopping aisle or at the back of an elementary school cello recital.\n\n\u201cCan you believe the Iran deal?\u201d That sort of thing.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a question what we\u2019d be discussing as her van window lowered. Donald Trump. Of course. What else does anyone talk about these days?\n\nI opened: \u201cI\u2019m all in for Ted Cruz;\u201d I said jauntily, \u201cI just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t do what?,\u201d she asked.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do Donald Trump \u2014 no matter what.\u201d\n\nBad miscalculation: One of the nicest smiles you\u2019ll ever see instantly vanished. In its place came genuine, impassioned anger.\n\n\u201cYou know, you people in the media and politics just don\u2019t get it! You don\u2019t get why the rest of us are so mad.\u201d The words came easily and her eyes flashed as she spoke.\n\nTo say I was taken aback would be a significant understatement. The term \u201cyou people\u201d really cut into me. In an instant, I had become one of \u201cthem\u201d to someone I consider a trusted friend and ally.\n\nI immediately backed down. Politics can destroy friendships, and I didn\u2019t want to lose this one.\n\nBut the exchange left me shaken and seething, frankly, for the rest of the day \u2014 not so much at my neighbor (OK, a little) but at all the people who have suddenly discovered politics and want to hang by the neck those of us who have spent a lifetime in the trenches, knocking on doors, phone banking after work, collecting petition signatures while our friends were at the beach and writing checks we couldn\u2019t afford to candidates who didn\u2019t stand a chance of winning. I wake up these days wanting to vent at them in a flurry of expletives, ending with a harsher version of, \u201cWhere the heck have you been all these years?!\u201d Those \u201cnew\u201d voters everyone keeps talking about? I want to tell them to stick it from the depths of my soul, I\u2019m ashamed to admit. I want to say, \u201cWhere were that election day?\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s only partly the reason my friend\u2019s words stung. They also hurt because they\u2019re partially true, but not necessarily in the way she meant, which I assume was about the years of self-dealing and broken promises in Washington.\n\nThat I get. I\u2019ve been angry about it for years.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nWhat I am guilty of \u2014 what people in the political industry who develop messaging have been guilty of for going on 20 years \u2014 is helping create a political environment that\u2019s rendered rational discourse trite and ineffectual. Ask Ohio Gov. John Kasich about that.\n\nConsultants in both parties have gradually upped their font sizes to attract attention, sharpened their rhetoric and mastered the art of painting opponents as mortal enemies of the state in one way or another.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve done it because it works.\n\nNot all of us set out to go there; some learned it along the way out of necessity. It\u2019s a bleak reality: Hard-hitting politics gets news coverage. Detailed policy prescriptions, not so much. (Media industry professionals can tell you which stories people want to watch and read most.) This truth has become far more pronounced, in my experience, as more and more jobs have gone overseas and as the U.S. economy continues to feel stagnant.\n\nMy colleagues and I also have made political compromise hurt. Part of the reason for that was McCain-Feingold, the well-intentioned Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 as it\u2019s formally known.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nIt backfired.\n\nMcCain-Feingold moved billions of dollars that would have gone into candidate campaigns into narrow, issue advocacy PACs that for the first time developed powerful and effective media and marketing operations of their own. Step out of line on a vote today and feel their wrath, be it from the teachers\u2019 unions, the NRA or NARAL. Groups like these, and the newer super PACs, have no incentive, like candidates do, to temper attacks. They\u2019re not trying to get elected; they\u2019re keeping incumbents in line or working to knock them out of office.\n\nBut even candidate campaigns have changed dramatically in tone and strategy. Political rhetoric used to escalate predictably over the course of a race. Competitive campaigns would launch with \u201csunshine and rainbow\u201d bio ads (establish yourself first) before shifting over to the grainy negative stuff, which is the only thing that significantly moves poll numbers. Many campaigns now open with full nuclear salvos (define the other guy before he defines you.)\n\nThirdly, candidates have learned the hard way never to talk about political realities. It\u2019s electoral death in primaries especially. A candidate may be telling the truth in saying, \u201cGeesh, I don\u2019t know if we can get rid of Obamacare without the 60 votes needed for cloture in the Senate.\u201d But what low-information voters are hearing \u2014 and being told to hear \u2014 is \u201cthis guy\u2019s not committed to the cause.\u201d\n\nIs it any wonder that voters end up disappointed?\n\nBut here\u2019s the worrisome question going forward: How do we change course? How do campaigns de-escalate when doing so would in many cases mean losing? To rephrase the walkaway quote from the movie, \u201cThe Untouchables,\u201d how do you bring a knife to a gunfight?\n\nA mutually agreed upon detente by the entire political industry is a wonderful thought, but so is peace in the Middle East. Both are worth discussing, but probably unrealistic.\n\nWhat I fear is more likely to occur is continued escalation of the harsh, us-vs.-them rhetoric and tactics. Young consultants are no doubt watching Trump\u2019s success and taking notes. My biggest fear is that it will take some terrible event or outcome to break this trajectory. That\u2019s historically what needs to happen before humanity is reminded, yet again, that civility isn\u2019t just politeness, it\u2019s the essential ingredient of a democracy.\n\nGetting back to my friend\u2019s question; why are so many people so angry?\n\nThey\u2019re angry for 100 reasons. One if them is that we in the political industry were weak and irresponsible. We gave them exactly what they wanted.\n\nWilliam F. B.
