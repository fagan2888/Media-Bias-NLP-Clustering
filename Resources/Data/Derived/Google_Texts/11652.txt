A program that will offer free health care to thousands of undocumented youth and adults and assign them to specific community clinics launched on Wednesday, officials said.

Called My Health L.A., the $61 million program will assign people to one of 164 community clinics countywide that will become their medical home. There, the patients will receive primary care, chronic disease management, prescription medications and referrals to specialty care at county facilities, said Tangerine Brigham, deputy director for the managed care services division at the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.

“When they have a medical home, they will be less inclined to use the system episodically, like going to one clinic for one thing, and another clinic for another,” Brigham said. “It’s just not cost effective. But with this restructuring, it’ll be a more efficient.”

My Health L.A. replaces a former program called Healthy Way L.A. Unmatched, which ended on Dec. 31, she said. Those who qualify for My Health L.A. are undocumented, live in Los Angeles County and have an income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that would mean a monthly income of at or below $2,743.

People who are undocumented are ineligible to sign for health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, including Medicaid.

So far, 3,000 people have signed up for My Health L.A. at Northeast Valley Health Corp., which operates 14 health care sites across the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, said Vilma Champion, director of managed care at Northeast Valley,

Champion said even though clients receive a medical card, the program is not insurance, but it is designed as a quasi-managed care program, she said. Clients are matched or assigned to a medical home for a year, she added.

“It’s not an insurance program, but it’s a coverage program,” Champion said.
