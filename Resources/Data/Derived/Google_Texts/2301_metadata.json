The company is focusing first on eight new states, including New York, Florida and Massachusetts, and it now has a license to operate in all 50 states.\n\nSimplyInsured CEO Vivek Shah, who previously worked as a healthcare analyst at McKinsey & Company, said in an interview that he started the company after a confusing experience trying to buy health insurance for himself on the open market.\n\nSo. Much. Tech. Some of the biggest names in tech are coming to TNW Conference in Amsterdam this May.

The startup offers instantaneous quotes, fully-online paperless filing, 24/7 support, an advocacy group, mobile insurance cards and higher acceptance rates.\n\nAccording to Shah, the average broker has a 25 percent rejection rate, much of which is caused by not being aware of obscure rules from individual insurance providers. SimplyInsured\u2019s rejection rate is currently hovering around 10 percent.\n\nSimplyInsured is emerging during a time when the nation is obsessed with the healthcare issue. Open enrollment just wrapped up for President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, and the technical struggles of government sites like Healthcare.gov have been widely documented. While small businesses aren\u2019t directly affected by the mandate, the fact that individuals are required to have health insurance will trickle down to smaller companies.\n\n\u201cThe [Affordable Care Act] has created a lot of attention, but also a lot of confusion because of all the changes,\u201d Shah said. \u201cWe can reduce people\u2019s fear in the new world.\u201d\n\nSimplyInsured estimates that it saves customers $500-$1,000 a year per employee on average, though extreme cases could see even more of a benefit. One customer saw her monthly healthcare costs drop from $1,600 per month to $350 while still receiving equivalent benefits. A three-person financial services company recently saw a reduction of $30,000 per year from their insurance costs after working with SimplyInsured.\n\nCompanies like Trinet have built up the professional employer organization (PEO) industry around full-service offerings, but a new batch of startups, such as SimplyInsured and ZenPayroll, has arrived to improve individual components of an organization\u2019s HR, accounting and benefits needs.\n\nFinding health insurance for a small batch of employees has long been one of the major pain points for businesses, so SimplyInsured\u2019s expansion should do a bit more good in the world.\n\nImage credit: Adam Berry / Getty Images\n\nRead next: Skype for Windows Phone 8.1 can upgrade calls to video chats and will have Cortana integration (Updated)", "article_metadata": {"description": "SimplyInsured has announced an expansion outside of California to begin offering healthcare options for small businesses across the US.", "author": "Josh Ong", "og": {"site_name": "The Next Web", "description": "SimplyInsured has announced an expansion outside of California to begin offering healthcare options for small businesses across the US.", "title": "Healthcare Startup SimplyInsured Goes Nationwide", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/doctor-crop.jpg", "height": 1369}, "url": "http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/04/03/y-combinator-backed-simplyinsured-takes-online-healthcare-solution-nationwide/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SimplyInsured has announced an expansion outside of California to begin offering healthcare options for small businesses across the US.", "creator": "@beijingdou", "label1": "Author", "image": {"src": "http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/doctor-crop.jpg", "identifier": "http://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/doctor-crop.jpg"}, "title": "Healthcare Startup SimplyInsured Goes Nationwide", "site": "@thenextweb", "data1": "Josh Ong", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 10876852}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-04-03T00:55:48+02:00", "bt": {"body": "Y Combinator startup\u00a0SimplyInsured has announced an expansion outside of California to begin offering healthcare options for small businesses across the US.
