As GOP-controlled states across the country advance dozens of abortion restrictions, the Golden State has pursued the opposite approach, taking unprecedented steps to expand the pool of abortion providers and preserve insurance coverage for abortion.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean the anti-choice community isn\u2019t making inroads in other ways. According to a new report released by NARAL Pro-Choice California, the state is grappling with a rise in \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d (CPCs) \u2014 right-wing organizations that masquerade as reproductive health clinics in order to dissuade pregnant women from having an abortion.\n\nCPCs advertise themselves as viable alternatives to other women\u2019s health clinics. Their staff members often wear white coats and their waiting rooms look like any other doctor\u2019s office. But these centers are actually strategic players in the anti-choice agenda. They don\u2019t tend to employ medical professionals and don\u2019t offer the full range of reproductive health services; instead, they largely provide biased counseling designed to convince women to continue their pregnancies.\n\n\u201cThis is a very underhanded way that the anti-choice movement is able to make progress and interfere with women\u2019s health decisions in a state like California, where they can\u2019t do it through our legislature,\u201d Rebecca Griffin, the assistant director of California Programs at NARAL, told ThinkProgress. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that they\u2019re proliferating here and definitely making some real serious efforts to target women who are seeking abortions with their deceptive advertisements.\u201d\n\nAcross the country, as the number of abortion clinics has dwindled, there\u2019s actually been a rise in the network of CPCs. Anti-choice organizations say that more than 3,500 crisis pregnancy centers are currently in operation.\n\nNARAL Pro-Choice America has conducted undercover investigations in 10 different states to document what happens when women facing an unintended pregnancy find themselves in one of those fake clinics. In California specifically, the organization trained six investigators who visited 45 centers in 19 counties \u2014 more than 25 percent of the estimated 167 different CPCs in the state.\n\nOne of those investigators, 19-year-old volunteer Cristina \u2014 who asked not to be identified by her real name \u2014 attended counseling sessions at dozens of CPCs, and said she was amazed they all ended up blending together. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone was trained by one person. I heard the same thing over and over again,\u201d Cristina said.\n\nWhen Cristina told CPC employees that she was unexpectedly pregnant and didn\u2019t think she wanted to have a baby, she always heard the same information about how abortion is supposedly linked to breast cancer, depression, and infertility. One employee told her that ending the pregnancy might puncture her uterus and close her Fallopian tubes, preventing her from having any more children in the future. One counselor asked her how she would have felt if her own mother had aborted her. Another told her she should \u201cstop whoring around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was so hurtful. Sitting there in those centers, I was realizing that this could be me \u2014 I could be a young girl who is disoriented and happens to stumble across this place and I think it\u2019s a real clinic,\u201d Cristina said. \u201cEven if you\u2019re not looking for a CPC, you might walk in there by accident.\u201d\n\nCPCs are strategic in location; they\u2019re often situated right next to a real abortion clinic, or right across the street from a high school or college. In California, according to Cristina, right-wing clinics target minority communities and tend to set up shop in areas where people may only speak Spanish. It can be really hard to tell the difference, especially for women in vulnerable situations who are eager to visit the first health clinic they can find.\n\n\u201cWe think it creates an interesting dynamic here. People are lucky enough to live in a state that has good protections and good coverage for abortion and prenatal care, but aren\u2019t necessarily going to get to the right place,\u201d Griffin said.\n\nAbortion opponents have pursued a similar online strategy. When you search for \u201cabortion clinic,\u201d advertisements for crisis pregnancy centers are often some of the first to pop up, prompting reproductive rights groups to lobby Google and Yahoo to crack down on the groups.\n\nAnd even women who aren\u2019t necessarily interested in having an abortion may receive inaccurate information at CPCs from employees who aren\u2019t actually trained in reproductive health. Cristina asked for an ultrasound at several centers; at two of them, the staff incorrectly identified her IUD as her \u201cbaby.\u201d NARAL has also documented repeated instances of CPC employees misleading women about their risk of miscarriage, telling them they don\u2019t need to make a decision about their pregnancy right away because they have up to a 50 percent chance of miscarrying \u2014 even though medical professionals put that risk closer to 15 percent.\n\n\u201cI have heard anecdotally from public health officials about problems with women who thought they were getting prenatal care, but then were dropped by CPCs once it was too late for them to have an abortion,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe do feel like it\u2019s a real public health issue here, where women aren\u2019t getting the good prenatal care they need and don\u2019t necessarily know otherwise until they\u2019re far into their pregnancies.\u201d\n\nDespite the well-documented issues at crisis pregnancy centers, many of them are actually the recipients of state funding. Some states designate direct funding for CPCs in their budgets, while others indirectly support them with the proceeds from \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plates. This week, NPR reported that some states are funneling money to CPCs even as they cut funding for Planned Parenthood. Texas, for instance, continues to defund family planning services at the national women\u2019s health organization, yet appropriated more than $5 million over two fiscal years for CPCs.\n\n\u201cRegardless of one\u2019s position on abortion, we can all agree that women should not be given medical misinformation,\u201d Amy Everitt, the state director of NARAL Pro-Choice California, concluded in an op-ed published on Thursday. \u201cIt is wrong to lie to women, especially when those lies can have serious health consequences.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Inside the right-wing organizations trying to talk women out of abortion.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Inside the right-wing organizations trying to talk women out of abortion.", "title": "\u2018Crisis Pregnancy Center\u2019 Tells Woman Her IUD Was A Baby", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/03/13/3633349/crisis-pregnancy-california-report/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cpc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Inside the right-wing organizations trying to talk women out of abortion.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cpc-321x214.jpg", "title": "\u2018Crisis Pregnancy Center\u2019 Tells Woman Her IUD Was A Baby", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cpc.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/cpc.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-13T09:49:17+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Anti-choice organizations say that more than 3,500 crisis pregnancy centers are currently in operation.\nHealth \u2018Crisis Pregnancy Center\u2019 Tells Woman Her IUD Was A Baby CREDIT: Flickr Creative Commons via BrianneWhen you think about states where women struggle to access reproductive health care, California certainly isn\u2019t the first one that comes to mind.\nWhen you search for \u201cabortion clinic,\u201d advertisements for crisis pregnancy centers are often some of the first to pop up, prompting reproductive rights groups to lobby Google and Yahoo to crack down on the groups.\nThis week, NPR reported that some states are funneling money to CPCs even as they cut funding for Planned Parenthood.\nAccording to a new report released by NARAL Pro-Choice California, the state is grappling with a rise in \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d (CPCs) \u2014 right-wing organizations that masquerade as reproductive health clinics in order to dissuade pregnant women from having an abortion."}
