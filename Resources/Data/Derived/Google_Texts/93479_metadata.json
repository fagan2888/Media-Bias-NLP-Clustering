He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia may have been the worst-behaved justice in the courtroom this morning, Dahlia\u2014but the chief was the most obnoxious on paper. The Arizona redistricting case brought out the worst in Chief Justice John Roberts, the petty jibes and scornful mockery that this usually staid justice strives to avoid.\n\nLike King v. Burwell, the Arizona case is, at bottom, really a political dispute. It began when voters in the state passed a ballot initiative that took congressional redistricting out of the state legislature\u2019s hands\u2014and handed the task over to an independent, nonpartisan commission. Before the initiative, partisan legislators gerrymandered districts to favor their own party. Once it passed, the commission created fairer districts that led to more competitive elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut the Republican-dominated Arizona legislature sued to stop this progress. It argued that the commission violates the Constitution, which states that \u201cThe Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for \u2026 Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.\u201d Arizona legislators insist that this provision gives elected lawmakers exclusive power to determine the \u201cmanner of holding elections.\u201d Thus, the independent commission should be invalidated, and the legislature should be permitted to gerrymander the state.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court rejected this argument by an unnervingly close 5\u20134 vote. In a masterful opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg laid waste to the Arizona legislature\u2019s faux originalist arguments. The \u201canimating principle\u201d of our Constitution, Ginsburg explains, is \u201cthat the people themselves are the originating source of all powers of government.\u201d And while we may today define \u201clegislature\u201d solely as a state\u2019s legislative body, that\u2019s an anachronistic reading of the Constitution. Dictionaries from the founding era, Ginsburg writes, \u201ccapaciously define the word \u2018legislature,\u2019 \u201d usually as \u201c[t]he power that makes laws\u201d or \u201cthe Authority of making Laws.\u201d Among other pieces of historical evidence, Charles Pinckney\u2014a key player at the Constitutional Convention\u2014defined a \u201crepublic\u201d as a place \u201cwhere the people at large\u201d may \u201ccollectively \u2026 form the legislature.\u201d\n\nA Slate Plus Special Feature: Supreme Court Blogs, TV Recaps, and Wikipedia What a legal-affairs writer visits on the Internet more than 20 times a month.\n\nThese persuasive originalist sources lead Ginsburg to conclude that legislature here actually means legislative power\u2014which can be exercised by the people through direct democracy. This reasoning strikes me as obviously correct. The idea that all political power is derived from the people is a bedrock principle of our constitutional system. Arizona legislators\u2019 argument\u2014that the founders would have somehow wished to deprive the people, acting collectively, from exerting control over a fundamentally political process like redistricting\u2014is simply implausible. Just because ballot initiatives didn\u2019t exist at the founding doesn\u2019t mean that they are out of line with the framers\u2019 vision of democracy.\n\nYet Roberts, joined by the other three conservatives, latches onto an anachronistic definition of the word legislature and sinks in his teeth. The court\u2019s definition, he writes, contradicts the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the word and \u201cmakes nonsense\u201d of its history. He calls the decision \u201ca judicial error of the most basic order.\u201d The court\u2019s position, he says, \u201chas no basis in the text, structure, or history of the Constitution.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s pure applesauce. Ginsburg carefully tracks the framers\u2019 debate over the clause in dispute, proving that the \u201cdominant purpose of the Elections Clause\u201d was to \u201cempower Congress to override state election rules, not to restrict the way States enact legislation.\u201d Her evidence is comprehensive and sweeping; Roberts\u2019 is cherry-picked. Yet the court\u2019s two staunchest originalists, Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas, join Roberts\u2019 opinion spurning Ginsburg, as does Justice Samuel Alito. To them, apparently, it is more important to preserve gerrymandering than to interpret the Constitution evenhandedly.\n\nPerhaps the most galling aspect of Roberts\u2019 dissent, though, is his casual dismissal of both democracy and federalism\u2014the two cornerstones of his marriage equality dissent. Ginsburg writes that \u201cour federal system\u201d allows states to \u201cretain autonomy to establish their own governmental processes.\u201d She also explains that \u201call political power flows from the people.\u201d To those arguments, the conservatives respond: So what? The same justices who were so devoted to democracy Friday\u2014even a form of democracy that allows voters to trample on fundamental rights\u2014now decide that democracy is overrated. If Arizonans are truly frustrated with gerrymandering, Roberts writes, they should pass a constitutional amendment. Never mind that the legislators who would vote on that amendment would be beneficiaries of gerrymandering and would likely see no reason to curtail it.\n\nBut enough carping about the dissents. Ginsburg\u2019s opinion is now the law, and I suspect that, in a few decades, this case will be considered one of the most important of the term. Thus far, only California has copied Arizona and created an independent redistricting commission. But with the court\u2019s blessing, more states are likely to follow suit. These commissions have been hugely successful thus far, a real boost for representative democracy and a cure for the notoriously stubborn problem of gerrymandering. Had Justice Anthony Kennedy swung away from Ginsburg and aligned with his fellow conservatives, America would be facing down a distressingly undemocratic future.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Ginsburg\u2019s redistricting decision could be the most important one of the term.", "fb-share": "Chief Justice John Roberts throws a little tantrum.", "sailthru.author": "Mark Joseph Stern", "description": "Dear Dahlia, Walter, Judge Posner, Kenji, and Marty, Justice Antonin Scalia may have been the worst-behaved justice in the courtroom this morning, Dahl ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Dear Dahlia, Walter, Judge Posner, Kenji, and Marty, Justice Antonin Scalia may have been the worst-behaved justice in the courtroom this morning, Dahl ...", "title": "This Ginsburg Decision Could Be the Most Important of the Supreme Court Term", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/ginsburg_decision_in_arizona_case_supreme_court_rules_against_gerrymandering.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_RBG.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dear Dahlia, Walter, Judge Posner, Kenji, and Marty, Justice Antonin Scalia may have been the worst-behaved justice in the courtroom this morning, Dahl ...", "title": "This Ginsburg Decision Could Be the Most Important of the Supreme Court Term", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/ginsburg_decision_in_arizona_case_supreme_court_rules_against_gerrymandering.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_RBG.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@mjs_DC", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-29T15:42:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "This Ginsburg Decision Could Be the Most Important of the Supreme Court Term", "sailthru.headline": "Supreme Court Breakfast Table", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"This Ginsburg Decision Could Be the Most Important of the Supreme Court Term\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2015/scotus_roundup/ginsburg_decision_in_arizona_case_supreme_court_rules_against_gerrymandering.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/06/150629_JURIS_RBG.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100150629016\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-06-29T15:42:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Mark Joseph Stern\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"supreme court\",\n    \"gerrymandering\",\n    \"ruth bader ginsburg\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s brilliant blockbuster decision is a victory for democracy.
