After senior Calyn Hull gave Austin Peay its second set point, sophomore Aubrey Marsellis clinched the set with a block, giving APSU the 28-26 victory.\n\nAustin Peay scored an impressive 22 kills the opening, but could not maintain that momentum the match\u2019s remainder. The Lady Govs would post just 23 kills in the final three sets as the momentum slowly seeped Memphis\u2019 direction.\n\nMemphis (8-5) claimed the second and third sets early. The Tigers jumped out to a 12-7 lead in the first set and did not look back en route to the 25-18 win. A 14-7 Memphis lead in the third set went similarly unchallenged as it posted a 25-16 win to take the lead in the match.\n\nAustin Peay would challenge early in the fourth set and battled to a 8-8 tie. Memphis would take control with a seven-point burst to build a 15-8 lead and closed with a 9-4 run to claim the match-ending 25-13 victory.\n\n\u201cI thought our first set was the best we have looked offensively,\u201d said Lady Govs head coach Taylor Mott. \u201cI also was pleased that we were able to come back and then hold Memphis off to claim the win. However, we continue to battle with our consistency within the match. We have to be able to prevent one bad point from snowballing into several points. Once we do that we will be able to string some wins together.\u201d\n\nHull led Austin Peay with 14 kills. Junior Liz Landon scored a career-high tying 13 kills and posted a team-best .440 attack percentage. Austin Peay finished with 45 kills but saw its attack percentage fall to a match-ending .141 mark. Ebright was named to the Tiger Invitational all-tournament team following the match.\n\nLiz Landon was named APSU Player of the Match.\n\nAustin Peay continues its season-opening 17-match road trip when it opens Ohio Valley Conference play with a 7:00pm, September 27th contest at Jacksonville State.\n\nBox Score\n\nAustin Peay vs Memphis\n\n(September 21st, 2013 at Memphis, TN) Austin Peay ATTACK SET SERVE SRV DEF BLOCK GEN ## Player SP K E TA PCT A SA SE RE DIG BS BA BE BHE Points 1 FIELDS, Cami 4 0 1 2 -.500 36 0 1 0 7 0 0 0 1 0.0 2 HULL, Calyn 4 14 5 48 .188 0 1 0 4 7 0 1 0 0 15.5 4 EBRIGHT, Sammie 4 7 4 21 .143 2 0 0 1 10 0 2 0 0 8.0 8 LANDON, Liz 4 13 2 25 .440 0 0 1 0 6 0 2 0 0 14.0 10 STROTHER, Samantha 3 1 3 7 -.286 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1.5 12 HENDERSON, Lauren 4 9 6 28 .107 1 1 3 0 3 0 3 1 0 11.5 3 ADAMS, April 4 0 0 0 .000 0 0 0 0 15 0 0 0 0 0.0 7 MARSELLIS, Aubrey 3 0 0 1 .000 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1.0 13 LITCHFIELD, Syd 4 0 0 0 .000 0 1 2 1 8 0 0 0 0 1.0 15 PLYBON, Hillary 1 1 4 10 -.300 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1.5 TEAM 1 Totals 4 45 25 142 .141 42 3 7 7 57 1 10 3 1 54.0 TOTAL TEAM BLOCKS: 6.0 TEAM ATTACK BY SET Set K E TA Pct Sideout Pct 1 22 6 45 .356 15-26 57% 2 10 2 27 .296 13-25 51% 3 8 8 34 .000 12-24 50% 4 5 9 36 -.111 8-25 31% 48-100 47% SET SCORES 1 2 3 4 TEAM RECORDS Austin Peay (1) 28 18 16 13 3-12 Memphis (3) 26 25 25 25 8-5 (September 21st, 2013 at Memphis, TN) Memphis ATTACK SET SERVE SRV DEF BLOCK GEN ## Player SP K E TA PCT A SA SE RE DIG BS BA BE BHE Points 1 HAYES, McKenzie 4 7 0 20 .350 0 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 0 9.0 5 PURVIS, Lindsey 4 0 0 0 .000 0 1 1 0 10 0 0 0 0 1.0 7 WESLEY, Alexis 4 12 2 19 .526 1 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 0 14.0 9 ZIMMERMAN, Veronica 4 1 1 4 .000 51 2 1 0 10 0 1 0 1 3.5 11 HAWKINS, Lauren 4 11 6 26 .192 0 2 3 0 3 0 4 0 0 15.0 12 TEIVANE, Viktorija 4 11 5 38 .158 1 0 1 2 10 0 1 0 0 11.5 3 LILLY, Catlin 4 16 3 28 .464 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 1 0 17.0 4 PULIDO, Megan 1 0 0 0 .000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0 6 MOSS, Michaella 4 0 0 4 .000 0 1 0 0 15 0 0 0 0 1.0 16 PETRONIJEVIC, A. 4 0 0 0 .000 2 1 2 0 13 0 0 0 0 1.0 TEAM 1 Totals 4 58 17 139 .295 55 7 8 3 66 0 16 1 1 73.0 TOTAL TEAM BLOCKS: 8.0 TEAM ATTACK BY SET Set K E TA Pct Sideout Pct 1 16 5 41 .268 15-28 53% 2 15 2 29 .448 13-18 72% 3 13 4 32 .281 13-17 76% 4 14 6 37 .216 8-13 61% 49-76 64% Site: MEMPHIS, Tenn.
