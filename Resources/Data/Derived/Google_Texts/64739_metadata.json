The majority ruled that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) prohibited the state\u2019s action.\n\nLiberty Mutual Insurance Company, which has a self-insured health plan that includes only 137 Vermont residents, brought the lawsuit against the state. However, it was a part of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, which included several thousand Vermont residents in its network. After the state informed Blue Cross that it had to report all claims on its Vermont members to a state agency or face a $2,000 a day penalty, Liberty Mutual sued in federal court.\n\nThe ruling, one of a series of decisions released on Tuesday, was supported by the court\u2019s three remaining conservatives \u2013\u2013 Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas \u2013\u2013 as well as two of its liberals, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, and Anthony Kennedy, who is often viewed as a swing vote.
