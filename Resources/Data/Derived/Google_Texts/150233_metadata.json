He turned east onto Dillon Road, so he could turn around and head home, when he came upon the washed-out road.\n\nChase French braked his green Ford F-350 pickup truck, but it toppled into the raging water, where a white sedan had already crashed.\n\nThe truck hit the water, but the impact was soft enough that the airbags didn\u2019t deploy, Nancy French said.\n\nHe unbuckled his seat belt, to be ready for a quick exit. He grabbed his cell phone and dialed 911. Chase French was on the phone with 911 for 45 seconds when a second pickup truck drove off the washed-out road and slammed into his Ford. The airbags were triggered this time. He was thrown across the cab, which knocked the eyeglasses off his face and the phone from his hand.\n\nChase French crawled out of his mangled truck, scrambled back up onto Dillon Road and walked back to U.S. 287 so he could flag down help.\n\n\u201cHe was afraid another (driver) might go over and into the water,\u201d Nancy French said.\n\nAt U.S. 287 he spotted first-responders and pointed them toward the wrecks.\n\n\u201cHe told them: \u2018Look for my tail lights,\u2019 \u201d Nancy French said.\n\nThe two other drivers were not able to get out of their vehicles on their own. They were eventually rescued, pulled out by emergency workers.\n\nThe day of the crash, Chase French walked back to the wash-out from U.S. 287 and was interviewed by a sheriff\u2019s deputy. After the initial adrenaline rush of the crash wore off, pain started kicking in.\n\nHe was taken to the hospital where his severe injuries were diagnosed. He underwent surgery on his neck to stabilize it.\n\n\u201cOn one hand you could consider him really unlucky,\u201d Nancy French said. \u201cOn the other hand \u2026 we\u2019re just really thankful he is alive.\u201d\n\nChase French, a 2005 graduate of Boulder High School, is an avid outdoorsman who enjoys, hiking, backpacking and fishing.\n\nNancy French said she hopes that her son\u2019s active lifestyle, physically demanding job, and relatively young age, combine to aid Chase in his recovery.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a strong guy,\u201d Nancy French said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a long recovery. We\u2019re hoping it will be a full recovery. We\u2019re looking forward to helping him.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Driver recovering after being caught in Broomfield road collapse", "title": "Driver recovering after being caught in Broomfield road collapse", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/16/driver-recovering-after-being-caught-in-broomfield-road-collapse/", "image": {"width": 479, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__Chase_Hammondp1.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130916__Chase_Hammondp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-16T12:25:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:32:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He turned east onto Dillon Road, so he could turn around and head home, when he came upon the washed-out road.\n\u201cHe was afraid another (driver) might go over and into the water,\u201d Nancy French said.\n\u201cYesterday he took two 40-feet walks,\u201d Nancy French said Monday, followed by a short laugh \u2014 part relief, part apprehension.\nChase French, 27, of Niwot, an electrician, received multiple fractures in his neck and back, said Nancy Hammond French, his mother.\n\u201cHe is improving a little bit every day,\u201d Nancy French said."}
