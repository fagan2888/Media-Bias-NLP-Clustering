He even claimed to be one of them, saying \u201cour health care got canceled\u201d because Blue Cross-Blue Shield left the individual market in Texas.\n\nInsurers did stop offering some plans after the law took effect, including those that didn\u2019t provide required benefits like maternity care or that charged higher premiums to older or sicker people. But people with those plans had the opportunity to sign up for others. And over all, the law has drastically reduced the number of Americans who lack health insurance. According to the Census Bureau, the number of uninsured Americans dropped by 10 million between 2010, when the law passed, and 2014. While critics said employers might stop offering health insurance because of the law, three million people actually gained coverage through their employers between 2010 and 2014.\n\nIncidentally, Mr. Cruz never lost his health insurance. Blue Cross Blue Shield did cancel his particular plan, but it automatically moved him and his family to a new one. A Cruz spokeswoman said the senator had been misinformed by his insurance broker.\n\nMillions of people have lost their jobs: Mr. Cruz has called the Affordable Care Act \u201cthe biggest job-killer in this country\u201d and said \u201cmillions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work\u201d because of it. This is false.\n\nhe unemployment rate has fallen since the law took effect, PolitiFact notes, as has the number of people working part time when they would rather work full time. A 2015 study using data from the Current Population Survey found that the law \u201chad virtually no adverse effect on labor force participation, employment or usual hours worked per week through 2014.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump frequently talks about his plan to \u201cget rid of the lines around the states\u201d to foster competition among insurance companies. Customers in states where insurance is heavily regulated, the thinking goes, would be able to save money if they could purchase coverage from insurers based in states with fewer rules. Mr. Cruz, too, supports allowing people to buy insurance across state borders.\n\nBut the biggest obstacle stopping insurers from setting up in more states is not regulation; it\u2019s the difficulty of establishing a network of providers in a new market. And such a structure would destroy the longstanding ability of states to regulate health insurance for their populations. Allowing cross-border plans would encourage insurers to base themselves in low-regulation states, and the result might be a proliferation of poor-quality plans.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Premiums for plans on the exchanges rose between 2015 and 2016 and are likely to rise again next year. A few insurers have left the exchange market, raising concerns in some quarters that more companies might follow.\n\nBut the law has helped millions of Americans, especially low-wage workers like cashiers, cooks and waiters who previously struggled to pay for coverage. In inventing problems that don\u2019t exist and proposing solutions that won\u2019t help, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz show that they don\u2019t care about helping Americans get health care, which has never been their interest. They want to trash the Affordable Care Act, and they\u2019re willing to mislead the public any way they can.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Editorials", "description": "Editor\u2019s note: This editorial is from The New York Times and was originally published on April 19.\n\t\u201cDisaster.\u201d \u2018\u2019Incredible economic burden.\u201d \u2018\u2019The biggest job-killer in this country.\u201d\n\tCentral to the presidential campaigns of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz has been the claim that the Affordable Care Act has been a complete failure, and that the only way to save the country from this scourge is to replace it with something they design.", "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "GOOGLEBOT": "NOODP"}, "article_summary": "He even claimed to be one of them, saying \u201cour health care got canceled\u201d because Blue Cross-Blue Shield left the individual market in Texas.\nThey want to trash the Affordable Care Act, and they\u2019re willing to mislead the public any way they can.\nMillions of people have lost their insurance: In January, Mr. Cruz claimed that \u201cmillions of Americans\u201d had lost their health insurance because of the health reform law.\nIn inventing problems that don\u2019t exist and proposing solutions that won\u2019t help, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz show that they don\u2019t care about helping Americans get health care, which has never been their interest.\nAnd such a structure would destroy the longstanding ability of states to regulate health insurance for their populations."}
