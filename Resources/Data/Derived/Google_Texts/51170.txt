The Lee County School District is trying to tackle a major problem this summer for students whose families can't afford to pay the full price for lunch.



72 percent of students in the district right now qualify for free or reduced lunches; that's more than 50,000 children.

This week school board members will decide whether to introduce a universal free lunch program in 77 Lee County schools.

Student Laura Marty understands the importance of meals in schools.

"Lunch is my favorite subject of school, even though it's not actually a subject," Marty said jokingly.

But Marty isn't alone. She's part of a growing number of students in Lee County receiving free and reduced lunch.

Lee County school board chair Cathleen O'Daniel Morgan says the number of students on free lunch is about to get bigger.

"Instead of approximately 50,000 kids receiving free lunch in Lee County, the number approximately goes up to 71,000 kids receiving free lunch," O'Daniel Morgan said.

That number depends on if the board adopts federal grant for free lunch for all students regardless of income.

The USDA grant is called the Community Eligibility Provision.

O'Daniel Morgan says she supports it for obvious reasons.

"I think that the number of kids receiving lunch will go out with the kids who need it will go up more kids will be eating."

This will allow students to focus more on their studies and less on their hunger.

"I know how I feel when I'm on an empty stomach for the whole day. It gets me really grumpy and mad," Marty said.

To be eligible for the grant, at least 40 percent of a school population has to qualify for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
