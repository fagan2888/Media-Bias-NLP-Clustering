ALBANY — State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman will propose legislation Monday requiring health insurers to provide cost-free birth control — even for men, the Daily News has learned.

Schneiderman’s bill would write into New York law provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act that require insurance companies to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved methods of birth control for women, including the morning-after pill.

The bill would also go beyond Obamacare by requiring insurers in New York to cover non-over-the-counter contraception methods for men, such as sterilization. It would also allow up to a year’s worth of contraception to be provided at one time.

“New Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate for them,” Schneiderman said.

The legislation comes after Schneiderman’s office last week sent letters to several insurers asking for information about their contraception policies.

Schneiderman’s office said the letters were in response to reports that women were being denied coverage and that some insurers were imposing improper co-pays.

New Yorkers should not be penalized by their insurance companies for using the birth control method that they and their medical provider agree is most appropriate.

Among the complaints were charges that insurers were using “medical management techniques,” which are allowed under the Obamacare law, to restrict access to contraception, officials said.

Schneiderman’s proposed legislation would prohibit insurers from using medical management procedures to limit or delay contraception coverage.

Leslie Moran of the New York Health Plan Association said insurers in New York already abide by the Obamacare provisions and have their plans approved by state regulators.

“There is a shared goal of the state and the health plans to provide access to coverage, including contraception,” Moran said.
