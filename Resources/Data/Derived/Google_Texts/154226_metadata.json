Baker has expressed support for removing the limit, and his pick for the next secretary of education, James A. Peyser, is a strong advocate for charter schools.\n\nNeedham\u2019s School Committee chairman, Michael Greis, said he welcomes bringing creative new ideas into education. But, with public education \u201cthe bedrock of our democracy,\u201d Greis said, it concerns him that charter schools are functioning as \u201cprivate schools under another name. That to me is extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\nGreis said the cap on charter schools should not be lifted until there is more discussion about the role they play. \u201cI don\u2019t see evidence of all the innovation they are supposed to unleash,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Medford, School Committee member Ann Marie Cugno said she also opposes relaxing the cap. While charter schools receive tuition equal to the per-pupil rate of the local district, she said, many have a lower proportion of at-risk students and most are not accountable to local officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of equality,\u201d said Cugno, past president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Logan, superintendent of the Foxborough Regional Charter School, said he favors lifting the cap, though he believes the move should be accompanied by a discussion on how to \u201cappropriately fund public education for all public schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should remove the barriers to families and students getting an education they would want,\u201d he said.\n\nRalph Carrero, director/superintendent of the Lawrence Family Development Charter School, said he supports eliminating the cap, but would settle for raising it if the state revises rules that have blocked expansion of charter schools in some urban districts under a change in 2010.\n\n\u201cIf you create an environment where everyone in public education is held accountable for the academic success of every child, it will ensure that we provide the best quality options for families and parents, particularly in urban communities,\u201d Carrero said.\n\nFramingham School Committee chairwoman Beverly Hugo strongly opposes additional charter schools. In an e-mailed comment, she said that while they offer a choice to parents, charter schools \u201cdivert important state funding from districts, operate without public oversight from the communities they serve, and fail to enroll a representative cross-section of students.\u201d\n\nState school aid is also a key concern of local officials, an issue that may be timely as the new administration wrestles with a budget deficit. Some said they hope the work of a state legislative commission reviewing potential updates to the foundation budget \u2014 the minimum spending required of school districts \u2014 will lead to more aid for districts to meet rising costs.\n\n\u201cHow realistic is the formula when we have seen so many changes with population, with increased poverty in our local communities, and a huge increase in immigrant\u2019\u2019 and English language learner populations, said Revere\u2019s school superintendent, Paul Dakin.\n\nBrockton Superintendent Kathleen Smith said the state\u2019s 1993 Education Reform Act \u201creally brought some equity for funding for urban districts.\u201d But she said in recent years, \u201cWe are getting some needier students,\u201d and state funding needs to be adjusted to meet the costs of serving them.\n\nSchool Committee member Adam Weldai of Malden said he is encouraged that Baker appears to understand \u201cthe importance of cities and towns and the idea of local aid being our lifeblood. I would really hope that he keeps to his promise to preserve and strengthen local school aid.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about state government and its obligation . . . to support education,\u201d said Holliston\u2019s superintendent, Bradford L. Jackson. \u201cI\u2019m expecting that the commission is going to find clearly that it has fallen behind, and I\u2019m hopeful the new governor will take that recommendation and follow through on it to better support the costs of educating children in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nSuperintendent Joseph F. Baeta in Norton said he would like to see an easing of the mandates the state has imposed on school districts, citing its move to \u201cCommon Core\u2019\u2019 federal standards and the potential swapping of the MCAS system for the PARCC tests.\n\n\u201cOur biggest headache has been the constant initiatives that have been added,\u201d he said. Rather than adding new mandates, \u201cWe have to look at the initiatives we have on the table and complete them,\u201d Baeta said.\n\nNeedham board chairman Greis said he would like the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to see the communities as \u201cpartners in education, not people to be regulated.\u201d\n\nBeth M. Stafford, vice president of the Whitman-Hanson Educational Association union and a Whitman Middle School teacher, said she is looking for teachers to have a voice in education discussions under the Baker administration, as they have under Governor Deval Patrick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how it should be because we are the ones teaching the children, we are the ones there every day,\u201d she said.\n\nBonnie Biocchi, president and chief executive of the MetroWest Chamber of Commerce, said that under the new governor, the state needs to continue its efforts to help students prepare for today\u2019s jobs, notably by supporting state colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cThey provide a good education and are more affordable for families,\u201d she said of the public institutions.\n\nMary Sarris, executive director of the North Shore Workforce Investment Board, highlighted the connection between quality education and employment. To prepare for jobs, she said, students through high school need a \u201cwell-rounded and intensive education,\u201d and the state needs to support \u201cvigorous education and training\u201d at the postsecondary level.\n\n\u201cOur populace has to be continually learning and continually improving their skills,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.1062946242", "eomportal-id": 105054, "description": "When Governor-elect Charlie Baker charts his agenda for bolstering the state\u2019s education system, school leaders and advocates from the Boston suburbs are hoping charter schools, state mandates, and funding issues are all high on his list of topics.
