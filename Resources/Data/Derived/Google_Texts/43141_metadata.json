Singapore\u2019s prime minister for more than three decades until 1990, Lee died last Monday at age 91. His cortege took a 15-kilometer (9-mile) route through the city-state before a three-hour state funeral. Singaporeans credit Lee\u2019s leadership with laying the foundation of the Southeast Asian country\u2019s current prosperity, and his death triggered a wave of emotion rarely seen in Singapore.\n\nSome scenes from Sunday:\n\n___\n\nAs the funeral cortege left Parliament, where Lee lay in state for four days, heavy rain poured down on onlookers, some of whom had waited for hours for a glimpse of the procession. Huddled beneath a canopy of umbrellas, the crowds sang patriotic songs, waved Singapore flags and chanted \u201cLee Kuan Yew.\u201d On a nearby open field known as the Padang, Howitzer cannons were fired, creating a haze of smoke, and four air force fighter jets streaked across the island, one peeling off in a \u201cmissing man\u201d formation. Navy patrol ships made an \u201cLKY\u201d signal with their flags and sounded horns.\n\n___\n\nSeeing the coffin draped in Singapore\u2019s red and white flag and protected by a glass casing as it sat atop a ceremonial gun carriage, an elderly Chinese man at the Padang shouted \u201cThank you, Lee Kuan Yew\u201d as tears streamed down his face. A couple dressed in black wrapped arms around each other\u2019s waist as the teary woman rested her head on her male partner\u2019s shoulder.\n\nReflecting on his own life, port systems planner Teo Chai Beng, 59, said, \u201cI was a foster child, I was mistreated, I worried about where my next meal would come from. I had nothing but P6 (Primary 6) education.\u201d Then he added, \u201cThanks to him, I am a supervisor now, and myself and my two sons all have houses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scenes of emotion as Singapore mourns Lee Kuan Yew", "author": "Jeanette Tan", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scenes of emotion as Singapore mourns Lee Kuan Yew", "title": "Scenes of emotion as Singapore mourns Lee Kuan Yew", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/29/scenes_of_emotion_as_singapore_mourns_lee_kuan_yew/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/singapore-lee-kuan-yew.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scenes of emotion as Singapore mourns Lee Kuan Yew", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/singapore-lee-kuan-yew.jpeg20-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Scenes of emotion as Singapore mourns Lee Kuan Yew", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Scenes of emotion as Singapore mourns Lee Kuan Yew", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb30\"", "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsSINGAPORE (AP) \u2014 Singaporeans turned out in the tens of thousands Sunday to pay final respects to longtime leader Lee Kuan Yew.\nHis cortege took a 15-kilometer (9-mile) route through the city-state before a three-hour state funeral.\nSingapore\u2019s prime minister for more than three decades until 1990, Lee died last Monday at age 91.\nSingaporeans credit Lee\u2019s leadership with laying the foundation of the Southeast Asian country\u2019s current prosperity, and his death triggered a wave of emotion rarely seen in Singapore.\n___Seeing the coffin draped in Singapore\u2019s red and white flag and protected by a glass casing as it sat atop a ceremonial gun carriage, an elderly Chinese man at the Padang shouted \u201cThank you, Lee Kuan Yew\u201d as tears streamed down his face."}
