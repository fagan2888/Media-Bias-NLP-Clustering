In our year-end poll, readers chose as the most underreported story of 2013 the lawlessness of the Obama administration in its handling of ObamaCare. Eleven state Attorneys General share that opinion \u2014 and started off the year attempting to correct it. Led by Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia (no relation), the consortium of AGs protested the changes in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius (via Instapundit):\n\nThe attorneys general specifically criticize President Obama\u2019s executive action that allowed insurance companies to keep offering health plans that had been canceled for not meeting ObamaCare\u2019s more rigorous standards. We support allowing citizens to keep their health insurance coverage, but the only way to fix this problem-ridden law is to enact changes lawfully: through Congressional action,\u201d the attorneys general wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. \u201cThe illegal actions by this administration must stop.\u201d They say the healthcare fix was \u201cflatly illegal under federal constitutional and statutory law.\u201d\n\nCongress wrote the law in a manner that transfers much of its authority to HHS. The bill is chock-full of the phrase, \u201cThe Secretary shall determine \u2026\u201d in areas where Congress should have provided much more specific direction, which allows the executive branch wide latitude in a number of areas. However, the bill does have some specificity, especially on deadline dates for enforcement. HHS does not have the statutory flexibility that it has arrogated to itself for these \u201cfixes,\u201d nor does it have the constitutional power to change statute.\n\nMorrisey and his colleagues are correct in their accusations. The question will be whether any of them will challenge those decisions in court. One would have to think they have standing to do so, especially as it relates to the impact on insurers in their states. Congress also would have standing to bring a complaint to the federal court, and one has to wonder whether John Boehner and the House is considering such an action. If \u201cthe illegal actions by this administration must stop,\u201d they have to know that a letter to Sebelius isn\u2019t going to be the fulcrum of that change.\n\nIn other ObamaCare news, the confusion over sign-ups versus actual enrollments is keeping people from getting care:\n\nHospital staff in Northern Virginia are turning away sick people on a frigid Thursday morning because they can\u2019t determine whether their Obamacare insurance plans are in effect. Patients in a close-in DC suburb who think they\u2019ve signed up for new insurance plans are struggling to show their December enrollments are in force, and health care administrators aren\u2019t taking their word for it. In place of quick service and painless billing, these Virginians are now facing the threat of sticker-shock that comes with bills they can\u2019t afford.\n\n\u2018They had no idea if my insurance was active or not!\u2019 a coughing Maria Galvez told MailOnline outside the Inova Healthplex facility in the town of Springfield. She was leaving the building without getting a needed chest x-ray.\n\n\u2018The people in there told me that since I didn\u2019t have an insurance card, I would be billed for the whole cost of the x-ray,\u2019 Galvez said, her young daughter in tow. \u2018It\u2019s not fair \u2013 you know, I signed up last week like I was supposed to.\u2019\n\nThe x-ray\u2019s cost, she was told, would likely be more than $500.\n\nShe chose a plan that cost $450 a month but hasn\u2019t received a bill yet, the Daily Mail reports, but she also has a $5500 deductible \u2014 which means she\u2019d be paying for that chest X-ray anyway. There are plenty of more anecdotes from the front lines of the ObamaCare rollout in the article, so be sure to read it all.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThe only way to fix this problem-ridden law is to enact changes lawfully: through Congressional action.\u201d", "title": "Eleven state AGs protest ObamaCare \u201cfixes\u201d as \u201cflatly illegal\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/03/eleven-state-ags-protest-obamacare-fixes-as-flatly-illegal/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "attorney general, fix, illegal, Kathleen Sebelius, ObamaCare, Patrick Morrisey,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-03T13:31:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-03T13:25:43+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09ab\"", "article_summary": "Eleven state AGs protest ObamaCare \u201cfixes\u201d as \u201cflatly illegal\u201dposted at 8:31 am on January 3, 2014 by Ed MorrisseyAlternate headline: Hot Air readers get results!\nIn other ObamaCare news, the confusion over sign-ups versus actual enrollments is keeping people from getting care:Hospital staff in Northern Virginia are turning away sick people on a frigid Thursday morning because they can\u2019t determine whether their Obamacare insurance plans are in effect.\nEleven state Attorneys General share that opinion \u2014 and started off the year attempting to correct it.\nIn our year-end poll, readers chose as the most underreported story of 2013 the lawlessness of the Obama administration in its handling of ObamaCare.\nThere are plenty of more anecdotes from the front lines of the ObamaCare rollout in the article, so be sure to read it all."}
