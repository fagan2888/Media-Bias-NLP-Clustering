A series of young comedians are doing their 10-minute bits before an audience of about two dozen millennials. The topics are edgy and funny: race, sex, gluten, kale.\n\nNext up is Caitlin Brodnick, a fresh-faced blonde in heels and a bright red dress. She announces that she\u2019s wearing Spanx. The crowd chuckles. Then she launches into her real topic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited today, guys,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t know if anybody else out there is afraid of dying of cancer.\u201d\n\nYes, she\u2019s going there.\n\nHave you heard the joke about cutting off your boobs to prevent breast cancer? The room is not warming to her shtick. She continues: \u201cI had the Angelina Jolie surgery, you guys, where they removed my breasts because I\u2019m BRCA-positive, so I have a huge chance of getting breast cancer.\u201d\n\nDead silence.\n\n\u201cI know \u2014 it\u2019s so intense,\u201d she says. She soldiers on: \u201cI\u2019m just like Angelina Jolie\u2014 we\u2019re like twins. I love her. Except she has Brad Pitt, and I have credit card debt.\u201d\n\nAt that, the audience erupts in laughter, and she has the crowd back.\n\nBrodnick can do that. The 30-year-old native of Kensington, Maryland, has made a name for herself in the past couple of years with her very public, poignant and funny openness about finding out that she is BRCA1-positive and then taking the radical step of undergoing a preventive double mastectomy.\n\nAt first glance, not so funny, right?\n\nIncreasingly, women who learn that they have the BRCA1 and 2 genetic mutations that exponentially increase their risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer have been having preventive mastectomies to lessen their chances of getting the disease. They call themselves \u201cprevivors.\u201d\n\nBut joking about it?\n\nWhen Brodnick found out, at 26, that she has the gene and started doing research, she mainly found fear and sadness.\n\n\u201cI looked at YouTube, and all the women had had breast cancer or terrible experiences,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody was casually talking about it in a hopeful, positive way.\u201d\n\nAnd nobody was seeing the subject matter as comic fodder. That\u2019s where she comes in.\n\n\u201cI have these amazing fake\u201d breasts, she tells the audience. \u201cThey are high \u2014 and they just won\u2019t quit!\u201d When she\u2019s old, she\u2019s going to walk around topless in the nursing home, she says.\n\nBrodnick is not the only comic who has tapped into the mastectomy humor vein. Tig Notaro, the subject of HBO\u2019s \u201cBoyish Girl Interrupted,\u201d developed breast cancer before she decided to have her breasts removed. Also, before her surgery, Notaro\u2019s chest was so flat that she joked about it to the extent that, as she recounts in her stand-up routine, her breasts said, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019re sick of this. Let\u2019s kill her.\u201d\n\nNotaro is now completely flat-chested and nipple-free, which she reveals when she removes her shirt for the last 20 minutes of her HBO special. She makes no further reference to breasts or cancer, though.\n\nBrodnick, on the other hand, has never had cancer. And she delights in her new size 34C breasts. She says the former ones were too large \u2014 32G on a 5-foot-1 frame \u2014 and she can\u2019t seem to stop talking about her freedom to downsize and create what she calls \u201cDIY boobs.\u201d\n\nShe also decided that the best way to go through the experience was to document it, which led to a groundbreaking video series posted on the Glamour magazine website. As a habitual over-sharer, she knew that \u201cI\u2019m probably going to talk about it anyway.\u201d So why not be that open book?\n\nBrodnick has spent her life in the shadow of cancer. Her father\u2019s sister died of breast cancer at 32.\n\n\u201cIt really rocked everyone to their core,\u201d she says.\n\nBorn nine months later, Caitlin was the \u201cmiracle child\u201d who gave her grandmother a reason to live. Then other family members started dying: her grandmother, another aunt.\n\n\u201cI just remember being -- it\u2019s always about the cancer,\u201d Brodnick says. When her test proved positive, \u201cit felt like I had cancer. It felt like my family\u2019s fears were coming true, that I was going to be the next one.\u201d\n\nFor three years, her reaction was depression and not taking care of herself. Then Jolie announced her decision to undergo a preventive mastectomy. For Brodnick, it was a major tipping point.\n\nSandy Cohen, coordinator of volunteers for Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered, a national nonprofit organization that supports and advocates on behalf of those with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, heard about the Glamour series and invited Brodnick to speak at this year\u2019s annual conference, held in Philadelphia in June.\n\nBrodnick did about 20 minutes of her comedy routine for about 80 attendees.\n\n\u201cShe was very frank,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cIt was like a breath of fresh air that they needed\u201d after talking about cancer and prevention all day.\n\nToday, Brodnick is part advocate, part comedian and part the girl you want to sit next to on the airplane. She performs a regular gig at New York\u2019s Upright Citizens Brigade comedy shows as well as at other venues, and is launching a new tour called BRCA Power Prevention International to connect with other BRCA-positive women.\n\nThanks to her comedy and her video series, she says, she is starting to be recognized. People will ask her, \u201cAre you the one who went under the knife and then showed everyone your breasts?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeees!\u201d she says. \u201cI aaaaam! This is all I have to offer! I\u2019m a feminist, but this is all I have to offer!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6dd4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey are high \u2014 and they just won\u2019t quit!\u201d When she\u2019s old, she\u2019s going to walk around topless in the nursing home, she says.\nHave you heard the joke about cutting off your boobs to prevent breast cancer?\n\u201cI looked at YouTube, and all the women had had breast cancer or terrible experiences,\u201d she says.\nTig Notaro, the subject of HBO\u2019s \u201cBoyish Girl Interrupted,\u201d developed breast cancer before she decided to have her breasts removed.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited today, guys,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t know if anybody else out there is afraid of dying of cancer.\u201dYes, she\u2019s going there."}
