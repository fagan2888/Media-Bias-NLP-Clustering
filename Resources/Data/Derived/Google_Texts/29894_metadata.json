The smart thing to do would be to quietly gut Obamacare, enacting something like Avik Roy\u2019s health-care plan under the guise of fine-tuning the ACA.

Barack Obama was willing to risk having the health-care law be his last significant domestic-policy project as president.

Federal crimes and misdemeanors ranging from the IRS scandal to the fumbling response to Ebola suggest very strongly that we have management and oversight problems as well as ideological ones, but holding oversight hearings long after (one hopes) Ebola is out of domestic headlines provides very little juice for a presidential candidate facing a restive base all hopped up on Hannity. Being the guy who gets up and demands the repeal of Obamacare might get you elected president; being the guy who fixes the damned thing simply makes you a target for talk-radio guys who have never run for nor held an elected office but who will nonetheless micturate upon your efforts from a great height.\n\nEverybody wants to run for president.
