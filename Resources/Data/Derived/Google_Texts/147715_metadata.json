The New York Times\u2019 Steve Eder uncovers testimony from the brother of Hillary Clinton in a lawsuit, in which Rodham describes his business plan in Haiti, where he ended up on the board of a company that somehow got a license to mine gold in the impoverished nation. His Haitian dealings came directly through the Clinton Foundation, Rodham testified:\n\nWhen Mr. Clinton worked as a co-chairman of Haiti\u2019s earthquake recovery commission, Mr. Rodham and his partners sought a $22 million deal to rebuild homes in the country. In court proceedings three years ago in an unrelated lawsuit, Mr. Rodham explained how \u201ca guy in Haiti\u201d had \u201cdonated\u201d 10,000 acres of land to him and described how he had leaned on Mr. Clinton to get the rebuilding project funded amid bureaucratic delays. \u201cI deal through the Clinton Foundation. That gets me in touch with the Haitian officials,\u201d Mr. Rodham said, according to a transcript of his testimony. \u201cI hound my brother-in-law, because it\u2019s his fund that we\u2019re going to get our money from. And he can\u2019t do it until the Haitian government does it. \u201cAnd he keeps telling me, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.\u2019 Well, tomorrow hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201d\n\nThat deal didn\u2019t pan out, but not for lack of trying. The Haitian government put the kibosh on this project, as it did the gold mining license, angry at exploitation disguised as relief. Eder\u2019s report doesn\u2019t reveal what happened to the \u201cdonated\u201d land Rodham received, but the multimillion-dollar housing project linked to it never materialized. Rodham had to explain this in the context of legal fees he owed his attorney, the reason for the lawsuit.\n\nEder\u2019s report reveals Rodham to be a ne\u2019er-do-well relative who hoped to make a big score through his family. That didn\u2019t exactly pan out either, but the Clintons took care of him in other ways:\n\nWhen Mr. Rodham was short on cash in 2010, Mr. Clinton helped get him a job for $72,000 a year raising investments in GreenTech Automotive, an electric car company then owned by Terry McAuliffe, an old friend of Mr. Clinton\u2019s and now the governor of Virginia. \u201cI was complaining to my brother-in-law I didn\u2019t have any money. And he asked McAuliffe to give me a job,\u201d Mr. Rodham said during the court proceedings, which were the result of a lawsuit over unpaid legal bills filed by his lawyer in a child support case.\n\nGreenTech turned into another sleazy deal, but it didn\u2019t stop McAuliffe from winning the gubernatorial race in Virginia. NY Mag\u2019s Margaret Hartmann thinks the NYT\u2019s story is a nothingburger, too:\n\nThe former president and his foundation both say they had no involvement in Rodham\u2019s Haiti deal. If Rodham had his way, he might be featured prominently in the many reports on the Clinton Foundation\u2019s questionable practices, but it sounds like Clinton intended to get around to financing the project right after he came over to help his brother-in-law move all those heavy boxes out of his basement.\n\nShe\u2019s probably right. The business dealings of siblings don\u2019t usually have much impact on the candidates themselves. However, rarely has a sibling been so tied to the business operations of the candidate, too.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Sibling revelry.", "title": "Tony Rodham testimony: \u201cI deal through the Clinton Foundation\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/11/tony-rodham-testimony-i-deal-through-the-clinton-foundation/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-12T00:41:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-11T21:40:26+00:00"}, "keywords": "Bill Clinton, Clinton Foundation, corruption, GreenTech, Hillary Clinton, Tony Rodham,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "\u201cAnd he keeps telling me, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s going to happen tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.\u2019 Well, tomorrow hasn\u2019t come yet.\u201dThat deal didn\u2019t pan out, but not for lack of trying.\nHis Haitian dealings came directly through the Clinton Foundation, Rodham testified:When Mr. Clinton worked as a co-chairman of Haiti\u2019s earthquake recovery commission, Mr. Rodham and his partners sought a $22 million deal to rebuild homes in the country.\nTony Rodham testimony: \u201cI deal through the Clinton Foundation\u201dposted at 8:41 pm on May 11, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyWell, not much profit in this case, but it\u2019s not to say that Tony Rodham didn\u2019t try.\n\u201cI deal through the Clinton Foundation.\nThat gets me in touch with the Haitian officials,\u201d Mr. Rodham said, according to a transcript of his testimony."}
