However, there\u2019s a little more pep in our cheer for the Denver Broncos because, when they win, complete specific plays, or just show up, fans score some great food and drink deals. Promos are valid for all games during the regular season at participating locations. There are several offers to tackle, so get your game plan ready.\n\nOn game day\n\nPapa Murphy\u2019s serves up a game day feast with an oven-ready large pizza (up to five toppings) or signature pizza for $10, no strings attached.\n\nAfter a win\n\nThe day after a win, save 50 percent on a Papa John\u2019s online order of regular-price menu items. Use the promo code BRONCOS. To celebrate a sweet victory, King Soopers gives customers a free raised or cake donut the following day (you need a loyalty card). If you\u2019re not still buzzing from a big win, you can sip on a free small coffee at participating Suncor Energy/Shell gas stations from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n\nGet your kicks\n\nWhen the Broncos kick a field goal of 35 yards or more, get up to six single tacos for 35 cents each at Jack in the Box from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. the following day. If you kick it with the maximum, that\u2019s only $2.10, plus tax.\n\nTouchdown treats\n\nThirsty fans can get quenched with a touchdown freebie from King Soopers. When Eric Decker scores a touchdown, get a free 2-liter bottle of Orange Crush. If Demaryius Thomas makes a TD, get a free 2-liter Pepsi. If both players score, choose between Pepsi or Orange Crush. The offer is good the next day and requires your store loyalty card.\n\nSack dance\n\nWhen the Broncos get two or more sacks, buy two beverages and a burger, entr\u00e9e or entr\u00e9e salad and get a free Red\u2019s Tavern Double Burger the Tuesday after game day. This freebie comes with bottomless steak fries.\n\nBig score\n\nShould the Broncos score 28 or more points, one dozen Original Glazed Krispy Kreme doughnuts are yours for $2.80 the Tuesday after game day.
