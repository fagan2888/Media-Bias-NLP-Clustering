One thousand and six hundred winning tickets \u2014 each worth a little over $400,000 \u2014 were all sold in the same town, MSN is reporting.\n\nEach year, Spain holds its annual Christmas Lottery, officially Sorteo Extraordinario de Navidad and unofficially \u201cEl Gordo,\u201d apart from its regular national lottery. And it got the nickname \u201cEl Gordo\u201d (\u201cThe Fat One\u201d) for a reason: it\u2019s worth billions. According to CNBC, this year\u2019s El Gordo paid out $2.4 billion.\n\nPeople are going crazy over the $2 billion jackpot for Spain\u2019s \u201cEl Gordo\u201d lottery https://t.co/KkgBhrRpgk pic.twitter.com/ZpsKJXbr6w \u2014 CNNMoney (@CNNMoney) December 22, 2015\n\nEl Gordo creates something of a frenzy each year in Spain, with long lines, sometimes hundreds of people deep, forming around ticket retailers weeks before the draw. Because the price of a single ticket (\u20ac200, or about $219) is so expensive, Spaniards pool their money to buy tickets \u2014 and share the wealth, should their number come up. Families, friends, co-workers all contribute to buy tickets, and sometimes favorite bars will even smaller fractional shares of tickets.\n\nBy some estimates, up to 75 percent of the population of Spain participates in El Gordo in one way or another.\n\nOn draw day, December 22, millions of Spaniards tune in to their TV\u2019s to watch the \u201chours-long\u201d presentation, as a choir of schoolchildren from Madrid\u2019s Saint Ildefonso School sings out the winning numbers.\n\nNo one winner gets all $2.4 billion from El Gordo \u2014 the top prize is actually \u20ac4,0o0,000 (4,000,000 Euros, or about $4,386,000), awarded 160 times, according to the Telegraph. There are also second prizes, third prizes, fourth prizes, and so on, worth anywhere from hundreds of thousands of Euros on down to \u20ac200 (the price of a single ticket). One such consolation prize in this year\u2019s El Gordo is worth \u20ac400,000 (about $439,000), and 1,600 tickets worth that prize were all sold in one town: Roquetas de Mar.\n\nAUD 960M go to this beautiful town on the Coast of #Almer\u00eda, Andaluc\u00eda, @spain\u2013 #RoquetasdeMar #ElGordo Congrats! pic.twitter.com/0l9mGPpMRU \u2014 ConsuladoEspa\u00f1aMelb (@ConsuladoEspMel) December 22, 2015\n\nTimes have been hard in Roquetas de Mar of late. Times have been hard in all of Spain recently, but they\u2019ve been especially hard in Roquetas de Mar, a beach town of about 85,000 people, some 358 miles south of Madrid, on the Mediterranean Sea. The town has an unemployment rate of 31 percent \u2014 compared to 21 percent for Spain as a whole.\n\nMayor Gabriel Amat told a local newspaper that he\u2019s thrilled about the impact the massive lottery win will have on his town.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really happy and I congratulate all the winners. It\u2019s very important for the town, especially in the difficult times we\u2019ve been facing.\u201d\n\nOne retailer sold all such winning tickets; Spanish lottery officials say that\u2019s possible because buyers don\u2019t pick their numbers \u2014 they\u2019re generated randomly.\n\nThe Spanish Christmas lottery is the largest lottery in the world. While other national lotteries (and, in the U.S., state and multi-state lotteries, such as Powerball and Mega Millions) offer bigger top prizes, El Gordo has the most money poured into it, and the most money poured back out, after the Spanish government\u2019s 30 percent take off the top. It also offers several hundred ways to win, giving ticket buyers that much more to hang on to when they dream of winning to fat, top prize.\n\nIt is also one of the oldest lotteries in the world: the Spanish Christmas lottery began in 1812 and was held for charity.\n\nBy the way, if you get an email telling you how to claim your winnings from El Gordo, and you don\u2019t remember buying a ticket, it\u2019s a scam.\n\n[Image via Shutterstock/Makaule]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Spain's yearly Christmas lottery, affectionately called \"El Gordo,\" is showering riches on a beach town that has fallen on hard times.
