Southwest Airlines unveiled a new color scheme for its airplanes on Monday, previewing an appearance change for only the third time in its history.



Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the new design, which the airline has labeled "Heart," reflects its strength as its nears conclusion of a merger with AirTran Airways that has been in the works since 2010.



“Our collective heartbeat is stronger and healthier than ever, and that’s because of the warmth, the compassion, and the smiles of our People,” Kelly said in a statement. “The Heart emblazoned on our aircraft, and within our new look, symbolizes our commitment that we’ll remain true to our core values as we set our sights on the future.”



Southwest has said that it will complete its merger with AirTran Airways in December. The airline last changed the appearance of its planes in 2001



Kelly said Monday the completion of AirTran's integration into the new company was a fitting occasion for a redesign.



“With all these exciting changes happening, we thought it was time for a new visual expression of our brand—one that marries our past to our present and sets the course for where we’re headed in the future,” he said.
