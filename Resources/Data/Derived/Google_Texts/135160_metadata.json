Clinton said people shouldn\u2019t be afraid to attend class or see a movie.\n\n\u201cI am going to fight for new, effective gun control measures,\u201d she said\n\nThe pledge drew the biggest response from the crowd. Clinton said that changing gun laws is a \u201cpolitical mountain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with us,\u201d Clinton asked, \u201cthat we can\u2019t stand up to the NRA [National Rifle Association] and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent?\u201d\n\nClinton also used the setting of the speech to say that a college education should be less expensive and that students should get some relief from student loans.\n\nShe said students should be able to seek a better deal on their loans.\n\n\u201cIf you can refinance your mortgage or your car payment, why can\u2019t you refinance your student debt?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe the federal government should be making a profit off of lending you money to pursue your education.\u201d\n\nFederal student loans are different than other types of debt. They stay with you through bankruptcy and the government sets interest rates.\n\nClinton said she supports an idea proposed by President Barack Obama: two free years of community college. That would reduce the need for loans.\n\nThe visit was intended to fire up Clinton\u2019s Florida supporters.\n\nBoca Raton resident Harriet Molk was one of those supporters. She was introduced to Clinton through some of the candidate\u2019s Yale classmates.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s the only one who can really be president in this current world, economic and political situation,\u201d Molk said.\n\nBut Molk said she\u2019s concerned about how Clinton \u2013 and Democrats more broadly \u2013 are campaigning. She thinks the party needs to be more aggressive talking about successes, like the Affordable Care Act national health insurance law.\n\n\u201cHillary has to lighten up in her press conferences. She has to be more Bill,\u201d Molk said, referring to the former president and Clinton\u2019s husband.\n\nOnce the presumptive Democratic nominee, Clinton is now in a race with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nClinton still leads in most national polls, but Sanders has moved ahead in early-voting states like New Hampshire.\n\nFriday\u2019s speech was on friendly ground. Broward County is the heart of the state\u2019s Democratic Party and a \u201cfree speech zone\u201d was free of protesters before Clinton spoke.\n\nBut the Broward College gym was hot, and Clinton took the stage 66 minutes after the announced starting time. By then, some people had left. Others left before Clinton completed her 28-minute speech.\n\nMolk, a donor to the campaign, was unhappy event staff weren\u2019t attentive enough.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re being treated like cattle,\u201d she said, as she spoke to staff member about finding her seats. \u201cI really resent it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "One day after a shooter killed nine people and himself at an Oregon community college, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she\u2019ll seek", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wlrn.org/post/hillary-clinton-wants-tougher-gun-laws-after-oregon-shooting", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wlrn/files/styles/medium/public/201510/10-2_clintonrally.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One day after a shooter killed nine people and himself at an Oregon community college, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she\u2019ll seek", "title": "Hillary Clinton Wants Tougher Gun Laws After Oregon Shooting"}, "story_id": 445396544, "twitter": {"site": "@WLRN", "card": "summary", "creator": "@johnroconnor"}, "author": "John O'Connor", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Hillary Clinton Wants Tougher Gun Laws After Oregon Shooting"}, "nid": 57312, "datePublished": "2015-10-02", "keywords": "Hillary Clinton, 2016 Presidential Race, college, guns, debt, news", "wordCount": 554, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "One day after a shooter killed nine people and himself at an Oregon community college, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she\u2019ll seek tougher gun laws if she\u2019s elected.\nBroward County is the heart of the state\u2019s Democratic Party and a \u201cfree speech zone\u201d was free of protesters before Clinton spoke.\n\u201cI am going to fight for new, effective gun control measures,\u201d she saidThe pledge drew the biggest response from the crowd.\nClinton said she supports an idea proposed by President Barack Obama: two free years of community college.\nBut the Broward College gym was hot, and Clinton took the stage 66 minutes after the announced starting time."}
