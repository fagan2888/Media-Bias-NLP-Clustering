In Obama\u2019s position, a Republican president would have appointed an unabashed conservative because that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. All the discussion about Obama \u201cplaying chess\u201d and \u201cbeing reasonable\u201d is beside the point.\n\nThis choice, among other decisions by Obama during his presidency, is exactly what created the entire Bernie Sanders, Liz Warren movement. Democrats want their presidents to act like unapologetic Democrats, just like Republicans act like unapologetic Republicans 100 percent of the time.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the time for compromise. With Trump and Cruz fighting for the nomination, Democrats and Obama should drive the ball hard up the middle and quit trying to be cute and clever.\n\n\u2014 Principia in St. Louis, reacting to President Obama\u2019s selection of Merrick Garland as a nominee for the Supreme Court.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n2. Obama could appoint a bald eagle pointing an assault rifle at refugees to the Supreme Court and the G.O.P. would still find reasons to be upset.\n\n\u2014 Amer Aldi on The Times\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n(After The Times highlighted this comment, a Twitter user named @OhNoSheTwitnt claimed credit for first writing it.)\n\nPhoto\n\n3. Just a reminder that Mr. Obama was one of two dozen Senators including Hillary Clinton who voted to filibuster the nomination of Samuel Alito in 2006. Perhaps Mr. Obama feels he is better qualified to make a Supreme Court nomination than George Bush and that the current members of the Senate have different constitutional rights than the rights of Senators in 2006.\n\n\u2014 Fifty Shades of Red in Santa Fe, N.M.\n\n4. I wish the Pres would use this nomination for someone left of center, but you gotta hand it to him \u2014 he\u2019s doing what won\u2019t create more division, and in doing so respects the entire electorate. President Obama always demonstrates a great deal of class, and respect for the responsibility he\u2019s been given. We can only hope we ever have as great a president again.\n\n\u2014 Barbara in Washington, D.C.\n\nHer comment received more than 2,440 reader recommendations and was the most-recommended comment of the week.\n\n5. Liberals are disappointed in the selection, but you have to look at the big picture. This is basically just bait. Obama wins either way.\n\nEither the G.O.P. refuses to consider the most reasonable option possible, and looks foolish, or Obama gets his nominee and can be respected for making a selection that was actually electable and will make a difference. People hoping for a hard-left candidate aren\u2019t able to see the forest through the trees.\n\n\u2014 T in New York. His comment received 391 reader recommendations.\n\nThe Republican Party\n\nPhoto\n\n6. I understand the appeal of Trump. I wish I didn\u2019t, but I do. Family members who support him are good people who have watched the cost of living rise while their wages for service and industry jobs have not.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThey seem to watch a lot of TV (CNN, Fox) and fear that if immigrants don\u2019t take their jobs, terrorists will get to them first. They have American-made cars, flat screen TVs, and fenced-in yards for dogs that are there to protect private property. Their children are christened and they go to mass on holidays.\n\nDonald Trump is a kind of political Dr. Phil. He gives them the opportunity to vent deep disappointment, frustration and resentment.\n\nHis candidacy is a collective catharsis. His rallies are not about policy; they\u2019re about being heard: The supporters I know simply don\u2019t feel heard, not by me, not by our leaders. And unfortunately they don\u2019t engage in civil discourse or civic life because the work of life \u2014 houses, jobs, kids, health \u2014 is enormously weighty.\n\nI loathe Mr. Trump and I am terrified of his candidacy. But he has helped me to see that a \u201csilent\u201d if not \u201cmajority\u201d at least portion of his supporters are ordinary working people who feel left behind.\n\n\u2014 MS in Boston, in response to an editorial contending that Donald J. Trump incites violence at his rallies. This comment received 43 reader recommendations.\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Really sad to see a young guy like Rubio who appealed to a lot of young voters like myself drop out. I never agreed with his social stance nor how much he would allow religion to affect his decisions, but I liked his optimism and his hope for young men like myself.\n\nHe was moderate, had strong economic views, great foreign policy, but sadly people did not recognize this or just could not trust him. Hopefully as he matures and gets more involved with the Senate he can grow onto people, Democratic and Republican alike.\n\n\u2014 BG in Radford, Va., in response to Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s exit from the Republican presidential race. His comment attracted 26 reader responses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n8. He\u2019s a smart, honest, experienced and decent man. He does adhere to some of the Republican platform \u2014 as he would have to in order to avoid to total excommunication. But give him credit for embracing Obamacare for the sake of the children in his state.\n\n\u2014 Robert Selsor on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, reacting to a Gail Collins column about Gov. John Kasich\u2019s primary victory in his home state of Ohio.\n\nThe Democratic Party\n\nPhoto\n\n9. Trump vs. Clinton. So I guess I\u2019ll vote for Hillary. Kind of like wanting a Coca-Cola, but you drink the Pepsi because you really don\u2019t want the Faygo.\n\n\u2014 Chad Vaughn, on The Times\u2019s Facebook page, in response to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s win in the Ohio primary. (Faygo is a soda popular in the Midwest.)\n\n10. I can hear Bernie\u2019s army firing away from their keyboards in response to the revelations in this article.\n\nIn 2008, Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy was in the same slow-arcing death spiral that Sanders\u2019s is in now \u2014 so President Obama can empathize with what Clinton is facing.\n\nHowever, Sanders has every right to stay in the race through June, as did Ms. Clinton eight years ago. His candidacy has vociferous and progressive support, though outnumbered in the electoral system we have in place.\n\nEven if Sanders doesn\u2019t win, Democrats and the nation both win as Sanders\u2019s message continues to nourish the political soil for future progressive change to take root.\n\n\u2014 Ed Sugden in El Segundo, Calif., in response to President Obama asking Democratic donors to unite behind Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy.
