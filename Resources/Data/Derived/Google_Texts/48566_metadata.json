He needed less than three quarters to surpass his season best of 26 earlier this month against Milwaukee.\n\nWhen his final 3-pointer swished through with 8:53 left in the fourth, he surpassed his previous career high of 39 points set at Dallas in December 2012.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest thing for me tonight,\u201d said Jameer Nelson, the longtime Magic standout back in his old haunts. \u201cNot too many guys can give you 40 points in an NBA game. He\u2019s been hot; he\u2019s been shooting the heck out of the ball.\u201d\n\nNelson also tormented his former team with 15 points and five assists. Jusuf Nurkic, a late addition to the starting lineup with Randy Foye\u2019s illness, added 11 points along with Kenneth Faried, J.J. Hickson and Will Barton.\n\nThe Nuggets hit 12 of 28 attempts from 3-point range on the night, one shy of their season best.\n\nVictor Oladipo led the Magic with 21 points, while Nik Vucevic added 20 points and eight rebounds. Rookie Elfrid Payton, who earlier in the week became the first Orlando player ever to record back-to-back triple-doubles, was held to just six points.\n\n\u201cThey were really motivated,\u201d Nuggets interim coach Melvin Hunt said. \u201cWe wanted to sweep the state of Florida, and we dropped that one to Miami. The guys really wanted to make up for it and, boy, did they make up for it.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets led just 28-25 after the first quarter and 40-33 early in the second before Gallinari and Nelson helped break things open with a 20-2 outburst.\n\nNelson\u2019s 3-pointer pushed Denver to a 10-point advantage and Hickson followed with a dunk as the Nuggets held Orlando scoreless on 10 of their next 11 trips down the floor, interrupted only by an inside bucket from Vucevic.\n\n\u201cI almost forgot about the offense,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI\u2019ve got all these pretty plays in my pocket and I didn\u2019t have to pull any of them out. The defense was so on point; the guys were so in tune with each other. They made it easy.\u201d\n\nBy the time Nelson drove the lane with four minutes left before halftime, the Nuggets led 60-35 and it was just a matter of keeping any Magic comeback hopes in check.\n\n\u201cWe had a group out there that wasn\u2019t focused, lacked the urgency,\u201d Magic interim coach James Borrego said. \u201cGive Denver credit \u2013 they played well \u2013 but I didn\u2019t think we respected that group enough.\u201d\n\nDenver led 69-51 at halftime and pushed the edge to 27 points in the third, when Nurkic\u2019s jam capped an 11-2 run midway through the quarter to make the score 88-61. The Nuggets led by as many as 33 in the final period.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Danilo Gallinari scores 40 to lead Nuggets past Magic", "title": "Danilo Gallinari scores 40 to lead Nuggets past Magic", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/22/danilo-gallinari-scores-40-to-lead-nuggets-past-magic/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__bkn-danilop1.jpg", "height": 540}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150322__bkn-danilop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-22T18:46:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T14:47:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Nuggets led by as many as 33 in the final period.\nVictor Oladipo led the Magic with 21 points, while Nik Vucevic added 20 points and eight rebounds.\nThe big Italian rained down a half-dozen 3-pointers on the way to a career-high 40 points, helping the Nuggets snap their three-game losing streak in impressive fashion with a 119-100 romp over the Orlando Magic.\n\u201cThat was the biggest thing for me tonight,\u201d said Jameer Nelson, the longtime Magic standout back in his old haunts.\n\u201cIt was one of those nights where the basket looks like a swimming pool,\u201d said Gallinari, who sat out the Nuggets\u2019 loss Friday in Miami."}
