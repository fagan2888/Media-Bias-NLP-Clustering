TransUnion, one of the three major credit bureaus, filed for an initial public offering March 31, with Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Securities, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Pierce, Fenner & Smith and Merrill Lynch among its underwriters, according to Reuters.

This is TransUnion’s second attempt to go public. It withdrew a bid in 2011 after being acquired by Advent International and Goldman Sachs.

With an initial fundraising target of $100 million, and previous reports that TransUnion intends to raise $800 million this year through its IPO, this move makes the agency the last of the big three to go public. Equifax joined the New York Stock Exchange in 1971, and Experian joined the London Stock Exchange in 2006.

Going public means a company gives up a certain amount of freedom; while its valuation and investment can shoot up, so can the pressure investors can place on the company’s operations and processes. Trans-Union reported a revenue net loss of 10 percent, or $12.5 million, last year, down from $35.1 million the year before, per Reuters.

With the IPO filed with U.S. regulators, speculation has begun about ways the company’s focus will shift in coming years. For example, the research firm IDC expects TransUnion’s investment in big data to increase 15 percent by 2018.

TransUnion has been in the news recently for a number of consumer-based milestones. First, the bureau announced that CreditVision, its 18-month-old creditworthiness predictor, helped score 26.5 million consumers who previously lacked credit scores, while also increasing the number of people categorized as super-prime.

Then news broke that the three credit bureaus had come to an agreement with New York state to resolve credit disputes themselves, rather than through lenders.

With potentially adjusted business priorities, a slew of new investors to come and a large increase in funds raised, it’s not a reach to argue that this move could affect consumers.
