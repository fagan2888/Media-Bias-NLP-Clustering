He enjoyed explaining his faith to non-Jewish audiences. And he believed that learning was a lifelong calling.\n\nKripke, who died Friday at age 100, led Omaha's Beth El Synagogue for almost 30 years.\n\nHe had served congregations in Wisconsin, New York and Connecticut before coming to Omaha in 1947. He was named rabbi emeritus at Beth El in 1975.\n\nKripke often hosted educational talks with community members and wrote a weekly column for the Jewish Press for years.\n\nRabbi Steven Abraham of Beth El said Saturday night that his predecessor was beloved by his congregation and respected around the country.\n\n\u201cHe was an incredibly scholarly man, an erudite man,'' Abraham said. He added: \u201cHe put the Omaha Jewish community on the map.\u201d\n\nKripke and his wife, Dorothy, who died in 2000, made numerous charitable contributions over the years. The couple endowed the Center for the Study of Religion and Society at Creighton University, and it was renamed the Kripke Center in 2005.\n\nA key focus of the center is promoting understanding among all faith communities but especially among Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\n\nRabbi Kripke often spoke in churches, Christian schools and other non-Jewish venues. He said his hope was that misconceptions about Judaism might be \u201cmodestly assaulted by my presence.\u201d He taught courses on theology at Creighton and the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\n\nMyer Kripke was born Jan. 21, 1914, in Toledo, Ohio. He was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of New York University and earned a master's degree in philosophy from Columbia University.\n\nHe received master's and doctoral degrees, as well as his rabbinical degree, from the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. He was senior class president at the seminary in 1937.\n\nKripke met Dorothy Karp in a classroom at the seminary. She said it was love at first sight: \u201cI knew a good thing when I saw one.\u201d\n\nThe Kripkes' philanthropy was enabled in large part because of their decision to invest with Warren Buffett. The couple had known Buffett since the 1950s, playing bridge together and celebrating Thanksgivings.\n\nDorothy Kripke urged her husband for several years to approach Buffett about investing their modest savings, but the rabbi resisted, saying the stake was too small to interest Buffett.\n\n\u201cI said 'Look, I'll be silly to go up there,' \u201d Kripke recalled in 1997. \u201cHe doesn't want the kind of money we have.''\n\nIn 1966, he finally made the trip to Buffett's office.\n\n\u201cHe said 'I'll take whatever you have and I'll make money on you,' \u201d Kripke recalled. \u201cAnd he did. And we did.\u201d\n\nThe amount grew to millions of dollars over the years, allowing the Kripkes to make charitable contributions, including a $7 million donation to the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he had trained, to restore its 13-story tower for classroom and office space.\n\nRabbi Kripke used the pulpit as an educational vehicle, said his daughter, Madeline Kripke of New York. He also commissioned artwork for the sanctuary at Beth El.\n\n\u201cThe way he practiced his religion from the pulpit was also to be mindful of aesthetics,\u201d she said.\n\nIn that same vein, she said, he wanted his sermons to be melodic, understood and translated.\n\nKripke once told The World-Herald that his strength as a congregational rabbi was his ability to listen. He said he was aided by his devotion to reading, which broadened his perspective.\n\n\u201cOne tends to like his own opinion very much,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm guilty of that, too.\u201d\n\nDorothy Kripke was an accomplished writer and scholar as well. She was the author of 10 books for children, including the popular \u201cLet's Talk\u201d series: \u201cLet's Talk About God\u201d and \u201cLet's Talk About Right and Wrong\u201d among them.\n\nThe Kripkes' son, Saul, is an internationally known philosopher who teaches at the Graduate Center of the City College of New York. Madeline Kripke is an editor and well-known expert on dictionaries, with 20,000 volumes in her collection. The Kripkes' other daughter, Netta Stern, who was a social worker, died in 2011.\n\nMyer Kripke also is survived by a grandson, granddaughter and two great-grandsons.\n\nServices will be at 10 a.m. Monday at Beth El Synagogue, 14506 California St., with burial in Beth El Cemetery.\n\nWorld-Herald staff writer Joseph Brennan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Omaha.com", "description": "In a century of life, Myer Kripke was a scholar, rabbi and philanthropist.", "title": "Longtime leader of Omaha synagogue championed interfaith dialogue", "url": "http://www.omaha.com/news/longtime-leader-of-omaha-synagogue-championed-interfaith-dialogue/article_7cd35fca-3184-51ae-a030-85ba083a3042.html", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/9e/f9ec90ec-63e4-5c02-a757-9da11cf87230/5390cc2cb56f0.image.jpg?resize=600%2C512", "height": 512}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@OWHnews", "card": "summary"}, "description": "In a century of life, Myer Kripke was a scholar, rabbi and philanthropist.", "fb": {"app_id": 117714391577072}, "keywords": "news", "google-site-verification": "gE-kSjgMAF16OyUU3QCB0Ap0PQnFlh5oPdueJO6D2cQ", "news_keywords": "news"}, "article_summary": "Services will be at 10 a.m. Monday at Beth El Synagogue, 14506 California St., with burial in Beth El Cemetery.\nHe was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of New York University and earned a master's degree in philosophy from Columbia University.\nKripke, who died Friday at age 100, led Omaha's Beth El Synagogue for almost 30 years.\nRabbi Kripke used the pulpit as an educational vehicle, said his daughter, Madeline Kripke of New York.\nRabbi Steven Abraham of Beth El said Saturday night that his predecessor was beloved by his congregation and respected around the country."}
