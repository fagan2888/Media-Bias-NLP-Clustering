The U.S. Marshals Service says a Kansas City, Kansas, man who fled the U.S. two years ago was arrested when he flew back to the country from Africa.

Marshals say Wilson Tyler was arrested Thursday at John F. Kennedy airport in New York. He fled in 2013 after being charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and stealing $150. He was tracked to Sierra Leone.

The Kansas City Star reports Tyler was convicted as a teenager of second-degree murder in the 1980 killing of a Kansas City, Kansas, service station clerk. He was convicted of sodomizing another inmate while being held for the murder.

Because of Ebola in Sierra Leone, Tyler will be held in a special unit in New York until he is cleared to return to Kansas.
