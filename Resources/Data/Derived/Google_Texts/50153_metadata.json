Oregon Right to Life says Cruz has a sterling pro-life record that it described as \u201cimpeccable.\u201d\n\n\u201cORTL PAC is pleased to endorse Senator Cruz,\u201d said Gayle Atteberry, executive director of ORTL. \u201cHis record on pro-life issues is impeccable. We can trust that as president, he will do all he can to protect unborn babies. That includes the all-important decisions he would make in nominating new Supreme Court justices.\n\n\u201cBoth Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Atteberry, \u201csupport abortion on demand, from conception to birth, as well as continued taxpayer funding of abortion and Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nAtteberry told LifeNews that the stakes in Oregon\u2019s primary election are higher than usual as every delegate counts in the battle for the Republican nomination. She said \u201cOregon Right to Life PAC encourages pro-life voters across Oregon to vote early for Ted Cruz to ensure that Oregon plays its part in electing a pro-life president.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Cruz has a 100% pro-life voting record during his tenure in the Senate.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of abortion, Cruz has compiled a 100% pro-life voting record during his tenure in the Senate. On 16 total votes on pro-life issues taken while has has served in the Senate, Cruz voted pro-life every single time.\n\nThe votes tallied by the national Right to Life Committee include multiple votes supporting a bill to de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business over the years, votes to repeal or de-fund Obamacare, which uses taxpayer funds to pay for abortions as well as votes to protect the conscience rights of pro-life Americans.\n\nThe tally of 8 votes below does not include two additional votes in August and September to end debate and stop the Democrats\u2019 filibuster of measure that would de-fund Planned Parenthood. The August and September votes Cruz cast to defund Planned Parenthood brings the total tally to 10 pro-life votes cast during his Senate tenure.\n\nIn a recent interview, Cruz expound on his pro-life views and said that pro-abortion Democrats use the issue of contraception to try to attack pro-life Republicans and make them look like extremists.\n\nCruz gave an interview last week to the Catholic news network EWTN and he asked Cruz about some comments he made supporting contraception. The Texas senator said he was pushing back against a Democratic \u201cpolitical attack that was deliberately deceptive.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am unequivically pro-life, I believe that every life is a precious gift from God that needs to be protected from the moment of conception until the moment of natural death,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the Democrats didn\u2019t raise that battle on the issue of life; instead they did it on contraceptives, and it was deliberately deceptive, they were trying to scare young women into thinking some politician is going to come take their birth control away from them.\u201d\n\nSIGN THE PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\n\u201cAnd the point I was making through humor \u2013 and humor is often a very effective way to communicate \u2013 is that nobody was talking about banning birth control for anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz also defended the Little Sisters of the Poor, who are headed to eh Supreme Court to defend their right not to be forced by the Obama administration ot pay for abortion-causing drugs under the HHS mandate found in Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oregon Pro-Life Group Endorses Ted Cruz: \"His Record on Pro-Life Issues is Impeccable\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The leading pro-life group in Oregon today issued its endorsement for pro-life Republican candidate Ted Cruz for President.
