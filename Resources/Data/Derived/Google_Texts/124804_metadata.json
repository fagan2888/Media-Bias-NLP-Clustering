Obama administration officials, including Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time of the attack, have said the erroneous account was a result of flawed initial reports.\n\nRepublicans on the panel said in a press release last week that Kennedy could \"shed some light\" on delays in the delivery of State Department documents to the panel and address \"why security in Benghazi was grossly inadequate.\"\n\nThe committee has interviewed more than 70 witnesses. Gowdy said most have not spoken under oath to other congressional committees.\n\nDemocrats dismiss the investigation as a partisan probe aimed at finding dirt on Clinton. That perception has benefited from statements by prominent House Republicans who have touted the effect committee findings have had on Clinton's campaign.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
