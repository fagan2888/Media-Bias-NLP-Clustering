(Photo: John Minchillo/AP)\n\nBoth presidential nomination contests having been scrambled by recent events \u2014 the FBI taking control of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and a raucous, roiling GOP debate \u2014 the third edition of the Racing Form is herewith rushed into print.\n\nLegal disclaimer: This column is for betting purposes only. What follows is analysis \u2014 scrubbed, as thoroughly as a Clinton server, of advocacy. (Unless I simply can\u2019t resist.)\n\n\u2022Hillary Clinton: Ever since her disastrous book-launch performance, I\u2019ve thought her both (1) a weak candidate and (2) the inevitable Democratic nominee.\n\nNo longer. She has fallen from her 95 percent barring-an-act-of-God perch. The email imbroglio has already badly damaged her credibility. But now that she\u2019s lost control of the server, there is potential for further, conceivably fatal, damage. It hinges largely on how successful she was in erasing the 32,000 emails she unilaterally deemed private.\n\nWhatever happens, she will stay in the race. Clintons never quit. But if more top-secret information is found, if she did destroy work-related emails and if her numbers continue their steady decline, the party might decide it simply can\u2019t afford to continue carrying her baggage.\n\nOdds: 1-3.\n\n\u2022Bernie Sanders: A less flighty, more serious Gene McCarthy. Fiery and genial, Sanders is the perfect protest candidate. But can a 73-year-old dairy-state Brooklynite socialist win? Of course not. If Hillary falls, Joe Biden fills the vacuum. Possibly even John Kerry. (Note to Dems: The beatified Jon Stewart is currently unemployed and at large.)\n\nMeanwhile, over at the GOP ...\n\n\u2022Donald Trump: Clear front-runner. Are you waiting for him to bring himself down? He won\u2019t. He\u2019s impervious to the gaffe. In fact, he has a genius for turning a gaffe into a talking point, indeed, a rallying cry.\n\nSince the debate, his numbers have plateaued, and in some places declined. In New Hampshire, for example, he\u2019s gone from the mid-20s to the high teens. And he had a rough debate, as reflected in the Suffolk University poll in Iowa taken right afterward, in which, by 55-23, respondents felt less comfortable with him as president.\n\nNonetheless, his core support, somewhere around 20 percent (plus or minus a couple), remains as solid as that once commanded by Ron Paul and Ross Perot. Which means Trump will likely continue to lead until the field whittles down to a handful, at which point 20 percent is no longer a plurality.\n\nTeflon Don. Solid constituency, fixed ceiling. Chances of winning his party\u2019s nomination? About the same as Sanders winning his.\n\n\u2022Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio: Still the top tier. Walker just held his own in the debate. Bush slipped slightly, appearing somewhat passive and, amazingly, still lacking a good answer to the \u201cbrother\u2019s war\u201d question. But he continues steady with a serious follow-up foreign policy speech and stick-to-his-guns positions on Common Core and immigration \u2014 not easy given the current mood of the party.\n\nRubio had the best debate performance of the prime-time 10 \u2014 fluid, passionate, in command. And he was already No. 1 in the \u201cwho could you support\u201d question (at 62 percent), crucial in a 17-member field.\n\nOdds for each? Rubio 3-1. Bush and Walker 4-1.\n\n\u2022Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Carly Fiorina: The new second tier. And rising. Cruz had a strong debate, establishing himself as the most convincing carrier of the populist, anti-Washington meme.\n\nKasich was engaging and compelling as the bleeding-heart conservative and successful tough-guy governor. Not an easy trick.\n\nFiorina displayed raw talent that surprised everyone who didn\u2019t know her \u2014 and 6 million watched. Articulate, knowledgeable and relentlessly combative, she took on Clinton, Trump and Barack Obama. Being in the undercard was a stroke of luck. She took the stage and made it her own.\n\nOdds for the second-tier? 9-1 but with high ceilings for each.\n\n\u2022Bonus Racing Form feature: the general election.\n\nConventional wisdom is that the GOP is tearing itself apart and headed south. What\u2019s becoming clear, however, is that the Democrats are equally split ideologically \u2014 Clinton desperately moving left as Sanders\u2019 crowds grow \u2014 and increasingly nervous about her chronic, shall we say, character problem.\n\nBoth parties limp into November 2016. Current odds? GOP: 55 percent.\n\nAnd note how thin is the Democrat\u2019s bench. After Clinton, no one, while the GOP stage sports perhaps eight to 10 impressive, plausibly presidential figures, including (for those who count such things) two Hispanics, a female former Fortune 500 CEO and an African-American brain surgeon.\n\nAnd one white guy fluent in Spanish. Try engaging Bernie or Hill en espa\u00f1ol.\n\nCharles Krauthammer\u2019s email address is letters@charleskrauthammer.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1NzhRoN", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Columnist Charles Krauthammer analyzes the field", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Columnist Charles Krauthammer analyzes the field", "title": "The Racing Form: 2016 presidential election", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/08/16/racing-form-presidential-election/31817227/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Columnist Charles Krauthammer analyzes the field", "title": "The Racing Form: 2016 presidential election", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2326636f7817a8e41bda631512b76fef8e1b9b65/c=1010-0-4331-3321&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/16/GreenBay/B9318448271Z.1_20150816143805_000_GRDBK938K.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Articulate, knowledgeable and relentlessly combative, she took on Clinton, Trump and Barack Obama.\nRepublican presidential candidates from left, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Scott Walker, Donald Trump, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and John Kasich take the stage Aug. 6 for the first Republican presidential debate at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.\nAfter Clinton, no one, while the GOP stage sports perhaps eight to 10 impressive, plausibly presidential figures, including (for those who count such things) two Hispanics, a female former Fortune 500 CEO and an African-American brain surgeon.\n(Photo: John Minchillo/AP)Both presidential nomination contests having been scrambled by recent events \u2014 the FBI taking control of Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and a raucous, roiling GOP debate \u2014 the third edition of the Racing Form is herewith rushed into print.\n\u2022Hillary Clinton: Ever since her disastrous book-launch performance, I\u2019ve thought her both (1) a weak candidate and (2) the inevitable Democratic nominee."}
