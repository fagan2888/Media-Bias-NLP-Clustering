Ryan Silvey, R-Kansas City, will be formally introducing a bill today to expand Medicaid in Missouri by applying for a block grant from the federal government to operate the program.\n\nSilvey \u2014 one of only a few Republicans publicly supporting expansion of Medicaid as called for under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 said that several of his Republican colleagues have voiced interest in seeking the funds to expand through a block grant, removing many of the strings that come with federal money.\n\nUnder the bill, which Silvey plans to introduce today, the Missouri Department of Social Services would seek approval to operate MO HealthNet under a block grant through the creation of the \u201cHealthcare Transformation Trust Fund.\u201d The fund would allow individuals making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level to be eligible for Medicaid, closing the infamous \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d Silvey\u2019s legislation would also designate a joint committee of 5 senator and 5 representatives to promulgate rules to implement MO Healthnet and oversee its operation.\n\nThat move, Silvey said, is a way of keeping Gov. Jay Nixon from getting a blank check from the federal government to \u201ctotally remake\u201d the Medicaid program.\n\n\u201cIn most states if you had a Republican legislature ask for a block grant, you\u2019re going to have a Republican governor. There are things that I\u2019ve put forward that [Nixon] wouldn\u2019t implement if it\u2019s up to him,\u201d Silvey said. \u201cAdditional workforce participation requirements? He won\u2019t do that. Expanding options for private insurance? He won\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nSilvey said the federal government was becoming increasingly comfortable with granting waivers and block grants to states to operate their Medicaid programs as its seen the bitter legislative fights surrounding Medicaid expansion ensue. Under Silvey\u2019s bill, no expansion would take place if the block granted were not given.\n\nSilvey\u2019s support for Medicaid expansion occasionally draws the ire of some of his fellow Republicans, who say expansion is merely adding most money and costs to a largely broken healthcare system. He\u2019s been vocal this year about his desire to support \u201cclosing the coverage gap\u201d and even filed veterans-only expansion bill as just one way to force the discussion in the Senate. Silvey says he knows that legislative hurdles still exist to expansion, but says he\u2019s increasingly optimistic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for solutions,\u201d Silvey said. \u201cI\u2019m confident many of my colleagues do recognize that we have a problem with the coverage gap. This is one possible solution for it, and we need to be having those conversations. This is one solution that some conservatives have suggested.
