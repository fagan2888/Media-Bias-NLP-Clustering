It would withhold certain federal funding from states or cities that refuse to comply with requests from federal immigration officials to turn over immigrants who are in the country illegally.\n\nSen. David Vitter, R-La., introduced the legislation, which includes a provision known as Kate\u2019s Law, named after 32-year-old Kate Steinle, who was fatally shot in San Francisco on July 1. The bill would impose a mandatory minimum jail sentence of five years for illegal immigrants who are convicted of re-entering the United States after being convicted of an aggravated felony or have three strikes for trying to enter the country illegally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s maddening that the Democrats are encouraging sanctuary cities like New Orleans that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement and let dangerous criminal illegals free,\u201d Vitter said in a statement after the bill failed.\n\nVitter has been pushing to defund sanctuary cities since 2007, when he served as chairman of the Border Security Caucus.\n\nSanctuary policies vary from state to state, but they generally prevent local authorities from cooperating with federal immigration officers, allowing those localities to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. There are currently 340 sanctuary cities in the United States, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThe issue of sanctuary cities gained national attention when Steinle was killed this summer by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal immigrant who had seven prior felony convictions in the U.S. and had been deported to Mexico five separate times. He was released from a San Francisco jail in April under a city law barring the jail\u2019s deputies from informing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of his release, despite the agency\u2019s previous notification request.\n\nOpponents of the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act question the taxpayer cost of implementing mandatory minimums at a time when Congress is working to reform the criminal justice system. Some, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., even mocked the legislation, calling it the \u201cDonald Trump Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis Donald Trump Act was designed to demonize immigrants and spread the myth that they are criminals and threats to the public,\u201d Reid said on Monday.\n\nDuring his bid for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, Trump highlighted Steinle\u2019s death as an example of why the country needs stricter immigration policies.\n\nIn July, the White House issued a veto threat on similar legislation that passed in the House, saying the measure \u201cundermines current administration efforts to remove the most dangerous convicted criminals.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that supports reduced immigration, identified the 340 cities, counties, and states that are considered sanctuary locations.\n\nA government report commissioned for Congress by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement found that sanctuary cities released more than 9,000 illegal immigrants whom federal authorities were seeking to deport between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30, 2014. As of last year, 69 percent of those were still at large in the United States.\n\nOf those still at large, 1,377 had another criminal arrest that resulted in the detainer. Of the 6,460 criminal aliens who were still at large during the time period studied, 3,802 (58 percent) had prior felonies or violent misdemeanors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senate Democrats blocked legislation that would punish \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in a 54-45 vote Monday afternoon.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Democrats blocked legislation that would punish \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in a 54-45 vote Monday afternoon.", "title": "See How Your Senators Voted on Sanctuary Cities", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlseven197729.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-21T14:37:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PEyeU7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Senate Democrats blocked legislation that would punish \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in a 54-45 vote Monday afternoon.", "title": "See How Your Senators Voted on Sanctuary Cities", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/rtrlseven197729.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-10-20T15:27:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-21T14:37:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "sanctuary cities, sanctuary city bill, vitter, senator vitter, immigration, illegal immigration, kate Steinle, Kate's law,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec70\"", "article_summary": "Vitter has been pushing to defund sanctuary cities since 2007, when he served as chairman of the Border Security Caucus.\nThere are currently 340 sanctuary cities in the United States, according to the Center for Immigration Studies.\nSenate Democrats blocked legislation that would punish \u201csanctuary cities\u201d in a 54-45 vote Tuesday afternoon.\nAs of last year, 69 percent of those were still at large in the United States.\nThe issue of sanctuary cities gained national attention when Steinle was killed this summer by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an illegal immigrant who had seven prior felony convictions in the U.S. and had been deported to Mexico five separate times."}
