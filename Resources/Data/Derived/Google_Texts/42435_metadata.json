They include aerostats, large, tethered balloons with infrared cameras that can scan the landscape around the clock.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to do it at a scale that hasn\u2019t been done,\u201d Buffett said in an interview with The Associated Press. He described the initiative, which will also focus on cross-border criminal investigations and intelligence networks, as way of learning \u201cwhat works and what doesn\u2019t work\u201d in a southern area of the park that has 4,000 rhinos. South African is home to most of the continent\u2019s rhinos.\n\nBuffett acknowledged that the $23.7 million initiative doesn\u2019t directly address soaring demand for rhino horn in Vietnam and other parts of Asia where it is viewed as a status symbol and a healing agent for serious illness, although there is no evidence that rhino horn, made from the same material as fingernails, is an effective medicine.\n\n\u201cI have no illusions about this,\u201d said Buffett, who announced the initiative with the South African national parks service at Standard Bank headquarters in Johannesburg. \u201cThis is an overwhelming issue.\u201d\n\nParts of a fence once separating Kruger park from a national park on the Mozambican side were removed a decade ago to encourage wildlife migration, but the surge in rhino poaching has prompted some calls to restore the barrier. The South African government said Friday that poachers had killed 172 rhinos so far this year, two-thirds of them in Kruger park. Last year, 1,004 rhinos were poached in South Africa, three times as many as in 2010.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American philanthropist funds rhino protection", "title": "American philanthropist funds rhino protection", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "American philanthropist funds rhino protection", "title": "American philanthropist funds rhino protection", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/15/american_philanthropist_funds_rhino_protection/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/south-africa-wildlife.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "American philanthropist funds rhino protection", "title": "American philanthropist funds rhino protection", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/south-africa-wildlife.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Christopher Torchia", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca2a\"", "article_summary": "The South African government said Friday that poachers had killed 172 rhinos so far this year, two-thirds of them in Kruger park.\n\u201cI have no illusions about this,\u201d said Buffett, who announced the initiative with the South African national parks service at Standard Bank headquarters in Johannesburg.\nSouth African is home to most of the continent\u2019s rhinos.\nLast year, 1,004 rhinos were poached in South Africa, three times as many as in 2010.\n\u201cThis is an overwhelming issue.\u201dParts of a fence once separating Kruger park from a national park on the Mozambican side were removed a decade ago to encourage wildlife migration, but the surge in rhino poaching has prompted some calls to restore the barrier."}
