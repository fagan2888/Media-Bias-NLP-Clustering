CDT\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, Wisconsin! (Applause.) I am thrilled to be back in Wisconsin. Hello, U.W.L.! (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much. I\u2019m fired up! (Applause.) It is good to be back in \u201cGod\u2019s Country.\u201d (Applause.) I appreciate being anyplace that names an eagle after Stephen Colbert. (Laughter.)\n\nHappy early 4th of July, everybody. (Applause.) I figured I\u2019d come here to kick off the long weekend.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Get a Bratwurst!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: I\u2019m looking for a brat. (Laughter.)\n\nIt is wonderful to see your outstanding Senator, Tammy Baldwin, here. (Applause.) Tammy is doing outstanding work in the Senate. And then, over in the House, you got a Congressman who never forgets his La Crosse roots \u2014 Ron Kind. (Applause.) Yay, Ron! Your Mayor, Tim Kabat. (Applause.) Former Governor, Jim Doyle. (Applause.) And I want to thank your chancellor, Joe Gow \u2014 (applause) \u2014 and everybody who helped to organize this. I\u2019m so appreciative.\n\nI\u2019ve heard good things about Riverfest. (Laughter.) We do a pretty good cookout at the White House. In fact, we\u2019re having a barbeque for the troops on Saturday. (Applause.) But let\u2019s face it, nobody does brats like Wisconsin. (Applause.)\n\nSo, no matter where you live, this is a special time of year to be an American. You\u2019ve got the food, you\u2019ve got the fireworks. By the way, if you have chairs, feel free to sit. (Laughter.) I\u2019m going to talk for a while. If you don\u2019t have chairs, don\u2019t sit down because you\u2019ll fall. (Laughter.)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Love you! (Applause.)\n\nBut in addition to the fireworks, in addition to the food, this is a chance to celebrate a bedrock principle so deep that generations of Americans have been willing to risk everything to declare it: the idea that all of us are created equal. (Applause.) That all of us are endowed with certain inalienable rights like liberty, the pursuit of happiness \u2014 and that it\u2019s each generation\u2019s obligation to help secure those rights not just for a few, but for everybody. (Applause.)\n\nAnd that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about. It\u2019s been a remarkable few weeks in America. (Applause.) Health care is now affirmed as something that everybody can get, not just some. (Applause.) And by the way, it\u2019s not just a matter of making sure everybody has access to high-quality care; it\u2019s also organizations like Gundersen here in Wisconsin that are doing great work to help \u2014 (applause) \u2014 to increase quality and to control costs. And so that was a great affirmation.\n\nAnd then, the freedom to marry who you love \u2014 that\u2019s now open to all of us. (Applause.) Everybody. That\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s a good thing. (Applause.) That is a good thing.\n\nAnd then out of the worst of tragedies, this country is responding with a generosity but also the kind of self-examination that can lead us to someplace better.\n\nSome folks think all this progress comes really quickly. But the truth is progress only comes with the persistent, dedicated effort of citizens \u2014 (applause) \u2014 people who are, in their own small ways all across the country, working hard, committed to the promise that\u2019s always set this country apart. It doesn\u2019t happen because of the Supreme Court; it doesn\u2019t happen because of a President or a member of Congress. It happens because ordinary people work hard and do extraordinary things together; the promise that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can chase our own individual dreams, but we still come together as one American family to make sure the next generation has opportunity as well.\n\nAnd that\u2019s especially true when it comes to our economy. And that\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to La Crosse to talk about on this 4th of July weekend.\n\nAmerica has always done better, economically, when we\u2019re all in it together, when everybody gets a fair shot. (Applause.) When everybody gets a fair shot, everybody is doing their fair share, everybody is playing by the same set of rules. When we all feel like we\u2019ve got a common stake in our success \u2014 from the CEO in the corner suite to the workers on the factory floor. That\u2019s how we built the great American middle class. When you drive through La Crosse and throughout Wisconsin, when you see communities where kids are thriving and communities are thriving, it\u2019s because everybody has a shot. Everybody is working hard. Everybody is pitching in. That\u2019s when we\u2019re at our best.\n\nNow, this morning, we learned that our businesses created another 223,000 jobs last month. (Applause.) And the unemployment rate is now down to 5.3 percent. (Applause.) Keep in mind, when I came into office it was hovering around 10 percent. All told, we\u2019ve now seen 64 straight months of private sector job growth, which is a new record \u2014 (applause) \u2014 new record \u2014 12.8 million new jobs all told.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good. But we\u2019ve got more work to do because we\u2019ve got to get folks\u2019 wages and incomes to keep going up. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to make sure folks feel like their hard work is getting them somewhere. And let\u2019s face it, there are a lot of folks who still feel like the playing field is tilted in ways that make it hard for them to get ahead.\n\nThe challenges facing working men and women didn\u2019t all start with the recession. It\u2019s been going on for a while now. For a long time, health care was closed off from too many people and cost too much. Our schools too often were underfunded, weren\u2019t preparing our kids and our workers for the competition that\u2019s coming from the rest of the world.\n\nAnd by the way, our teachers are underpaid. (Applause.) I\u2019m just saying. That\u2019s true. (Applause.) Hardest job there is; most important job there is; and we should honor it as such. (Applause.)\n\nOther nations had been racing ahead on clean energy; we were still addicted to foreign oil when I came into office. So, even as we\u2019ve worked to put people back to work in the short run, we\u2019ve also been trying to work to change some of these long-term trends to make sure that we\u2019re laying the foundation for future success.\n\nWe worked to rebuild our economy on a stronger foundation for growth. And in slow and steady ways, that work is paying off.\n\nWe believed that we could ship fewer jobs overseas, start bringing new jobs to our shores instead. So we retooled the American auto industry. Today, we\u2019re on track to sell more cars and trucks this year than we have in over a decade. (Applause.) We invested in American manufacturing. And after a decade of decline, thanks to some of the steps we took, thanks to the support of folks like Tammy Baldwin and Ron Kind, we\u2019ve added nearly 900,000 new manufacturing jobs. Manufacturing is actually growing faster than the rest of the economy. (Applause.)\n\nWe believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high; more Americans finish college than ever before. (Applause.)\n\nWe believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and do a better job of protecting the planet. (Applause.) Today, America is number one in the traditional fuels \u2014 oil and gas \u2014 but we\u2019re also number one in wind. We generate more than 20 times as much solar electricity as we did in 2008. (Applause.) And thanks to lower gas prices and us setting standards to double fuel efficiency on cars, the typical family is on pace to save about 700 bucks at the pump this year. (Applause.)\n\nWe extended tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans and 97 percent of small businesses, and, yes, we asked the wealthiest Americans \u2014 who have been doing better than everybody else not just relatively, but absolutely \u2014 we asked them to pay a little bit more to help bring down the deficit. (Applause.) We put in place the toughest Wall Street reform in history that\u2019s protecting Main Street from another crisis if folks start acting reckless on Wall Street.\n\nAs I already mentioned, health reform means the uninsured rate in America is now the lowest on record. (Applause.) I have these vague recollections of when Republicans were saying Obamacare would kill jobs and crush freedom and bring about death panels. (Laughter.) And it turns out we\u2019re still celebrating the 4th of July. (Applause.) The only difference is another 16 million Americans can celebrate it with health care. (Applause.) That\u2019s worth celebrating. (Applause.) The republic survived. (Laughter.)\n\nBy one leading measure, what business owners pay out in wages and salaries is now growing faster than what they spend on health care. And that\u2019s the first time that\u2019s happened since the 1990s. So not only are more people getting health care, but because we\u2019ve slowed the growth of health care costs, businesses have more money left over to start giving raises to their workers. That\u2019s good for everybody. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I just want to play back the tape \u2014 I want to play back the tape \u2014 because we were told all these measures were going to destroy jobs and explode the deficit. Remember that?\n\nAUDIENCE: Yes!\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Remember when Republicans promised to bring unemployment down to 6 percent by 2017? (Laughter.)\n\nSo we\u2019ve got a record streak of private sector job growth. We\u2019ve cut the deficit by two-thirds. Our stock market has more than doubled \u2014 (applause) \u2014 restoring 401ks for millions of families.\n\nThis is progress. Step by step, America is moving forward. Middle-class economics works. (Applause.) It works. Yes! (Applause.)\n\nBut we still got more work to do. As Will Rogers once said, \u201cEven if you\u2019re on the right track, you\u2019ll still get run over if you just sit there.\u201d (Laughter.) You got to keep running. And so the question we\u2019ve got to keep asking ourselves is, where do we go from here? Because we still have choices. Will we drift toward an economy where only a few of us do very well and everybody else is still scrabbling, struggling to get by? That\u2019s not the right way to do it. Or will we keep working towards an economy where everybody who works hard has a chance to succeed?\n\nAnd over the next year and a half, you\u2019re going to hear a lot of pitches from a lot of people \u2014 they\u2019re going to deny that any progress has been made. You\u2019ll hear a lot of folks trying to sell you on their vision of where our country should go. They\u2019re going to be making a whole bunch of stuff up. (Laughter.) And when I say a lot of stuff, I mean a lot of stuff. (Laughter and applause.) We\u2019ve got some healthy competition in the Democratic Party, but I\u2019ve lost count of how many Republicans are running for this job. (Laughter.) They\u2019ll have enough for an actual \u201cHunger Games.\u201d (Laughter and applause.) That is an interesting bunch. (Laughter.)\n\nSo, but, Wisconsin, I\u2019ve come here today, I figure why should I let them have all the fun? (Laughter.) It is a good thing that this time around, you\u2019re hearing Republicans joining Democrats, talking about the middle class and working families. And that\u2019s good. I welcome them acknowledging that that\u2019s an important issue. But just keep in mind, Tammy, Ron, me \u2014 we were talking about the middle class before it was cool. (Laughter and applause.) Before it was trendy. (Applause.) We were talking about it before the polls told you, you should be talking about it. (Laughter.)\n\nAnd they talk the talk, but they don\u2019t walk the walk. Their menu doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of options for the middle class. The one thing that the bus full of people who are fighting to lead the Republican ticket all share is they keep on coming up with the same old trickle-down, \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d economics that helped bring about the crisis back in 2007-2008 in the first place.\n\nAnd I want to emphasize \u2014 I know some of them well. They\u2019re good people. It\u2019s just their ideas are bad. (Laughter and applause.) And I want to emphasize that. We\u2019re one country, we\u2019re all on one team, and so we\u2019re all one American family. But we all go \u2014 we\u2019re at Thanksgiving and Uncle Harry starts saying something and \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 you say, \u201cUncle Harry, that makes no sense at all.\u201d You still love him. (Laughter.) He\u2019s still a member of your family. Right? But you\u2019ve got to correct him. You don\u2019t want to put him in charge of stuff. (Laughter and applause.) That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. (Applause.)\n\nAnd by the way, if there\u2019s an Uncle Harry out here \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 I wasn\u2019t talking about you. (Laughter.) I was just using \u201cHarry\u201d as an example.\n\nHere are a few of their bad ideas: Eliminating taxes that the wealthiest Americans pay on their investments while making you pay taxes on every dime of your paycheck. That\u2019s a bad idea. (Applause.) That\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nKeeping the minimum wage worth less than it was when Ronald Reagan took office before most of you were born \u2014 that\u2019s a bad idea. (Applause.) Although, to be accurate, at least one of them actually thinks we just shouldn\u2019t have a nationwide minimum wage at all \u2014 we should just get rid of it.\n\nEvery single one of these candidates serving in Congress has supported cutting taxes for folks at the top while slashing investments in education. I know that sounds familiar.\n\nAUDIENCE: Booo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Some of those members of Congress voted to do it. Every single one of them is still obsessed with repealing the Affordable Care Act despite the fact that, by every measure, it\u2019s working. (Applause.) You know, look, you could make an argument against Obamacare before it passed \u2014 it\u2019s something new; it\u2019s untried; you don\u2019t know. But now, where it\u2019s doing exactly what it was supposed to and actually costing less than we expected, and people are satisfied with the coverage we\u2019re getting, it just seems a little mean \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 to say that you don\u2019t want to provide coverage to 16 million people. And you\u2019ve got nothing to replace it with \u2014 that\u2019s a bad idea. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I just to be clear, these are all really their ideas. I\u2019m not making it up. You can go fact-check it. I\u2019m not asking you to select from this list to see which one is actually true \u2014 they\u2019re all true. And the thing is there\u2019s nothing new about this philosophy. Right? It\u2019s a philosophy that believes if we give special breaks to folks at the top, prosperity trickles down for the rest of us.\n\nBut we\u2019ve seen what happens when top-down economics meets the real world. We\u2019ve got proof right here in Wisconsin. You had a statewide fair pay law that was repealed. Your right to organize and bargain collectively was attacked.\n\nAUDIENCE: Nooo \u2014\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: Per-student education funding was cut. Your minimum wage has been stuck in place. Meanwhile, corporations and the most fortunate few have been on the receiving end of hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax cuts over the past four years.\n\nAll right, so that\u2019s what\u2019s been going on here. What happens when we try middle-class economics? Just across the river \u2014 (applause) \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a pretty interesting experiment. Across the river, in Minnesota, they asked the top 2 percent to pay a little bit more. They invested in things that help everybody succeed \u2014 like all-day kindergarten and financial aid for college students. (Applause.) They took action to raise their minimum wage. They passed an equal pay law. They protected workers\u2019 rights. They expanded Medicaid to cover more people.\n\nNow, according to the Republican theory, all those steps would have been bad for the economy. But Minnesota\u2019s unemployment rate is lower than Wisconsin\u2019s. Minnesota\u2019s median income is around $9,000 higher. The La Crosse Tribune wrote, \u201cMinnesota is winning this border battle.\u201d (Applause.) Now, it is true that, as the Tribune pointed out, Wisconsin does have the Packers. (Applause.) So even a Bears fan can respect the Packers. (Applause.)\n\nBut understand, I\u2019m saying this \u2014 Wisconsin is this extraordinary state filled with extraordinary people. But if you end up having policies that cut education, help folks at the top, aren\u2019t expanding opportunity, then it\u2019s not going to work. We need better policies \u2014 (applause) \u2014 because the bottom line is top-down economics doesn\u2019t work. Middle-class economics works. (Applause.) It works. It works. (Applause.)\n\nAnd this is also a matter of values. Being an American is not about taking as much as you can from your neighbor before they take as much as they can from you. We\u2019re not just a bunch of individuals out here on our own. We\u2019re a community. We\u2019re a family. We\u2019re all in this together. (Applause.)\n\nWe all have to work hard. I was taking some photos beforehand with Ron, and met a couple folks who\u2019ve got dairy farms. Nobody works harder than farmers. (Applause.) They know about hard work. Farmers know about hard work. They wake up early, go to bed late. They\u2019re worrying all the time about making sure things run. But they also understand about being neighbors and helping each other out. That\u2019s America.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to make sure that this economy works for everybody who\u2019s willing to work, everybody who\u2019s willing to do their fair share. So I want to spend just the rest of my time talking about what that might mean for the 21st century.\n\nNumber one, we\u2019ve got to help working families feel more secure in this world of constant change. That\u2019s why health reform mattered. If you ever have been locked out of the health care market just because you have a preexisting condition, those days are over. (Applause.) So you can now change jobs, chase that new idea, start a business \u2014 because you\u2019ve got portable, affordable insurance if you need it. And that\u2019s going to protect a lot of people in the new economy.\n\nThe same applies when it comes to wages and benefits. Instead of treating child care as a side issue, or a women\u2019s issue, we got to treat it like a national economic priority. (Applause.) We\u2019ve got to make sure that when we\u2019ve got families where the mom and dad work, that we\u2019re putting together ways for them to still make sure their kids are secure and safe. (Applause.)\n\nSee, we got a lot of young people here who don\u2019t \u2014 aren\u2019t really thinking about that yet \u2014 and that\u2019s good. (Laughter.)\n\nWe got to make sure we got sick leave that\u2019s in place so that families \u2014 if somebody at home gets sick, you\u2019re not thinking, do I give up my paycheck or do I take care of my loved one. Everybody should have that basic benefit. (Applause.)\n\nWe need to boost the minimum wage. Give America a raise. That\u2019s very straightforward. (Applause.) We have to protect \u2014 and not attack \u2014 a worker\u2019s right to organize for fairer wages and better benefits, and safer workplaces. (Applause.)\n\nFolks forget sometime unions are what helped bring about the 40-hour workweek \u2014 (applause) \u2014 helped bring about the idea of the weekend. And I know that\u2019s a popular concept. (Laughter.) Helped establish worker protections, worker safety, a stronger middle class. As I said at Laborfest in Milwaukee last fall, if I were looking for a good job that lets me build some security for my family, I\u2019d join a union \u2014 because I\u2019d want a union looking out for me. And we\u2019re stronger together than we are by ourselves. (Applause.)\n\nI\u2019d want Congress looking out for me, too \u2014 but you can\u2019t always get what you want. (Laughter.)\n\nSo when Congress doesn\u2019t act on behalf of working people, what I\u2019ve tried to do is partner with cities and states and mayors and governors and acted on my own. Over the past couple of years, 17 states, almost 30 cities and counties have taken action to raise wages. Other cities and states have started guaranteeing workers paid sick days and family leave. (Applause.) And just this week, we took action to protect a worker\u2019s right to overtime. (Applause.)\n\nNow, this is an issue of basic fairness. If you work longer, you work harder, you should get paid for it. (Applause.) Today, some companies take advantage of an exception in the rule to make their lower-wage employees who really should be paid hourly \u2014 they\u2019re making them work 50, 60, sometimes 70 hours a week without paying them an extra dime. In extreme cases, it\u2019s possible for workers to actually earn less than the minimum wage. So they essentially label somebody as management instead of a worker, even if they\u2019re making, like, $25,000 \u2014 work them a whole bunch of hours. That\u2019s a way of getting around the minimum wage. It\u2019s not fair.\n\nSo we\u2019re updating the rules. We\u2019re ending that exception. (Applause.) We\u2019re making more workers eligible for the overtime that you\u2019ve earned. And it\u2019s one of the single most important steps we can take to help grow middle-class wages. It\u2019s going to give as many as 5 million Americans, including 80,000 folks right here in Wisconsin, the overtime protections they deserve. (Applause.) It\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s the right thing to do. (Applause.) Because in America, a hard day\u2019s work deserves a fair day\u2019s pay.\n\nNow, in an economy that\u2019s constantly changing, we\u2019ve also got to give every American the chance to earn the skills they need to stay competitive. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to be investing in job training and apprenticeships that help folks earn the skills for that new job or better-paying job. That\u2019s why we should make community college free for responsible students \u2014 like Tammy Baldwin is introducing in the United States Senate. (Applause.) No middle-class family should be priced out of the education that they need. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we need to keep churning out high-wage jobs for a better-trained workforce to fill \u2014 which means investing in basic research and development that leads to new businesses and industries. We should put more Americans to work rebuilding our roads, our railways, our bridges, our ports, our airports. (Applause.)\n\nAt a moment where our economy is in a position of global strength, because we\u2019re growing faster than most other countries right now \u2014 advanced countries \u2014 we have to rewrite the rules for the global economy before other countries like China do. The other day, I signed a couple of bipartisan bills that will help our businesses sell more goods made in the United States than the rest of the world. (Applause.) And I\u2019m going to keep pushing for trade that is fair and that creates a race not to the bottom, but to the top \u2014 (applause) \u2014 that creates better wages and better working conditions. Because when the playing field is level, American workers always win. (Applause.) They always win. We know how to work. Americans know how to work. (Applause.)\n\nSo that\u2019s what we need for this new economy: Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Give them the tools they need to earn higher wages and better jobs. Keep our businesses the most competitive. Stay on the cutting-edge of technology. Invest in research. Rebuild our roads. Rebuild our bridges. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to help more middle-class families succeed in a new and changing economy. We can\u2019t stop the economy globally from changing, but we can make sure we\u2019re at the forefront of adapting to it.\n\nAnd, look, I don\u2019t want to lie to you \u2014 this is hard. If it sounds hard, it\u2019s because it\u2019s hard. (Laughter.) I remember when we were working on health care, I had an advisor who \u2014 we\u2019re in a meeting and we were going around and around about how we were going to get this thing done. He raised his hand and he says, Mr. President, the thing is, this is hard, and hard things are hard. (Laughter.) I said, well, thank you for that astute observation. (Laughter.) So when he left, he left me a plaque that I put on my desk \u2014 it says \u201cHard things are hard.\u201d (Laughter.) Just in case I forget. (Laughter.)\n\nBattling back from recession has been hard. Fixing a broken health care system has been hard. Making our economy more competitive for the future \u2014 it\u2019s hard. But the last seven years \u2014 shoot, the last seven days \u2014 should remind us there\u2019s nothing America cannot do. (Applause.) There\u2019s no challenge we can\u2019t solve. There are inspiring Americans who prove this every single day. (Applause.) Nothing we can\u2019t do. Nothing we can\u2019t do. There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do. (Applause.)\n\nI got to admit \u2014 let me just, as a quick aside \u2014 I\u2019ve been President for six and a half years now. I do not watch the news. (Laughter.) I didn\u2019t \u2014 no offense. (Laughter.) But you\u2019d think, like, every day, the only thing going on are shark attacks and \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 just horrible things. But every day, I do get letters from Americans from all walks of life, and they\u2019re doing such amazing, inspiring things. Sometimes just simple things \u2014 working hard; running a farm; looking after their families; teaching a child. And every once in a while, they do something that has a even broader impact.\n\nSo Steve Cottrell lives right here in La Crosse \u2014 I\u2019m going to use him as an example. Steve? Steve is right there. (Applause.) He\u2019s going to start blushing, but I\u2019m going to talk about him anyway.\n\nIn 2002, he started a small business out of his house to help manage data for car companies and dealerships. By 2007, he employed a handful of people. Then he was hit with a double whammy \u2014 the recession came and the auto industry almost went belly up. But we refused to walk away from people like Steve. That shot in the arm, Steve says, was enough to keep his company\u2019s confidence going. During the worst years of the recession, Steve invested in new people, new technology; decided to double down, was absolutely confident his business model was right.\n\nAs the auto industry came roaring back, things began booming. And since 2007, Steve\u2019s revenue is up 1,000 percent. (Applause.) His company, Authenticom, has gone from 18 employees to more than 120. (Applause.) So this business that began in Steve\u2019s son\u2019s old bedroom is now one of America\u2019s fastest-growing private companies, based in a restored historic building right in downtown La Crosse. (Applause.)\n\nNow, I guarantee you Steve worked hard. He put everything he had into it. He took enormous risks. But he\u2019s also somebody who recognizes that he didn\u2019t do it by himself. He\u2019s proud of what he\u2019s accomplished, but he also talks about how fortunate he\u2019s been to be part of a community like La Crosse, to be part of an industry that got back to basics, determined to do things better and smarter. He pays his employees fair wages. He guarantees paid sick days. He helps pay for the tuition of those folks when they decide to go back to school. He created a stock appreciation program, so when the business does better, his workers do better also. And then, most importantly, there\u2019s \u201cFree lunch Friday.\u201d (Laughter.) Who doesn\u2019t like \u201cFree Lunch Friday,\u201d right? (Applause.)\n\nSo, look, I want to read something Steve said. He said, \u201cYou can\u2019t always do everything that everyone would like. But if you treat everybody like family, that\u2019s good for us.\u201d If you treat everybody like family, that\u2019s good for us.\n\nWhat\u2019s true for Steve\u2019s business is true for America. If you treat everybody like family, that\u2019s good for us. Not just me; not just you; not just Democrats; not just Republicans; not just old folks or young folks; not just black folks or white folks \u2014 it\u2019s good for us. (Applause.)\n\nWe\u2019re not going to solve every problem in one fell swoop. But if we make things a little better for our fellow Americans, we\u2019re going to leave something better for us and for our kids. And if we\u2019re walking down that road together, we\u2019re going to get there faster. (Applause.)\n\nThat\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for, everybody. That\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for, Wisconsin. (Applause.) That\u2019s what Tammy is fighting for and Ron is fighting for. That\u2019s what we all have to fight for. (Applause.)\n\nHappy 4th of July, everybody. God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)\n\nEND 2:19 P.M. CDT", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This is progress.
