When Typhoon Haiyan (also known as Typhoon Yolanda) hit the Philippines earlier this month, it was called one of the strongest storms — if not the strongest — in history.

Many linked it to global warming. Philippine Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario, said, “The unprecedented scale and strength of Yolanda, a typhoon that occurred at a very late time of the year, is a clear demonstration of the changing weather pattern. Whether the world faces up to it or not, this is a manifestation of climate change.”

True? No.

A peer-reviewed study published by the American Meteorological Society last year found that there weren’t more tropical cyclones, just more people and buildings in their paths: “The evidence in this study provides strong support for the conclusion that increasing damage around the world during the past several decades can be explained entirely by increasing wealth in locations prone to (tropical cyclone) landfalls.”

The latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also found no increase in the number of tropical cyclones and said it is “likely” their intensity has increased — but said the reason was unclear.

NASA climate scientist Bill Patzert did a YouTube video on the topic this month (watch it below). In it, he says:

“Is global warming happening? No doubt about it. We’re living in a warmer world, we’re living in a melting world, sea levels are rising. Now, direct evidence of the footprint or the fingerprint of global warming (is) we’re seeing more frequent, more intense and longer lasting heat waves. As far as hurricanes, tornadoes, forest fires, floods and drought, the evidence is definitely not in. The consensus among almost all scientists is that it’s a small fingerprint, not a large footprint. … Global warming definitely is accelerating and it will have an impact on extreme weather, but at this point, not much.”
