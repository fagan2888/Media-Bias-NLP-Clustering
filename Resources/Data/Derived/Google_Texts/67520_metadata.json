She pledged to keep the best of Obamacare and talked generally about the need for economic competitiveness and growth.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSlowly over time, it\u2019s become more difficult, more expensive, more red tape, unnecessary regulation that has put a damper\u201d on economic growth, she said. She praised the \u201cvirtuous cycle\u201d of consumers jump-starting the economy with more spending.\n\nBut she remained light on policy details, saying that \u201cbefore I roll out my policies, I want to hear from you on the front lines.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state arrived at a warehouse for the fruit distributor Capital City Fruit just before 1 p.m. Wednesday, taking her seat at a square table surrounded by a group of six. Behind her sat high stacks of boxed tomatoes.\n\nClinton vowed to try \u201cto build on what works in the Affordable Care Act\u201d and said she would look into health care providers competing across states in a free-market system.\n\n\u201cIt would be interesting to find out why in Iowa, a well-established company like yours is being asked to pay so much more for a private plan,\u201d she told Brendan Comito, who owns a fruit distributor and complained that his premiums have risen by 13 percent over one year.\n\nClinton said she would protect changes in Obamacare that prohibit insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions.\n\n\u201cI will defend those important changes in the Affordable Care Act because of somebody like you, Jennifer,\u201d she told Jennifer Hansen, the owner of a small boutique, who revealed she was diagnosed with breast cancer last year.\n\nOn immigration , she said, \u201cWe are really missing out on economic opportunity because we haven\u2019t been able to agree on comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore I roll out my policies, I want to hear from you on the front lines,\" Clinton said. | AP Photo\n\nClinton tapped into her own family history to relate to the group of small-business owners, recounting her father\u2019s work of printing and selling fabric for draperies. \u201cOccasionally my mother and brothers and I would work the squeegee,\u201d she recalled.\n\nWhile she was relaxed with the small-business owners gathered at the table, she bristled at the press. Clinton bolted from the room when reporters shouted questions at her about why she had ignored a 2012 letter from congressional investigators asking about her personal email use at the State Department and why she appeared to change her position on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage.\n\nDuring the roundtable, however, she was looser. She seemed to get a kick out of Bryce Smith, a recent college graduate who purchased the bowling alley he worked at growing up. Before she left, she asked him what the alley\u2019s hours were.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be in Iowa a lot,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "But she talks generally about the need for economic competitiveness and growth.", "title": "Hillary Clinton: Not ready to roll out policies yet", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/hillary-clinton-iowa-campaign-trail-policy-agenda-117005.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/15/lede_150415_hillary_clinton_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton 2016,Elections,Obamacare,Iowa,Hillary Clinton,Campaign 2016,Campaigns,Elections 2016,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "But she talks generally about the need for economic competitiveness and growth.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "While she was relaxed with the small-business owners gathered at the table, she bristled at the press.\n| AP PhotoClinton tapped into her own family history to relate to the group of small-business owners, recounting her father\u2019s work of printing and selling fabric for draperies.\nClinton said she would protect changes in Obamacare that prohibit insurers from discriminating against people with preexisting conditions.\nNORWALK, Iowa \u2014 In her second day on the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton rolled ahead with what has emerged as largely a listening tour, laying out only broad strokes of her policy agenda.\nShe pledged to keep the best of Obamacare and talked generally about the need for economic competitiveness and growth."}
