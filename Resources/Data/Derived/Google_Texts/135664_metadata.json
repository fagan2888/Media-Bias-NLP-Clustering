It was riveting, nonetheless, for Dave Christian and his old Olympic buddies, together again to celebrate their Miracle on Ice.\n\n\u201cIt feels exactly the same,\u201d Christian said Saturday night as the members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team returned to the rink they made famous with their triumph over the Soviet Union. \u201cYou could feel the electricity in the (locker) room. It\u2019s still there.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cRelive the Miracle\u201d reunion at Herb Brooks Arena attracted more than 5,000 fans for a two-hour celebration of one of the most memorable upsets in sports history. Every surviving player from the team made the trip, including Mark Pavelich, who drove from his Oregon home with two dogs. It was the first time the team had all been together since that memorable night.\n\nMissing was Brooks, the Hall of Fame coach who was killed in a car accident in 2003, and rugged defenseman Bob Suter, who died at age 57 in September.\n\n\u201cHerb had a feel for the game during the game,\u201d goalie Jim Craig said. \u201cHe would get you off the ice before you could commit a penalty. He was ahead of his time in many ways.\u201d\n\nFestivities included audio, video and still pictures, as well as a discussion of the game with the players. Suter\u2019s jersey was raised to the rafters as a tribute.\n\n\u201cBobby was a great player and a great person,\u201d said 60-year-old Mike Eruzione, who scored the game-winner against the Soviet Union in the medal round. \u201cHe did a lot for hockey. We all realize that at some point we\u2019re going to move on, but nobody thought that Bobby would not be with us. He was a special teammate, a special person.\u201d\n\nSuter had dedicated much of his later life helping kids learn the game as a youth hockey coach back in his hometown of Madison, Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cEveryone felt a big loss,\u201d Mark Johnson said. \u201cEveryone on the team had a role. Bobby was a character in and out of the locker room. He\u2019s dearly missed. His legacy will live on in Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nThe celebration continues Sunday, when NBC will anchor its \u201cHockey Day in America\u201d coverage from Lake Placid and feature the team.\n\nThe U.S. took the lead on Friday, Feb. 22, 1980, against the powerful Soviets on Eruzione\u2019s goal midway through the third period. It was the last goal of the game as Craig stood tall in net.\n\nThe Americans finished the 4-3 upset to the sound of broadcaster Al Michaels\u2019 call of, \u201cDo you believe in miracles?\u201d Two days later, the U.S. rallied to beat Finland 4-2 for the gold in a game the Americans had to win just to medal.\n\n\u201cIn sports in general, everyone roots for the underdog, which we certainly were an underdog,\u201d Christian said Saturday afternoon at a press conference. \u201cWe were aware of the political situation in the world, but in a lot of respects for us it truly was a game, a great challenge.\n\n\u201cWe were up against what at that time was considered one of the best teams that had been put together,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in that respect it was just a game. I think it gave people the sense of feeling good. You can\u2019t help but smile.\u201d\n\nFor Eruzione, who works in alumni relations at Boston University, his winning goal and the team\u2019s improbable gold medal changed his life. He said he deals \u201cwith it so often it\u2019s hard to believe it\u2019s been 35 years\u201d because every week he\u2019s doing something or going somewhere that\u2019s associated with 1980.\n\n\u201cThe real story for me was they only scored three goals,\u201d Eruzione said. \u201cThroughout the tournament, they were scoring seven, eight, nine goals a game. Not only was Jimmy (Craig) solid, actually, the defense and the defensemen were outstanding in that game.\u201d\n\nWhen the U.S. won the gold, it was a time of world strife. The Soviet army had just invaded Afghanistan as the Cold War simmered, a group of Americans was being held hostage in Iran, the U.S. economy was hurting, and President Jimmy Carter already had announced a U.S. boycott of the Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\nThe sociopolitical impact of that era has since faded. The memory of that February day 35 years ago in Lake Placid has not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played on a lot of teams, and this is the best team, the closest team I ever played on,\u201d Neal Broten said. \u201cAs a younger guy, I looked up to all these guys. It was a privilege and honor for me to represent our country with these guys and do what we did.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team reunites in Lake Placid", "title": "1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team reunites in Lake Placid", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/1980-u-s-olympic-hockey-team-reunites-in-lake-placid/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__miracleonicep1.jpg", "height": 481}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__miracleonicep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T14:06:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:34:13+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "LAKE PLACID, N.Y. \u2014 The ovation wasn\u2019t quite as deafening as it was 35 years ago.\nThe memory of that February day 35 years ago in Lake Placid has not.\nHis legacy will live on in Wisconsin.\u201dThe celebration continues Sunday, when NBC will anchor its \u201cHockey Day in America\u201d coverage from Lake Placid and feature the team.\n\u201cIt feels exactly the same,\u201d Christian said Saturday night as the members of the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team returned to the rink they made famous with their triumph over the Soviet Union.\n\u201cI\u2019ve played on a lot of teams, and this is the best team, the closest team I ever played on,\u201d Neal Broten said."}
