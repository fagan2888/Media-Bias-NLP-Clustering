The world\u2019s oldest party, which governed the nation during two world wars and is the primary architect of America\u2019s regulatory and redistributive state, is eager to give her its presidential nomination, in recognition of . . . what?\n\nThe party, adrift in identity politics, clings, as shipwrecked sailors do to floating debris, to this odd feminist heroine. Wafted into the upper reaches of American politics by stolid participation in her eventful marriage to a serial philanderer, her performance in governance has been defined by three failures.\n\nHer husband, having assured the 1992 electorate that voting for him meant getting \u201ctwo for the price of one,\u201d entrusted to her the project that he, in a harbinger of the next Democratic president\u2019s mistake, made his immediate priority \u2014 health-care reform. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan urged him to begin with welfare reform, just as wise Democrats wanted President Obama to devote 2009 to economic recovery rather than health care, perhaps sparing the nation six years and counting of economic sluggishness.\n\nHillary Clinton enveloped her health-care deliberations in secrecy, assembling behind closed doors battalions of the best and the brightest \u2014 think of many Jonathan Grubers weaving complexities for the good of, but beyond the comprehension of, the public. When their handiwork was unveiled, it was so baroque that neither house of a Congress controlled by her party would even vote on it. This was one reason that in 1994 Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years \u2014 a harbinger of 2010, when ObamaCare helped end Nancy Pelosi\u2019s tenure as the first female speaker.\n\nClinton\u2019s Senate interlude was an uneventful prelude to her 2008 presidential quest, which earned her, as a consolation prize, the State Department. There her tenure was defined by the \u201creset\u201d with Russia and by regime-change-by-bombers in Libya.\n\nRussia has responded by violently dismembering a European nation. Libya was the object of \u201chumanitarian intervention,\u201d an echo of Bill Clinton\u2019s engagement in the Balkans that appealed to progressives because it was connected only tenuously, if at all, to the US national interest. Today, Libya is a humanitarian calamity, a failed state convulsed by civil war and exporting jihadists.\n\nThese episodes supposedly recommend a re-immersion in Clintonism, a phenomenon that in 2001 moved The Washington Post to say, more in anger than in sorrow, that \u201cthe Clintons\u2019 defining characteristic\u201d is that \u201cthey have no capacity for embarrassment.\u201d This judgment was rendered as two episodes were demonstrating that the Clintons in power were defined by their manner of leaving it.\n\nBill Clinton punctuated his presidency by pardoning the late Marc Rich, a fugitive who 17 years earlier had been indicted for tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. He also traded with Libya and South Africa in contravention of embargos, and traded with Iran during the hostage crisis. Rich\u2019s former wife reportedly contributed more than $1 million to assorted Democratic causes, $450,000 for Clinton\u2019s presidential library and $10,000 to the legal-defense fund necessitated by Clinton\u2019s glandular life that led to the Supreme Court effectively disbarring him from practicing before it.\n\nA year before the Clintons decamped from Washington to begin planning their return to it, they began trucking away from the White House $190,000 worth of furnishings. Perhaps exigencies dictated this; the couple was, Hillary Clinton says, \u201cdead broke.\u201d The furnishings became, as things often do with the Clintons, another occasion for an \u201cit depends on what the meaning of the word \u2018is\u2019 is\u201d tiptoe along the ledge of illegality.\n\nThe White House chief usher thought many of the items were government property donated in 1993 to a redecoration project. Several donors of items said they were told this. Although the Clintons said that all the removed furnishings were personal gifts, they returned $28,000 worth of them.\n\nAs Hillary Clinton begins her campaign to again reside with the White House furnishings, remember an episode perhaps pertinent to the family penchant for secrecy and to her personal email server. Sandy Berger, who had been President Clinton\u2019s national security adviser, was Clinton\u2019s designated representative to the commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks that occurred less than nine months after Clinton left office. While representing Clinton, Berger frequented the National Archives. Later, he was fined $50,000 for surreptitiously taking highly classified documents from the archives and destroying some of them.\n\nAnother Clinton presidency probably would include a reprise of the couple\u2019s well-known patterns of behavior.
