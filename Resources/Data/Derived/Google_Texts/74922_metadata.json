From basic nursing to support services such as counseling, music therapy and pet therapy, Karagiozis and the hospice explore virtually every approach to easing patients\u2019 physical and emotional pain.\n\nBut Karagiozis\u2019 commitment to hospice is more than career-deep. He placed in hospice this year alone both his husband, Lance, who died in March of congenital heart disease, and his aunt, Beverly, who died of cancer the day we interviewed him.\n\nKaragiozis offered his interview in memory of his aunt, who opened his first office and paid out of her own pocket for patients who couldn\u2019t afford their medications.\n\nQuestion: Your grandmother\u2019s death from cancer convinced you to change course from veterinary to human medicine. Why did her death affect you that way?\n\nAnswer: When you\u2019re young, you don\u2019t really have an appreciation for mortality, and you don\u2019t really understand the disease state. When my grandmother got cancer \u2014 we\u2019re talking 30 years ago \u2014 cancer therapy was really primitive compared to what it is today. Even then, my mother and I could tell it was not state-of-the-art. That was the transformational moment for me. I went to med school just when HIV was coming out. I spent a large part of my career researching HIV. I just had this whole idea of attacking difficult-to-treat diseases.\n\nQuestion: You gravitate toward needier populations: Prisoners, the mentally ill, the dying. What draws you in that direction?\n\nAnswer: That\u2019s a really fun one. My grandmother was a huge believer in astrology, and she told me my sun was in the 12th house. And she always said the 12th house ruled outcasts, prisoners and the mentally ill. She always claimed that was the reason I gravitated toward needier people.\n\nAlso, I was raised between the Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches. So I was exposed early in my life to that philosophy of helping the needy. I guess either way you want to look at it, I was destined to take care of people who were on the outside or suffering.\n\nQuestion: What\u2019s your goal as a hospice doctor?\n\nAnswer: My primary objective is to keep people from suffering. At some point, you need to get people to accept that their illness is terminal, and you\u2019re not going to be able to do anything to materially change the outcome of the disease. But you can care for patients, and bring patients to a place where they\u2019re comfortable, at peace and not fearful.\n\nQuestion: Why does our culture avoid confronting or talking about death?\n\nAnswer: Americans basically have this attitude that we\u2019re invincible. I think our physicians are a product of that culture. As Americans, we just don\u2019t believe in losing. But the reality that is accepted in almost every other culture is that everyone dies eventually. When I do palliative-care consults, I see the difficulty that internists, specialists and interventionists have giving up when patients have reached the end of any reasonable return. America has the best interventionists in the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean every individual can be saved.\n\nQuestion: What do we need to change as a society about how we deal with dying?\n\nAnswer: There\u2019s this very strict and arbitrary definition of who can be a hospice patient. You have to be within six months of a prognosis of death. That\u2019s absurd. Florida passed legislation that gave patients a year, which is much more reasonable. But really, once you know a patient is terminal, that\u2019s when hospice should begin. Many studies show that benefits increase the earlier the patient is admitted to hospice. The journal Circulation looked at patients who had stage 4 heart disease, some of whom were admitted to hospice and some of whom were not. Patients admitted to hospice lived an average of 81 days longer, because of the constant nursing and ancillary support patients got. When they would go into little health crises, nurses would correct the problems before the patient went into full heart failure.\n\nPeople think the purpose of going into hospice is to die. But it\u2019s not. The purpose is to live well until you die. If there were a single thing I could change, it would be to help people understand that.\n\nQuestion: You recently lost your husband and your aunt. Are you able to be more clinical and objective about death? Does it affect you less than it might affect others?\n\nAnswer: With my aunt, she was older and she had cancer. I really feel that for her, dying was a lifting of a burden.\n\nWhen Lance died, I was devastated. We (doctors) remain human, and the beauty of hospice is that we can accept death. Nothing you do changes your humanity. All it does is allow you to put your humanity in perspective. And that perspective allows you to integrate and rationalize it better, so you may move through the stages of grief faster, but yeah, you go through all of those stages and at the same intensity as everyone else. And now, when I tell my patients and their families that I know what they\u2019re going through, it\u2019s an honest statement. It allows me to tell them it will get better. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. You just have to hold on until then.\n\nI know some doctors may be aloof, but if they are, it\u2019s because they\u2019re trying to protect themselves from these feelings everyone has. I don\u2019t know any doctor who isn\u2019t that way.\n\nQuestion: What do you like best about your job?\n\nAnswer: I like teaching students and residents that death is a natural process. I like them to understand that it\u2019s OK to care for a patient who has no positive prognosis.\n\nThe other thing I love most is bringing patients to peace with their diagnosis. I hate it when people are broken up and sad, and feeling existential suffering, because again, death is a natural part of life. The death rate is still 100 percent. So I love being able to bring people comfort and peace, and allowing them to enjoy the good death. A happy death is really a peaceful and painless death after a life well-lived.\n\nQuestion: What do you not like?\n\nAnswer: The way the funding paradigm is in the United States right now doesn\u2019t really recognize the importance of palliation. Existential suffering is as bad as any physical suffering. Yet, that\u2019s not really accepted in our society or in medical administration. It\u2019s just not really recognized that death is a genuine and tragic source of pain. I\u2019ve seen existential suffering far worse than any physical suffering. Nobody questions a morphine order for physical pain, but if you want to bring in a psychiatrist, they say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s not a covered benefit.\u201d\n\nQuestion: Doesn\u2019t the Affordable Care Act have rules to help change that?\n\nAnswer: In theory. We\u2019ll see how it pans out. Medicare is the largest provider and biggest driver of hospice, so Medicare is the (group) that would have to seriously look at it.\n\nQuestion: You\u2019ve helped establish the state\u2019s first fellowship program in hospice. What\u2019s the best solution to Nevada\u2019s medical-education issues?\n\nAnswer: Shelley Berkley, the provost at Touro University, said it best at a (May) graduation ceremony. The problem with medicine in Nevada is not that we don\u2019t graduate enough doctors. It\u2019s that we don\u2019t retain enough doctors. We have lots of medical-school seats, so we can graduate enough doctors. But we have a severe shortage of graduate medical education programs (residencies). That\u2019s why medical students leave \u2014 to go find graduate medical education. And most doctors end up staying where they train. To retain physicians, we need to train them here.\n\nMy personal opinion is that we don\u2019t need another medical school if we don\u2019t have graduate medical education programs. People would study here and then leave.\n\nContact reporter Jennifer Robison at jrobison@reviewjournal.com.
