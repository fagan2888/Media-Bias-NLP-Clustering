VERMILLION, S.D. (AP) - University of South Dakota Athletic Director David Herbster says the school has hired Northern Kentucky women’s basketball coach Dawn Plitzuweit (PLITZ’-zoo-wyte) to lead the Coyotes.

Officials plan to formally introduce Plitzuweit as South Dakota’s new coach at a news conference on Monday morning.

Plitzuweit replaces Amy Williams, who recently accepted a similar position at Nebraska, which is in the Big Ten conference.

Plitzuweit has compiled a 188-93 record for a winning percentage of .669 in nine years as a head coach. She led her teams to eight postseason appearances, highlighted by a 2006 NCAA Division II Championship at Grand Valley State.

She also guided Northern Kentucky through the Division I transition with four consecutive Women’s Basketball Invitational berths.
