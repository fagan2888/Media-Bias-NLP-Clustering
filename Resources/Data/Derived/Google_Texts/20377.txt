Some Quad Cities brides can check a few things off their list. Hundreds came out to the 13-th annual WeddingMax Bridal Show held on Saturday.

Around 45 different vendors showed up to the iWireless center to show off what they can offer brides for their wedding day, from photographers to dress shops to reception halls.

"It's for the brides: For them to come and get to talk to the vendors, and pick out their days. You want everything to be perfect for them for their day, and that's what we're trying to accomplish here at the show," said Karlie Fleck, who organized the Bridal Expo.

Next year's Bridal Expo is set for January 7, 2017.
