Mr. Rice was later released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the league after a new video emerged from media website TMZ showing Mr. Rice hitting his wife inside the elevator.\n\nThe NFL then faced another issue on Friday, when Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on a charge of injury to a child. Mr. Peterson was deactivated for Sunday\u2019s loss to the New England Patriots, but the Vikings said Monday that he is expected to play this week at the New Orleans Saints.\n\nDespite the recent criticisms, the NFL remains popular. NBC said Tuesday that its ratings for the first \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d after the scandal rose 8 percent to 22 million viewers.\n\nOverall, the NFL remains one of the few reliable ways to reach a massive audience. The league claimed last year that 205 million unique people watched an NFL game. As a result, advertisers spent more than $3 billion out of a total $70 billion on the NFL.\n\nThe NFL has a cozy relationship with its major advertisers and broadcasters. Last year at an owners meeting in Arizona, journalist Charlie Rose moderated a panel for league employees featuring, among others, McDonald\u2019s Chief Executive Don Thompson and CBS CEO Leslie Moonves. These types of events are common, as are other business leaders in owners\u2019 boxes at big games. The week of the league\u2019s opening game in Seattle, Goodell and his top executives dropped by for friendly visits to Microsoft and Nike.\n\nNFL owners continue to support Mr. Goodell both publicly and privately. New York Giants owner John Mara; the McCaskey family, owners of the Chicago Bears; and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, among others, have supported Mr. Goodell in the last week. Privately, owners say there wouldn\u2019t be real pressure unless the ongoing investigation into the matter, run by former FBI-head Robert Mueller, finds evidence of a coverup in the league office or that Goodell saw the tape.\n\nSponsors pulling out could apply major heat to Mr. Goodell, but those familiar with the NFL say that\u2019s unlikely.\n\n\u201cAny sponsor can be replaced. There\u2019s competition in all their key categories,\u201d said Kent Atherton, a former vice president of sports at DirecTV, who now runs a media and marketing company. \u201cThe NFL does exert leverage. They don\u2019t like to talk about it, but they carry a big stick. You want to play nice, you want to make sure you have a good relationship with them when it comes time to renewals.\u201d\n\nLen DeLuca, a longtime executive with CBS and ESPN, who now runs a media strategy company, said that evidence of how carefully \u201cleague partners\u201d are treading in the past week is evidence of how important the NFL is to large companies.\n\n\u201cThe networks and \u201ctraditional media\u201d are walking the fine line between covering the story with its news and sports-news divisions, and offending the client that produces 90 percent of the highest-rated shows in television,\u201d he said, citing the fact that TMZ broke the Rice video scandal in the first place.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NFL\u2019s big sponsor \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with response to off-field violence", "title": "NFL\u2019s big sponsor \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with response to off-field violence", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/16/nfls-big-sponsor-not-satisfied-with-response-to-off-field-violence/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140916__nfl-anheuser-buschp1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140916__nfl-anheuser-buschp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-16T15:10:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:24:54+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Sponsors pulling out could apply major heat to Mr. Goodell, but those familiar with the NFL say that\u2019s unlikely.\nNFL owners continue to support Mr. Goodell both publicly and privately.\nMr. Rice was later released by the Ravens and suspended indefinitely by the league after a new video emerged from media website TMZ showing Mr. Rice hitting his wife inside the elevator.\nThe week of the league\u2019s opening game in Seattle, Goodell and his top executives dropped by for friendly visits to Microsoft and Nike.\nThese types of events are common, as are other business leaders in owners\u2019 boxes at big games."}
