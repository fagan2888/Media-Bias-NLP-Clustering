Duncan died last week. \"We will do it from this day forward anywhere in the U.S.\"\n\nHealthcare workers across the country are worried about caring for potential Ebola patients in the wake of news that two healthcare workers who tended to Duncan while he was hospitalized have come down with the illness. Both are in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian although ABC News reports that the second healthcare worker will be transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.\n\nThe CDC has assigned a site manager to oversee infection control at the Dallas hospital to ensure that staff properly put on and remove personal protective equipment. The agency will also limit the number of healthcare staff who take care of an infected patient, according to Fox News. It is also providing more training so healthcare workers know how to diagnose Ebola.\n\n\"Every doctor, nurse, staff person needs to ask where have you been in the past month, past 21 days, have you been to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea,\" he told reporters.\n\nFrieden also acknowledged that the CDC was too slow to respond to the first case of Ebola and should have had a more robust team at the Dallas hospital after confirmation that Duncan had the virus.\n\nNow that a second healthcare worker is ill with the virus, public health authorities are monitoring 75 people who had contact with Duncan during his 11-day hospital stay, according to ABC News.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times is also reporting that coworkers of the Dallas healthcare workers claim staff worked for days without proper protective gear and that the hospital's Ebola protocols and procedures were unclear and inadequate, leaving workers prone to contamination. The new accusations were made in a statement by National Nurses United on behalf of unidentified registered nurses. The claims contradict previous reports by the CDC and the hospital that the organization followed infection control guidelines and workers did wear protective gear, including a gown, gloves, mask and face shield.\n\nPotentially complicating matters, the second worker flew the day before her symptoms manifested, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak is the worst in nearly 40 years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), which now reports that the virus has killed more than 4,000 people, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The WHO claims those countries could see 10,000 cases of Ebola a week by the end of the year, CNN reports.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Fox News coverage\n\n- here's the ABC News story\n\n- check out the Los Angeles Times piece\n\n- here are the statistics from WHO\n\n- read the CNN story\n\n- read the AP article via the Huffington Post\n\n- here's the second ABC News story\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nEbola pandemic would be costly to health insurers\n\nCDC may issue new protocols for healthcare workers to treat Ebola\n\nTexas nurse has Ebola; Did CDC protocols fail?\n\nDallas hospital defends treatment of Ebola patient\n\nEbola outbreak could cost affected nations $32B\n\nProviders, officials double down on Ebola precautions\n\nEbola in the U.S.: Review office game plan for handling infectious disease\n\nNurses union: U.S. hospitals not prepared for Ebola patients\n\nEbola outbreak worsens as scientists search for source of virus\n\nCDC confirms first case of Ebola", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday launched\u00a0a new strategy to stop the spread of Ebola to healthcare workers\u00a0in the wake of news that a second clinician who cared for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan before he died has come down with the deadly virus.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Tuesday launched\u00a0a new strategy to stop the spread of Ebola to healthcare workers\u00a0in the wake of news that a second clinician who cared for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan before he died has come down with the deadly virus.", "title": "CDC outlines new Ebola protocol with rapid response teams", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/cdc-outlines-new-ebola-protocol-rapid-response-teams/2014-10-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),Ebola,Ebola virus,Infectious Disease,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Rapid Response Teams", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb309\"", "article_summary": "The agency will also limit the number of healthcare staff who take care of an infected patient, according to Fox News.\nIt is also providing more training so healthcare workers know how to diagnose Ebola.\nThe CDC has assigned a site manager to oversee infection control at the Dallas hospital to ensure that staff properly put on and remove personal protective equipment.\nCDC Director Thomas Frieden, M.D., announced during a press conference that the agency will send Ebola response teams within hours of a confirmed case to any hospital in the United States, Fox News reported.\nBoth are in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian although ABC News reports that the second healthcare worker will be transferred to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta."}
