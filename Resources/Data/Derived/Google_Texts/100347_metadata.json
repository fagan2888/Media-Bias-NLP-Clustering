In last week\u2019s debate among Republican presidential candidates, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said he wasn\u2019t sure \u201chow paying for transgender surgery for soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines makes our country safer.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Surprising Way the Military Could Save Millions\n\nThe new study published in The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that 12,800 transgender troops currently serve and are eligible for health care in the U.S., but only 188 transgender service members would require transition-related care annually. Aaron Belkin, the San Francisco State University researcher who conducted the survey, checked for accuracy using data from the Australian military, which already covers transition-related care, and compared costs with insurance plans offered to University of California employees and their dependents.\n\nBelkin emphasized that costs could be lower than expected for several reasons. Among those, transition-related care would mitigate other serious and potentially costly conditions, such as suicidal thoughts, and might improve job performance.\n\nAcknowledging that the costs might be higher than he estimates, Belkin still says they would be too low to matter and shouldn\u2019t be a factor in deciding whether the ban is lifted or not.\n\nIn June, the American Medical Association said there is \u201cno medically valid reason\u201d to prohibit transgender individuals from serving in the military.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As the U.S. military studies the implications of lifting a ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces, a new study says that the cost of providing transition-related health care to those service members would be about $5.6 million a year, or \u201clittle more than a rounding error in the military's $47.8 billion annual health care budget.\u201d", "title": "Here\u2019s How Much It Would Cost the Military to Provide Transition Care to Transgender Troops", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Here-s-How-Much-It-Would-Cost-Military-Provide-Transition-Care-Transgender-Troops", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-pentagon-carter_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Here-s-How-Much-It-Would-Cost-Military-Provide-Transition-Care-Transgender-Troops", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-pentagon-carter_1.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As the U.S. military studies the implications of lifting a ban on transgender people serving in the armed forces, a new study says that the cost of providing transition-related health care to those service members would be about $5.6 million a year, or \u201clittle more than a rounding error in the military's $47.8 billion annual health care budget.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0149\"", "article_summary": "Among those, transition-related care would mitigate other serious and potentially costly conditions, such as suicidal thoughts, and might improve job performance.\nIn June, the American Medical Association said there is \u201cno medically valid reason\u201d to prohibit transgender individuals from serving in the military.\nAaron Belkin, the San Francisco State University researcher who conducted the survey, checked for accuracy using data from the Australian military, which already covers transition-related care, and compared costs with insurance plans offered to University of California employees and their dependents.\nBelkin emphasized that costs could be lower than expected for several reasons.\nIn last week\u2019s debate among Republican presidential candidates, former Arkansas Gov."}
