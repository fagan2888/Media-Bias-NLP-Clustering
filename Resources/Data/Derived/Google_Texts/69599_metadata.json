And we're focusing on some of the ways our world looks different, thanks to the changes to our health.\n\nIn health care policy, the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which insured 10 million people who didn't have health insurance, is certainly the most memorable addition of the past decade. Other noteworthy legislation includes indoor smoking bans, which started in California in the 1990s but spread across the country in the mid-aughts. Today, even clean outdoor air is considered a right in public parks and on beaches.\n\nOn the medical front, advances in minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery have reduced hospitals stays and mean less scarring and and less trauma for patients. Bionic limb technology has changed amputees' lives by replacing cumbersome prosthetics with sophisticated robotic limbs using microchips that mimic human reflexes. Medicinal marijuana also gained a foothold after decades of anti-drug sentiment, with states across the country legalizing medicinal cannabis. Research into the plant's potential benefits is currently underway.\n\nOur ability to understand our own fitness and exercise habits has increased exponentially with the advent of wearable technologies. Diets -- from South Beach to the Master Cleanse to the Zone to Macrobiotic to Paleo -- came and went. The best diet advice is still the same as it was 10 years ago: don't diet. (Instead, do as Michael Pollen does and \"Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.\") Health food advertisements have changed with the times. While the \"Got Milk?\" campaign reigned in 2005, today's trendiest superfood is the avocado, which even had its own Super Bowl commercial this year.\n\nHealth shifts have even happened in the corporate world. The 2008 financial crisis prompted many workers to reevaluate the all-consuming roles of money and power in their lives. Today, many companies are finding ways to incorporate employee wellness into the workplace, including in-office yoga and meditation classes, which studies show improve brain function and reduce anxiety.\n\nHere's a peek at what health looked like 10 years ago compared to today.\n\nThen: Going to a bar meant even nonsmokers got secondhand exposure\n\n\n\n(Photo credit, left: AP Photo/Chris Curry) (Photo credit, right: Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nNow: Widespread bans prohibit smoking in bars and restaurants\n\nThen: Federal authorities could seize medicinal marijuana and prosecute doctors for prescribing it\n\n\n\n(Photo credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Photo credit: Gilles Mingasson/Getty Images)\n\nNow: 23 states (and counting!) have legalized medical cannabis\n\nThen: Cutthroat Wall Street culture emphasized money and power\n\n\n\n(Photo credit: AP Photo/Richard Drew) (Photo credit: Damon Dahlen, Huffington Post)\n\nNow: Workplace yoga and meditation programs have replaced the three-martini lunch\n\nThen: Recording a workout involved a start and stop button\n\n\n\n(Photo credit: Wodicka/ullstein bild/Getty Images) (Photo credit: Getty Images)\n\nNow: Wearable fitness trackers can record steps, sleep quality and calorie intake\n\nThen: Low-tech prosthetics were heavy and painful\n\n\n\n(Photo credit: Getty Images) (Photo credit: Mary Turner/Getty Images)\n\nNow: Bionic limbs allow wearers to walk naturally by mimicking human motion\n\nThen: \"Got Milk?\" was the health food campaign plastered in every magazine\n\n\n\n(Photo credit: gotmilk.com) (Photo credit: YouTube)\n\nNow: 2015's health food darling, the avocado, scores a Super Bowl commercial", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Huffington Post turns 10 this week, and in honor of our anniversary, we're celebrating advancements in public and private health over the past decade...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-05-08 07:00:18 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The Huffington Post turns 10 this week, and in honor of our anniversary, we're celebrating advancements in public and private health over the past decade...", "title": "This Is What Our Health Looked Like Just 10 Years Ago", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/the-way-we-were_n_7205574.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2911614/images/o-WORKPLACE-YOGA-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2911614/images/o-WORKPLACE-YOGA-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The Huffington Post turns 10 this week, and in honor of our anniversary, we're celebrating advancements in public and private health over the past decade...", "site": "@HPLifestyle", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "This Is What Our Health Looked Like Just 10 Years Ago"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-05-07 07:00:18 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7205574", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "impact", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "healthy living,healthy living healthy news,mindfulness,medical marijuana,Smoking Ban,avocado,Affordable Care Act,obamacare,public health,bionic limbs,prosthetics,wearable technology,fitness trackers,Fitness Trends,nutrition,diet and nutrition,the next 10", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "tag": "healthy living,healthy living healthy news,mindfulness,medical marijuana,Smoking Ban,avocado,Affordable Care Act,obamacare,public health,bionic limbs,prosthetics,wearable technology,fitness trackers,Fitness Trends,nutrition,diet and nutrition,the next 10", "published_time": "2015-05-07 07:00:18 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-08-27 19:59:01 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf69f\"", "article_summary": "was the health food campaign plastered in every magazine(Photo credit: gotmilk.com) (Photo credit: YouTube)Now: 2015's health food darling, the avocado, scores a Super Bowl commercial\nHealth food advertisements have changed with the times.\nIn health care policy, the Affordable Care Act of 2010, which insured 10 million people who didn't have health insurance, is certainly the most memorable addition of the past decade.\nAnd we're focusing on some of the ways our world looks different, thanks to the changes to our health.\nThe Huffington Post turns 10 this week, and in honor of our anniversary, we're celebrating advancements in public and private health over the past decade."}
