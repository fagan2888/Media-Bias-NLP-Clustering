Colorado Republicans, who haven’t had that much to be merry about in the last decade, were all smiles at the Lincoln Club of Colorado’s holiday party Wednesday in Denver.

Among the festivities: raising money by auctioning off lunches with various folks, including the Senate’s two newest members, Republicans George Rivera of Pueblo and Bernie Herpin of Colorado Springs. They were elected when two Democratic senators were recalled in September for their gun votes. Former Congressman Bob Beauprez, who served as the auctioneer, won the bid for lunch with Rivera.

Lincoln Club President Mary Dambdam shelled out $200 for the winning bid for lunch with Jon Caldara, president of the Independence Institute.

“You got hosed,” I joked.

“I know,” Dambman said, with a laugh.

Attorney John Zakhem took high-dollar honors, spending $350 for lunch with Pueblo lawmaker Clarice Navarro-Ratzlaff, a rising star in the Republican Party.

Republicans are excited on several fronts, including the recall results. Recent polling shows the state’s top two Democrats — Gov. John Hickenlooper and U.S. Sen. Mark Udall, both up for re-election in 2014 — are struggling and “Obamacare” is making for negative headlines.
