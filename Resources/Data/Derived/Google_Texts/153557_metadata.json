Cambria represented Kane in 2009, when he pleaded guilty to a noncriminal charge of disorderly conduct after being accused of assaulting a Buffalo cab driver over 20 cents.\n\nCambria is a high-profile attorney who specializes in First Amendment issues. He has represented Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and music artists Marilyn Manson and DMX.\n\nThe developments come a day after Hamburg police confirmed Kane is under investigation for an \u201cincident that allegedly occurred\u201d at the player\u2019s offseason home in suburban Buffalo. Hamburg Police Chief Gregory Wickett did not discuss the nature of the investigation. He said police are gathering information and awaiting forensic tests.\n\nIn the meantime, Blackhawks spokesman Brandon Faber said Kane will skip the Stanley Cup celebration over Chicago\u2019s third title in six years. Kane had paraded the trophy around Buffalo the previous two times he hosted it. Now, with the investigation in place, that has changed.\n\nTentative plans had called for Kane to bring the Cup to Buffalo Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital for what was supposed to be a private visit. There also was to have been a celebration at a downtown bar.\n\nThough Kane is spending the day with his family, people were still hoping he might pop up with the Cup at some of his familiar spots.\n\nA handful of youngsters in Blackhawks shirts and hats camped out in front of Kane\u2019s favorite pizza place in his old neighborhood of south Buffalo. There are autographed Kane jerseys on the walls and a Blackhawks flag outside. Three off-duty Buffalo police officers were patrolling the parking lot before leaving early in the afternoon.\n\nIn Hamburg, several cars slowed or stopped to peek into the front yard of Kane\u2019s home overlooking Lake Erie. A police officer was parked in a black and white SUV across the street.\n\nKane, who wears No. 88, picked Saturday to host the Cup because it is the eighth day of the eighth month.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Patrick Kane of Blackhawks hires lawyer while under police investigation", "title": "Patrick Kane of Blackhawks hires lawyer while under police investigation", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/patrick-kane-of-blackhawks-hires-lawyer-while-under-police-investigation/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_095024_patrick-kane-1.jpg", "height": 443}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808_095024_patrick-kane-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T09:54:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T08:46:21+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In the meantime, Blackhawks spokesman Brandon Faber said Kane will skip the Stanley Cup celebration over Chicago\u2019s third title in six years.\nCambria represented Kane in 2009, when he pleaded guilty to a noncriminal charge of disorderly conduct after being accused of assaulting a Buffalo cab driver over 20 cents.\nThe developments come a day after Hamburg police confirmed Kane is under investigation for an \u201cincident that allegedly occurred\u201d at the player\u2019s offseason home in suburban Buffalo.\nWithout providing details, lawyer Paul Cambria confirmed in a text message to The Associated Press that he has been hired to represent Kane.\nTentative plans had called for Kane to bring the Cup to Buffalo Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital for what was supposed to be a private visit."}
