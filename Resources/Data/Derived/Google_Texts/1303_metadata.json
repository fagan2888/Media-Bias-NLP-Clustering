What is your main goal if you are elected: Reunite the town, provide property tax relief, build new sidewalks, pave dirt roads, and allow ordinary citizens to obtain services at Town Hall rather than travel to the county building at Northbridge.

Six candidates are running for the four seats: Mary Beth Berry, Leonard Blank, Garrett Milliken, Darren Troy Mullinax, Lyndy Palmer and Joshua Stokes.\n\nBerry, Blank and Mullinax currently hold Town Council seats.\n\nThe town's latest incorporation was in August 2012, and state law requires that it hold an election within two years of its incorporation.\n\nJames Island incorporated three times since the 1990s, but each of those efforts were squashed, largely due to lawsuits from the city of Charleston.\n\nCharleston and James Island town supporters have a long history of being at legal odds. All three previous attempts at incorporation were struck down after the city's challenges went to the S.C. Supreme Court.\n\nAfter the fourth attempt was passed by voters in April 2012, Riley announced the city would not seek to block it.\n\nOne of the strongest legal defenses that allowed the new town to survive was that the current version was drawn to be geographically contiguous. That meant the town had to shrink in size from earlier designs, omitting some neighborhoods such as Riverland Terrace.\n\nReach Diane Knich at 843-937-5491 or on Twitter at @dianeknich.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "James Island voters go to the polls Tuesday, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Bill Woolsey,Town of James Island,Trent Kernodle", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "James Island voters will decide Tuesday who they think will best serve the town as it deals with development, traffic and the impact of growth.", "title": "James Island voters go to the polls Tuesday", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20140727/140729552/james-island-voters-go-to-the-polls-tuesday", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140727/PC16/140729552/AR/0/AR-140729552.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140727/PC16/140729552/AR/0/AR-140729552.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "James Island voters will decide Tuesday who they think will best serve the town as it deals with development, traffic and the impact of growth.", "title": "James Island voters go to the polls Tuesday", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20140727/PC16/140729552/AR/0/AR-140729552.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 140729552}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "James Island voters go to the polls Tuesday , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nMetro, Bill Woolsey,Town of James Island,Trent Kernodle", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T06:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2014-07-25T17:00:00Z", "author": "Diane Knich"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "James Island voters will decide Tuesday who they think will best serve the town as it deals with development, traffic and the impact of growth."}, "article_summary": "Previous elected offices: Member of James Island Town Council, 2002-2004; Mayor of Town of James Island, 2010-2011 and 2012-2014.\nCharleston and James Island town supporters have a long history of being at legal odds.\nJames Island voters will decide Tuesday who they think will best serve the town as it deals with development, traffic and the impact of growth.\nIncumbent Bill Woolsey (left) is running for mayor of the Town of James Island against Trent Kernodle (right).\nJames Island incorporated three times since the 1990s, but each of those efforts were squashed, largely due to lawsuits from the city of Charleston."}
