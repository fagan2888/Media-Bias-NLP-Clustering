Like so many chancellors before him, the government\u2019s austerity champion has had to fend off plenty of accusations of double-counting, re-announcing and empty promises.\n\n\n\nRelated: George Osborne gets mixed economic news in week before budget\n\nSo what to make of the budget day pledges? The government insists progress has already been made. A spokesman said: \u201cThe government set out how it will spend \u00a34tn over the next five years, so obviously it is far too early to make any assessment of policy announcements for that period.\u201d\n\nWe take 18 announcements from the chancellor\u2019s autumn statement and spending review in November and look at what he has achieved so far.\n\nCutting the deficit\n\nWhat the Treasury said \u201cOver the next four years, the deficit will have been eliminated and the government will be running a surplus \u2013 raising more than is spent.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat has happened Based on the latest official figures on Britain\u2019s public finances, things are not looking great for this year. Against the backdrop of softer than expected economic growth, government receipts have disappointed and experts say the deficit for this financial year will probably overshoot the \u00a373.5bn forecast by fiscal watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n\nNew homes\n\nWhat the Treasury said By the end of the decade, 400,000 affordable new homes will be delivered, almost half of them starter homes sold at a 20% discount and 135,000 of them under the Help to Buy shared ownership programme.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened Some traditional affordable housing has been replaced by starter homes, but councils will not have to require them on developments until the housing bill is passed. The Help to Buy shared ownership programme launches in April.\n\nFunding social care\n\nWhat the Treasury said Councils will be able to add 2% on council tax to pay towards social care in their areas.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened Take-up has been fast but there are worries this change will raise households\u2019 council tax bills without doing much to plug a gap in social care funding. So far, 143 of the 152 councils that can introduce the 2% rise have approved it or are considering it, according to the Local Government Association (LGA). That will raise \u00a3372m to pay for social care services but 152 councils that provide social care will receive \u00a32.5bn less in revenue support grant funding from central government to run local services in 2016-17, the LGA says.\n\nEnterprise zones\n\nWhat the Treasury said \u00a312bn set aside for a local growth fund and 26 new or extended enterprise zones.\n\nWhat has happened The first 16 of the new and extended zones go live this April and the others start in April 2017. Business groups have welcomed the move to expand enterprise zones, which are hubs where companies can benefit from lower taxes and simpler planning rules. The hope is that they will see new companies and jobs spring up around England and help redress the long-standing problem of unbalanced growth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A nurse prepares medication in A&E at Royal Stoke University hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian\n\nNurses\n\nWhat the Treasury said The government will replace direct funding with loans for new student nurses so that it can abolish a \u201cself-defeating\u201d cap on training places and create up to 10,000 new training places in this parliament.\n\nWhat has happened The changes are due to come in for new students in August 2017. The public service trade union, Unison, is worried the shift from grants to loans will deter people from becoming nurses. Its general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: \u201cThis disastrous decision will mean nurses graduate in 2020 with over \u00a352,000 of debt.\u201d But the government says it needs to make the switch to loans to get more nurses and midwives into the NHS. The Department of Health is due to consult on how to implement the changes soon.\n\n\u00a3600m more for mental health services\n\nWhat the Treasury said \u00a3600m \u201cadditional funding\u201d was pledged for mental health services.\n\nWhat has happened The Mental Health Network, which represents NHS mental health trusts, notes that the \u00a3600m money was only due to be spent from the start of the new financial year starting in April. Stephen Dalton, its chief executive, says: \u201cThe \u00a3600m was never supposed to be for this year. It\u2019s wrapped up in the [recently published] mental health taskforce, which is a five-year programme.\u201d Unison says the \u00a3600m announced in November \u201csimply replaced money that had been slashed from mental health budgets in previous cuts.\u201d\n\nWelfare savings\n\n\n\nWhat the Treasury said The \u00a312bn of welfare savings committed to at the election \u201cwill be delivered in full\u201d.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened This goal seem optimistic, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Picking over the autumn statement, the thinktank noted that less than half of those savings would be delivered by 2017-18.\n\nMoney for roads\n\nWhat the Treasury said Transport capital spending will increase by 50% to a total of \u00a361bn and that will fund the \u201clargest road investment programme since the 1970s\u201d. There will be more than \u00a35bn spent on roads maintenance this parliament.\n\nWhat has happened Much of the \u00a361bn has been sucked into the additional costs of HS2, as well as another \u00a3700m to help Network Rail combat its overspend on electrification projects. A \u00a315bn road investment strategy, for maintenance, converting the hard shoulder of motorways and new roads, had already been announced in 2014.\n\n\n\nWhiplash claim crackdown\n\nWhat the Treasury said The government will reduce car insurance premiums by \u00a31bn by ending claims for injuries such as whiplash, projected to save an average of \u00a340-\u00a350 from bills annually.\n\nWhat has happened The government has been talking to representatives from the claimant and insurance sectors but has not yet started consultations on the changes. The fear is that it will be years before such changes bring down insurance premiums.\n\nThe motorists\u2019 group, the AA, is not getting its hopes up: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that it\u2019s taking time for new legislation to take effect but insurance companies could be expected to reflect the expected fall in small claims in lower premiums. That has yet to happen. The government is constantly playing catch-up with an industry that is finding ways to encourage people to make claims even when an injury hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nArts Council boost\n\nWhat the Treasury said The government is increasing the cash that will go to \u201cthe Arts Council, our national museums and galleries\u201d.\n\nWhat has happened After fearing dramatic cuts before the autumn statement, arts leaders and museum chiefs welcomed this unexpectedly good settlement for the sector. But there are fears that cuts to council budgets will continue to put pressures on the arts and museums as local authorities look for savings.\n\nTechnology investment for courts\n\n\n\nWhat the Treasury said Under-used courts will be closed and the money saved will be used to fund a \u00a3700m investment in new technology that will \u201cspeed up the process of justice\u201d.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened In February, the government announced the closure of 86 underused courts and tribunals in a move expected to raise \u00a340m to reinvest in the justice system. So iPad-wielding judges may be just round the corner.\n\nPrison closures and new modern prisons\n\nWhat the Treasury said Old Victorian prisons that are not suitable for rehabilitating prisoners will be sold and the government will spend more than \u00a31bn \u201cin this parliament\u201d building nine new modern prisons. Holloway prison \u2013 the biggest women\u2019s jail in western Europe \u2013 will close.\n\nWhat has happened The government wants to close Holloway by mid-2016 and is understood to be on track to build the nine new, modern prisons \u2013 five of which will open in this parliament. The Prison Reform Trust wants to see money raised from the Holloway sale being invested in community sentences and women\u2019s centres and \u201cnot just funnelled down the prison-building drain\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Apprentices at work in Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire. Photograph: Asadour Guzelian\n\nApprenticeship levy and raising the number of apprentices\n\nWhat the Treasury said The government had already said it wanted to create 3m new apprenticeships by 2020, funded by a levy on large employers. The apprenticeship levy launches in April 2017, at a rate of 0.5% of an employer\u2019s pay bill.\n\nWhat has happened: There has been encouraging news on the number of companies offering apprenticeships and the number of young people signing up for them. But there are worries among business groups that the new levy could prove to be counterproductive. The manufacturers\u2019 organisation, the EEF, says it is disappointed that the government has told businesses what they will need to pay into the scheme but not what they can get out of it and that could start to hamper recruitment plans and put the 3m target at risk. The CBI business group agrees. \u201cMany businesses are in the difficult position of having to reduce overall training or apprenticeship numbers to pay their levy,\u201d said Neil Carberry, CBI director for employment and skills.\n\nAdditional clampdown on tax avoidance\n\nWhat the Treasury said: There will be a fresh clampdown on disguised remuneration schemes, stamp duty avoidance and the abuse of the intangible fixed-assets regime and capital allowances.\n\nWhat has happened: Hardly a budget goes by without new tax avoidance measures being announced and it remains to be seen what impact these latest changes will have. As Simon Wilks, tax partner at PwC, points out: \u201cYou\u2019d be forgiven for believing avoidance and evasion has exploded in recent years when the reverse is true. Even without these measures, avoidance was on the wane.\u201d Economists caution such crackdowns are unlikely to rake in big money for the exchequer.\n\nHousing associations and right to buy\n\nWhat the Treasury said: Right to buy was extended to housing association tenants, beginning with an immediate pilot scheme.\n\nWhat has happened: Tenants of five associations have been able to register interest and apply, but no one will be able to buy until the housing bill gets royal assent later this year.\n\n\n\nLondon homebuyer loans\n\nWhat the Treasury said: A new Help to Buy equity loan scheme for London would let buyers in the capital borrow up to 40% of the purchase price of a new build home.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened: The high price of London property has led to a rush of interest in the scheme, which launched at the start of February. The government said it expected 10,000 households to be helped; so far, more than 50,000 people have expressed interest and more than 300 homes have been reserved.\n\n\n\nAid\n\nWhat the Treasury said: Aid funding will continue to be protected, including a new \u00a31bn global vaccine fund to speed up the development of drugs to eliminate the world\u2019s deadliest infectious diseases.\n\n\n\nWhat has happened: This is an area where there has been clear progress. The \u00a31bn Ross Fund - named after Sir Ronald Ross, the first British Nobel Laureate who was recognised for his discovery that mosquitoes transmit malaria - has been set up and the government set out in January how the money would be shared out.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A road closed due to flooding near Endmoor. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\n\nFlood defences\n\nWhat the Treasury said: By 2021, 300,000 homes will be better protected from flooding, with \u00a32.3bn for more than 1,500 flood defence schemes across the country\n\nWhat has happened: Following December\u2019s floods, when about 16,000 properties were flooded during the wettest December in a century, the government has made about \u00a3200m available to help those affected. The \u00a32.3bn announced at the autumn statement will be invested over the next six years, but Labour has questioned whether is will be enough, saying that the government \u201cunderestimated the climate change risk\u201d.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "description": "The chancellor made many promises in his autumn statement and spending review in November \u2013 but how many has been able to keep?", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Hilary Osborne", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "The chancellor made many promises in his autumn statement and spending review in November \u2013 but how many has been able to keep?", "title": "George Osborne's November pledges: how far has he got?", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/13/george-osbornes-november-pledges-how-far-has-he-got", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6b011ccf006082fdd4c4f256d291d55ee7ac7c/0_56_3915_2349/master/3915.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=7ea2a9c0a3ebfa0f4ce032f0a23501ae", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2016/mar/13/george-osbornes-november-pledges-how-far-has-he-got?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/13/george-osbornes-november-pledges-how-far-has-he-got", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2016/mar/13/george-osbornes-november-pledges-how-far-has-he-got?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/7f6b011ccf006082fdd4c4f256d291d55ee7ac7c/0_56_3915_2349/master/3915.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2016/mar/13/george-osbornes-november-pledges-how-far-has-he-got?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Budget 2016,Budget,Politics,George Osborne,Economics,Public finance,Business,Budget deficit,UK news,Economic policy,Society,Flooding,Aid,Property,Money,Tax avoidance,Apprenticeships,Prisons and probation,Arts funding,Road transport,Welfare,Mental health,Health,Social care,Housing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-03-13T09:00:43.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katieallen,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwyntopham,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/deniscampbell,https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hilaryosborne", "section": "UK news", "modified_time": "2016-05-07T14:12:43.000Z", "tag": "Budget 2016,Budget,Politics,George Osborne,Economics,Public finance,Business,Budget deficit,UK news,Economic policy,Society,Flooding,Aid,Property,Money,Tax avoidance,Apprenticeships,Prisons and probation,Arts funding,Road transport,Welfare,Mental health,Health,Social care,Housing"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f6b011ccf006082fdd4c4f256d291d55ee7ac7c/0_56_3915_2349/3915.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=c7115c09656a8c633a9e09d289706b89", "theme-color": "#005689", "news_keywords": "Budget 2016,Budget,Politics,George Osborne,Economics,Public finance,Business,Budget deficit,UK news,Economic policy"}, "article_summary": "\u00a3600m more for mental health servicesWhat the Treasury said \u00a3600m \u201cadditional funding\u201d was pledged for mental health services.\nRelated: George Osborne gets mixed economic news in week before budgetSo what to make of the budget day pledges?\nAs George Osborne puts the finishing touches to his budget, voters may well be bracing themselves for yet another smoke-and-mirrors performance.\nFunding social careWhat the Treasury said Councils will be able to add 2% on council tax to pay towards social care in their areas.\nWhat has happened The Mental Health Network, which represents NHS mental health trusts, notes that the \u00a3600m money was only due to be spent from the start of the new financial year starting in April."}
