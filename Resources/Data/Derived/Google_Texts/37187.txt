Tens of thousands of mental health patients in Alabama will have to look for new medical care on Friday when Alabama Psychiatric Services closes its doors.

ASP has more than a dozen inpatient and outpatient facilities around the state. With less than one week notice, the company announced it will close its doors because of failed negotiations with the health insurance company Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama.
