Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nIntelligence cannot be directly observed, but yet we still judge how smart someone may be within moments of meeting. While you may think the best way to make a good impression is through witty, enthralling speech, a recent study has found evidence to suggest your intelligence is best conveyed not in what you say but in how you say it.\n\nFor the study, which is currently published in the Journal Psychological Science, a team of researchers from the University of Chicago videotaped MBA students while they were giving pitches. They then had prospective employers or professional recruiters either watch the video, listen to an audio of the speech, or simply read a transcript. Results showed the voice of the students had the biggest influence in whether or not they were hired, and adding video to the audio did not at all affect the students' evaluations.\n\n\u201cWhat they show is that your intelligence is not necessarily something I can see on your body, but I think it\u2019s a cue that we can pick up or hear in your voice,\u201d explained Nicholas Epley, one of the researchers involved in the study, as reported by Time.\n\nEpley recommends that we can use this data to our benefit, especially when it comes to trying to win over the favor of others and make a good first impression. According to Epley, although most of us may not want to speak out for the fear of appearing stupid, it\u2019s actually the opposite that rings true. He recommends that in contexts such as a job interview, if you ever have the opportunity to speak to someone directly, take it.\n\n\u201cFor conveying one\u2019s intellect, it is important that one\u2019s voice, quite literally, be heard,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nThis link between perceived intelligence and vocal pitch may have even bigger implications in how we understand human social interactions, especially in the new online setting.\n\nThanks to advances in technology, more and more human interactions take place in written form rather than verbal. That lack of verbal interaction has disturbed natural ways in which we socialize and has made it harder to judge the intelligence level of strangers. It may also explain why we treat strangers online differently than we do in person.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any accident that people online seem to treat each other as mindless idiots,\u201d Epley said.\n\nSource: Scroader J, Epley N.
