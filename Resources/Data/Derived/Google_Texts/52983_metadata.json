PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) - Nick Martinez saw his chance to win his major league debut slip away late in the game.\n\nMartinez allowed three runs and four hits over six innings in the Texas Rangers 5-4 loss Saturday night to the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\n\u201cNick gave us a chance,\u201d Texas manager Ron Washington said. \u201cHe was getting ahead of hitters. He changed speeds. He made a couple mistakes that did get out of the ballpark, but when he left the ballgame he still gave us the lead.\u201d\n\nMartinez ended up with a no-decision.\n\nJames Loney hit a go-ahead, two-run double in the eighth inning off Neal Cotts (0-1) that put Tampa Bay ahead 5-4. His opposite-field drive that went over left fielder Shin-Soo Choo came after Evan Longoria was intentionally walked to put the potential tying and go-ahead runs on base.\n\n\u201cI was actually (surprised),\u201d Loney said of the walk to Longoria. \u201cThey had a one-run lead, but people like to do that now.\u201d\n\nBrandon Gomes (1-0) pitched a perfect eighth before Grant Balfour got the final three outs for his first save.\n\nYunel Escobar and Matt Joyce homered off Martinez.\n\n\u201cI need to learn to limit my mistakes,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cI made a couple mistakes I wish I could have back, but just kept learning as I went along.\u201d\n\nDavid Price, who was sick Friday and almost didn\u2019t pitch, gave up four runs and nine hits in six innings for the Rays.\n\n\u201cFeel better since we won,\u201d Price said.\n\nAlex Rios put the Rangers up 2-0 with a two-out, two-run double in the first off Price. Rios has 12 hits in 30 at-bats with 10 RBIs against the Rays left-hander.\n\nElvis Andrus made it 3-0 on a second-inning RBI single before Escobar pulled Tampa Bay within two on a solo homer in third.\n\nIt was announced before the game that Escobar and the Rays had agreed to a two-year extension for 2015 and 2016 worth a guaranteed $13 million. There is a 2017 club option.\n\nAfter Choo had a sacrifice fly in the fourth, Joyce cut the Rays deficit to 4-3 with a two-run homer in the bottom half.\n\nRays manager Joe Maddon had a successful challenge for the second straight game. It was first ruled that Robinson Chirinos had beat Escobar\u2019s throw from shortstop to first for an infield single in the second, but after a 1-minute, 35-second delay the umpires changed the call to an out.\n\nMaddon won his first replay reversal in the seventh Friday night after it was first ruled that right fielder Wil Myers didn\u2019t make the catch while sliding forward on J.P. Arencibia\u2019s two-out flare. After a 1-minute, 43-second delay, the umpires ruled Myers did make the catch.\n\n\u201cThe umpires have done a great job with it,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cIt seems to be working well.\u201d\n\nNotes: Rangers ace Yu Darvish (neck stiffness) could throw up to 100 pitches in his first start this season Sunday. Alex Cobb (0-1) will pitch for the Rays. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun stuff,\u201d Maddon said. \u201cIt\u2019s a marquee matchup.\u201d \u2026 Texas 2B Jurickson Profar (right shoulder muscle tear) is fielding grounders, but no date has been set to swing a bat. \u2026 Rangers LHP Joe Saunders (bruised left ankle) played catch and will have his status determined by Monday. \u2026 Martinez had his contract purchased from Double-A Frisco. \u2026 Texas RHP Daniel McCutchen was optioned to Frisco.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nick Martinez saw his chance to win his major league debut slip away late in the game.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Nick Martinez saw his chance to win his major league debut slip away late in the game.", "title": "Martinez denied 1st win, Rangers lose 5-4 to Rays", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/5/martinez-denied-1st-win-rangers-lose-5-4-to-rays/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/05/716f9e8684c4880d500f6a706700fbeb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/05/716f9e8684c4880d500f6a706700fbeb.jpg", "description": "Nick Martinez saw his chance to win his major league debut slip away late in the game.", "card": "summary", "title": "Martinez denied 1st win, Rangers lose 5-4 to Rays"}, "Author": "MARK DIDTLER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Nick Martinez, Texas Rangers, Ron Washington, Yunel Escobar"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8314\"", "article_summary": "Martinez allowed three runs and four hits over six innings in the Texas Rangers 5-4 loss Saturday night to the Tampa Bay Rays.\nAfter a 1-minute, 43-second delay, the umpires ruled Myers did make the catch.\nST.
