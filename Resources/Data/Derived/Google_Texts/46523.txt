Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.2% from a year ago, the fastest annual rise since June 2012, the Labor Department said.

Overall prices were unchanged for the month and up 1.4% from a year ago. Energy costs slid 2.8% for a second straight month, but the yearly decline slowed to 6.5% vs. 12.6% in December and 18.4% in September, as comparisons get tougher.

Core prices were driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing, including lodging away from home.

Health insurance costs rose 1.1% for the month and 4.8% from a year ago — the biggest increase since April 2013, before the ObamaCare exchanges were launched. Although subsidies help reduce the prices, inflation measures take into account the added government costs as well. Despite rising premiums, UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have warned of losses in the exchanges, with UnitedHealth the most explicit about possibly exiting the market if conditions don’t improve.

The cost of medical care rose 0.5% in January, bringing the yearly increase to 3%, tied for the highest since early 2013. Prescription drug companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD)and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have been under fire for high costs, but the annual rise in prescription costs has decelerated to 3% from 6.4% at the end of 2014.

The cost of medical service rose 0.5% for the month and 3.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual rise since April 2013.

Rent of primary residence rose 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year ago, matching December’s annual gain for the biggest since June 2008.

Lodging away from home, which sees volatile swings from month to month, rose 2% in January and 3.1% for the year.

All items excluding food, shelter and energy still were up a more moderate 1.5% from a year ago.

The core inflation rate has risen above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. But the Fed pays more attention to another price gauge, the core PCE deflator, which has shown little pickup in recent months.

UnitedHealth shares fell fractionally on the stock market today in morning trade. Aetna, Humana and Gilead Sciences fell 1.3%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals tumbled 7.6% after Wells Fargo downgraded the drugmaker, saying there are “too many questions.”
