After all, it\u2019s incredibly convenient to have a car available after a night out with friends \u2014 no need for public transportation or wasting money on a cab. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK to drive drunk; an estimated 32 percent of all fatal car crashes in the U.S. involve an intoxicated driver. But what about when it comes to driving under the influence of marijuana?\n\nTwo new studies from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have found driving while high on weed could be far safer than driving while intoxicated, even if neither should be done. Specifically, one study found drunk drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 (the legal limit) were 400 percent more likely to crash their cars than sober drivers. Their high-on-weed counterparts, meanwhile, were only about 25 percent more likely to crash a car. That risk went down even further, though, when accounting for age, gender, and race, putting risk of a crash at around five percent.\n\nThe researchers suggested the drastic drop in crash risk among pot users could be attributed to the way these demographic factors affected their capacity to operate a vehicle. \u201cFor example, if the THC-positive drivers were predominantly young males, their apparent crash risk may have been related to age and gender rather than use of THC,\u201d they wrote. Likewise, THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive ingredient in weed, can be found in the body, stored in fat cells, for weeks after its effects have worn off. \u201cCaution should be exercised in assuming that drug presence implies driver impairment. Drug tests do not necessarily indicate current impairment.\u201d\n\nEssentially, it all comes down to a likeliness that driving while high is safer, but it\u2019s really unclear. \u201cAt the current time, specific drug concentration levels cannot be reliably equated with a specific degree of driver impairment,\u201d the researchers wrote in the other study. This is due to a lot of reasons besides those mentioned above. For one, the way marijuana is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized in the body varies with each person.\n\nThe researchers noted sensitivity and tolerance to the drug also varies between each person \u2014 a finding supported by a 2012 study. Published in the journal Psychopharmacology, it found only 30 percent of people under the influence of marijuana failed a field sobriety test, which police officers give to potentially intoxicated drivers, and includes following a pen with your eyes while the officer moves back and forth; walking nine steps back and forth, heel to toe; and standing on one leg for 30 seconds. The test\u2019s ability to spot a stoned driver really depended on how comfortable to being high that person was.\n\nEven if driving while high is eventually proven to be safer, that doesn\u2019t mean doing it is OK. Marijuana\u2019s been shown to impair both the way a person handles a car and how fast they react to sudden situations \u2014 a detriment when it comes to defensive driving. This effect can last up to three hours, according to the NHTSA. Speaking to KUSA-TV, Colorado State Representative Don Pabon said, \u201cDeciding between using marijuana before getting behind the wheel and using alcohol before getting behind the wheel, they\u2019re both bad ideas.\u201d Crashing a car, regardless of whether you\u2019re sober or not, affects not only those who are hurt, but they\u2019re friends and family as well, so why take the risk?\n\nSource: Berning A, Compton R, Wochinger K.
