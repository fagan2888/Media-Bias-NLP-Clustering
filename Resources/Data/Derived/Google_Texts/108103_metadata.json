Costs are likely to keep rising as Maryland figures out how to fix or replace the system.\n\nCosts were outlined Thursday in a routine budget review presented to state lawmakers after months of outrage and political finger-pointing over the health-exchange debacle. Hopes of developing a site that would be a model for the nation have melted away as the exchange has become a major embarrassment for Democratic Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown.\n\nThe review of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, by the legislature\u2019s budget analysts, found that state spending on the site has exceeded expectations. The report says the state is seeking to tap $30 million from the federal government that was not to be allocated until later. Also, the rate of spending is unlikely to taper off next year, as planned, because of the problems.\n\n\u201cAt this time, it is impossible to know if the funding\u201d Maryland has appropriated and proposed for the health exchange \u201cwill be adequate to achieve what needs to be done,\u201d the report concludes.\n\nRead the report See the Maryland report from state budget officials. Read it.\n\nMaryland\u2019s decision to build the complex online exchange on a tight deadline was a \u201chigh-risk undertaking\u201d from the outset, budget officials wrote in their report. Maryland made the process more challenging by trying to add features \u2014 like a Medicaid renewal function \u2014 to the health insurance marketplace.\n\nThe report warns against overreaching and dallying as the state searches for solutions.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re shooting in the dark,\u201d Del. Adelaide C. Eckardt (R-Dorchester) said during a budget hearing Wednesday in Annapolis. \u201cAll that I see is more and more money being put into something when we don\u2019t have a definite plan.\u201d A second hearing was held Thursday.\n\nJoshua M. Sharfstein, Maryland\u2019s secretary of health and mental hygiene, tried to reassure lawmakers that the situation is getting better. Five months after the launch of the site, he said, state officials are in a position to evaluate the options.\n\nSharfstein said Eckardt\u2019s \u201cshooting in the dark\u201d reference was once accurate. But, he said, \u201cthe lights are on. . . . We can use actual information about how different systems are doing in order to inform this decision.\u201d\n\nAmong the system\u2019s problems, according to health officials, it cannot identify Medicaid recipients who should be removed from the rolls because their income has increased.\n\nTo avoid dropping people incorrectly from the program, Maryland received a six-month extension to confirm the eligibility of recipients. Budget officials say the delay is expected to cost Maryland $17.8 million in unnecessary payments this fiscal year and $12.7 million in fiscal 2015, which begins in July.\n\nThe site has also been problematic for Medicaid applicants, who have struggled with \u201cincorrect eligibility determinations, stuck cases, difficulties in choosing managed care organizations, as well as with sending enrollment data\u201d to the federal Medicaid hub, according to the budget report.\n\nBecause of the challenges posed by the new health system, the federal government, which shares Medicaid costs with the states, had offered them all a three-month grace period beyond the deadline for confirming the eligibility of existing Medicaid recipients.\n\nMaryland officials asked for twice as much time.\n\nO\u2019Malley was an early and enthusiastic supporter of the Affordable Care Act, legislation championed by President Obama. The governor wanted Maryland to be among the states building their own health insurance exchanges \u2014 14 have done so \u2014 rather than relying on the federal site.\n\nDespite high goals and expectations, however, the site has been beset by flaws that have hindered thousands of Marylanders seeking coverage. The exchange\u2019s governing board this week fired Noridian Healthcare Solutions, the lead contractor, and state officials have said they reserve the right to sue or penalize Noridian and other firms that worked on the project.\n\nThe report says officials must decide quickly what to do about the broken health exchange and have five options: Fix the system; develop a new one; adopt technology that was successful in Connecticut, Kentucky or other states; join a multistate consortium; or use the federal marketplace.\n\nState lawmakers have said health officials are leaning toward adopting another state\u2019s technology or joining a consortium.\n\nBut those options \u201cdo not appear to specifically address\u201d the need to quickly verify the income of existing Medicaid recipients, according to the report, which was prepared by Maryland\u2019s Department of Legislative Services, a nonpartisan agency that advises the General Assembly on policy and budget decisions.\n\nIn addition, adopting Connecticut\u2019s technology, for instance, would \u201clikely take at least 9 to 12 months,\u201d the report says. That means the exchange might not be working well in time for the next open enrollment period for buying health coverage, which starts Nov. 15.\n\nMedicaid enrollment is always open.\n\n\u201cNot having a solid back-up plan could lead to a similar situation faced by the State in October,\u201d the report states, referring to the Oct. 1 debut of the Maryland site, which crashed almost immediately.\n\nThe exchange was supposed to be completely built and functioning by the end of June, which would have shrunk the project\u2019s budget substantially. The need to overhaul or replace the system upends that plan.\n\nMaryland has received $182.2 million from the federal government to pay for the exchange, and those funds are suppose to cover expenses through the end of the year. Exchange officials recently asked state lawmakers for permission to use more than $30 million that was not supposed to be available until later. The money might be needed to make repairs to the exchange in the spring, officials said.\n\nIt is likely that Maryland will ask the federal government for more money, budget officials wrote in the report. The state might also try to redirect money that was intended to pay Noridian to help cover the costs of improving the system. Noridian has submitted invoices for $12.6 million more than what it has been paid.\n\nSharfstein told lawmakers that the state is working closely with federal health officials, who are \u201cvery aware of the challenges\u201d Maryland faces.\n\n\u201cWe are sharing our plans with them,\u201d Sharfstein said, \u201cand they have basically said that if what we are doing is sensible and necessary for the exchange, that they will do their best to continue to fund us.\n\n\u201cThe key thing that this hinges on is the decision about which direction we go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State\u2019s health exchange cannot verify whether existing Medicaid recipients earn too much to remain in program.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "State\u2019s health exchange cannot verify whether existing Medicaid recipients earn too much to remain in program.", "title": "Major flaw in Maryland health site may mean $30 million in unnecessary Medicaid payments", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/major-flaw-in-md-health-site-may-mean-30-million-in-unnecessary-medicaid-payments/2014/02/27/4092eb06-9f2f-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/02/27/Local-Politics/Images/Republicans_Health_Care-09dfb-529.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marypatflaherty"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "mdpolitics, maryland health care exchange, maryland exchange, noridian, medicaid, maryland health insurance, martin omalley, president obama, obamacare, josh sharfstein, medicaid redeterminations, medicaid eligibility", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/wpjennajohnson"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4092eb06-9f2f-11e3-a050-dc3322a94fa7", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "mdpolitics, maryland health care exchange, maryland exchange, noridian, medicaid, maryland health insurance, martin omalley, president obama, obamacare, josh sharfstein, medicaid redeterminations, medicaid eligibility"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0eb2\"", "article_summary": "Read the report See the Maryland report from state budget officials.\nFive months after the launch of the site, he said, state officials are in a position to evaluate the options.\nSharfstein told lawmakers that the state is working closely with federal health officials, who are \u201cvery aware of the challenges\u201d Maryland faces.\nThe review of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, by the legislature\u2019s budget analysts, found that state spending on the site has exceeded expectations.\nBudget officials say the delay is expected to cost Maryland $17.8 million in unnecessary payments this fiscal year and $12.7 million in fiscal 2015, which begins in July."}
