A taste:\n\nNot everything is about race in this country. But when it is about race, then it just is. So when a guy who has been depicted wearing a jacket featuring an apartheid-era Rhodesian flag allegedly walks into a historic black church and guns down nine African-American worshipers at a Bible study meeting, common sense leads one to believe his motivations are based in racism. When a survivor of the ordeal reports that the killer shouted before opening fire, \u201cYou rape our women and you\u2019re taking over our country. And you have to go\u201d \u2014 well, that sounds to me a lot like racial hatred. Let\u2019s call this sickness what it is, so we can get on with the healing. If this were a medical disease, and all the doctors recognized the symptoms but refused to make the diagnosis for fear of offending the patient, we could call it madness. But there are people who are claiming that they can lead this country who dare not call this tragedy an act of racism, a hate crime, for fear of offending a particular segment of the electorate.\n\nSo when we sat down on Tuesday, within the cool confines of the Atlanta Athletic Club in Johns Creek, the topic hung like a slow curve:\n\nInsider: Are you happy with how Republicans have dealt with the Charleston issue since last week?\n\nCarson: I\u2019m glad to see that the people at the state level \u2013 the legislators and the governor, who really should be dealing with it \u2013 are dealing with it. I\u2019m very pleased to see that.\n\nInsider: In your op-ed piece, were you chastising those who refused to call the murders a racist act?\n\nCarson: Not really. Some people have characterized it as chastisement, because they want to create controversy. Basically, what I\u2019m saying is that you can put up Confederate flags everywhere or get rid of them. But that\u2019s not the essential issue.\n\nThe essential issue is, where are people\u2019s hearts and minds? That\u2019s what we really should be working on. We have a tendency to grab symbols do symbolic things and think that we\u2019ve solved the problem. And we really haven\u2019t.\n\nInsider: Where do we go from here? How do we change hearts and minds?\n\nCarson: First of all, we have to have open discussions about it, and recognize there\u2019s always more than one point of view. There are a lot of people in our society who are very uncomfortable with symbols associated with slavery. There are other people in our society who lost family members and important parts of their heritage in the Civil War. And they like to commemorate that\u2026.\n\nThe way that we solve [the conflict] is not \u2018my way or the highway.\u2019 That results in somebody winning and somebody having a great deal of animosity. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to sit down with both sides, with both points of view and see if you can reach an accommodation? That always makes more sense.\n\nInsider: You grew up in Detroit. I can\u2019t expect that you had a whole lot of interchange with Confederate symbolism.\n\nCarson: I\u2019ve had interchanges with very racist people.\n\nInsider: I don\u2019t doubt that. But when did you get your first dose of the Confederacy?\n\nCarson: Probably on a visit to Tennessee. Which is the first time I saw colored and white drinking fountains.\n\nInsider: How old were you?\n\nCarson: Six.\n\nInsider: Which part of Tennessee?\n\nCarson: Chattanooga.\n\n***\n\nInsider: Where is your strength at this point? Is your strength domestic policy? Have you been able to bone up enough on foreign policy?\n\nCarson: I\u2019m very comfortable with either one. I\u2019ve done a lot of boning up.\n\nInsider: How do you study to be a presidential candidate? Is it like med school?\n\nCarson: No, there\u2019s not that much. Not nearly that much. But you go to the major topics of the day, and you read up on them and you talk to a bunch of people who are experts in those areas. And you ask them what do they think you need to know.\n\n***\n\nInsider: If the U.S. Supreme Court cuts off Obamacare premium subsidies in states like Georgia that don\u2019t have their own exchanges, what is your message going to be?\n\nCarson: My message is that obviously, the 9.8 million people who would be affected in the exchanges \u2013 we can\u2019t allow them to fall through the safety net. There needs to be a stopgap measure. But the big message is to Congress, that they need to come up with an alternative. They need to come up with it in the relatively near future.\n\nObviously, it would be best if [Republicans and President Barack Obama] worked in harmony, as opposed to as enemies. Because we need to take health care out of the political arena\u2026.\n\nThe reason that I\u2019m not a big fan of the so-called Affordable Care Act is not because it doesn\u2019t work and because it\u2019s not affordable, but because it fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the government\u2026.\n\nInsider: Has Obamacare had any success in any area?\n\nCarson: Certainly there are some people who did not have insurance who have gotten insurance. And I think that\u2019s a good thing. But the system that I proposed would also propose insurance for those people. Much better insurance\u2026.\n\nInsider: What happens if the Supreme Court upholds the Affordable Care Act. Where would you suggest Republicans go?\n\nCarson: I would suggest that they still should put forth an alternative. And they should work on removing the mandates.\n\n***\n\nInsider: Are you still not talking about gay marriage?\n\nCarson: Other than what I\u2019ve said about it, and I think that the Constitution protects everybody, but it doesn\u2019t give anybody extra rights to change everything for everybody else\u2026.\n\nWhy not just have a situation where you live and let live? Anybody \u2013 I don\u2019t care what their sexual orientation is, but if they\u2019re adults and they want to have a relationship that\u2019s legalized, that allows them hospital visitation, property rights \u2013 that can easily be done with a legal document.\n\nInsider: That gets back to civil unions. When Georgia passed its constitutional ban in 2004, we didn\u2019t stop with gay marriage. We outlawed civil unions as well. Did opponents of gay marriage make a mistake there?\n\nCarson: I probably wouldn\u2019t have done that. I wouldn\u2019t have put it in a sexual context. I would have said any two adults who want to have a legalized relationship, can do so. End of story. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything sexual at all\u2026.\n\n***\n\nInsider: I was talking to my dentist about you yesterday. He wanted to know how what you learn about brain surgery translates to what you do as a presidential candidate. Where is the overlap?\n\nCarson: The overlap is that you learn how to do very complex things. You learn how to put together teams of people to create a vision. Some of them know things that you don\u2019t know, but you learn how to make it all work together.\n\nIt\u2019s really about how you get things done, rather than how much time have you spent in politics. Because there are a lot of people who have spent a lifetime in politics and haven\u2019t gotten anything done.\n\n***\n\nInsider: I\u2019ve met plenty of presidential candidates, but I\u2019ve never met anyone with a softer voice than you.\n\nCarson: I used to have a horrible temper. I was very outrageous at one point.\n\nInsider: You are probably the calmest presidential candidate I have every run across.\n\nCarson: That doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have a backbone, though. Some people mistake that soft-spokenness for lack of will. And it\u2019s definitely not true.
