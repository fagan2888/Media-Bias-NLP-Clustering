He struck out eight that game, his previous career high.\n\nRoark said the key was throwing first-pitch strikes.\n\n\u201cThat really gets a hitter on his heels and gives you confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t try to strike guys out. I just try to make quality pitches. Strikeouts happen. Today everything was working.\u201d\n\nSaid manager Matt Williams: \u201cHe\u2019s just been pitching like that for us all year. He just continues to pound the zone, all of his pitches. Pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals won their fourth straight and for the sixth time in seven games.\n\n\u201cSame thing he showed over in Washington,\u201d Padres manager Bud Black said of Roark. \u201cMixed his pitches, changed his speeds, commanded his fastball a little bit different than in his start in Washington. In Washington, he used his curveballs, more changeups.\u201d\n\nSan Diego has just 15 hits in five games. On Wednesday, Everth Cabrera bunted for a single in the first inning for San Diego\u2019s only hit in a 3-2 victory against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep going through it,\u201d Black said. \u201cYou have to keep your nose to the grindstone and keep working. There is no magic formula to this. You keep working, you keep busting your butt in the cage, you keep watching video, you keep your confidence, you keep telling yourself you\u2019re going to have good at-bats, you stay together as a team, you hang in there in the hopes that it will turn.\u201d\n\nPadres starter Tyson Ross (6-5) had a bad night. He walked Washington\u2019s Denard Span to open the game and then allowed Rendon\u2019s homer to left field, his ninth.\n\nRendon, the third baseman, came out after grounding out in the sixth. He was struck in the right hand trying to field Carlos Quentin\u2019s smash in the fourth inning and committed a throwing error. He committed a fielding error the next inning. Williams said X-rays were negative.\n\nRoss was chased during a nightmarish four-run sixth inning in which he had a throwing error, wild pitch, walked two, hit a batter and allowed two hits. Ross allowed an RBI double to Wilson Ramos that bounced over the fence in right-center and then walked Ian Desmond to load the bases. Ross hit Danny Espinosa on the left knee to force in a run and Nate McClouth hit a two-run single to right to end Ross\u2019 night.\n\nRoss allowed six runs, five earned, on five hits in 5 1-3 innings. He struck out seven and walked three.\n\nNOTES: The Padres placed 2B Jedd Gyorko on the 15-day disabled list with plantar fasciitis in his left foot, retroactive to Wednesday. Gyorko has struggled after signing a $35 million, six-year contract extension in April. He\u2019s hitting just .162. Manager Bud Black says Gyorko had an anti-inflammatory shot, will use a walking boot and will wear a strap when he sleeps to keep the arch stretched out. \u2026 LHP Eric Stults was activated from the bereavement list. He\u2019s scheduled to start Sunday. \u2026 The Padres will make two more roster moves Saturday, when RHP Andrew Cashner (2-5, 2.35) is due to be activated from the disabled list and start against the Nationals. He\u2019s been out with a sore elbow. \u2026 The Nationals will counter Saturday night with Blake Treinen (0-2, 1.40).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roark (4-4) beat the Padres 4-0 at Washington on April 26th, throwing a three-hitter for his first career shutout.
