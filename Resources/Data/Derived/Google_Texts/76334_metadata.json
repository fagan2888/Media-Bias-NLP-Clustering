Whose turn is it?'\" says Spaulding. \"Business as usual, more of the same. People complain about (the US Supreme Court decision) Citizens United but we raise more money than Republicans. Kay Hagan raised more money than Thom Tillis and she lost. We can have the same thing (in the governor's race) unless we bring in a fresh approach to politics where we're able to appeal to the unaffiliated and independent voters who are just sick and tired of this mess that we've had in North Carolina -- they've left the Democratic Party in droves, they've left the Republican Party in droves.\"\n\nSpaulding believes the state made a major mistake in not accepting the expansion of Medicaid that President Obama thought all states would, once the Affordable Care Act became law. He also favors the bond referendum on the ballot during the primary -- though he thinks it doesn't go far enough. Spaulding believes now is the time to not only build rebuild the state's universities and some cities basic infrastructure but that we should have a roads element to the bond issue, as well.\n\nSpaulding graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C., and got his law degree from UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\nSee him talk with Bob Buckley on the major issues in this report and find more at kenspaulding.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "For Ken Spaulding, it's simple. \"North Carolina needs a change,\" he insists, and Spaulding thinks he's just the man to do it.
