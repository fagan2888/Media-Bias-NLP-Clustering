An Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper involved in an excessive force investigation in 2009 is again in the spotlight - this time for allegedly showing an inappropriate photo to another trooper.

State Trooper Daniel Martin has been released from a special assignment at the Cadet Lawman Academy pending the results of an investigation, according to Captain George Brown of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. He is regularly assigned to Troop D which is headquartered in McAlester, Brown said.

A new complaint against Martin alleges that he showed an "inappropriate adult photo - not of himself - to a fellow trooper," Brown said in a news release.

The alleged incident took place in the first few days of the Cadet Lawman Academy, the release states.

"The incident was reported to Academy staff, who decided since Trooper Martin's son was attending the academy, it would be best to release Trooper Martin from this special assignment. The finalization of the incident is pending," Brown said.

He stressed that the matter was between peers only, and "at no time was Trooper Martin ever accused of any type of sexual misconduct with any teen attending the Cadet Lawman Academy. There have been no allegations of physical contact or direct inappropriate behavior between Trooper Martin and attending members of the Cadet Lawman Academy," he said.

Martin was put on paid administrative leave after an incident in May of 2009 when he got into an argument with a paramedic and put the man in a choke hold. The incident was captured on cell phone video.
