PAUL, Minn. \u2014 Young invincibles aren\u2019t the only ones opting out of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace thus far.\n\nSo are a rising number of insurance agents the government counts on to sell young people and others on the MNsure state health insurance exchange, the results of a new survey of 463 Minnesota licensed health insurance agents indicate.\n\nAbout 20 percent of insurance agents who participated in survey say they\u2019ve lost time, money and patience trying to work with MNsure.\n\nAs a result, MNsure has lost them.\n\nThe agents said they will no longer participate in the program, increasing the likelihood of their customers obtaining coverage outside the exchange. In addition, 60 percent of agents surveyed expressed doubts the state insurance exchange will ever function well, but they haven\u2019t thrown in the towel just yet.\n\n\u201cI regret ever agreeing to be included in this directory,\u201d said a Scott County agent quoted in the report. \u201cWe still cannot help the vast majority of prospective callers at this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare is the law and we need to help the lower income people be able to afford insurance but this is not the answer. Needs a lot of work,\u201d an Anoka County insurer said in the report.\n\nThe DGR Communications survey was designed to gauge the experience of insurance agents on the front lines of health reform three months after the shaky rollout of MNsure, the state insurance exchange.\n\nFunded by individual agents, the report makes \u201cno claim that it speaks for the professional associations\u201d but does claim to be \u201ca fair representation of licensed profession health insurance agents\u2019 interaction with MNsure from across Minnesota.\u201d The report does not name the agents it quotes.\n\nThe results of the survey show a striking contrast in agents\u2019 attitudes before and after MNsure went online in October.\n\nBefore the launch, slightly more than half of the respondents were cautiously optimistic that MNsure would benefit their customers and their businesses. After three months of hands-on dealings with Minnesota\u2019s online marketplace, it was the reverse.\n\n\u201cPrior to MNsure\u2019s launch, agents looked toward MNsure with uncertain hope. By December, agents became frustrated on behalf of their clients and in their own practices. Many began to question whether to walk away from MNsure,\u201d wrote Dave Racer, a St. Paul health-care consultant to insurance agents and brokers who conducted the 20-question survey.\n\nAbout half of the participants said MNsure was a \u201cpartial or total failure\u201d in their business, raising concerns about the program\u2019s \u201cability to attract and enroll individuals in non-government health plans\u201d according to the report.\n\nTechnical issues also plagued agents, with 38 percent of those surveyed indicating they failed to get a policy through MNsure specifically due to website problems. Even the 45 percent of the participants who successfully navigated the online system said they found it frustrating.\n\nSome 44 percent of brokers and agents who took the survey reported spending countless hours of uncompensated time assisting individuals who ultimately qualified for Medicaid or MinnesotaCare rather than a private policy.\n\n\u201cWhile I try to help everyone secure the insurance that they need, I have a family of my own to support,\u201d said an Anoka County agent quoted in the report. \u201cConsequently I have unfortunately explained to some people that as much as I would like to help them, I cannot afford to since I am not paid for it.\u201d\n\nRacer presented the results privately to MNsure interim CEO Scott Leitz before making the report public.\n\n\u201cMinnesota\u2019s insurance agents (and) brokers play an incredibly important role in helping Minnesotans find affordable, high-quality health insurance. We apologize for the fact that the MNsure system caused problems for brokers as well as customers,\u201d said Jenni Bowring-McDonough, media relations coordinator for MNsure.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance has to be sold, it\u2019s not bought. Sure there\u2019s a federal law requiring it, but for most people they have to be convinced. That\u2019s what agents do,\u201d Racer said. \u201cWithout agents selling MNsure plans, MNsure is going to fail in selling commercial health plans.\u201d\n\nContact Tom Steward at tsteward@watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "20 percent of MN insurance agents in a new survey are dropping out of MNsure, while 60 percent of respondents doubt the exchange will ever function well.", "title": "Ouch!
