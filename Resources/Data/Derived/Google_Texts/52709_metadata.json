Since his second inauguration in January 2013, Mr. Obama has seen his approval ratings plummet, and his administration has found itself ensnared in several scandals.\n\nFor this reason, Mr. Obama has been compared with Richard Nixon on more than one occasion.\n\nWith that in mind, Victor Davis Hanson, a historian affiliated with Stanford University\u2019s Hoover Institution, asked in the headline of a recent column \u201cIs Obama Walking the Trail Blazed by Nixon?\u201d Mr. Hanson subsequently argued many of the Obama administration scandals involve abuses of power eerily reminiscent of those of the Nixon administration.\n\nHe paid particular attention to the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s harassment of conservative groups between 2010 and 2012; on-the-fly revisions to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; the recently scuttled Federal Communications Commission investigation of news decisions; and political use of the Department of Justice, among other things.\n\nMr. Hanson also pointed out that most news outlets have taken a pass on reporting the nitty gritty of these scandals, a 180 degree turn from 40 years ago. He contended this disparity simply is because Mr. Obama is a Democrat, while Mr. Nixon was a Republican.\n\nMr. Hanson had a succinct conclusion to this excellent column: \u201cBoth presidents once had enormous potential and high poll ratings, but their treatment of the Constitution was as Orwellian as it was unnecessary. Before Nixon imploded, he was warned to stop it. Will Obama?\u201d\n\nRead it here.\n\nIndeed, the Obama administration\u2019s doings are frightening and have set some horrible precedents. They stand in contrast to the president\u2019s 2008 \u201chope and change\u201d rhetoric. However, it is equally appalling that most journalists are content to let most of the dirtiness go unchallenged; this is a point we have made on the editorial page many times in recent months.\n\nThe Fourth Estate exists to hold public officials to account, but it seems most members will stand aside when their guy is the one in the hot seat. This is shameful and dangerous.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf1de\"", "article_summary": "He contended this disparity simply is because Mr. Obama is a Democrat, while Mr. Nixon was a Republican.\nFor this reason, Mr. Obama has been compared with Richard Nixon on more than one occasion.\nSince his second inauguration in January 2013, Mr. Obama has seen his approval ratings plummet, and his administration has found itself ensnared in several scandals.\nMr. Hanson also pointed out that most news outlets have taken a pass on reporting the nitty gritty of these scandals, a 180 degree turn from 40 years ago.\nThere is little doubt President Obama has been beset by the so-called second-term curse."}
