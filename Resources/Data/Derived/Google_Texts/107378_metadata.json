In other words, it\u2019s a typical government program, but this one wrecks your health care.\n\nAlso, the president did raise taxes on the middle class in defiance of his well-worn campaign promise not to. Indeed, Obamacare is the largest tax hike in U.S. history.\n\nAmong the other changes effected by this law are:\n\n\u2014 Obamacare will allow insurers to charge 50 percent higher premiums for smokers, but prohibits insurers from increasing premiums for those with HIV/AIDS.\n\n\u2014 Nationally, Obamacare will increase men\u2019s individual insurance premiums by an average of 99 percent and women\u2019s by 62 percent. In North Carolina, for example, individual insurance premiums will triple for women and quadruple for men.\n\n\u2014 Health plans valued at $27,500 or more for a family of four will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent.\n\n\u2014 No doctors who went to an American medical school will be accepting Obamacare.\n\n\u2014 A 62-year-old man earning $46,000 a year is entitled to a $7,836 government tax credit to buy health insurance. But if he earns an extra $22 in income, he loses the entire $7,836 credit. He will have more take-home pay by earning $46,000 than if he earns $55,000. (If he\u2019s lucky, he already works for one of the companies forced by Obamacare to reduce employees\u2019 hours!)\n\n\u2014 Merely to be eligible for millions of dollars in grants from the federal government under Obamacare, education and training programs are required to meet racial, ethnic, gender, linguistic and sexual orientation quotas. That\u2019s going to make health care much better!\n\n\u2014 Obamacare is turning America into a part-time nation. According to a recent report by economist John Lott, 97 percent of all jobs added to the economy so far this year have been part-time jobs. Ninety-seven percent!\n\n\u2014 Obamacare is such a disaster that the people who wrote it refuse to live under it themselves. That\u2019s right, Congress won a waiver from Obamacare.\n\nResponding to the people\u2019s will, House Republicans first voted to fund all of government \u2014 except Obamacare. Obama refused to negotiate and Senate Democrats refused to pass it.\n\nThen the Republicans voted to fully fund the government, but merely delay the implementation of Obamacare for one year. Obama refused to negotiate and Senate Democrats refused to pass it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ann Coulter", "description": "'The left thinks the government is their car and the people's representatives are obstreperous teenagers trying to borrow it.'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "In the current fight over the government shutdown, Republicans are simply representing the views of the American people.
