OKLAHOMA CITY – To help address Oklahoma’s poor oral health rankings, Cherokee Nation Businesses is using some of its New Market Tax Credits to finance the 8,000-square-foot Dental Center of Excellence in south Oklahoma City. Variety Care, a family focused health center serving the needs of Oklahomans, recently broke ground on the center that will add 15 new dental chairs to its health center at 1025 Straka Terrace. The $4.3 million project will bring the total number of dental operatories at the site to 21, making it one of the largest dental clinics in the state. “Oklahoma struggles with many health outcomes, but one of the most challenging is oral health,” Variety Care CEO Lou Carmichael, said. “The most non-urgent diagnosis in hospital emergency rooms is tooth pain. Dental care is central to primary care and keeping families healthy, but it is also tough for people to afford. Our dental expansion at the Straka location will help keep people’s mouths healthy.” Variety Care provides comprehensive primary care to Oklahoma families, including medical, dental, optometric and behavioral health care. Most insurances are accepted, and uninsured patients pay cash for care along a sliding-fee scale based on income and family size. “Every time we build a standard three-chair dental clinic at one of our health centers, the schedule fills up within a week and a waiting list forms,” Carmichael said. “Variety Care receives hundreds of calls each month for dental patients we cannot fit into our existing schedules. This Dental Center of Excellence will let us hire additional dentists and hygienists, and it will feature extra dental chairs for emergency walk-in patients and student rotations for workforce development.” Principal Chief Bill John Baker said with the center’s addition, Variety Care will create jobs and make the kinds of critical investments that will help improve access to health care. “There is no issue more important to me and to the Cherokee people than affordable health care,” Baker said. “I am proud a portion of our Cherokee Nation Businesses New Markets Tax Credits will be used to help an organization dedicated to that same mission.” Inasmuch Foundation, the United Way of Central Oklahoma and The Wilshire Foundation have also provided grant money to support initial operations of Variety Care’s new dental center and keep costs affordable for patients. In addition to dental care, the expansion will pave the way for an urgent care area at the health center, as well as a gastroenterology practice. Of the 21 dental chairs planned for Variety Care’s Straka site, six will focus on pediatric dental care and the other 15 will focus primarily on adult care. “There is a two-front battle in dental care,” Carmichael said. “First, many adults have significant dental needs because they have neglected oral health care over the years. But, second, we have to break this cycle by making sure children are developing healthy dental habits. We need parents to understand just how important dental visits are for kids as early as 1 year of age.” CNB officials said they have been supporting numerous projects across Oklahoma through New Markets Tax Credits investment. “We are pleased to help spur economic development in Oklahoma and improve health infrastructure through our involvement with organizations like Variety Care,” CNB CEO Shawn Slaton said. “Variety Care’s health centers are truly making a difference in the lives of our fellow Oklahomans, and we’re grateful to have a hand in getting this project off the ground.”

Read More Officials take steps to manage contract health budget BY JAMI MURPHY

Senior Reporter – @cp_jmurphy TAHLEQUAH, Okla. – At the May 16 Health Committee meeting, Tribal Councilors questioned Health Services Director Connie Davis and Brett Hayes, who oversees the tribe’s contract health department, about contract health referral reductions for the rest of the fiscal year and the department’s shortfalls. According to an emailed letter from Health Services Executive Medical Director Dr. Roger Montgomery to Davis, who then forwarded it to Tribal Councilors, each year the tribe overspends its contract health budget and he recommends “people cut back on the referrals they write.” “People don’t really cut back all that much and administration makes up the difference with collections from the clinics, etc., so we don’t end up having to push the issue,” Montgomery states. “This year, with the implementation of a new electronic health record leading to reduced clinic schedules, and the addition of approximately 10,000 patient visits this year, there are no additional collections to pad Contract Health’s overruns.” Montgomery states that in the first seven months of FY 2016 the tribe spent $25 million of its $35 million contract health budget. “That leaves $10 million available for the last five months of the fiscal year and no expected increased collections to cover the remainder. If payments for transfers out continue at the same pace of about $200,000 per month, it actually leaves $9 million for everything else,” he writes. At the meeting, Davis said She said the lack of in-house procedures because of referrals has caused contract health spending to get out of control. “So we’ve asked our docs to do a better job managing patients within our own health centers and not sending them out for things like knee injections, shoulder injections or casting,” she said. She added that the health system had grown by about 10 percent annually since she’s led Health Services and that has impacted spending. “We’ve budgeted a flat budget with contract health all these years, and so it’s obvious that there’s at some point that we’re going to have to slow some of the (referrals),” she said. Many referrals are approved now that historically hadn’t always been approved, including pain management and orthopedic procedures, Hayes said. Montgomery states that to solve overspending for the rest of FY 2016 requires referral reductions. “Because of our three chance appeals process, the only real way to ensure not spending money on a referral is to not write the referral at all. In our case, this means reducing the number of referrals written by as much as 50 percent. Contract Health money is and was traditionally earmarked only for urgent and emergent care. It was never intended for elective care,” he states. “It was never intended for routine follow-ups in patients not having further issues. It was never intended for things we could do ourselves, even if it meant waiting a bit for the care. We added money in the past in programs such as Back to Work to help pay for some of the elective procedures. However, when that money was no longer available, we never dropped those new service lines.” <strong>Referrals that could be reduced included in Montgomery’s statement were:</strong> • Dizziness workups that were instigated by a vendor apart from the original reason for the referral, • Prophylactic mastectomy that could be performed at Hastings, • Circumcision revisions for cosmetic purposes, • Dermatology: simple excisions, punch biopsies, actinic and seborrheic keratosis treatments and skin tag removals, • Simple wound care, • Elective gallbladders, hernias, hysterectomies, etc., that could be performed at Hastings, • Cardiac clearance by cardiologists that can be done in-house, • Varicose veins, • Long-term follow-ups for benign or distant conditions, • Elective orthopedics-joint replacements, • Elective repairs, • Injections at outside vendors, • Non-elective orthopedics-simple casting, • PET scans that don’t change treatment, • Cataracts before Medicare kicks in, and • Allergy testing and reduction mammoplasty. Not all non-urgent, non-emergency procedures are included in the list. The list was in reference to one day’s referrals, according to Montgomery’s statement. Montgomery also states that providers would have to “police themselves” when writing referrals. “If your case manager is writing all your referrals for you without any real discussion, you will need to halt this practice…Another option is to advocate to your patients the importance of signing up for available resources, such as insurance from the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and Medicare Part B,” Montgomery states. “We can pay for 5 insured referrals for every one uninsured referral. This also brings money into your individual clinics, which allows you to pay for raises, new providers, and creates the cushion that Contract Health used to use when there are overruns. Explain to your patients that signing up for these things are a huge help to Cherokee Nation Health. Ask them if they can afford to and are willing to help.” Montgomery states that if these options were unsuccessful each clinic would be given a budget to work from and be required to review their referrals daily and work within that budget. “If we still aren’t getting under budget, more drastic action would need to be taken,” he states.

Read More CN works to curb prescription drug abuse BY STAFF REPORTS

WAGONER, Okla. – To curb prescription drug abuse, the Cherokee Nation is encouraging the public to drop off any unused prescriptions on Saturday during the Wagoner Family Fun Day in Maple Park. The tribe’s regional prevention coordinators will have an “Rx Take Back” booth at the event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for those who want to safely dispose of prescriptions that are no longer needed. Wagoner County ranks among the highest in the state for prescription overdose deaths related to painkillers, according to state data. “The Cherokee Nation knows the importance of not only physical health, but mental health, and is working to ensure our communities and citizens are healthy and safe,” CN certified prevention specialist Coleman Cox said. “Painkillers such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and codeine, are some of the most abused prescription drugs in our 14-counties. That’s why it’s important to have safe drop off bags and locations to get these no longer used drugs out of medicine cabinets and homes.” The CN is using a grant from the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to raise awareness of the problem and create prevention plans. The CN regional prevention coordinators who work through the tribe’s Behavioral Health department routinely drop bags at pharmacies with information on safe use, safe storage and safe disposal of prescription drugs. In Wagoner County, Owl Drug on Main Street gives the bags out to raise awareness. “We like the prescription take back bags and handing them out with some prescriptions,” pharmacist Matthew Villandry said. “We think it helps and have also seen a decrease in hydrocodone use because we now ask customers to fill another prescription along with it.” Residents can dispose of prescriptions at the booth on Saturday or at any time at the Wagoner County Sheriff’s Office at 307 E. Cherokee St., Wagoner Police Department at 105 S. Casaver Ave. or the Coweta Police Department at 212 N. Broadway, where each has disposal bins.

Read More Women’s group releases rape handbook for Native females BY JAMI MURPHY

Senior Reporter – @cp_jmurphy LAKE ANDES, S.D. – The Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center recently released its workbook for Native American females titled “What To Do When You Are Raped, An ABC Handbook For Native Girls.” The book, Cherokee Nation citizen Pam Kingfisher said, is a resource aimed at answering questions women face following a sexual assault. “From thinking through buying emergency contraception, to getting tested for STDS, to who to turn to for support,” she said. Comanche Nation citizen Charon Asetoyer, who is also the Native American Women’s Health Education Resource Center’s CEO, said the book is a woman-to-woman, woman-to-girl, girl-to-girl community response in regards to sexual assault. “Sharing with them, providing support, letting them know they are not alone. That this is not their fault and they shouldn’t blame themselves. The book instructs them on how to report if they choose to,” Asetoyer said. “It talks to them about going in for STD exam and also access to emergency contraceptive Plan B.” Kingfisher and Asetoyer joined Elizabeth Black Bull and Donna Haukaas to co-write the book. [BLOCKQUOTE]Asetoyer said she was asked by a young mother on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in Lake Andes what she should do if her daughter was raped. Asetoyer said that when a mother puts it as when, not if, her daughter is raped, there is a realization that the problem is worse than originally thought. Asetoyer said the book sends a message to women and helps them realize it is not their fault. “There are other women out there. You’re not alone, and turn to them for help,” she said. Kingfisher said the project was personal and that she’s worked with Asetoyer on the book for about four years. “I think it’s so important that we advocate for our health and for our women. As a young girl who was assaulted and didn’t know anything…and later became pregnant and was forced to give up a child for adoption, I didn’t know any of these things. Nobody talked. These conversations didn’t happen at the kitchen table or even around girlfriends,” Kingfisher said. She added that she and Asetoyer, as well as other advocates fighting against sexual assault, want to make this issue real. “For me it’s important that we serve that matriarchal role of being good aunties, being good grandmas, being big sisters and helping,” she said. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, one of the nation’s largest anti-sexual assault organizations, during an American Indian or Alaskan woman’s lifetime she is at a 34.1 percent chance of suffering from rape or attempted rape, the most of any other race. And about 3 percent of American men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes.
