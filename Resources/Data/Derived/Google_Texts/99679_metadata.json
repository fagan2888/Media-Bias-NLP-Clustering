I am also flabbergasted to why someone would think a newspaper should be \u201cfamily-friendly.\u201d If you want news to be family-friendly, then voice your concerns to the corrupt politicians, murderers, rapists, thieves and other headliners.\n\nChildren should not be reading the newspaper. It will not benefit them until they\u2019ve achieved the capacity of critical thinking and reasoning. People also give the supposedly family-friendly Bible to study, even though it, too, is full of corruption, murder, rape, kidnapping, thieves, war and bigotry. When kids ask why God ever made a law to rape a virgin and pay 50 shekels to her father for marriage, come back and tell me about the \u201ctasteless indecency\u201d of a woman confidently and artistically showing off a beautifully sculpted body. Preston Baez\n\nSkimpy coverage\n\nKew Gardens: First warm day and page 3 features young girls in skimpy bikinis. No sign of exposed men: Shocker! Jessica Glass\n\nEarth Day, everyone\n\nBrooklyn: \u201cWe do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children\u201d is a Native American proverb that reminds us of the impact of our current actions on future generations \u2014 and an important philosophy to remember as we celebrate Earth Day. We live here. It\u2019s our home. As holistic nurses, my friends and I are committed to preserving the environment and recognizing our connection to the healing powers of Mother Earth. Since we all must share its resources, we ask all who live on the planet to join us. Our precious Earth supplies natural healing opportunities from sunlight, minerals and plants. Staying connected to nature is vital to our health and well-being. We cannot function or live well if our water, air or land are polluted. The more we nurture and live in harmony with our environment, the more we open ourselves up to peace and kindness, which in turn promote a healthier life. Marci Resnicoff\n\nAnother bad deal\n\nBrooklyn: The Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact under negotiation is a bad deal for the American middle class and for the health of every American. Not only that, but it will put all of our climate protections, meager as they are, in jeopardy, in a bad deal for the planet. I just can\u2019t understand why President Obama is doing this. Stop it in its tracks! Jessica Flagg\n\nScheduling a visit\n\nAstoria: I look forward to the decriminalization of various offenses by Melissa Mark-Viverito so I can go to her place of residence and ride my bicycle on the sidewalk to her home, and, after finishing my beer and listening to my music, proceed to urinate on her sidewalk as I depart and toss my empty beer can into the whispering wind at her front door. Aden O\u2019Donnell\n\nStill crimes, for now\n\nKew Gardens Hills: I\u2019m surprised Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and the rest of the blockheads on the City Council are not trying to decriminalize murder and rape. Barr Koppel\n\nChoice ticket\n\nBrooklyn: The best police reform out there is a simple idea called discretion. Cops are no longer taught it. If the NYPD encouraged common-sense policing instead of vapid notions of \u201czero tolerance,\u201d the cops and their communities would both be better off. Eugene Durante\n\nBack at you\n\nMahopac, N.Y.: Well, I have seen it all now, with the Daily News\u2019 Tuesday headline referring to our brave men and women of the New York City Police Department as \u201cdummies\u201d (\u201cPolicing for dummies,\u201d April 21). Maybe the headline could be more appropriate rewritten as \u201cnewspaper reporting for dummies.\u201d Michael J. Murphy\n\nPoll position\n\nStaten Island: To Voicer Linda Wyatt: Exactly what law did the GOP pass that \u201ckeeps minorities from voting\u201d? David Fine\n\nSay on pay\n\nBrooklyn: Hey, Voicer Marty Goodman: Where did you go to school? If a person works six hours per day, five days per week, that totals 30 hours per week. If they make $15 per hour that would total $450 a week before taxes, not $600. Clare Butts\n\nUnfair trade\n\nAstoria: Having been to Cuba, I could have told Gov. Cuomo not to waste his time and the taxpayers\u2019 money. What New York product or vacation can a Cuban afford on a $20 monthly average salary? And what can we purchase from Cuba? Their only two industries are sugar and tobacco. Just what we need more of! If the governor wants to promote trade he should go to Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands. Who dreamed up this boondoggle? Richard Nebenzahl\n\nHate on the beach\n\nCedarhurst, L.I.: Why did Gov. Cuomo threaten to boycott Indiana over its religious freedom legislation yet races over to Cuba, with its history of human rights violations, to do business there? Adam Moskowitz\n\nTime for a tax refund\n\nSaugerties, N.Y.: In her letter to President Obama, Voicer Kathie Dunn certainly provided forceful statements and opinion, but whether she has any facts on her side is questionable. For example, she complains that she works and makes $30,000 for herself and her college daughter, has the maximum withheld by her employer, and still owes a thousand dollars in taxes. I don\u2019t know who does her taxes, but a review of the IRS 1040 instructions would show that she could claim a $9,100 deduction as Head of Household, and $7,900 for two exemptions for herself and daughter. This would result in about $13,000 in taxable income, with a potential tax bill of about $1,300. She is also eligible for an earned income credit of at least $1,356, so even without considering the \u201cmaximum withheld\u201d by her employer, she would be eligible for a refund! As for Affordable Care Act payments that had to be made, if Dunn\u2019s employer offered health coverage and she could not afford it, she in all likelihood qualified for an exemption to any payment, but did not claim it. Rich Dooley\n\nJust watch\n\nStaten Island: Re \u201cISIS vid horror\u201d (April 20): President Obama\u2019s silence is deafening. Gloria Delio\n\nNo contest\n\nManhattan: To Voicer James J. Moglia: Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I don\u2019t think the \u201clegal residents\u201d in the contest rules refer to an individual\u2019s immigration status. I\u2019m thinking the sponsors have in mind people who are in the United States vacationing from another country, or have a visitor\u2019s visa, or live in a possession of the U.S. They are not \u201clegal residents\u201d of the 50 states, and thus can\u2019t enter the contest. Vanessa Enger\n\nShort history of mayors\n\nBrooklyn: I read with interest the statement that the \u201cshort, bespectacled (Scott) Stringer might not look the part\u201d of mayor (\u201cA \u2018String\u2019 theory,\u201d April 19). While it is true that New York has occasionally elected tall men to the top job, including Bill de Blasio, John Lindsay and Ed Koch, we have also elected our share of shorter mayors, including Abe Beame, Michael Bloomberg and Fiorello LaGuardia. Ira Cure\n\nLife of crime\n\nKew Gardens: The saddest part of the story \u201cHe \u2018soaked\u2019 the stores\u201d (April 18) is the 17-year-old neighbor who thinks that this man was \u201cmaking a living.\u201d Someone needs to look into how this child\u2019s parents \u201cmake a living.\u201d Or just keep tabs on this kid: I can guarantee he will end up in jail if he thinks stealing is making a living. Kevin Hargrove has cost everyone money. He is a crook and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. He should go to jail and be required to pay back Stop & Shop every penny he stole. Cathy Kleiman\n\nMan vs. machine\n\nJamaica: Seems like karmic justice that Kevin Hargrove was able to switch bar codes and steal from supermarkets by using self-service checkouts. Had the stores not reduced the number of employees by replacing people with machines, he would never have gotten away with it, as the cashier would have noticed. Perhaps he might even have been able to support his family working at one of the jobs eliminated. The stores were hoisted by their own petards.
