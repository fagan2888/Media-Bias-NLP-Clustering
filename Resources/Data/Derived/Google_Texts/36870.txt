The president of a physician-owned hospital said patient cherry picking is a myth.

The House Ways and Means health subcommittee gave physician-owned hospitals a chance to defend themselves today at a hearing on competition in the traditional Medicare program and the private Medicare plan markets.

For years, the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act limited physicians' ability to refer patients to facilities they owned. Physicians could refer patients only when they owned the entire hospital, rather than just part of a hospital.
