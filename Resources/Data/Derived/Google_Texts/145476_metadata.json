This is their job isn\u2019t it?\u201d Have you ever thought those words yourself?\n\nRecently, I received an incredibly strong answer to this question from Jennifer, a former store manager at a national women\u2019s clothing chain.\n\nJennifer is outgoing, incredibly gifted at making customers feel comfortable and was considered a \u201chigh-potential\u201d by her district and regional managers. Within a year, however, she had quit.\n\nA few months later, she ran into her district manager at a coffee shop. As they talked, the district manager expressed surprise that Jennifer had left. \u201cYou were one of the most talented, capable managers we had. You had so much to offer and you left. Do you mind if I ask why?\u201d\n\nJennifer told me, \u201cIt took me a few moments to recover from the shock . . . the district manager had never shared any of those positives with me. I got a weekly, sometimes daily, breakdown of where I wasn\u2019t good enough \u2013 and that was it.\u201d\n\nJennifer told her former district manager, \u201cI thought I was failing. I\u2019m shocked to hear that I was doing anything right. I wish you had told me I was talented or capable at the time.\u201d\n\nWhy Encourage People for Just Doing Their Job?\n\nThat depends. How important is it to you to keep your top performers? How much lost talent, energy and productivity will a lack of encouragement cost you?\n\nHuman beings need encouragement. It\u2019s a fact of life. You get more of what you encourage or celebrate and less of what you criticize or ignore. If you want a team that doesn\u2019t need to be encouraged, get a cat. Otherwise, if you\u2019re working with people, they need encouragement.\n\nIf you\u2019re married, imagine what would happen if, after your wedding, you never said \u201cI love you\u201d or never held hands or kissed the other person. You couldn\u2019t expect your relationship to last very long.\n\nThat\u2019s the equivalent of never saying \u201cthank you\u201d or encouraging your team members. Yes, it\u2019s their job in as much as they\u2019ve made a commitment to your organization \u2013 just like spouses make a promise to commit to one another. That doesn\u2019t mean you should take that commitment or your team\u2019s work for granted.\n\n3 Keys to Effective Encouragement\n\nRecently, when I shared Jennifer\u2019s story, an audience member asked, \u201cHow do I encourage people? I understand the concept, but struggle to do it well.\u201d Effective encouragement requires three things:\n\nAvoid \u201cgreat job!\u201d Instead, try something like \u201cI really appreciate the extra effort you put in on that project last Tuesday. The client loved the work and renewed their account.\u201d\n\nEncourage people in ways that are meaningful to them. The easiest way to find out is to ask. When you onboard people into your team, ask them, \u201cHow do you like to receive recognition for a job well done?\u201d\n\nMake sure your encouragement is related to the work and business outcomes. It demoralizes everyone when you encourage someone for something that actually detracts from the team.\n\nThank you for your commitment to leading well. Remember, you get more of what you encourage and celebrate. Everyone needs encouragement \u2013 they just need it in ways that are meaningful to them.\n\nDavid M.
