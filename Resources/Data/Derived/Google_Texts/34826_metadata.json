He says it began with kissing between class periods and eventually led to intercourse.\n\nAltice, who was arrested in October for the alleged incidents involving the first student, now faces nine felony counts in connection with the allegations involving two of her former students.\n\nFarmington 2nd District Judge John Morris ordered her on Friday to return to court on Oct. 9 to face three counts of rape and one charge of forcible sodomy.\n\nAltice has pleaded not guilty to all counts. Her attorney Ed Brass argued she did not use her position as a teacher to persuade the teen into having a sexual relationship. He says she succumbed to the student\u2019s frequent flirting.\n\nUnder Utah law, a victim cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ex-Utah teacher to trial on student sex charges", "title": "Ex-Utah teacher to trial on student sex charges", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ex-Utah teacher to trial on student sex charges", "title": "Ex-Utah teacher to trial on student sex charges", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/ex_utah_teacher_to_trial_on_student_sex_charges/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/teacher-sex-charge.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ex-Utah teacher to trial on student sex charges", "title": "Ex-Utah teacher to trial on student sex charges", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/teacher-sex-charge.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf0f\"", "article_summary": "Her attorney Ed Brass argued she did not use her position as a teacher to persuade the teen into having a sexual relationship.\nOne of the teenage boys offered graphic details during his testimony at a preliminary hearing on Friday about how he went from being Brianne Altice\u2019s English student to allegedly having sex with her in his Farmington home.\nUnder Utah law, a victim cannot consent to sex if the other person is in a position of special trust.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsFARMINGTON, Utah (AP) \u2014 A 35-year-old former Utah high school teacher accused of having sexual relationships with two of her former students has been ordered to stand trial on additional charges of rape and forcible sodomy.\nAltice, who was arrested in October for the alleged incidents involving the first student, now faces nine felony counts in connection with the allegations involving two of her former students."}
