The Administration can\u2019t be happy that the Term\u2019s most famous case will center around its attempts to strong arm nuns who have devoted their lives to caring for the homeless and the poor. As any high school student knows, the Constitution protects the religious rights of nuns, bishops, and religious schools just as much as it protects the church down the street. It\u2019s high time the Supreme Court put a stop to the Obama Administration\u2019s policy of subjugating religious liberty to its own agenda.\u201d\n\n\u2014Public statement by Carrie Severino, chief counsel for the Judicial Crisis Network, a legal advocacy group that promotes limited government and the rule of law, on November 6, after the Supreme Court accepted review of seven cases challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate of free access to contraceptive services for women employees and college students.\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nBecause high-profile legal cases also have a public relations aspect, the lawyers involved try hard to find an individual or group whose situation or personality will make the cause seem \u2013or be \u2014 more sympathetic. It was no surprise that Linda Brown would be the one who gave her name to the court\u2019s 1954 decision ordering the racial desegregation of public schools. As a grade schooler, she could not go to the public school four blocks from her house, but had to cross a railroad track and take a bus to the segregated school for black children in Topeka. (She sued through her father, because she was a minor.)\n\nAnd it is no surprise that lawyers and advocacy groups pressing a new challenge to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) have been publicly attempting to keep the focus on just one of nearly 40 individual or group challengers involved \u2014 an order of Roman Catholic nuns, the Little Sisters of the Poor. The attorneys and the groups they represent would prefer that, when the Justices decide the case next year, it would come out as Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nWhat better way would there be to show the supposed insensitivity of the federal government as it attempts to achieve widespread free access to birth control devices and methods for millions of women workers and college students, many of whom are employed by or enrolled in religiously affiliated institutions?\n\nIt is a fact that, among the seven cases the Justices will be hearing, the only one that raised a constitutional challenge to the birth-control mandate was that of the Little Sisters. But it is also a fact that, when the court last Friday chose the issues it would be deciding, it did not accept that specific challenge; all of the cases will be judged on whether the mandate, if it does apply to each of the challengers, violates a federal law: the Religious Freedom Restoration Act or RFRA. If the court does not accept a constitutional question, it drops out of the case and lawyers would be well advised not to try to rely on it.\n\nIf the lawyers for this order of nuns had hustled a bit more in getting the case to the court, it might have given its name to the coming decision. But that place almost certainly will go to the first case to reach the court in this controversy: Zubik v. Burwell. That case is named for the Catholic bishop of Pittsburgh, the Most Rev. David A. Zubik.\n\nIt is a peculiarity of some of these cases that the named individual actually is not covered by the ACA mandate. Bishop Zubik is one of those, although he is the overseer of the diocese of Pittsburgh, which does have some entities that are covered.\n\nAnd it is a peculiarity of the Little Sisters case that neither they nor their health plan provider seems to face a binding legal obligation to provide free contraceptive services under the ACA, although that remains a bit unclear. Rather than \u201cstrong arming\u201d the nuns\u2019 order to comply, the most that the government may do is to encourage the order\u2019s insurer to do so voluntarily.\n\nIn fact, as the government has structured the mandate, not one of the organizations suing over the mandate will be required \u2013 itself \u2013 to provide the contraceptive services to their employees or their students. The government is willing to offer each one an exemption to the mandate, provided that they simply notify the government that they wish to be exempted because of religious objection to contraceptive drugs or methods.\n\nBut that is also at the center of the case. Under RFRA, if a federal government program imposes a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on the practice of a religion, the government can enforce that program only if its policy goal is \u201ccompelling,\u201d and only if it uses the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d to achieve that goal.\n\nThere is little debate in these cases that the mandate, if enforced directly despite a religious non-profit group\u2019s religious objections, would satisfy the burden test of RFRA. So the case will be focused tightly on whether the government, by offering exemptions to the religious entities, has adopted the \u201cleast restrictive\u201d way to provide access to birth control drugs or measures.\n\nIf a group does claim an exemption, under the rules laid down by federal officials, the arrangement of access to contraceptives is done by the government itself, working independently with the religious institution\u2019s health plan. But even that degree of involvement for the institution \u2013 its own health insurance plan used as the basis for the coverage \u2013 does not give them enough assurance that they will have nothing to do with the program. Merely notifying the government that a religious institution would seek to opt out, they claim, would be to \u201ctrigger\u201d access for their workers and students.\n\nThus, a major issue that the court will have to decide in these seven cases will be just how the government can, or must, go about allowing a religious institution to opt out of a program that will reach those who work for it or go to school in its classrooms. That could be the lasting legacy of Kubik v. Burwell.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nCan \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d be displayed on police cars?\n\nConstitution Check: Which birth control case will the Supreme Court choose?\n\nConstitution Check: How far can Congress go to override Article III?\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at the desire of attorneys to have the latest Obamacare challenged named for a group of nuns.", "title": "Constitution Check: Is the new Obamacare case all about the nuns?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/11/constitution-check-is-the-new-obamacare-case-all-about-the-nuns/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Inside_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Inside_the_United_States_Supreme_Court.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-10T10:15:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-09T20:43:55+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Share:EmailLyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at the desire of attorneys to have the latest Obamacare challenged named for a group of nuns.\nIf the court does not accept a constitutional question, it drops out of the case and lawyers would be well advised not to try to rely on it.\nIf the lawyers for this order of nuns had hustled a bit more in getting the case to the court, it might have given its name to the coming decision.\nTHE STATEMENT AT ISSUE:\u201cOnce again, the Supreme Court will scrutinize the Obama Administration\u2019s controversial contraceptive mandate.\nBut that place almost certainly will go to the first case to reach the court in this controversy: Zubik v.
