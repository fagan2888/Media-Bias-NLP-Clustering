The pressures of overseeing a major healthcare organization are never-ending, but it's especially difficult when your direct reports have more experience than you do.

It's a situation hospital chief executive officers will increasingly face given high CEO turnover and the trend of organizations hiring senior executives who don't necessarily have healthcare experience.

Nicholas R. Tejeda, CEO of Doctors Hospital of Manteca (Calif.), a 73-bed facility affiliated with the Tenet Healthcare Corporation, (pictured right) knows this first-hand.

In an exclusive interview with FierceHealthcare prior to his presentation today at the American College of Healthcare Executives Congress, Tejeda said he's battled perceptions about his age and experience in every hospital management job he's had--beginning with his first stint as a supervisor, when a lab director said he'd quit before reporting to Tejeda.
