The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India on Saturday said it will conduct inquiry in the matter of the 21-year-old CA student allegedly hacking the Income Tax account of industrialist Anil Ambani.

Subodh Kumar Agrawal, president of ICAI, said the Hyderabad-based girl, who is pursuing her CA article-ship, would get a notice in this regard.

"The issue has been forwarded to the respective department," he said.

When asked if there would be any action against Manoj Daga & Company, the CA firm where the girl was doing her article-ship, Agrawal said it was too early to say anything.

"First we will inquire with the student and later if anything is found then we will go ahead for others," he said.

The girl allegedly hacked Ambani's e-filing of Income Tax returns, to find out details of his income and the tax he paid, according to Mumbai police.

A case was registered against her under the Information Technology Act on September 7.
