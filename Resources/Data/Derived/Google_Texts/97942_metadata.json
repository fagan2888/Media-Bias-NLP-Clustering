Neighbors have helped each other weather many storms, including Hurricane Sandy\u2019s devastation and the loss of dozens of its residents on 9/11.\n\nHowever, this time residents can do nothing to stop the emotional and financial distress hundreds of fellow residents are enduring as a result of Obamacare.\n\nSchool employees, township workers, local supermarket employees, and local businesses are all dealing with Obamacare\u2019s adverse effects.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon interviewed many residents whose lives have been upended because of the president\u2019s signature legislation.\n\nThe township has cut the hours of 25 workers to avoid the burdensome $500,000 per year it would have incurred to be in compliance with Obamacare. The town\u2019s mayor said it was a difficult decision.\n\n\u201cIt is a horrible situation all around. I know a lot of these people, they are great assets to the town,\u201d said Middletown Mayor Gerry Scharfenberger.\n\nOne woman begged the mayor not to cut her hours. \u201cShe was crying, begging me,\u201d Scharfenberger said. \u201cMy heart goes out to these workers. \u2026 Decent, hard-working people are getting hurt.\u201d\n\nThis is only the beginning, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very early. We haven\u2019t felt the full effect yet,\u201d Scharfenberger said. \u201cI\u2019m terrified of what else is coming next. \u2026 It\u2019s so early and has been so catastrophic so early on.\u201d\n\nMiddletown\u2019s schools slashed the hours of 178 of its total 300 paraprofessionals to avoid paying health insurance for the part-time employees as required by Obamacare.\n\nNow the most vulnerable children in the school district are suffering.\n\n\u201cTheir whole life is disrupted, the kids are really paying the price,\u201d said one paraprofessional, who asked for her name to be withheld in fear of reprisal. Each special needs child in the past would have one paraprofessional assigned to their care. Now, she said she is required to take one day off a week, and it is causing emotional distress for the child under her care.\n\nThe paraprofessional mentioned a recent attack by an autistic child on another aide; she said she believed the incident was due to a disruption in the child\u2019s schedule.\n\n\u201cObamacare is hurting all the wrong people. To see children suffer because of it is heartbreaking,\u201d the paraprofessional said.\n\nThe Middletown School District superintendent did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Board of Education president.\n\nAt the local Stop and Shop supermarket, employee Rob Hill said his hours were cut due to Obamacare. He has now taken a second job and is working 60 hours a week to pay the bills. His brother, who works at another supermarket, is also dealing with loss of work hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making it worse for the middle class. It\u2019s not the way it was supposed to be,\u201d Hill said. He said not only have his hours been cut, but there is no overtime now permitted due to ACA. His household is struggling.\n\nAccording to Laura Wilton, the health administrator for the Frank Wilton Law Firm, her husband\u2019s group insurance policy was canceled.\n\n\u201cThe firm\u2019s group health insurance plan, not an individual plan, was not being renewed since it didn\u2019t meet the new Obamacare standards,\u201d she said. She explained the plan did not include now mandatory pediatric vision and dental benefits.\n\nWilton said in the past she chose not to have that coverage because of the exorbitant cost. \u201cIt was cheaper for us to pay out of pocket for our four kids\u2019 vision and dental needs than buy these overpriced options,\u201d Wilton said. Now, she said, \u201cI\u2019m being forced to buy coverage I don\u2019t want.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s infuriating that the government is telling me to buy a product I don\u2019t want,\u201d Wilton said. Right now she is in limbo, as the fix announced by the president last week has still not materialized. She said her insurer, Horizon Blue Cross and Blue Shield, announced they were evaluating if the president\u2019s proposal could be accomplished.\n\nThe uncertainty of not knowing if she can keep her plan for another year, and knowing her premiums are expected to \u201cskyrocket\u201d in the future, is affecting business spending.\n\n\u201cI need to know how much it will be. I can\u2019t purchase equipment or supplies. The budget is up in the air,\u201d Wilton said, \u201cIt is affecting spending\u201d\n\nAnother small business owner, Linda O\u2019Keefe, also had her insurance policy cancelled. She now is paying higher monthly premiums for a plan that gives her fewer choices. Her previous plan allowed her the liberty of choosing doctors and hospitals, a reason she picked that plan.\n\n\u201cI am disgusted. I\u2019m limited in doctors and hospitals I can go to,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cI\u2019m a small business. I shopped for a long time to get a policy to meet my needs and now that policy is being taken away from me and replaced with an inferior policy.\u201d\n\nOther small businesses across town are bracing for Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI go to an event, or a cocktail party, and I keep hearing from small businesses the same thing: \u2018This is going to drive me out of business,\u2019\u201d said Scharfenberger.\n\n\u201cThis is turning into everything he [President Obama] didn\u2019t promise. It\u2019s just the opposite of what he promised. It is bizzaro legislation,\u201d Scharfenberger said. \u201cEach day, another shoe seems to drop. It\u2019s the people who can least afford to weather the storm who are getting hurt the worst.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Feature: Obamacare hits Middletown, New Jersey especially hard.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Residents in Middletown, known as the biggest small town in New Jersey, are no strangers to severe challenges.
