Board of Education ruling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the Obama administration has taken steps against it, Cruz said.\n\n\u201cBrown was a landmark victory for justice, a unanimous repudiation of the oppressive doctrine of \u2018separate but equal,\u2019\u201d the Texas lawmaker said. \u201cSchool choice is the civil rights issue of our era.\u201d\n\nBudget proposals from President Obama have sought to eliminate the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program that provides tuition vouchers for students in Washington, D.C., to attend private schools, he added. The Justice Department has also fought Louisiana\u2019s private school voucher program, saying it threatens desegregation efforts in the state.\n\n\u201cSchool choice gives low-income children the same choices and opportunities that children from wealthy families have always had,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd school choice improves the public schools, making them stronger and more effective.\u201d\n\nIn the Brown decision, the court unanimously ruled that state laws separating schools by race violated the Constitution.\n\nOn Friday, Obama hosted NAACP Legal Defense Fund leaders and relatives of the families involved in the landmark case at the White House.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
