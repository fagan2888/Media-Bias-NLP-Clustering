Fifty-three-year-old Leo Bonten had a leg amputation earlier this year after slipping into a pool and breaking his right leg two years ago. Prior to his surgery, Bolton had a flash of inspiration: to have his amputated leg made into a floor lamp, instead of sending it to the incinerator.\n\nIn order to get the rights to keep his leg, Bonten endured a legal battle at the hospital about who is the rightful owner of his amputated limb, and whether it was even legal for him to keep it. Conventionally, an amputated limb \u201cbelongs\u201d to the hospital where it was removed, and the hospital is responsible for its disposal, according to the Mirror UK. If the hospital staff doesn\u2019t dispose of the human tissue, then they are in breach of legislation.\n\n\u201cMy leg is my property. People keep their kidney stones in a jar on the mantelpieces. Ashes of deceased people are included in tattoos. I\u2019m going to make a lamp of my leg,\" Bolton told NCR Reader, a Dutch publication. After Bonten eventually got approval to keep his leg, the amputee designed the real-life leg lamp with the help of forensic pathologist William Schaper Kotter and a lamp maker. The leg was fixed in formaldehyde inside a large cylindrical container and was used as the base of a large LED lamp. The lamp was being built as Bolton recovered from his surgery.\n\nBonten\u2019s amputation was used as a last resort after the 53-year-old underwent numerous surgeries for his snapped leg and complicated fractures. Leg amputations are performed when the patient has had an accident or their leg may have had a blood clot, infection, or disease, according to MedlinePlus. Unfortunately, he developed a bacterial infection that attacked his knee joint and gnawed away at his bones. Shortly after, Bolton\u2019s leg became a dead, stiff weight that needed to be amputated.\n\nLeo Bonten heeft zijn geamputeerde rechterbeen terug.

Sch\u00e4perk\u00f6tter was surprised he was so quick to sell the creative piece right after surgery. \u201cI am surprised. He wanted his leg to be made into a lamp because he could not say goodbye,\" he told NL Times. \"I thought that he would maybe want to sell the lamp in a few years, when he has processed the amputation completely. I did not expect it to happen so soon.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t start the bidding just yet though, eBay has pulled Bonten\u2019s listing, since it violates a rule against the sale of body parts. eBay\u2019s official policy reads: \u201cWe don't allow humans, the human body, or any human body parts or products to be listed on eBay, with two exceptions. Sellers can list items containing human scalp hair, and skulls and skeletons intended for medical use.\u201d\n\n\"Soon I won\u2019t even have a home where I can put the lamp,\u201d he told NL Times. For Bonten, selling his leg was a way he could deal with the loss and use the money to buy a bonic leg among other things. The amputee is currently looking for another way to sell his real-life leg lamp.\n\nWatch the video below (in Dutch) to see how the lamp was made.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "amputated leg, prosthetic leg, leg lamp, real-life, leo bonten, ebay", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Leo Bonten had a \u201cflash of inspiration\u201d before an amputation and made a real-life leg lamp with his disembodied body part to later sell on eBay.", "title": "Man Makes Amputated Leg Into Real-Life Lamp [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/leo-bonten-has-amputated-leg-made-real-life-lamp-sell-ebay-128k-my-leg-my-property-305286", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/man-makes-amputated-leg-real-life-lamp.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Leo Bonten had a \u201cflash of inspiration\u201d before an amputation and made a real-life leg lamp with his disembodied body part to later sell on eBay.", "title": "Man Makes Amputated Leg Into Real-Life Lamp [PHOTO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/leo-bonten-has-amputated-leg-made-real-life-lamp-sell-ebay-128k-my-leg-my-property-305286", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/man-makes-amputated-leg-real-life-lamp.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/26/man-makes-amputated-leg-real-life-lamp.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-09-26T17:44:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-26T17:44:24-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Leo Bonten had a \u201cflash of inspiration\u201d before an amputation and made a real-life leg lamp with his disembodied body part to later sell on eBay."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde13b\"", "article_summary": "The amputee is currently looking for another way to sell his real-life leg lamp.\nAfter Bonten eventually got approval to keep his leg, the amputee designed the real-life leg lamp with the help of forensic pathologist William Schaper Kotter and a lamp maker.\nFifty-three-year-old Leo Bonten had a leg amputation earlier this year after slipping into a pool and breaking his right leg two years ago.\nOne Dutch man\u2019s desperate times called for desperate measures when he built up the courage to sell his own disembodied right leg turned real-life leg lamp \u00e0 la A Christmas Story on eBay to settle financial debts.\n\u201cI would rather keep him, but I need the money,\u201d Bonten told NCR Reader."}
