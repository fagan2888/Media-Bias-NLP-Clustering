However, not every disaster area will qualify for both types of loans. And, economic injury loans are available even in cases where there was no physical damage sustained.\n\nDeadlines to apply and approved loan amounts can vary, depending on when the damage happened and financial need, as verified by SBA. Many of the deadlines for physical damage are in June and July. Economic injury deadlines generally are around early 2015.\n\nFor example, the SBA issued a press release on May 23 regarding disaster loans for residents in Escambia, Jackson, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa and Walton counties in northern Florida, an area that sustained damages due to storm damage from floods, tornadoes and strong winds that took place in late April and early May.\n\nSo far, nearly 180 loans valued at more than $7.6 million have been made to residents and business owners in the affected areas, according to SBA officials..\n\nEconomic injury loans can cover items such as payroll, fixed debts, accounts payable and other related expenses.\n\nA similar press release also was released for residents of the Alabama counties of Baldwin, Blount, Dekalb, Etowah, Jefferson, Lee, Limestone, Mobile and Tuscaloosa. About $5.7 million has been paid out in disaster loans.\n\nEconomic injury loans are available small businesses and most nonprofits in some adjacent counties in Alabama, Florida, Tennessee and Mississippi.\n\nDeadlines for these areas are July 1 for physical damage and Feb. 7 for economic damage.\n\nGetting assistance for disaster-related incidents can be done by calling the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Applying for relief loans can be done through the SBA website.\n\nGet Free Updates! Stay in the loop with a weekly newsletter, with all our news from the previous week.
