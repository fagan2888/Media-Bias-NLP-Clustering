New details were revealed in court Saturday about the man accused of shooting and killing a Bonita Springs man in front of his home on Friday.

Randy Marquardt, 51, is being held with no bond in jail.

He is charged with second degree murder and kidnapping.

"It's just scary. It really is," said neighbor Darlene Bithorn.

Neighbors were shocked to find out the man in the yellow house on Terry Street was in jail on murder charges.

"Sort of freaked out. I didn't sleep last night," said Bithorn.

A security specialist, neighbors say Marquardt kept to himself.

"You never see anything happen at that house. It's quiet," said Bithorn.

Deputies say Marquardt shot and killed 50-year-old Joseph Gales on Stoney Drive in Bonita Springs Friday morning.

He then took off.

Investigators say Marquardt drove to Fort Myers where his estranged wife was babysitting. He held her at gunpoint, kidnapped her and drove off in her car â€“ leaving an 8-month-old home alone.

Marquardt was found a short time later and was arrested.

More than 24 hours after the deadly shooting, deputies were still out securing the scene.

Saturday in court, startling new details from prosecutors described how Marquardt allegedly shot and killed Joseph Gales outside his home.

"Marquardt made the statement to the officer that he did not want any witnesses left to the shooting, so he hunted him down and shot him again," prosecutors said in court Saturday.

It is still unclear why Marquardt allegedly shot Gales.

According to prosecutors, Marquardt was going through a divorce and dealing with financial trouble.

"A lot of people under stress. No work, makes you do crazy things," said Bithorn.

Marquardt declined the use of a public defender, saying he will hire his own lawyer.

If convicted, he could face life in prison.
