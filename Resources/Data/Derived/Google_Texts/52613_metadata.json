Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication are the latest to weigh in the topic \u2014 but their focus is on advertising. In 2014, e-cig advertising totaled over a billion dollars in 2014 and it\u2019s expected to grow at a 50 percent rate over the next four years.\n\nAfter spending a year scouring the Internet for examples of e-cig ads \u2014 ads that strictly showed people inhaling or holding e-cigs, which is known as vaping \u2014 they selected 16 ads to show 900 former, intermittent, and regular smokers. Smokers were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: watching ads, watching audio-only ads, or taking a written survey. And afterwards, smokers in each condition took a survey to determine their smoking urges and cravings, their confidence to remain abstinent, and whether they actually smoked during the experiment.\n\nThe results showed regular and former smokers viewing ads with vaping craved tobacco more than regular and former smokers viewing ads without vaping. Former smokers in particular felt less confident they could refrain from smoking after viewing ads with vaping.\n\nAs for smoking during the experiment, 35 percent of daily smokers admitted to lighting up while watching ads with vaping versus 22 percent of daily smokers viewing ads without vaping and 23 percent of daily smokers not viewing any ads.\n\n\u201cGiven the sophistication of cigarette marketing in the past and the exponential increase in advertising dollars allotted to e-cigarette promotion in the past year, it should be expected that advertisements for these products created by big tobacco companies will maximize smoking cues in their advertisements,\u201d researchers wrote. \u201c...if not regulated, individuals will be exposed to much more e-cigarette advertising on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nResearchers added visual cues were what prompted daily smokers to act on their cravings. These visual cues include ashtrays, matches, lighters, and smoke. So the next step is for researchers to determine if it's a cigarette look-a-like producing the smoking cue, or if all types of visual cues produce the same effect. Study co-author Dr. Joseph N. Cappella said this is important, because \u201cthe jury is still out about the efficacy of e-cigarettes to reduce tobacco use and tobacco smoking.\u201d\n\n\"If it turns out to be the case that e-cigarettes are a good vehicle for reducing tobacco addiction, then we may not want to stand in the way of advertising e-cigarettes,\" he added. \"But it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t carry out that advertising without the vaping cues in order to not have deleterious consequences for former smokers...and current smokers in terms of their cravings for tobacco cigarettes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "e, cigarette, vaping, advertisements, makes, regular, and, former, smokers, crave, tobacco", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "There's a link between e-cig advertisements and tobacco cravings and behaviors.", "title": "E-Cig Ads Make It Hard To Stop Craving Tobacco", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarette-vaping-advertisements-makes-regular-and-former-smokers-crave-tobacco-325760", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/14/e-cigarette.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There's a link between e-cig advertisements and tobacco cravings and behaviors.", "title": "E-Cig Ads Make It Hard To Stop Craving Tobacco", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarette-vaping-advertisements-makes-regular-and-former-smokers-crave-tobacco-325760", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/14/e-cigarette.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/14/e-cigarette.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-14T18:04:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-14T18:05:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "There's a link between e-cig advertisements and tobacco cravings and behaviors."}, "article_summary": "The results showed regular and former smokers viewing ads with vaping craved tobacco more than regular and former smokers viewing ads without vaping.\nAs for smoking during the experiment, 35 percent of daily smokers admitted to lighting up while watching ads with vaping versus 22 percent of daily smokers viewing ads without vaping and 23 percent of daily smokers not viewing any ads.\nFormer smokers in particular felt less confident they could refrain from smoking after viewing ads with vaping.\n\u201c...if not regulated, individuals will be exposed to much more e-cigarette advertising on a daily basis.\u201dResearchers added visual cues were what prompted daily smokers to act on their cravings.\nSmokers were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: watching ads, watching audio-only ads, or taking a written survey."}
