Its total funding sits at $150 million.\n\nThe way Oscar Health Insurance competes with the established markets is pretty straightforward: Customers in New York and New Jersey can buy their coverage from the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Their website is slicker than the competition and lets its customers consult with doctors over the phone for free.\n\nOscar was founded by venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, an ex-Microsoft exec named Kevin Nazemi, and current CEO Mario Schlosser. Oscar was founded in July 2013, making the company a little less than two years old.\n\nIf true, this report would make Oscar Health Insurance the second member of the so-called Unicorn Club of startups that have raised $1 billion this week alone, after Sprinklr announced its own round of funding.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Matt Weinberger", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "It could be the second unicorn this week.", "creator": "gamoid", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/oscar-health-insurance-has-a-1-billion-valuation-2015-4", "image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/551c575becad04473164717f-506-253/oscar-is-a-new-york-based-health-startup-thats-less-than-2-years-old-and-it-may-soon-be-worth-1-billion.jpg", "title": "Oscar is a New York-based health startup that's less than 2 years old, and it may soon be worth $1 billion", "site": "sai", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "sai", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Startups, Oscar, Healthcare, Unicorns, Matt Weinberger", "description": "It could be the second unicorn this week.", "author": "Matt Weinberger", "sailthru.date": "2015-04-01", "sailthru.title": "Oscar is a New York-based health startup that's less than 2 years old, and it may soon be worth $1 billion", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/4c9cb8ee7f8b9a13550e0100-50-50/oscar-is-a-new-york-based-health-startup-thats-less-than-2-years-old-and-it-may-soon-be-worth-1-billion.jpg", "news_keywords": "Startups, Oscar, Healthcare, Unicorns, Matt Weinberger", "tbi-image": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4c9cb8ee7f8b9a13550e0100/oscar-is-a-new-york-based-health-startup-thats-less-than-2-years-old-and-it-may-soon-be-worth-1-billion.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-04-01", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/matt-weinberger"}, "sailthru.description": "It could be the second unicorn this week.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "It could be the second unicorn this week.", "title": "Oscar is a New York-based health startup that's less than 2 years old, and it may soon be worth $1 billion", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/oscar-health-insurance-has-a-1-billion-valuation-2015-4", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/551c575becad04473164717f-1190-625/oscar-is-a-new-york-based-health-startup-thats-less-than-2-years-old-and-it-may-soon-be-worth-1-billion.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Oscar is a New York-based health startup that's less than 2 years old, and it may soon be worth $1 billion", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/4c9cb8ee7f8b9a13550e0100/oscar-is-a-new-york-based-health-startup-thats-less-than-2-years-old-and-it-may-soon-be-worth-1-billion.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "sai"}, "article_summary": "Oscar Health Insurance, a New York-based startup trying to bring modern tech thinking into the health insurance industry, is in talks to raise a round of funding that would value it at more than $1 billion, according to Bloomberg.\nIf true, this report would make Oscar Health Insurance the second member of the so-called Unicorn Club of startups that have raised $1 billion this week alone, after Sprinklr announced its own round of funding.\nThe way Oscar Health Insurance competes with the established markets is pretty straightforward: Customers in New York and New Jersey can buy their coverage from the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.\nA few months later in May, Oscar closed an $80 million round of funding at a valuation of just under $1 billion, led by Joe Lonsdale of Formation8 and including Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst Partners, and others.\nOscar was founded by venture capitalist Joshua Kushner, an ex-Microsoft exec named Kevin Nazemi, and current CEO Mario Schlosser."}
