The two groups have, in the past, diverged when it comes to political issues: Unmarried women are more liberal, while married ones are more conservative, and there's a variety of reasons for that. But a new study suggests that this gap is best explained by \"linked fate,\" or a sense of female solidarity unmarried women feel in advancing women's status in the world.\n\nThe study, completed by researchers at Oregon State University and the University of Melbourne, was presented at the 110th Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association (ASA) this weekend. It found that unmarried women are more likely to feel that their individual success relies a lot on women\u2019s status in society as a whole, as a collective group. The researchers used data from the 2010 American National Election Study (ANES), comparing responses about political attitudes from married, never married, divorced, or widowed women over the age of 18. They found that married and widowed women shared similar political beliefs, while unmarried or divorced women were far more likely to have this sense of \u201clinked fate,\u201d or the idea that the collective status of women impacted their own lives.\n\n\u201cOver 67 percent of never married women and 66 percent of divorced women perceive what happens to other women as having some or a lot to do with what happens in their own lives,\u201d Kelsey Kretschmer, co-author of the study and assistant professor of sociology at Oregon State University, said in the press release. \u201cOnly 56.5 percent of married women hold the same views.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, widowed women still shared more conservative political views about women\u2019s status because they \u201care frequently older and never ruptured their relationships with their husbands by divorcing them,\u201d Kretschmer explained in the press release. \u201cThey may still be receiving their husbands\u2019 pensions, social security, or health benefits. In other words, despite not having a husband, many widows are still engaged in the marriage institution in ways that make them more like married women than never married or divorced women.\u201d\n\nThe notion of linked fate can be applied to minority groups like African-Americans and Latinos, who are more likely to share political views/beliefs and vote for the same candidate due to sharing the same societal impact. The marriage gap in women delineates which women are connected to this female sense of linked fate.\n\nThis linked fate group of women is more likely to be concerned with things that impact all women \u2014 not just them individually \u2014 including wage equality, women\u2019s rights in the workplace (maternity and pregnancy leave), and anti-domestic violence laws. \u201cFor a woman, when it comes to politics, having a high level of gender linked fate generally means she thinks in terms of what will benefit women as a group,\u201d Kretschmer said in the press release. \u201cNot every individual woman needs these things, but women who have a strong sense of gender linked fate will think in terms of how women as a group will benefit from them.\u201d\n\nThe question that remains is whether being single or married is better for your health. This is a debate that is different for everyone, but research has shown that marriage is good for your heart health, mental health, and longevity \u2014 as your spouse is often likely to push you to take care of yourself. The only health advantage that single people, generally speaking, have over married couples is a lower likelihood to gain weight and become obese.\n\nPerhaps the new study contributes to this discussion, as politically aware and active women can benefit mentally, emotionally, and physically from empowering themselves and others. And of course, you don\u2019t have to be single to empower yourself or married to do so, either.\n\nSource: Kretschmer K, et al. 110th Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association. 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "unmarried, women's rights", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Women who never get married are more likely to care about political issues that impact other women.", "title": "Why All The Single Ladies Care About Women's Empowerment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unmarried-women-are-more-politically-aware-concerned-about-womens-empowerment-349160", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/24/gender-equality.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Women who never get married are more likely to care about political issues that impact other women.", "title": "Why All The Single Ladies Care About Women's Empowerment", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/unmarried-women-are-more-politically-aware-concerned-about-womens-empowerment-349160", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/24/gender-equality.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/24/gender-equality.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-08-24T12:31:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T12:31:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Women who never get married are more likely to care about political issues that impact other women."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ece\"", "article_summary": "The marriage gap in women delineates which women are connected to this female sense of linked fate.\nIt found that unmarried women are more likely to feel that their individual success relies a lot on women\u2019s status in society as a whole, as a collective group.\nBut a new study suggests that this gap is best explained by \"linked fate,\" or a sense of female solidarity unmarried women feel in advancing women's status in the world.\nThis linked fate group of women is more likely to be concerned with things that impact all women \u2014 not just them individually \u2014 including wage equality, women\u2019s rights in the workplace (maternity and pregnancy leave), and anti-domestic violence laws.\nThe two groups have, in the past, diverged when it comes to political issues: Unmarried women are more liberal, while married ones are more conservative, and there's a variety of reasons for that."}
