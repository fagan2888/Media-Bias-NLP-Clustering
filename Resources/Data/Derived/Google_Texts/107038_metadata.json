Scores of happy dolphins swam alongside their boat.\n\nBut their peace soon turned to panic when one of the dolphins leapt up and fell into their boat, landing on top of Chrissie Frickman and breaking both of her ankles.\n\n\u201cIt hit my wife and knocked her over, and punched my daughter,\u201d Dirk Frickman told the Orange County Register. \u201cI had this 350-pound dolphin in my boat. There was no way to get it off the boat.\u201d\n\nHow family outing took 'bizarre' turn after dolphin lands in boat, breaks woman's ankles: http://t.co/pvXQNHq7Vt pic.twitter.com/MLyKuyVtND \u00e2\u20ac\u201d O.C. Register (@ocregister) July 1, 2015\n\nFrickman called the OC Sheriff\u2019s Department Harbor Patrol on the radio as he rushed the boat back to the harbor, and the officer came out to meet them. After getting Chrissie and their two kids safely onto the Harbor Patrol boat, Frickman stayed on the boat to splash water on the thrashing dolphin, bloodied with cuts on its nose and tail.\n\nTwo dock workers and Frickman tied a rope around the dolphin, pulled it up onto the dock, then untied the rope and released it back into the water. Frickman notes that \u201cthe dolphin was hopefully saved. It swam away with no problem.\u201d\n\nChrissie Frickman is now recovering from her broken angles, and her husband is taking time from work to take care of her. Though the event was scary, Dirk notes that it was overall a good lesson in safety.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s all so beautiful, but you have to remember it\u2019s still kind of wild,\u201d Frickman told the OC Register. \u201cFrom seven years watching them, dolphins have been so precise in their movements, but you just never know. Maybe you want to stay a bit farther away.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "family, outing, turns, bizarre, scenario, when, dolphin, jumps, boat, breaks, womans, ankle", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "When a family initially boated alongside some leaping dolphins, they were in for a surprise when one accidentally jumped into their boat.", "title": "Dolphin Jumps Into A Boat, Breaks Woman's Ankle [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/family-outing-turns-bizarre-scenario-when-dolphin-jumps-boat-breaks-womans-ankle-341040", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/02/family-outing-turns-bizarre-scenario-when-dolphin-jumps-boat-breaks-womans-ankle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When a family initially boated alongside some leaping dolphins, they were in for a surprise when one accidentally jumped into their boat.", "title": "Dolphin Jumps Into A Boat, Breaks Woman's Ankle [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/family-outing-turns-bizarre-scenario-when-dolphin-jumps-boat-breaks-womans-ankle-341040", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/02/family-outing-turns-bizarre-scenario-when-dolphin-jumps-boat-breaks-womans-ankle.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/02/family-outing-turns-bizarre-scenario-when-dolphin-jumps-boat-breaks-womans-ankle.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-02T12:22:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T12:22:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "When a family initially boated alongside some leaping dolphins, they were in for a surprise when one accidentally jumped into their boat."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2338\"", "article_summary": "There was no way to get it off the boat.\u201dHow family outing took 'bizarre' turn after dolphin lands in boat, breaks woman's ankles: http://t.co/pvXQNHq7Vt pic.twitter.com/MLyKuyVtND \u00e2\u20ac\u201d O.C.\n\u201cIt hit my wife and knocked her over, and punched my daughter,\u201d Dirk Frickman told the Orange County Register.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things where it\u2019s all so beautiful, but you have to remember it\u2019s still kind of wild,\u201d Frickman told the OC Register.\nScores of happy dolphins swam alongside their boat.\nAfter getting Chrissie and their two kids safely onto the Harbor Patrol boat, Frickman stayed on the boat to splash water on the thrashing dolphin, bloodied with cuts on its nose and tail."}
