A win by the plaintiffs, he writes, \u201cwould lead to absurd results that would discredit\u201d the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) \u201cand the cause of religious liberty.\u201d It could lead to, he argues, the end of religious exemptions if an overbroad ruling makes it impossible for legislators and government agencies to carve out reasonable ones.\n\nLaycock\u2019s brief is significant because he has long been seen as one of the staunchest and most thoughtful advocates for religious exemptions from state and federal mandates, including, recently, for religious objectors to same-sex marriage. He has written that the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 decision in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell\u2014in which the Court ruled that the contraception mandate violated the religious freedom rights of a closely held corporation\u2014was correctly decided. He had authored an amicus brief in that case in support of Hobby Lobby\u2019s position. But the nonprofit plaintiffs have a more difficult case to prove before the high court than the for-profit companies did.\n\nLaycock wrote the new amicus brief on behalf of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, one of the organizations weighing in on the reach of RFRA in Zubik v. Burwell, the group of cases challenging the health-care law, which the Supreme Court will hear next month. The Court has consolidated seven cases brought under RFRA by a cluster of religious nonprofits that includes the Archdiocese of Washington, the anti-abortion group Priests for Life, several evangelical universities, and the order of nuns known as the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nFederal regulators devised a system to permit religious objectors to opt out of providing and paying for the contraception coverage themselves. But the plaintiffs claim that this accommodation allowing them to notify their insurance carriers of their religious objections, triggering the carrier to provide coverage to the nonprofits\u2019 employees at no cost to the employer, still violates their religious freedom. (Only one court of appeals, the Eighth Circuit, ruled in their favor. Seven others sided with the government.)\n\nThe nonprofit cases are the final chapter in a protracted battle over the breadth of religious exemptions to the contraception coverage requirement that dates back to the health-care law\u2019s enactment five years ago. When the Department of Health and Human Services first issued the contraception coverage regulations in 2011, it exempted churches and their \u201cintegrated auxiliaries.\u201d But conservative activists sought also to exempt religious nonprofits, arguing that the law required these religiously affiliated organizations to be treated the same as houses of worship.\n\nInstead, HHS crafted an \u201caccommodation\u201d for religious nonprofits, enabling them to notify their insurance carriers to arrange and pay for the coverage, rather than exempting them entirely. The religious nonprofits claim that filling out the paperwork to notify their insurance companies imposes a substantial burden on their sincerely held religious beliefs, because it still involves them in arranging for the coverage.\n\nThe cases have become prime fodder in the culture wars, and a rallying point for religious conservatives up in arms over alleged infringements on religious liberty. In campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination, Texas Senator Ted Cruz has pledged to end what he calls the Obama administration\u2019s efforts \u201cto impose millions of dollars in fines against the Sisters, under Obamacare, in order to force the Sisters to pay for abortion-inducing drugs and others.\u201d\n\nLaycock\u2019s brief is remarkable because of the way it turns on its head the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the nonprofits are victims of an overreaching government. In fact, Laycock argues, \u201creligious liberty can be endangered by exaggerated claims and overreaching as well as by government intransigence and judicial under-enforcement,\u201d and that the nonprofits\u2019 arguments \u201cendanger religious liberty, both legally and politically.\u201d\n\nHolly Hollman, the Baptist Joint Committee\u2019s general counsel, said in an interview that her group is \u201cvery hesitant to oppose any good faith [RFRA] claim.\u201d (The BJC did not file a brief in the Hobby Lobby case, but notes in Laycock\u2019s brief that it believes the case was correctly decided.) But, Hollman added, for the nonprofits to prevail, \u201cthe Court would have to find that the government pursuing its interest in the contraception mandate through secular insurance companies is a substantial burden on the religious employer. That\u2019s a far different case than Hobby Lobby.\u201d\n\nIn their brief to the Supreme Court, the nonprofits describe the arrangement as the \u201csame mandate enforced by the same penalties as in Hobby Lobby, and it is a classic substantial burden on religious exercise.\u201d\n\nLaycock\u2019s brief, though, powerfully rejects this argument. He argues first that the nonprofits are, in effect, seeking \u201cabsolute deference\u201d from the court on their claims of substantial burden. He argues that adopting this standard \u201cwould lead to untenable consequences.\u201d\n\nFor example, he writes, a plaintiff could claim \u201cGod will punish the country and all its citizens,\u201d if a \u201ccontroversial public policy is not reversed.\u201d That \u201cwould state a claim of substantial burden to which the courts would owe absolute deference,\u201d the brief cautions.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Laycock warns, the nonprofits\u2019 overbroad argument that they are entitled to the same exemption as churches threatens the entire system of religious exemptions across the country. In addition to the federal RFRA, 32 states either have their own religious freedom laws, or interpret their state constitutions in accordance with the federal statute. Thousands of religious exemptions are codified in state and federal statutes and regulations. But that entire system, Laycock warns, is imperiled politically if courts do not \u201cdefer to reasonable efforts to draw such boundaries.\u201d\n\nEven if the remaining eight justices deadlock on the the question of whether the health-care law imposes a substantial burden on religious freedom Zubik could end up being decided in the government\u2019s favor. That assumes that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote in Hobby Lobby, remains consistent. In a separate concurring opinion in Hobby Lobby, Kennedy hinted that the accommodation was the least-restrictive way for the government to achieve its objective of ensuring copay-free coverage for contraception.\n\nWhatever the outcome, this brief by an erstwhile ally urging extreme caution on taking religious exemptions too far signals that the plaintiffs in these cases may have overplayed their hand.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The American Prospect", "description": "Conservatives have challenged the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate before the Supreme Court on the grounds that it tramples on their religious liberty, but a leading law professor argues that the abortion opponents\u2019 lawsuit would undermine freedom of worship in the long run.", "title": "How Contraception Court Challenge Hurts Religious Freedom", "url": "http://prospect.org/article/how-contraception-court-challenge-hurts-religious-freedom", "image": "http://prospect.org/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/zubik_v_burwell_1.jpg?itok=3YUasAyn", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "4dItj6FrXn-I63uD7pcvQKf3n3Qc6AIxiwwzo0_G4zk", "fb": {"admins": 431364, "app_id": 107113422697949}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale = 1.0, width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "In pointed language, Laycock calls the religious nonprofits\u2019 arguments a \u201cmortal threat\u201d to the future of religious freedom.\nThe cases have become prime fodder in the culture wars, and a rallying point for religious conservatives up in arms over alleged infringements on religious liberty.\nIn addition to the federal RFRA, 32 states either have their own religious freedom laws, or interpret their state constitutions in accordance with the federal statute.\nThousands of religious exemptions are codified in state and federal statutes and regulations.\nHe has written that the Supreme Court\u2019s 2014 decision in Hobby Lobby v.
