Wyden blasts CIA censorship\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Ron Wyden says the CIA is trying to blunt the impact of an upcoming Senate report examining the harsh treatment of Al Qaeda detainees by insisting on censoring the pseudonyms used for agency officers mentioned in the document.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence leadership are doing everything they can to bury the facts,\u201d said the Oregon Democrat, a Senate Intelligence Committee member who has been a frequent critic of the spy agency.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Senate, the CIA and the White House are negotiating over what should be blacked out for national security reasons in the 600-page summary of the report that is set for public release sometime after the November elections.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and other senior officials have said the CIA\u2019s use of waterboarding, stress positions, sleep deprivation and other harsh techniques on some detainees constituted torture. Many current and former CIA officers dispute that.\n\nThe Senate report asserts that the harsh treatment didn\u2019t work and that CIA officials misled Congress and other government agencies about it. Also to be released is a CIA response, and a separate one by Senate Republicans, which challenge the report\u2019s conclusions.\n\nCIA officials say they fear the publication of officer pseudonyms \u2014 often just a first name such as \u201cRoger\u201d \u2014 would lead to the unmasking of undercover officers. Readers could track the same person in different jobs and places, making it easier to discover their identity.\n\nWithout the pseudonyms, Wyden says, the report would be much harder to understand because readers wouldn\u2019t be able to distinguish different CIA officers. Readers wouldn\u2019t know, for example, whether same CIA official had been accused of lying multiple times.\n\nWyden pointed out that the 9/11 Commission Report and a 2004 report into abuses at Iraq\u2019s Abu Ghraib prison used pseudonyms for CIA officers.\n\n\u201cI think it is appropriate to redact specific identifying information so the identities of undercover officers are not publicly exposed,\u201d Wyden told The Associated Press.\n\nWyden said the Senate report documents \u201cfalsehoods, misdeeds and mistakes\u201d by the CIA.\n\nAsked about Wyden\u2019s remarks, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd said, \u201cPseudonyms are redacted to keep individual intelligence officers from being identified and potentially harmed. Making public those pseudonyms associated with individual officers, as well as dates, locations and other identifying information related to those officers, dramatically increases the likelihood that they will be exposed and potentially subject to threats or violence.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cThe intelligence leadership are doing everything they can to bury the facts,\u201d the senator says.", "title": "Wyden blasts CIA censorship", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/ron-wyden-cia-112127.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/03/30/140326_wyden_gty_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Oregon,Senate,Senate Intelligence Committee,Intelligence,Ron Wyden,Al Qaeda,CIA,Censorship,White House", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u201cThe intelligence leadership are doing everything they can to bury the facts,\u201d the senator says.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ed2\"", "article_summary": "Wyden blasts CIA censorshipWASHINGTON \u2014 Sen.
