Alcoa and Pepsico were among the companies kicking off the earnings season last week.\n\nCanada\u2019s gross domestic product shrank in April on oil and gas and mine production, surprising economists predicting a rebound following a first-quarter contraction. Amber Kanwar reports. BNN Video Video Video: GDP contracts due to reduced oil and gas production\n\nChristine Short, senior vice president of media at financial estimates firm Estimize, said her firm expects negative growth on both the top and bottom lines, with earnings per share contracting 3.5 per cent from the same quarter a year ago and revenues declining 2.1 per cent.\n\nThe stronger greenback cut into profits of multinationals in the first quarter of this year and that impact will continue to be felt.\n\n\u201cIt seemed as though every S&P 500 company was mentioning some sort of stronger dollar impact,\u201d Ms. Short said in an interview. \u201cThus far, about half the companies [that have reported] in the second quarter have still noted that they are seeing a hit to the bottom line because of dollar fluctuations.\u201d\n\nThe big five banks \u2013 JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America \u2013 are expected to report this week and into the next. The financial sector has the most companies in the index with 88, or roughly 17 per cent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re arguably in the peak housing season right now, so we\u2019ll be looking at Wells Fargo as the largest U.S. lender to see how mortgage originations are shaping up,\u201d said Ms. Short. She adds investment bankers should do well on the strength of increased M&A activity, and pegs financials\u2019 earnings growth at 2.7 per cent and revenues at 5 per cent.\n\nEarnings in the energy sector \u2013 which makes up 8 per cent of the index \u2013 are expected to be down 66 per cent year-over-year. Removing energy from the index, S&P 500 companies would see earnings expand by 3 per cent, Ms. Short said.\n\nBut the outlook for the energy sector has been on an upswing, with the sector seeing positive earnings revisions of late, noted Vincent Delisle, managing director of portfolio strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia.\n\nMaking up roughly 11 per cent of the index with 55 companies, health care is expected to see earnings growth of 13.5 per cent by Estimize\u2019s estimation. Recent developments, including the U.S. Supreme Court upholding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), have pushed health insurers toward consolidation, as illustrated by Aetna Inc.\u2019s pursuit of Humana Inc. and Anthem Inc.\u2019s bid for Cigna.\n\nMr. Delisle forecasts the health-care sector beating estimates easily, with an 11.4 per cent earnings gain this quarter.\n\nRecent developments in China and Greece also loom large this earnings season. Just under 10 per cent of the index\u2019s sales come from Asia Pacific, with a large portion of that from China.\n\n\u201cChina is more important to the S&P 500 multinationals than Europe is at this point,\u201d Ms. Short said. \u201cEurope\u2019s been suppressed for a while, so they\u2019ve [multinationals] expected that and the way they\u2019ve offset that weakness is through China.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s stock market was routed in recent weeks, sending retail investors into a tailspin as the government used its regulatory powers to prop it up.\n\n\u201cI think more than half the companies who have reported this quarter have talked about strengths out of China, how much they rely on it (for gross fees),\u201d Ms. Short said. \u201cMany companies such as General Mills are expanding some of their brands into China.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge piece of business revenue, and depending on how things deteriorate here, it could really change how the second half of the year looks.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "Strong dollar and oil price crunch are seen as main contributors to the expected overall decline in corporate revenue, profits", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Strong dollar and oil price crunch are seen as main contributors to the expected overall decline in corporate revenue, profits", "title": "Second-quarter results likely to show impact of strong dollar, energy sector woes", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/second-quarter-results-likely-to-show-contracting-us-economy/article25475587/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/4ed/report-on-business/international-business/article25475586.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/web-rb-cd-earnings-0712.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Strong dollar and oil price crunch are seen as main contributors to the expected overall decline in corporate revenue, profits", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/25475587", "iphone": "tgam://article/25475587"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2015-07-12 10:26:28 EDT", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "earnings;China;United States of America;second quarter results;corporate;banks;revenue;profit;U.S. economy;investors;", "article": {"onpage": 1, "engagement": "true", "comments": "false", "pages": 1, "type": "news", "id": 25475587}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "Removing energy from the index, S&P 500 companies would see earnings expand by 3 per cent, Ms. Short said.\n\u201cIt seemed as though every S&P 500 company was mentioning some sort of stronger dollar impact,\u201d Ms. Short said in an interview.\nMr. Delisle forecasts the health-care sector beating estimates easily, with an 11.4 per cent earnings gain this quarter.\n\u201cChina is more important to the S&P 500 multinationals than Europe is at this point,\u201d Ms. Short said.\nEarnings in the energy sector \u2013 which makes up 8 per cent of the index \u2013 are expected to be down 66 per cent year-over-year."}
