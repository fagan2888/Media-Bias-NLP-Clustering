This is the same abortion clinic facing a lawsuit for doing an abortion on a raped 13-year-old and returning her to her rapist.\n\nThe two investigative videos show Planned Parenthood facilities in Denver, Colorado offering disturbing and dangerous advice to what staffers think are underage girls. The counselors approvingly lay out in graphic detail a spectrum of sadistic sexual behaviors to the investigators, including \u201cwhipping,\u201d \u201ctying up,\u201d and \u201casphyxiation.\u201d\n\nOne Planned Parenthood counselor tells Live Action\u2019s investigator that a young girl using words like \u201cstop\u201d when she is uncomfortable \u201ccan get mixed up,\u201d resulting in the male partner wondering, \u201cDoes she really mean \u2018stop,\u2019 or does she mean, you know, whatever?\u201d The other concurs: \u201cUsually, a lot of people will say \u2018stop\u2019 even though it feels good, so that\u2019s usually not something that is used.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlanned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is already bragging about receiving ObamaCare grants specifically for sex education,\u201d Lila Rose, Live Action\u2019s president, said. \u201cHere\u2019s an abortion corporation, which gets 45% of its budget from the taxpayers, telling 15- and 16-year-olds not only to have sex, but also to choke each other in the process. Police should be busting down its door.\u201d\n\nNow, the attorney general of Colorado says he will have his staff review the Live Action investigative video. From Breitbart:\n\nAs observed by Wayne Laugesen at the National Catholic Register, despite Colorado Attorney General John Suthers\u2019 intentions to have the recent Live Action video reviewed, he lacks jurisdiction to do much if criminal activity on the part of Planned Parenthood is suspected. Instead, Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler has jurisdiction in the matter, and local authorities would need to pursue any charges. The video was released on July 15, just several weeks after a lawsuit was filed charging Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains with failing to report sexual abuse in the case of a 13-year old girl by her stepfather, Timothy David Smith, who brought her to the Denver Planned Parenthood facility and paid for her abortion on May 3, 2012. \u201cWe certainly are concerned with and follow up on mandatory reporting cases,\u201d Lynn Kimbrough, communications director for Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey, told the Register. \u201cThe process, though, would involve someone filing a criminal complaint. The simple fact of someone filing a civil suit that includes that allegation would not be enough, because we don\u2019t go trolling into the civil courts looking for criminal violations.\u201d The Register notes that the Littleton Police Department did not return multiple calls, nor did Planned Parenthood of the Rockies or its affiliate in Littleton.\n\nLive Action president Lila Rose told LifeNews she was delighted that the expose\u2019 video will be investigated further.\n\nRose said: \u201cWe are relieved to learn that authorities in Colorado are taking these tapes, and their shocking and extremely troubling contents, seriously. Parents of every political persuasion can come together and condemn an institutional ethos where sexual abuse of teens is portrayed as consensual sexual activity \u2013 where tax-funded counselors can recommend internet pornography and sex shops, and advise children on how to hide these things from their parents. We encourage every state to follow Colorado\u2019s example and investigate Planned Parenthood facilities in their jurisdictions.\u201d\n\nACTION: 1) Thank the attorney general at http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/ and 2) urge Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler to investigate Planned Parenthood at http://www.da18.org/DAsOffice/ContactUs.aspx", "article_metadata": {"description": "Attorney General to Investigate Planned Parenthood Teaching Teen Girl S&M Sex", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The Colorado Attorney General says he will investigate a shocking video that busted the Planned Parenthood abortion business, where its staffers are teaching te", "title": "Attorney General to Investigate Planned Parenthood Teaching Teen Girl S&M Sex, Gagging and Whipping", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/07/28/attorney-general-to-investigate-planned-parenthood-teaching-teen-girl-sm-sex-gagging-and-whipping/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/plannedparenthood50b-190x104.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "attorney general to investigate planned parenthood teaching teen girl s&m sex,attorney general to investigate planned parenthood teaching teen girl s&m sex", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5420\"", "article_summary": "We encourage every state to follow Colorado\u2019s example and investigate Planned Parenthood facilities in their jurisdictions.\u201dACTION: 1) Thank the attorney general at http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/ and 2) urge Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler to investigate Planned Parenthood at http://www.da18.org/DAsOffice/ContactUs.aspx\nIn a series of undercover audits, Live Action investigators documented Planned Parenthood counselors and nurses advising our investigators, who the Planned Parenthood staffers thought were minors, on how to practice torture sex.\nAs LifeNews reported earlier this month, Live Action staff pose as a 15-year-old at a Denver, Colorado-based Planned Parenthood abortion facility.\nThe two investigative videos show Planned Parenthood facilities in Denver, Colorado offering disturbing and dangerous advice to what staffers think are underage girls.\nThe Colorado Attorney General says he will investigate a shocking video that busted the Planned Parenthood abortion business, where its staffers are teaching teenagers about S&M-based sexual relationships and concepts such as gagging, whipping and asphyxiation."}
