Why he\u2019d target a county-run health center for the developmentally disabled was unclear: Because it represented the government, and Obamacare? Or, I admit it crossed my mind, because Donald Trump\u2019s vicious mimicking of a disabled New York Times reporter triggered some unspeakable reflex? (As it turned out, none of the victims were disabled.) Ad Policy\n\nAt that early point, Leon Wolf of the conservative Redstate.com was on the lookout for liberals like me jumping to conclusions\u2014as I was on the lookout for wingers who assumed it was Muslim terrorism. Wolf trolled \u201cbreaking: Mass Shooting in San Bernardino, Liberals on Twitter Ecstatic,\u201d and he ran \u201csome tweets from liberals who are involved in their favorite sporting event, pin the shooting on a conservative!\u201d To say anyone was \u201cecstatic\u201d is disgusting, but this meme then making the rounds did speak to me.\n\nAt the same time, though, the right was crossing its fingers and pleading, as it did during the previous week\u2019s Planned Parenthood attack: Please let it be a transgender leftist activist\u2014anybody but a white, pro-life, Christian male whom we\u2019ll have to fit into our \u201cmentally deranged and apolitical\u201d narrative.

The New York Post changed its cover headline from the cautious murder mission to the incendiary muslim killers. (Where was the Post headline christian killer for suspected Planned Parenthood attacker and self-described Christian Robert L. Dear Jr.?) Fox News anchors kept saying that Farook attacked his co-workers at a \u201cChristmas party,\u201d although most legit news sources described it as a \u201choliday party\u201d\u2014which is indeed what a government agency would call it. But Fox had found a seasonal twofer: Muslim terrorists (and their liberal symps) are leading the War on Christmas!\n\nWhat we have in these mass shootings, time and again, is each side accusing the other for prematurely pointing fingers.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dailynews_newyorkpost_img1-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Leslie Savan", "description": "Before we knew learned the identity of the shooters who massacred 14 people in San Bernardino, before we learned there was more than one shooter, I assumed that the gunman was another white, right-leaning domestic terrorist.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Before we knew learned the identity of the shooters who massacred 14 people in San Bernardino, before we learned there was more than one shooter, I assumed that the gunman was another white, right-leaning domestic terrorist.", "title": "Please Let the Shooter Be on the Other Guy\u2019s Team!", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/please-let-the-shooter-be-on-the-other-guys-team/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dailynews_newyorkpost_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2015-12-07T10:54:07+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before we knew learned the identity of the shooters who massacred 14 people in San Bernardino, before we learned there was more than one shooter, I assumed that the gunman was another white, right-leaning domestic terrorist.", "title": "Please Let the Shooter Be on the Other Guy\u2019s Team!", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/please-let-the-shooter-be-on-the-other-guys-team/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dailynews_newyorkpost_img1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dailynews_newyorkpost_img1-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "December 4th, 2015", "sailthru.title": "Please Let the Shooter Be on the Other Guy\u2019s Team!", "keywords": "guns and gun control, north america, political ideologies, politics, society, the constitution, the left, the right, 2015 san bernardino shooting, domestic terrorism, islamophobia, mass shootings", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 196581, "sailthru.tags": "Guns and Gun Control,North America,Political Ideologies,Politics,Society,The Constitution,The Left,The Right,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "mass shootings", "published_time": "2015-12-04T15:09:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-07T10:54:07+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/tparmar/"}, "sailthru.description": "We can't help but think that\u2014but only one team gets top-notch fear mileage.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/dailynews_newyorkpost_img1-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Or, I admit it crossed my mind, because Donald Trump\u2019s vicious mimicking of a disabled New York Times reporter triggered some unspeakable reflex?\nWhy he\u2019d target a county-run health center for the developmentally disabled was unclear: Because it represented the government, and Obamacare?\nBut Fox had found a seasonal twofer: Muslim terrorists (and their liberal symps) are leading the War on Christmas!\nWhat we have in these mass shootings, time and again, is each side accusing the other for prematurely pointing fingers.\n(Where was the Post headline christian killer for suspected Planned Parenthood attacker and self-described Christian Robert L.
