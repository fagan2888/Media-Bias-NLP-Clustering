Ted Cruz says anti-Obama sentiment is sweeping the nation and helping to fuel the grassroots movement behind his own presidential bid, and compares it to the revolution that powered Ronald Reagan to victory in 1980 over President Carter.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz is facing many Republican voters who fear he\u2019s more like Mr. Obama than Reagan, saying the GOP hopeful strikes them as an ideological warrior who would struggle to get things done in Washington.\n\n\u201cI think he is a lot like Obama,\u201d said Steve McMahon, 65, of Manchester, who is supporting Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cIf you disagree with him, he will beat you down, he will attack you, as opposed to saying \u2018Let\u2019s work together.\u2019 \u201c\n\nMr. McMahon, a financial adviser, said he shares a lot Mr. Cruz\u2019s beliefs, but questions whether the 45-year-old could get anything done given how he comes off as \u201cdivisive\u201d and \u201cangry\u201d and the way in which he has butted heads with members of both parties.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like him on his own side, and they don\u2019t like him on the other side,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a charge leveled first by Donald Trump, who said Mr. Cruz\u2019s own colleagues in the Senate don\u2019t like him.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Cruz does not have any endorsements of fellow senators \u2014 though none of them echoed Mr. Trump\u2019s attack on their colleague. By contrast Sen. Marco Rubio has garnered a half-dozen endorsements from fellow senators.\n\nAl Horvath, a 74-year-old from North Hampton, New Hampshire, who attended a Cruz rally at a car dealership here Thursday, said he likes how Mr. Cruz would not bend easy on principles, but said he also is taking into account a candidate\u2019s electability and ability to govern.\n\n\u201cI think [Rubio] might have an easier time getting along because of his personality, and it is likely that he might compromise a little bit more, but I don\u2019t think on anything serious. So yeah he might have an easier time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a factor. My gut tells me that he\u2019s got a better chance of winning.\u201d\n\nEven some disgruntled Democrats are willing to give Mr. Rubio a look, but not Cruz.\n\n\u201cI look at Cruz as somebody who is as bad as Obama,\u201d said Ellen Davis, of Hopkinton, who is hunting for a Republican to support in the general election. \u201cThey\u2019ve got their political ideology and it is so far on the [left and right] that they can\u2019t come and meet and do something for this country.\u201d\n\nBut for some Republicans, Mr. Cruz\u2019s unwavering approach to legislating is what\u2019s attractive about him.\n\n\u201cWhen he says he is going to do something, he does it,\u201d said David Smiley, 53, of Auburn. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t back down from his word.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz\u2019s solidified his rock star status among grassroots conservatives in 2013 when he held a 21-hour filibuster against Obamacare, and led an effort to defund the law that led to a 16-day partial government shutdown.\n\nThe move, however, frayed ties with fellow Republicans, who said Mr. Cruz was making promises to voters that were impossible for Congress to keep.\n\nMr. Cruz then flirted with further shutdowns by demanding Congress use the spending process to stop Mr. Obama\u2019s immigration plans and delete federal funding for Planned Parenthood. He also called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, a \u201cliar\u201d on the Senate floor.\n\nOn Wednesday, new House Speaker Paul D. Ryan \u2014 without mentioning Mr. Cruz \u2014 criticized \u201cvoices in the conservative movement\u201d who promised outcomes that were impossible to achieve with Mr. Obama wielding a veto in the White House.\n\nMichael Bloomer, a sheriff who lives in Windham, N.H., said this week he is voting for Mr. Cruz because of the way he has stood on principle, and said he is no fan of Mr. Ryan - though he acknowledged that the Cruz approach has not made him many allies inside Washington.\n\n\u201cThe establishment just doesn\u2019t want him,\u201d the 45-year-old. \u201cThe reason they are backing Rubio now is that he has already bent to them. With the Gang of Eight [immigration bill], he did exactly what they wanted.\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz, who scored a victory in Iowa\u2019s caucuses on Monday, has downplayed expectations for New Hampshire, where voters are more moderate on social issues.\n\nBut Mr. Cruz has received warm welcomes from large, electric crowds that have cheered his vows to rescind President Obama\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional\u201d executive orders, repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS and defeat the Islamic State terrorists.\n\nSpeaking in Nashua this week, Mr. Cruz said his win in Iowa was a victory \u201cfor millions of courageous conservatives across this country\u201d and likened the current political environment to the late 1970s when the Reagan coalition came together to end the Carter administration.\n\n\u201cThe same thing is happening here,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cAll across New Hampshire, all across this country, people are waking up and it took Jimmy Carter to give us Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the most long lasting legacy of Barack Obama is going to be a new generation of leaders in the Republican party who stand and fight for freedom, who stand stand and fight for the constitution, who stand for the Judeo-Christian values that built America,\u201d he said, sparking prolonged applause from the crowd.\n\nFrank Stoughton, a Cruz supporter, said he expects a President Cruz to forge new coalitions, saying the Texan is operating from a position of power because his arguments are based on the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThe question is: What is the right thing to do?\u201d Mr. Stoughton said. \u201cThat is a stronger impulse than what happens if he gets to be president.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
