After that date, according to a statement provided to the Observer by the CMS, \u201ccall centers operated by CMS contractors that have supported our effort to enroll millions of Americans in quality, affordable health coverage will be ramping down much of their activities.\u201d\n\nAccording to the statement, \u201cthe call center will staff up and down over the year to meet consumer demand and maximize operational efficiency.\u201d\n\nCMS officials said the call centers under contract to the agency have received more than 10 million calls from consumers seeking to obtain health insurance plans during the enrollment period, which opened in October 2013. The people hired to staff the call centers were considered seasonal workers.\n\nA spokesman for Fairfax-based General Dynamics declined to provide any information about the local call center. According to the county Economic Development Authority, the center employed 1,000 people in January, making it the county\u2019s 11th-largest private-sector employer.\n\n\n\nAs of March 1, more than 4.2 million people had signed up for health insurance through the new marketplace, which was created by the Affordable Care Act signed by President Obama in March 2010. The aim of the marketplace is to enable people who previously had no health insurance to obtain coverage.\n\n\n\nAmong the most controversial of the act\u2019s provisions is a penalty some consumers will face for not having insurance. Anyone who can afford to pay for health insurance but doesn\u2019t obtain coverage by the deadline will be charged a fee on their federal income tax next year, up to a maximum of $95 per person or 1 percent of taxable income, whichever is larger.\n\nThe penalty is set to increase annually. In 2015, it will be 2 percent of income or $325 per person, and from 2016 on, it will amount to 2.5 percent of income or $695 per person.\n\nIn addition, anyone who misses the deadline will have to wait until the next open enrollment period begins in October before signing up.\n\nFor detailed information about how the Affordable Care Act may affect you and how to get coverage if you need it, visit www.healthcare.gov or call 1-(800)-318-2596.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Chesterfield Observer", "description": "With open enrollment in the new government-administered Health Insurance Marketplace scheduled to close at the end of this month, more than 300 jobs are being eliminated at a call center in eastern Chesterfield County.", "title": "Hundreds to lose jobs at call center", "headline": "Hundreds to lose jobs at call center", "url": "http://www.chesterfieldobserver.com/news/2014-03-19/Front_Page/Hundreds_to_lose_jobs_at_call_center.html", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": "emma.breeden"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ourhometowninc", "description": "With open enrollment in the new government-administered Health Insurance Marketplace scheduled to close at the end of this month, more than 300 jobs are being eliminated at a call center in eastern Chesterfield County.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hundreds to lose jobs at call center"}}, "article_summary": "Hundreds to lose jobs at call center344 Obamacare workers to be cutBy Michael BuettnerWith open enrollment in the new government-administered Health Insurance Marketplace scheduled to close at the end of this month, more than 300 jobs are being eliminated at a call center in eastern Chesterfield County.\nIn addition, anyone who misses the deadline will have to wait until the next open enrollment period begins in October before signing up.\nThe aim of the marketplace is to enable people who previously had no health insurance to obtain coverage.\nAccording to the county Economic Development Authority, the center employed 1,000 people in January, making it the county\u2019s 11th-largest private-sector employer.\nA spokesman for Fairfax-based General Dynamics declined to provide any information about the local call center."}
