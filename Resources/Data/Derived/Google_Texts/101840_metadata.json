But this hasn\u2019t stopped them from attacking Democrats for pushing it as well. To wit, in South Carolina, the RGA is running ads against State Sen. Vincent Sheheen, who is challenging Governor Nikki Haley for the state\u2019s governorship.\n\n\u201cRemember this guy, Sheheen? Well first, Sheheen supported much of Obamacare. But then he refused to support the lawsuit to stop it,\u201d says the ad. \u201cNow, Vincent Sheheen wants to use Obamacare for a $2 billion expansion of Medicaid in South Carolina.\u201d Here\u2019s the full ad:\n\nIf last fall\u2019s gubernatorial election in Virginia was any indication, the Medicaid expansion will play a key role in Democratic efforts this year. The pitch is straightforward: The Affordable Care Act has its problems, yes, but it\u2019s foolhardy to reject federal funds and block health care for our poorest residents. If there\u2019s a strategy behind this RGA ad, it\u2019s to neutralize this appeal to self-interest by blurring the lines between the Medicaid expansion and \u201cObamacare.\u201d If a program takes money from Obamacare, then by the property of transference\u2014according to Republicans\u2014that program becomes Obamacare.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt this will work in South Carolina, where the law is incredibly unpopular. The question for Republicans is whether it plays in places where the public is amenable to something like the Medicaid expansion. What\u2019s more, this approach is interesting for what it says about the broader politics of the Affordable Care Act. If everything associated with the law is Obamacare, then it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where GOP lawmakers in GOP states are willing to do anything to implement the program. Opposition to the Affordable Care Act in toto might linger as a litmus test for conservatives.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "@jbouie"}, "keywords": "U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201403031630, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/jamelle-bouie", "description": "The new GOP attack on the Medicaid expansion is that it's indistinguishable from the dreaded Obamacare.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Everything is Obamacare!", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Everything is Obamacare!\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/03/everything-is-obamacare.html\",\"image_url\":\"\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/03/everything-is-obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-03T16:30:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"\",\"author\":\"Jamelle Bouie\",\"tags\":[\"u_s_politics0\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "tags": "u_s_politics0", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Jamelle Bouie", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-03T16:30:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/jamelle-bouiehtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/03/03/everything-is-obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The new GOP attack on the Medicaid expansion is that it's indistinguishable from the dreaded Obamacare.", "title": "Everything is Obamacare!", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/03/everything-is-obamacare.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/etc/clientlibs/dailybeast/img/logo/tdb_shareicon-16x9.jpg.dimg.jpg/67dd826.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/j/jamelle-bouie", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03a4\"", "article_summary": "If there\u2019s a strategy behind this RGA ad, it\u2019s to neutralize this appeal to self-interest by blurring the lines between the Medicaid expansion and \u201cObamacare.\u201d If a program takes money from Obamacare, then by the property of transference\u2014according to Republicans\u2014that program becomes Obamacare.\nThe new GOP attack on the Medicaid expansion is that it's indistinguishable from the dreaded Obamacare.\nIf everything associated with the law is Obamacare, then it\u2019s hard to imagine a world where GOP lawmakers in GOP states are willing to do anything to implement the program.\nWell first, Sheheen supported much of Obamacare.\nEight Republican governors have accepted the Medicaid expansion for their states\u2014and one of them, Chris Christie, leads the Republican Governors Association."}
