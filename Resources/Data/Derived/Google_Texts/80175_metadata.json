And the McDonald\u2019s point of view is not one that\u2019s always in sync with the White House policies he once defended.\n\nWhen Gibbs was President Barack Obama\u2019s press point man from 2009-2011, he defended the health care overhaul day after day as the controversial legislation made its way through Congress. McDonald\u2019s, with its over 3,000 small franchisees, has had issues with some of the law\u2019s requirements. Health care has been prominently featured on the company\u2019s lobbying reports, and its spending has soared: In 2009, McDonald\u2019s laid out $480,000 for federal lobbying; that spiked to $2.27 million by 2013 before dipping slightly to $2.1 million last year.\n\nThe company\u2019s position is bolstered by the excellent relationships it has built in Congress by giving generously \u2014 nearly $900,000 to congressional candidates in the 2014 cycle, plus generous gifts to the Democratic and Republican party committees. The company\u2019s PAC delivered slightly more to Republicans than Democrats.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, along with numerous other companies, received waivers from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in 2010 allowing it to keep minimum annual benefit amounts in their less expensive health care plans unchanged until 2014, when most of the ACA went into effect. The company had informed HHS that with higher required benefit amounts, \u201cit would be economically prohibitive for our carrier to continue offering\u201d those lower cost plans, known as \u201cmini-med\u201d plans. Shortly after receiving the waiver, Rich Floersch, the company\u2019s chief human resources officer, said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, that not having the mini-med plans \u201cwould have been highly disruptive to the company and our employees.\u201d\n\nVarious franchise restaurant owners under the umbrella of the International Franchise Association (IFA), including from McDonald\u2019s, have also sought to change a provision in the law that would impose penalties on employers with over 50 workers if insurance coverage isn\u2019t offered to those who work a minimum of 30 hours per week. In a 2013 survey of 25 McDonald\u2019s franchisees obtained by The Huffington Post, one such franchisee claimed that \u201cObamacare will negatively hit us like nothing else.\u201d\n\nActually, that position may not be such a problem for Gibbs, who said in a 2014 speech that he thought the law\u2019s employer mandate was \u201ca small part of the law\u201d and \u201cwill be one of the first things to go.\u201d Gibbs became an NBC News and MSNBC contributor after leaving the White House and co-founded a public relations firm, The Incite Agency.\n\nOther points of friction with his former employer will bubble up, of course. In December, the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s (NLRB) general counsel cited the company and some of its franchisees jointly in formal complaints over claims that employees were mistreated for taking part in union organizing and calling for wage increases \u2014 effectively claiming, in this case, that the actions of the franchisees were not independent of the corporation.\n\nIn April, McDonald\u2019s announced that it would raise the minimum hourly wage for workers at its corporate-owned locations (about 10 percent worldwide) by about $1, starting in July. The wage increases would not apply to McDonald\u2019s franchisees, though, and \u2014 averaging out at about $9.90 per hour after the increase \u2014 still doesn\u2019t quite meet the $10.10 hourly minimum that President Obama has called for in his last two State of the Union addresses.\n\nMany fast-food workers, including from McDonald\u2019s, rallied in September as well as after the company\u2019s announcement in favor of a $15 an hour minimum wage.\n\nStill, the company did win Michelle Obama\u2019s approval for putting more fruit and fewer fries in its Happy Meals a few years ago. And given Gibbs\u2019 communications chops and depth on the issues, executives at the corporate home of Ronald McDonald must be pleased with their latest hire \u2014 in fact, they\u2019re probably lovin\u2019 it!\n\nCorrection, 6/17: Due to a typo, this post originally said the NLRB\u2019s general counsel had issued complaints over \u201cclaims that employers were mistreated.\u201d We have corrected the sentence to refer to employees, not employers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "OpenSecrets Blog", "description": "In his new role as McDonald's global chief communications officer, former White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs will \"lead McDonald\u2019s in communicating clear, coordinated messages to internal and external constituencies, enhancing the brand and supporting corporate strategies,\"", "title": "McDonalds puts a smile on with Gibbs, whatever he may have said at White House podium", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.opensecrets.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AP110208131893.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-17T13:09:54+00:00", "url": "https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2015/06/mcdonalds-puts-a-smile-on-with-gibbs-whatever-he-may-have-said-at-white-house-podium/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Revolving Door", "published_time": "2015-06-10T17:00:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T13:09:54+00:00"}}, "article_summary": "And the McDonald\u2019s point of view is not one that\u2019s always in sync with the White House policies he once defended.\nWhen Gibbs was President Barack Obama\u2019s press point man from 2009-2011, he defended the health care overhaul day after day as the controversial legislation made its way through Congress.\nMcDonald\u2019s, with its over 3,000 small franchisees, has had issues with some of the law\u2019s requirements.\nMany fast-food workers, including from McDonald\u2019s, rallied in September as well as after the company\u2019s announcement in favor of a $15 an hour minimum wage.\nThat\u2019ll put Gibbs front-and-center conveying the company\u2019s perspective on a number of issues that are familiar to him, not the least of which is the Affordable Care Act."}
