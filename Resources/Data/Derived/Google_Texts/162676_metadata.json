And he wants to be on the road \u2014 but only when he feels like it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just kind of hopping in and out of things I want to do in New York or places like Denver, where I have some friends,\u201d said Buck, 57, over the phone recently. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be on tour for five to six weeks, so I\u2019m only doing some of the Baseball Project shows.\u201d\n\nThe Baseball Project, which headlines the Oriental Theater on Aug. 15 with Dressy Bessy and the Minus 5, is Buck\u2019s current gig, a supergroup that includes buddies Scott McCaughey (the Young Fresh Fellows), Mike Mills (R.E.M.) and Steve Wynn and Linda Pitmon of Dream Syndicate.\n\nThe band\u2019s third album of baseball-centric alt-rock/Americana ( titled, simply, \u201c3rd\u201d) was released in March to positive reviews, sporting song titles such as \u201cStats,\u201d \u201cBox Scores\u201d and \u201cThe Babe.\u201d\n\nAnd although Buck isn\u2019t a huge baseball fan himself, he appreciates the relatively low-key trappings of playing with a club band, as opposed to headlining stadiums and amphitheaters as he did in R.E.M.\n\n\u201cI enjoy doing smaller places and I like actually seeing the audience,\u201d Buck said. \u201cI\u2019m not in charge, don\u2019t have to do the set lists and they\u2019re not my songs. So by and large it\u2019s enjoyable to just show and up and go with it. There\u2019s less pressure than doing these really big songs that are important to me to get across. Plus we\u2019re friends and we hang out a lot anyway, so we might as well make music.\u201d\n\nBuck has known most of the band members of the Baseball Project for at least three decades, leading to an effortless rapport in the studio and on stage that comes through in Baseball Project tracks such as their plucky, Ramones-indebted cover of \u201cTake Me Out to the Ball Game.\u201d\n\nBuck admires his musical friends\u2019 obsession with the sport \u2014 its distinctly American lore, its endless stats and debates \u2014 but also feels the music is self-contained, despite the subject matter.\n\n\u201cScott and Steve kind of treat the baseball players like Old West gunfighters. It\u2019s more about the legends and stories than baseball itself, because it really encompasses a lot of what America was in the 1920s and \u201930s,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of friends in England who like the records but don\u2019t know anything about baseball.\u201d\n\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnwenzel\n\nTHE BASEBALL PROJECT.
