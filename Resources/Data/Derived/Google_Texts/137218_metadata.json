Navigators attended training sessions in Austin to understand how to help people enroll in the health care exchange.\n\nStill, the process is not perfectly clear, Anaya said.\n\nThe marketplace plans do not encompass everyone's needs according to income levels, and they are sure to change as the government works out the kinks in the new health care system, Dahlquist said.\n\nOne of those kinks turned out to be a significant gap between those who do not qualify for subsidies through the exchange and those who would qualify for Medicaid if Texas had agreed to expand its Medicaid program.\n\n\"We have a lot of people who are not going to qualify for the marketplace but would qualify for Medicaid,\" Dahlquist said.\n\nIn some other states, those people could receive health insurance through Medicaid, but because Texas did not expand its Medicaid program, their only options are to pay the full price of a marketplace plan or go without insurance and pay a penalty.\n\nThe penalty is $95 per adult or 1 percent of a year's income, whichever is greater, for the first year and increases each year.\n\nThere are exemptions to paying the penalty for certain hardships, such as people who qualify for Medicaid but live in a state that has not expanded its program.\n\nRussell Reado found himself looking up from that gap Tuesday.\n\nThe 63-year-old Port Arthur resident does not have health insurance, and it does not look like the Affordable Care Act is going to change that.\n\nReado lives on $766 a month. He retired from working at the local refineries years ago, leaving his comfortable company-sponsored health insurance behind. Yet he still earns too much with his social security checks to qualify for a subsidy through the marketplace, according to a subsidy calculator on the website of the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent, nonprofit health care policy research organization.\n\nReado's income is equal to 80 percent of the federal poverty level. Because Texas did not expand its Medicaid, he is also not eligible for assistance through the government assistance program.\n\nUnder a silver-level plan in the marketplace, Reado would pay $7,521 a year for insurance coverage. That is about 82 percent of his yearly income, exempting him from paying the penalty for not having insurance. The silver plan would cost him about $626 a month, leaving less than $150 for living expenses - a price he said he definitely could not afford.\n\nHe could pay $5,144 a year with a bronze-level plan, which has a lower premium but higher co-pays.\n\nAs it is, Reado has to ration out his funds when he does need to see a doctor. He goes to the Gulf Coast Health Center in Port Arthur for doctor's appointments where he can get in relatively quickly. Reado made his Tuesday appointment on Friday, and it cost $175.\n\nRight now, Reado can't afford the plans on the insurance exchange. He said he needs more than $139 a month to live on.\n\nAnita Hassan and Lora Hines contributed to this story.\n\nBCrum@BeaumontEnterprise.com Twitter.com/broocrum", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Glitches with Tuesday's long-awaited rollout of the online insurance marketplaces under the Affordable Care Act prevented Texans and others nationwide from obtaining information about coverage plans and rates.
