We\u2019re already operating at narrow profit margins as it is.\u201d\n\nThat Medicaid pay increase, though, will disappear in January if the budget recommendation from the Georgia Department of Community Health to the governor and state Legislature holds up during the state\u2019s budget process.\n\nThe proposal approved by the Community Health board last week for this fiscal year and next did not include what experts estimate as $50 million to $70 million in annual state funding to extend the pay hike for primary care doctors treating Medicaid patients.\n\nCurrently, the pay raise is being funded entirely by the federal government, as a provision of the Affordable Care Act, bringing doctors\u2019 pay for Medicaid up to the level of Medicare.\n\nThe additional reimbursement, which goes to family physicians, pediatricians and internists, is scheduled to run out at the end of December.\n\nDoctors say if that cutoff happens, Georgia\u2019s poor will find it harder to find a physician to treat them. Roughly 60 percent of Georgia physicians currently accept Medicaid patients.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gov. Nathan Deal, Sasha Dlugolenski, recently said in an email that the \u201cgovernor will be developing his budget recommendations throughout the fall and is aware of this issue \u2013 one of the early, blatantly obvious examples of Obamacare unloading costs onto the states. This was a short-term Band-Aid to a long-term problem, and now the states are left holding the bag.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Judson Hill, R-Marietta, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he supports compensating doctors fully for treating Medicare and Medicaid patients. But he told the newspaper that he is opposed to the state \u201cbeing forced\u201d to picking up the entire cost of maintaining the pay increase.\n\nTAKING NEW PATIENTS\n\nFor Church, going back to the former pay rate would be a big setback.\n\nThe area around Hiawassee, in the scenic Blue Ridge Mountains near North Carolina, gets its main revenue from tourism. But the population base is small, and many residents have low incomes. The area has a severe physician shortage, Church said, and roughly 30 percent of his patients are Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary,\u201d said Church. \u201cYou have to be able to pay staff and overhead\u201d to keep a practice going.\n\nRecently, two physicians moved out of the area.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only doctor taking new patients in the community,\u201d he said.\n\nInadequate payment, Church said, \u201cmakes it difficult for new providers to choose service to vulnerable groups, even if their heart is there.\u201d\n\nThe federal health law required that the raise be paid for two years, 2013 and 2014. But the money didn\u2019t arrive until this year.\n\nEligible doctors received the pay hike retroactively, back to Jan. 1, 2013. Delays in the payments occurred in many states, including Georgia, that use managed care in their Medicaid programs.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study estimated in 2012 that the increase in Georgia\u2019s Medicaid payment rate for doctors would be 48 percent.\n\nA handful of states have announced they will continue to pay the higher rate in 2015 out of their own budgets. The six states include Alabama and Mississippi, according to a recent Kaiser Health News article.\n\nThe Medical Association of Georgia said it\u2019s studying the impact of the loss of the extra pay in terms of physician participation in Medicaid. When fewer doctors participate in Medicaid, fewer patients have access to care.\n\nHARD CHOICES FOR PHYSICIANS\n\nDr. Evelyn Johnson, a Brunswick pediatrician, said losing the pay hike would be devastating for physician practices.\n\nA large majority of her patients in Georgia\u2019s coastal region are on Medicaid. Johnson, president of the Georgia chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said if the pay reverts to the former rate, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to take new Medicaid patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trained to serve the underserved,\u201d Johnson said. But she adds, \u201cThere are only so many patients I can see in a day. If kids can\u2019t get into a doctor to be seen, they will wind up in urgent care or the emergency room,\u201d which will run up higher costs for the state.\n\nMany physicians don\u2019t take Medicaid patients, or limit the number they will take, noted Johnson, a solo practitioner.\n\nExtending the pay raise \u201cis the right thing to do,\u201d Johnson said. Children, who make up the majority of Georgia\u2019s Medicaid beneficiaries, need the medical foundation that pediatricians provide, she adds.\n\nEnjoy Georgia Health News?
