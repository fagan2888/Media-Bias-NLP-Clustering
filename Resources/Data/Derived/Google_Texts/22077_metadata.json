While the first mailer tried to blame Obamacare for Ohio\u2019s horrible job growth under Kasich, the new one lists Kasich\u2019s favorite campaign talking points, all of which have been debunked again and again. Let\u2019s go through them one-by-one, shall we?\n\n\n\nEliminated $8 billion budget shortfall\n\nOhio never had an $8 billion budget deficit in any way, shape or form. We\u2019ve debunked this claim half a dozen times now. as has the Plain Dealer when they recently fact-checking a Josh Mandel ad making the same claim. Also debunking this claim? Kasich\u2019s own budget director.\n\nAnd the State\u2019s OBM reports that the Ohio\u2019s GRF debt load has actually grown by half a billion in the first three fiscal years of John Kasich\u2019s Administration.\n\n\n\nRestored Ohio\u2019s \u201cRainy Day\u201d Fund\n\nSure, Kasich put some money back into the Rainy Day fund. And the first payment came from the budget SURPLUS created by Ted Strickland\u2019s last budget. From the Columbus Dispatch: \u201cThe first payment the Kasich administration made to the rainy-day fund \u2014 $246.9 million in July of 2011 \u2014 came at the completion of the last two-year budget former Gov. Ted Strickland signed into law.\u201d\n\n\n\nReduced the Size of Government\n\nThis one is full on laughable. Kasich grew Ohio\u2019s GRF debts by half a billion dollars and he increased state spending by over 12 billion dollars!. Again, don\u2019t just take our word for it, listen to what Kasich\u2019s budget director told the Washington Post:\n\n\u201cBy one measure, state spending has increased by 23.9 percent since Kasich took office. But Tim Keen, director of the Ohio Office of Budget and Management, said that number is misleading because it reflects high and distorted growth percentages for Medicaid and debt-service spending. Adjusted for those factors, he said, spending has increased only 12.7 percent.\u201d\n\n\n\nCut Taxes for Every Ohio Family\n\nCleveland Crain\u2019s covered this point best when they called Kasich \u201ca Tax Shifter, Not Tax Cutter.\u201d\n\n\u201cGov. John Kasich likes to portray himself as a tax-cutting crusader. It is a misleading representation. He is more an illusionist, a master of taxation sleight of hand,\u201d writes Crain\u2019s. \u201cThe reality is, the governor is a tax shifter. He is adept at transferring the burden of taxation from one party to another while giving the appearance of reducing taxes.\u201d\n\nWhile Kasich may have helped push through a small income tax cut, he paid for it by increasing sales and other taxes and gutting the local government fund, which ultimately ended up increasing local taxes on Ohioans. Kasich billed his income tax cut as a job creation effort, meanwhile Ohio\u2019s job growth has lagged the nation for 23 straight months.\n\nCut Tax for Ohio Small Business\n\nColumbus Entrepreneur Elizabeth Lessner summed this one up nicely. \u201cLet\u2019s set one thing straight because there\u2019s a lot of misinformation out there,\u201d she wrote. \u201cJohn Kasich is terrible for small Ohio businesses.\u201d Lessner points out overcharging by BWC, increased payroll taxes, CAT tax rates that have quadrupled, an increased sales tax and higher energy costs.\n\nAnd that one tax cut that Kasich did get into the budget, the one he calls his small-business tax cut, really did nothing to help create jobs or help the majority of small businesses. Instead it helped a handful of lawyers, hedge-fund managers and investors \u2013 many from out-of-state \u2013 put profits back into their pockets.\n\nIO and Policy Matters Ohio both provided a thorough analysis of the proposal, which would give most small business owners a tax cut of less that $450.\n\nFull images of the mailer are included below.
