A hugely bestselling book by Michael Lewis and a popular, critically acclaimed movie starring Brad Pitt, both named Moneyball, will always be synonymous with those A\u2019s. Those A\u2019s famously had no superstars; they won 103 games by acquiring bargain-price players who excelled in often overlooked statistics such as on-base percentage. They won the American League West, losing finally in the playoffs to a wealthier, big-market team.

Even after losing Jason Giambi to free agency (and to the New York Yankees after 2001), the A\u2019s had several players who were in the superstar category; shortstop Miguel Tejada was in fact the league\u2019s MVP for the 2002 season. Third baseman Eric Chavez had 34 home runs and drove in 109 runs, and their powerhouse trio of starting pitchers\u2014Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Mark Mulder\u2014won 57 games. For some never-explained reason, these five players were scarcely mentioned in Michael Lewis\u2019s book and not at all in the movie. Some of the Athletics\u2019 key players, like Scott Hatteberg, were not acquired at bargain prices; in 2001 Hatteberg was paid a little over $1 million by the Red Sox and over the next three seasons with Oakland he made almost $5 million. Moreover, the 2002 A\u2019s didn\u2019t have an exceptional OBP, finishing 5th in the AL. They won because of their pitching, which delivered the lowest ERA in the American League. And they didn\u2019t lose in the playoffs to a bigger-market team; they lost to a smaller one, the Minnesota Twins. According to Forbes, for the 2002 season Oakland\u2019s operating budget was No. 24 at $172 million with an operating income of $6.6 million while the Twins were ranked 27th at $148 million with an operating income of $400,000.\n\nWell, as Maxwell Scott says in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, \u201cWhen fact becomes legend, print the legend,\u201d and there\u2019s no doubt the printed legend surrounding the 2002 A\u2019s will continue to overshadow the facts. What is peculiar, though, is that Billy Beane\u2019s A\u2019s this year really are a \u201cmoneyball\u201d team. They just clinched the American League West with a .596 win-loss percentage\u2014second in the league only to the Red Sox. During September they are 16-5. And they are doing it with a payroll of $60,664,500\u2014the fourth lowest in the major leagues and less than half of the payroll of their downstate league rivals, the Los Angeles Angels, who currently trail the A\u2019s by 16\u00bd games. And they\u2019ve done it all without any superstars. The A\u2019s are arguably the most no-celebrity team among the pennant contenders; most of their players are barely household names in their own households. No one has summed up the team\u2019s success better than Suzuki, who recently told reporters, \u201cMy teammates would be kind of like, 'How are we going to compete?\u2019 We don\u2019t think that way anymore, we just think \u2018Let\u2019s go out and win.\u2019\u201d No team has gotten more return on less investment. Outfielder Coco Crisp (who will take home $7 million this year) has hit 22 home runs and will finish the season with score more than 90 runs scored. Third baseman Josh Donaldson ($492,000) has 24 home runs and has hit over .300 for most of the season. Forty-year old Bartolo Colon (salary: $3 million) has been amazing, with a 17-6 record and a league-leading ERA of 2.64. The Athletics\u2019 fist-pumping closer, Grant Balfour ($4.5 million), a 35-year-old Australian and a much-traveled veteran of four major-league teams, has an ERA of 2.72 with 38 saves. Beane got set-up man Ryan Cook ($505,000) even cheaper; Cook has posted an ERA of 2.59 in 68 games. First baseman Brandon Moss ($1.6 million), age 30, also a veteran of four big league teams, has 27 homers. Yoenis Cespedes ($8.5 million), a Cuban immigrant who was 2012 Rookie of the Year runner up, has hit 26 home runs. And no Oakland A has delivered more wins per dollar than 25-year-old A.J.
