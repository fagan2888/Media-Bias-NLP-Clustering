Jeff Deem said.\n\nThe Crusade has raised money since 1954 to support the region's children. Its largest fundraiser \u2014 an annual telethon \u2014 takes place the first full weekend in June.\n\nFirefighters have long been associated with the organization, and residents have come to expect them and the iconic black boots accepting donations.\n\nDeem and Sgt. Scott Hoover take shifts raising money near the KFC Yum! Center, 4th Street Live and downtown hospitals. They see people search their cars, dumping change and whatever is attached to it \u2014 cigarette butts, gum \u2014 into the boots.\n\n\"We'll take it, as long as it supports the kids,\" Deem said.\n\nDeem, Hoover and other members of Louisville's 2nd Battalion stayed out of traffic Saturday as they collected donations beneath the Big Four Bridge as part of Chillers Microcreamery's ice-cream social.\n\nThe local business hoped to break the world record for largest ice-cream party, with all proceeds going to the Crusade.\n\nChillers is a multi-generational family business that has supported Crusade in the past, district manager Derek Young said. As the company continues to grow, its owners wanted to take their support to the next level.\n\nDerek and Trevor Young started planning Saturday's event a year in advance and said they were happy with the turnout. The exact number of attendees wasn't available, but about 700 tickets were sold in advance \u2014 raising about $3,500 before ice cream even entered the picture.\n\nAt the event, families could receive free ice cream and donate to firefighters waiting with open boots. They then sat in rows of white chairs while music played.\n\nShortly after 2 p.m., the audience posed for a photo, which will determine if Chillers broke the record \u2014 previously set with 784 people.\n\nJeffersonville resident Heather Henderson-Gilligan had her children, niece and nephew wear matching orange shirts so they could be spotted in the picture. She said she enjoyed the event and hopes it becomes an annual part of the Crusade.\n\nDeem said people were generous this year, and Hoover's freezer bag full of cash proved it.\n\nWith the donations received the day of the event, Trevor Young estimated the event topped $5,000.\n\nReporter Bailey Loosemore can be reached at (502) 582-4646.
