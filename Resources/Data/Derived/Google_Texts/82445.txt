Pollster and chair of the Ted Cruz-aligned PAC “Keep the Promise” Kellyanne Conway says Democrats helped sabotage Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s career by wedding him to the Gang of Eight amnesty bill and putting him on the opposite side of voters on a crucial issue.

“He’s often seen by some voters as not serious, as immature, as a little bit naive,” Conway said on Breitbart News Daily Friday. “You see him at that Gang of Eight podium — and you see Chuck Schumer… You see Chuck Schumer off to his left. You can almost see the saliva coming out of Chuck Schumer’s mouth, because he’s like, ‘We got this guy! This guy will never be president now. We’ve got him dead-to-rights. He is molding, leading, authoring, and shepherding through this amnesty bill that his base will never accept.’ Chuck Schumer knew that. And Marco Rubio didn’t.”

As conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly noted, Rubio worked tirelessly to sell the immigration bill, which would have tripled already extreme levels of legal immigration to three million per year, given legal status to violent gang members and sex offenders on top of the tens of millions of illegal alien unlawfully present in the nation, rewarded and strengthened sanctuary cities, transferred wealth from workers to corporations, and given “virtually unchecked authority to executive branch officials to prevent future removals,” as ICE officer Chris Crane warned.

Rubio’s “deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded Obama’s claims about disastrous Obamacare,” Schlafly wrote in a fierce report detailing the freshman senator’s attempts to pass a bill that would cost taxpayers at least $6.3 trillion.
