It should open next spring.\n\nIt will be built across from Shepherdsville City Hall on Conestoga Parkway.\n\nLast summer, Shepherdsville and Bullitt County officials rezoned the store\u2019s 25-acre property from general industrial and light industrial to B-1 Highway Business.\n\nIn July, Shepherdsville Mayor Scott Ellis said paperwork required for various state permits delayed construction, but the store could open as soon as fall 2014.\n\nAdditional permits needed to build the fuel station further delayed the project, Ellis recently said, but the construction is finally ready to begin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this thing for about two and a half years, maybe a little bit longer,\u201d Ellis said, noting that Wal-Mart looked at multiple locations before settling on Conestoga Parkway, visible from Interstate 65.\n\nDesigns for the building went through the Bullitt County code enforcement department but were not required to be voted on by any city or county commission, Ellis said.\n\nEllis said Wal-Mart will provide Bullitt County residents a closer grocery shopping option instead of having to drive to the nearest Louisville location, located just outside the county\u2019s boundaries on Preston Highway, north of Hillview.\n\n\u201cAnything we can do to keep people from leaving Shepherdsville and Bullitt County,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nThe store will also create new jobs for the company, Jones said, though the number is unclear.\n\nReporter Bailey Loosemore can be reached at (502) 582-4646.
