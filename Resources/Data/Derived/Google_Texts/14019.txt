Belmar’s Chick-fil-A restaurant is opening Thursday April 10 at 6 a.m with a chance to win a year of free Chick-fil-A meals for 100 customers.

The line opens 6 a.m. Wednesday at the store at 565 S. Vance St. in Lakewood. If there are more than 100 people in line, there will be a drawing. Those who are selected must camp out to keep their spot.

The first 100 adults in line Thursday morning will receive a gift card with 52 meals consisting of a Chick-fil-A sandwich, medium waffle fries and a medium drink.

The Atlanta-based chicken chain — known for its bovine mascots that implore consumers to “Eat Mor Chikin” — has been expanding in Colorado.

Belmar will be the fourth location to open in the state in four consecutive weeks, including Highlands Ranch, which opened March 20; Greeley, which opened March 27; and Greenwood Village, which opened April 3.

According to Chick-fil-A representatives, the new Belmar store will bring about 80 new jobs.

Chick-Fil-A franchise owner/operator Matt Zuschlag will also be holding a food and school supply drive at the Action Center, 8755 W. 14th Ave. on Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Those who donate school supplies or canned or boxed protein goods will receive a gift card for one free Chik-fil-A meal.
