They\u2019re a large group of nurses from National Nurses United, and their vehicle is called the Bernie Bus. That\u2019s right: They\u2019re riding a big, red bus across the country in an effort to educate voters on the candidate\u2019s stand on single-payer health care, the Canadian-style system that takes decisions out of the hands of insurance companies and puts them in the hands of healthcare practitioners. Of course, Sanders\u2019 platform is full of long-neglected planks that traditionally belong to the Democratic Party, such as jobs programs, checking Wall Street excesses, making college affordable, and more. But single-payer has long been an issue that nurses, especially among nurse\u2019s unions. And that brought us into a phone call with Jean Ross, an acute care nurse at Fairview Southdale Hospital in Minnesota \u2014 at least when she isn\u2019t barnstorming around the country in support of candidate Sanders as co-president of National Nurses United in the union\u2019s Bernie Bus.So, you\u2019re really riding around on a bus supporting Bernie Sanders\u2019 stand on single-payer?Basically everything that is on Bernie\u2019s platform is part of what we call our Main Street Contract. So single-payer is huge on our list. The Robin Hood tax is huge on our list. Basically everything that will benefit public health is on Bernie\u2019s platform and therefore it\u2019s on ours.What\u2019s the Robin Hood tax?It\u2019s a tiny financial transaction tax on some of the riskiest of trades on Wall Street, those that are made by computers every millisecond, and the ones that are responsible for really tearing apart our country in \u201908. Everything you and I do, we pay a sales tax on, but these traders pay nothing every time they do what they do for a living. And so it would sort of disincentivize the riskiest of trades, and kind of put back some of the money back into productive investment that those traders have taken away out of the system.And single-payer insurance is something different again from the Affordable Care Act, which was about giving people access to health insurance.Absolutely. We\u2019re very careful to try not to criticize the Affordable Care Act too much because it\u2019s what we have, and it did insure so many millions more, of course. But I think people forget, other than Bernie, that there are still so many of us underinsured. And our goal as nurses for people in this country was never to ensure that everybody had insurance, it was to ensure that everybody was entitled to care, cradle to grave.What special message do you have for people living in Detroit?Well, you know, we do our thing as nurses, we do educate them, it\u2019s part of our job as nurses. But we also listen. I think that\u2019s part of where we get most of our assessment of what\u2019s wrong with patient, or what\u2019s wrong with society.When I was a young nurse, it was so simple. You got somebody who was ready to leave the hospital, you gave them discharge instructions, and you said, \u201cOK, you come back at a certain point to see this doctor and we\u2019ll check this out.\u201d Now, you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever see these people again because they don\u2019t have a home to go to. If they\u2019re lucky, they\u2019re living out of their cars. We didn\u2019t use to see that years ago. People are worrying about paying for meals and their medications versus paying their rent. They have to make choices.The environmental hazards, which is another thing we really appreciate about Bernie Sanders. Those are the kind of things that people talk to us about: \u201cI\u2019m sicker than I used to be. My kids have asthma.\u201d We didn\u2019t have asthma in the family when I grew up. Well, you got all these pollutants, and now of course the lead crisis in Flint. What do we expect will happen? Whenever you put profits over people, you are going to continue to see this, and unfortunately, apparently, some of us matter more than others. Because if you\u2019re poorer, the poorest of the poor, the people of color, especially black, you are not going to get the same kind of care, if you get it at all, that you will, that people in other communities will.Where will you stop in our area?We\u2019ll be stopping in places along the way, like Wayne State University, Eastern Market, definitely in Flint \u2014 we\u2019ll be there for the Democratic Debate. But no matter where we go, they either want to tell us why they like Bernie, or they\u2019re still trying to decide. And they\u2019ll ask us nurses what we know about him because it\u2019s true what the bus says: Nurses are the most trusted profession in the country. And those in the most trusted profession trust Bernie.I think one of the things we don\u2019t talk about enough when we mention single-payer is the way it could free up people to pursue their dreams, whether as an entrepreneur or as a volunteer.Absolutely. I mean, we talk about that all the time. We could relate even that to mental health for you as an employer. You do not have to be stressed out about where that money is going to come from. Because, you know, people who run small businesses honestly care about their employees. They want to do the right thing. We\u2019re not talking multinational corporations here. So it would mean a job created for so many people. And then there is the added benefit for those of you who would like to earn a different kind of income. Maybe you aren\u2019t an entrepreneur or whatever, but you just have to be tied to a job for health insurance. So you spend a great part of your life, if not the whole of one, doing something you really don\u2019t want to do.That insecurity about health care isn\u2019t just driving people to the Sanders tent, it\u2019s also driving people to the other extreme.Yeah, there have been comparisons drawn, and rightly so. I see it myself, when you look at what they\u2019re calling populism. I sort of have a different type of belief of what populism is. Trump is called populist, but if you look at his message and you look at Bernie\u2019s, of course there are similarities in what they\u2019re tapping into. Bernie always says, \u201cenough is enough\u201d and he\u2019s said that for years. When is this going to stop? You can\u2019t survive this way. The social safety net is broken. So you got these individuals, unfortunately, who are responding to Trump\u2019s message, and he is telling them the reason you have all of this happening to you is \u201cthem.\u201d There\u2019s always a \u201cthem\u201d you can blame. So you can latch onto that message as opposed to Bernie\u2019s, which is the honest one: It\u2019s because you\u2019ve got multinational corporations running our government. You\u2019ve got them running our world. You got Wall Street taking every bit of money out of the economy that used to go for keeping our society whole and well. Now that\u2019s the real reason, and we know it, but not everybody latches onto that message. It\u2019s the other one seems so attractive because people are just so angry. A little well-placed anger is good, it spurs you to do something. And those of us that are attached to Bernie know that\u2019s the way to do something. A real movement-based politics.Well, it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer as far as issues go. Aren\u2019t a majority of Americans in favor of single-payer health care?That\u2019s what we find as we travel the country. And this is well before the Bernie Bus, the majority of Americans across the country want Medicare for all. They understand it. It\u2019s the political will of the people, and it\u2019s being held back by the powers that be. That\u2019s why you get this anti-establishment message. You are not letting the people govern their own country, and that\u2019s not a democracy. We\u2019re losing that. And Bernie gets that.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Blog Post", "description": "National Nurses United co-president Jean Ross on why they're rolling across the country in a \"Bernie Bus\" to spread the word about their candidate.", "title": "National nurse\u2019s union\u2019s \u2018Bernie Bus\u2019 to arrive in Detroit and Flint | Blogs | Detroit Metro Times", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit Metro Times", "description": "National Nurses United co-president Jean Ross on why they're rolling across the country in a \"Bernie Bus\" to spread the word about their candidate.", "title": "National nurse\u2019s union\u2019s \u2018Bernie Bus\u2019 to arrive in Detroit and Flint", "url": "http://www.metrotimes.com/Blogs/archives/2016/03/03/national-nurses-unions-bernie-bus-to-arrive-in-detroit-and-flint", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/u/slideshow/2399546/23819956934_329936b219_b.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/u/slideshow/2399546/23819956934_329936b219_b.jpg"}, "title": "National nurse\u2019s union\u2019s \u2018Bernie Bus\u2019 to arrive in Detroit and Flint", "description": "National Nurses United co-president Jean Ross on why they're rolling across the country in a \"Bernie Bus\" to spread the word about their candidate.", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@michaeljackman"}, "oid": 2399544, "fb": {"app_id": 310950202407744}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, health care, Election 2016, politics, nurses, News, Blog, Culture, Dining, Events", "google-site-verification": "06A5Yh5mu5xlqSkqBOzGlxA6P_yfmltTp1l0ssgpOBk", "thumbnail": "http://media2.fdncms.com/metrotimes/imager/u/slideshow/2399546/23819956934_329936b219_b.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "bernie sanders, health care, election 2016, politics, nurses, news, blog, culture, dining, events"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd22a\"", "article_summary": "They\u2019re a large group of nurses from National Nurses United, and their vehicle is called the Bernie Bus.\nAnd those of us that are attached to Bernie know that\u2019s the way to do something.\nBut single-payer has long been an issue that nurses, especially among nurse\u2019s unions.\nAren\u2019t a majority of Americans in favor of single-payer health care?That\u2019s what we find as we travel the country.\nAnd this is well before the Bernie Bus, the majority of Americans across the country want Medicare for all."}
