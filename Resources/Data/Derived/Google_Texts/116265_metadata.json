When he noticed the deputies, he entered the vehicle he had been working on in an effort to flee. Hughes ignored commands to stop the vehicle, and he recklessly and purposely maneuvered the vehicle in their direction. Two deputies had to take quick and evasive actions to avoid being struck by the vehicle and one fired his weapon due to the fear of being struck.\n\nHughes fled, but the vehicle was located a short time later, and he continued to flee into a wooded area. The vehicle Hughes fled in was found to be stolen along with another vehicle at the Bramlett Road address.\n\nHughes has been charged with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment with a weapon.
