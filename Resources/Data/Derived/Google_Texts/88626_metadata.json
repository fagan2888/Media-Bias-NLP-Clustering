They now want to give us the same plan for $153 [per month],\u201d he told the Daily Caller. \u201cThe President said you can\u2019t be kicked out of your plan. He lies.\u201d\n\nSchokowitz is one of many Medicare beneficiaries now learning that \u2014 like Americans who buy insurance on the individual market \u2014 they are losing their insurance, and in some cases their doctors, under Obamacare.\n\nPrivate insurance companies that cover patients with government funds under the Medicare Advantage program have quietly started to dump doctors and patients because of Obamacare budget cuts.\n\nSchkowitz, 75, who lives in a senior citizen complex near Atlantic City, would also pay more for prescription drugs under the new plan. The co-pay for a three-month supply of one of his medications increases next year from $7.50 to $54.00.\n\nThousands of New Jersey residents are suffering the same fate . Currently, 74,000 Garden State residents are enrolled in Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage. Nearly half have zero-premium plans.\n\nBut in 2014, New Jersey Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield is eliminating all zero-premium plans with prescription drug coverage and all but two of its other plans with monthly fees.\n\nNew Jersey Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield spokesman Tom Vincz tells the Daily Caller that \u201cdue to rising health care costs and cuts to Medicare Advantage we had to make these product changes.\u201d\n\nThe company is asking elected officials to avoid further cuts to the program, \u201cWe\u2019ve been lobbying Congress to help insure that Medicare Advantage is appropriately funded to avoid further increases in premiums and changes in the product,\u201d Vincz told TheDC. \u201cWe are hoping to make this a one time experience.\u201d\n\nFederal payments to Medicare Advantage HMOs will decrease seven to eight percent in 2014, according to one prominent health care industry analyst.\n\nOverall, the Affordable Care Act slashes Medicare Advantage funding by $156 billion in ten years, a reduction that Democrats and many journalists long insisted would not harm patients. Republicans, however, have continually warned of dire consequences.\n\nNow, insurance companies, feeling squeezed, are nixing doctor contracts and patient plans to save money. Medicare Advantage plans are being dropped all over the country.\n\nNearly 4,000 UnitedHealthCare Medical Advantage members in Hawaii will have their plan terminated next year, according to the Honololu Star-Advertiser.\n\nUnitedHealthCare Medical Advantage is also eliminating two plans in Broward County, Florida.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Evan Gahr", "description": "Retired chemist Edward Schokowitz was incredulous when he received a letter from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey early last month saying his", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Retired chemist Edward Schokowitz was incredulous when he received a letter from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey early last month saying his Medicare Advantage Plan, which had no premium,", "title": "Seniors lose insurance and doctors under Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/08/seniors-lose-insurance-and-doctors-under-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/medicareadvantage.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Retired chemist Edward Schokowitz was incredulous when he received a letter from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey early last month saying...", "creator": "@evangahr", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/08/seniors-lose-insurance-and-doctors-under-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/medicareadvantage.jpg"}, "title": "Seniors lose insurance and doctors under Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-08 20:46:18", "sailthru.title": "Seniors lose insurance and doctors under Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "medical prescription,medicare,medicare advantage,obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "medicare,obamacare,evan-gahr", "sailthru.description": "Retired chemist Edward Schokowitz was incredulous when he received a letter from Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey early last month saying his Medicare Advantage Plan, which had no premium,", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/medicareadvantage.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0677\"", "article_summary": "Currently, 74,000 Garden State residents are enrolled in Blue Cross Blue Shield Medicare Advantage.\nPrivate insurance companies that cover patients with government funds under the Medicare Advantage program have quietly started to dump doctors and patients because of Obamacare budget cuts.\nMedicare Advantage plans are being dropped all over the country.\nHe lies.\u201dSchokowitz is one of many Medicare beneficiaries now learning that \u2014 like Americans who buy insurance on the individual market \u2014 they are losing their insurance, and in some cases their doctors, under Obamacare.\nBut in 2014, New Jersey Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield is eliminating all zero-premium plans with prescription drug coverage and all but two of its other plans with monthly fees."}
