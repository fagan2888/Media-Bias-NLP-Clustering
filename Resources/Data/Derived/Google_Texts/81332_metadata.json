In addition to the madness, a TV reporter got caught in a confrontation with the festival\u2019s coordinator.\n\nJared Goodell, a reporter for Channel 8 in Keene, was in the middle of a live shot when Ruth Sterling appeared in the shot to criticize Goodell\u2019s coverage of the riots.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not letting me do my job and to report to you,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cShe would not like me to tell you what is going on at Keene State College.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you a Free Stater or something?\u201d Sterling interjected as she tried multiple times to grab Goodell\u2019s microphone from him. (The Free State Project is a libertarian activism group based largely out of Keene.)\n\nSterling then tried to assure viewers that the festival is safe and family-friendly despite the rioting that occurred on the outskirts, and threatened to \u201cpull the plug\u201d on Goodell\u2019s live shot if he continues to \u201cincite\u201d the riots and \u201cself-promote.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou heard it here first, everybody,\u201d Goodell responded, \u201cWhen you report the news, when you report the reality, the people in charge want to shut you down.
