This is no longer about immigration, it\u2019s about the president and DHS keeping open the corridors on the southern border that are accessible to anyone in the world,\u201d said Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who has raised concerns over national security risks at the border.\n\n\u201cWe can defend our country against another country\u2019s navy, a missile threat and even repel a conventional military invasion. But the president\u2019s policy of allowing anyone into the nation as students or refugees presents a serious threat,\u201d he said.\n\nPHOTOS: These celebrities are devoutly Christian \u2014 and you probably didn't realize it\n\nSome 25,000 illegal immigrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala have been caught in the first seven weeks of the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1 \u2014 an increase of 58 percent. The number of Chinese, Brazilians, Indians and, strikingly, Cubans, has each surged by more than 100 percent, and the number from Pakistan, while small overall, has spiked from 6 at this point last year to 31 now \u2014 an increase of more than 400 percent.\n\nSyria, strikingly, is not on the list \u2014 despite recent reports that Syrians have been apprehended on the border in the middle of the recent refugee debate.\n\nBorder Patrol officials in Washington didn\u2019t offer an explanation for the surge, which contradicts the sunny outlook officials have publicly portrayed. Indeed, the last fiscal year saw illegal immigration overall, as measured by number of apprehensions, drop to its lowest rate since the 1970s.\n\nThat was chiefly powered by a fall in Mexican migration, which has dropped off dramatically in the last five years. But it\u2019s being replaced by a bigger flow from Central America, particularly of women and children who are fleeing grim conditions back home and taking advantage of lax policies here in the U.S. that grant them access to the nation\u2019s interior and leave little danger of them being deported anytime soon.\n\nIndeed, in court documents the administration has admitted both the smuggling cartels and would-be crossers pay close attention to U.S. policies, and any perceived relaxation of enforcement entices more of them to undertake the perilous journey.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what illegal immigrants themselves are telling Border Patrol agents when they\u2019re caught, according to an Associated Press report last month. The migrants say they believe that under Mr. Obama\u2019s policies, they will earn a \u201cpermiso,\u201d or free pass, if they can reach the U.S. border.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same story as last year,\u201d said Shawn Moran, spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents line agents. \u201cOur agents are still getting hammered.\u201d\n\nStephen Miller, spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions and the immigration subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said illegal immigrants are responding to the push for leniency in the U.S., including the 2013 Senate bill that would have legalized most illegal immigrants, Mr. Obama\u2019s executive actions halting most deportations and the increasing use of \u201ccatch-and-release\u201d policies for illegal immigrant women and children.\n\n\u201cThese are immense pull factors,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cThis surge occurs at a time when the federal government continues to admit on visas more than 1 million permanent migrants and 700,000 temporary migrant workers each and every year \u2014 holding down pay for a financially drained workforce.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has been pleading with Congress to enact a more lenient policy toward illegal immigrants, but his efforts took a hit when tens of thousands of children and families surged across the border in the first half of 2014. The administration was caught off guard and had to scramble to try to gain a handle on matters.\n\nAt the height of the surge, some 10,000 children crossed per month. The number dropped to about 2,000 a month earlier this year but has risen steadily back to nearly 5,000 a month in September and October, and is on pace for about 5,000 in November.\n\nThe surge of illegal immigrant children puts a strain on other parts of government.\n\nUnder federal policy children from noncontiguous countries who are apprehended without being accompanied by parents are required to be processed and quickly released to the Department of Health and Human Services, which then tries to place them with relatives or in foster homes. Local school districts have struggled to accommodate the children, many of whom lag behind their age level in education and struggle with learning English.\n\nMore than 4,600 children were turned over to HHS in October, and November was headed even higher, with HHS predicting 4,900 children will be sent to its custody.\n\nOnce with families, the children usually skip their deportation hearings and disappear into the shadows with the 11 million other illegal immigrants already here.\n\nThe rising tide of illegal immigrants could also feed into the presidential campaign, where Republican hopeful Donald Trump has called for building more fencing.\n\nEven Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton recently bragged about her 2006 vote in favor of erecting 700 miles of two-tier fencing along the southwest border.\n\nThat law was watered down a year later, at the behest of then-Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas Republican, and less than 40 miles of two-tier fencing has been built. Another 310 or so miles of single-tier fencing was built, along with 300 miles of vehicle barriers that allow people and animals to cross.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Southwest border has broken open in recent weeks, with non-Mexicans -- and illegal immigrant children in particular -- crossing at a record rate in October, according to Border Patrol statistics that suggest the administration's victory lap earlier this year was premature.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Southwest border has broken open in recent weeks, with non-Mexicans \u2014 and illegal immigrant children in particular \u2014 crossing at a record rate in October, according to Border Patrol statistics that suggest the administration\u2019s victory lap earlier this year was premature.", "title": "Illegal immigrant children, non-Mexicans surge across U.S. Southwest border at record rate", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/illegal-immigrant-children-non-mexicans-surge-acro/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/11222015_ap-9469434270268201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/22/11222015_ap-9469434270268201.jpg", "description": "The Southwest border has broken open in recent weeks, with non-Mexicans -- and illegal immigrant children in particular -- crossing at a record rate in October, according to Border Patrol statistics t", "card": "summary", "title": "Illegal immigrant children, non-Mexicans surge across U.S. Southwest b"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues"}, "article_summary": "The Southwest border has broken open in recent weeks, with non-Mexicans \u2014 and illegal immigrant children in particular \u2014 crossing at a record rate in October, according to Border Patrol statistics that suggest the administration\u2019s victory lap earlier this year was premature.\nThe rising tide of illegal immigrants could also feed into the presidential campaign, where Republican hopeful Donald Trump has called for building more fencing.\nThat\u2019s exactly what illegal immigrants themselves are telling Border Patrol agents when they\u2019re caught, according to an Associated Press report last month.\nBorder Patrol officials in Washington didn\u2019t offer an explanation for the surge, which contradicts the sunny outlook officials have publicly portrayed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same story as last year,\u201d said Shawn Moran, spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union that represents line agents."}
