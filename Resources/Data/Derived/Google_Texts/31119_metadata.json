She promised to uphold Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, establish real ways for immigrants to attain full citizenship and to never deport DREAMERs \u2013 immigrants who came to the United States when they were children.\n\n\u201cThere is no place in the United States for second-class citizenship,\u201d she declared.\n\nThen she moved into the territory of women\u2019s health, where pro-abortion rights Democrats like herself have defended Planned Parenthood against anti-abortion attacks.\n\n\u201cAnd just today, we got another window into what Republican candidates really believe,\u201d she said. \u201cJeb Bush said he is not sure we need half-a-billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues.\u201d\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush did indeed say that on stage during an interview at the Southern Baptist Forum, but swiftly retracted his remarks. In a statement on his website, his campaign clarified that Bush wasn\u2019t talking about women\u2019s health in general. He was referring to current efforts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cNow, I would like to ask him,\u201d Clinton continued, \u201cGov. Bush, try telling that to the mom who caught her breast cancer early because she was able to get screening in time. Was her health not worth the money? Tell it to the teenager who avoided an unintended pregnancy because she had access to contraception. Tell it to everyone who was protected by an HIV test.\n\n\u201cI am really tired of the double speak. I am tired of women being shamed and blamed and dismissed. This really isn\u2019t complicated. When you attack Planned Parenthood, you attack women\u2019s health, and when you attack women\u2019s health, you attack America\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nAs Clinton supporters cleared out of La Rumba to make way for club-goers lined up outside, Denver resident Teresa Zoltanski said, \u201cIt\u2019s about time to elect a female president,\u201d especially one who\u2019s got \u201cmore experience, backbone and leadership than any of the guys.\u201d\n\nA longtime Democrat, Zoltanski said she preferred Clinton over Obama last go around, but the upshot of time past is that \u201cshe won\u2019t need any time to catch up. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nNot everyone sees that as a plus.\n\n\u201cThe fact is a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for four more years of President Obama,\u201d said state GOP chairman Steve House in a statement about the campaign stop. \u201cThat means four more years of Obamacare, four more years of his dangerous foreign policies and four more years of having a White House at war with Colorado\u2019s energy economy.\u201d\n\nNext up for Clinton in Colorado are fundraisers: two in Denver and one in Aspen.\n\nPhoto by Nat Stein", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Colorado Independent", "description": "Hillary Clinton\u00a0launched\u00a0her\u00a0Colorado campaign\u00a0Tuesday from\u00a0a rally at\u00a0La Rumba, a Denver Latin dance club\u00a0packed with more than 350 fans.
