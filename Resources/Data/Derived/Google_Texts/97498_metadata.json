That estimate still falls below the federal government\u2019s original estimate of $250 million, he said.\n\nThe new system is needed to comply with new eligibility rules under the federal Affordable Care Act. Selig said DHS originally received four bids for the project, but after the agency chose one of the bids, it was unable to agree on terms with the bidder, Noridian Systems, and was prohibited by state rules from awarding the contract to one of the bidders that was not selected.\n\nSelig said it was then early 2013, and with enrollment in health insurance under the Affordable Care Act set to begin Oct. 1 of that year, there was not enough time to issue a new request for proposals, so DHS used an existing \u201cstaff augmentation contract\u201d to pay various vendors for additional work. The contract requires the agency to pay vendors for their time and materials, not for finished products.\n\n\u201cBecause we did this staff augmentation approach, where you\u2019re paying for time and materials, it\u2019s hard to hold the vendors responsible for a particular product at a particular time,\u201d Selig said.\n\nSelig also said he accepts responsibility for deciding not to name a project manager.\n\n\u201cI was trying to save some money and manage it ourselves,\u201d he said.\n\nThings went well at first, Selig said. But flaws in federal data systems, oft-changing federal rules and a higher-than-expected number of applications received at the state level because of problems with the federal HealthCare.gov website posed challenges for DHS, Selig said.\n\n\u201cWhen we started to hit all these problems, we did not have the capacity in the department to really handle this project well, and that has delayed our time frames and been an issue for us,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, DHS fired the lead vendor on the project, EngagePoint, because of dissatisfaction with its performance. The company, which had been paid $32 million, was replaced with another vendor, eSystems.\n\nDHS also is withholding $1.2 million from another vendor, IBM Curam, because of issues with software it has provided for the project.\n\nRepresentatives of IBM Curam testified that the company has spent over $1 million trying to fix those issues at no extra cost to the state.\n\nSelig said DHS has taken a number of corrective actions, including beginning to phase out time-and-materials contracts and creating a project management office so there will be \u201ca single point of authority\u201d over the project.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, we probably should have done that in the first case,\u201d he said.\n\nGov. Asa Hutchinson has said all information technology contracts that could cost more than $100,000 will be reviewed by his office before bids are accepted and said new contracts of any kind will be reviewed by his office if they could cost over $1 million.\n\nDHS also has hired another vendor, Gartner Group, to review the entire project and see \u201cif we\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d Selig said.\n\nThe federal government requires that the eligibility of people enrolled in the food stamp and Medicaid programs, including people enrolled in the Medicaid expansion program known as the private option, be checked every year. Selig said Wednesday that although the verification process was behind schedule for several months, it is going more smoothly now.\n\n\u201cJust last night we did 5,600 re-determinations of people on the private option,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, expressed \u201cfrustration\u201d with the decision to use time-and-materials contracts for the project.\n\n\u201cI would say that was probably a poor decision, based on what has happened here, what has unfolded, because it\u2019s tied our hands to actually go after and hold these folks accountable,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The lack of a project manager and accountability for vendors contributed to delays and increased costs in the development of a new computerized enrollment and eligibility system for the Medicaid and food stamp programs, a state official told lawmakers Wednesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 The lack of a project manager and accountability for vendors contributed to delays and increased costs in the development of a new computerized enrollment and eligibility system for the Medicaid and food stamp programs, a state official told lawmakers Wednesday.", "title": "Selig: Lack of manager, accountability delayed Medicaid project", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/selig-lack-manager-accountability-delayed-medicaid-project", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_contract-problems_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/selig-lack-manager-accountability-delayed-medicaid-project", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_contract-problems_0.jpg"}, "title": "Selig: Lack of manager, accountability delayed Medicaid project", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-17T20:49:26-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1302\"", "article_summary": "Selig also said he accepts responsibility for deciding not to name a project manager.\nDHS also has hired another vendor, Gartner Group, to review the entire project and see \u201cif we\u2019re headed in the right direction,\u201d Selig said.\nSen.
