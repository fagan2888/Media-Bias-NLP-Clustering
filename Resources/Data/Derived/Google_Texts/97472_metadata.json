That day, stocks tumbled again, with the S&P 500 hitting its lowest close since September 1996. The World Bank issued a forecast that the global economy would shrink that year for the first time since World War II. None other than Warren Buffett told CNBC that the economy had \u201cfallen off a cliff.\u201d\n\nThe Journal story that Monday morning suggested that the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had already plunged more than 50 percent from its 2007 high, could sink another 25 percent. \u201cAs earnings estimates are ratcheted down and hopes for a quick economic fix fade, the once-inconceivable notion of returning to Dow 5000 or S&P 500 at 500 looks a little less far-fetched,\u201d it said.\n\nThat\u2019s what the bottom looked like. In the five years since then, stocks have staged a powerful rally that has lifted the S&P 500 index 178 percent and the Dow by 151 percent. It\u2019s not the best five-year bull market we\u2019ve seen \u2014 the rally that started in 1982 saw the S&P 500 gain 225 percent in five years, according to Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ \u2014 but it\u2019s in a solid second place dating back to World War II.\n\nThe question now, of course, is how long can it last? Can the rally continue for another year or longer \u2014 and what will ultimately end the bull run? Some investors have already expressed concern that we\u2019ve come too far too fast \u2014 and the extraordinary liquidity injected into the economy by the Federal Reserve has only fueled some investors\u2019 doubts, especially now that the central bank has begun easing up on its support for asset prices.\n\nRelated: Bull Market Not Enough to Save Some Public Pensions\n\nHistory may offer some lessons. Of the 11 previous bull markets S&P Capital IQ counts since 1945, the average rally lasted 4.5 years and only three have celebrated the six-year mark. At the same time, the current bull market is just the sixth longest since 1928, according to data from the Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nThat track record only matters so much, though. More important, analysts note, is that the current advance has been supported by improving fundamentals. \u201cThe gains that we\u2019ve seen in the market have been thoroughly consistent with the gains that we\u2019ve seen in what ultimately drives the equity markets in the long run, and that\u2019s corporate earnings,\u201d says Jeremy Zirin, chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS Wealth Management.\n\nS&P\u2019s Stovall echoed that point: \u201cIf you go back to either the prior bull market top or you go to the prior bear market bottom, in both cases earnings and price appreciation are exactly the same,\u201d he notes.\n\nThat, Stovall says, means there\u2019s a good chance the bull can keep running this year, if not at the pace that it did in 2013, when it gained nearly 30 percent. \u201cYes, we could see the market advance this year,\u201d he says \u201cHowever, I think it will go up by the amount earnings go up and not much more.\u201d\n\nEven if that\u2019s the case, stocks could still suffer through a sharper pullback than the one we saw to start the year. \u201cA correction is likely to occur this year for a couple of reasons,\u201d Stovall says. \u201cOne, we have gone 29 months without a decline of 10 percent or more and the average time between such declines is 18 months.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe history of midterm election years also points to the likelihood of a pullback, he adds. Every such year in recent history with the exception of 1954 and 1958 saw a decline of 9 percent or more, with the median loss being 19 percent.\n\nIf the market likes to \u201cclimb a wall of worry,\u201d as the saying goes, it\u2019s got plenty of material to build up that structure \u2014 or, alternately, plenty of factors that could derail the rally. Stovall, for one, lists a potential slowdown in earnings growth, the Fed\u2019s tapering of bond purchases, deflation fears in Europe, geopolitical crises like the one in Ukraine. Even continued dysfunction in Washington or some surprise scare like a terror attack could weigh on stocks.\n\nLet\u2019s consider just one of those factors: The Fed. Even if stocks have largely shrugged off the taper so far, that doesn\u2019t mean investors will continue to be unfazed by monetary policy shifts. A paper presented last month by a quartet of respected economists warned that the unwinding of the Fed\u2019s easy money policies could still set off an investor \u201ctantrum\u201d similar to the one the markets experienced last summer, when the Fed first signaled its plans to wind down asset purchases.\n\n\u201cOur results suggest that bond markets could experience another tantrum \u2013 along the lines of that seen during the summer of 2013 \u2013 as extraordinary monetary accommodation in the United States is withdrawn,\u201d the economists wrote.\n\nUntil that day comes, or the bull turns for some other reason, we can celebrate five years of strong gains and corporate earnings that look to be on more secure footing. \u201cThe big message this year from our team,\u201d UBS\u2019s Zirin says, \u201cis that the bull market is not over because the earnings cycle is not over. The economic recovery is still gaining traction and just starting to look like it\u2019s becoming more self-sustaining.\u201d On with year six.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Flash back to the bear-market bottom to see just how far the stock market has come.
