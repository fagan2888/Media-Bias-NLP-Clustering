According to the judge, this federal statute supersedes any state law in governing the production and sale of the pate.\n\n\u201cThis action for declaratory and injunctive relief touches upon a topic impacting gourmands\u2019 stomachs and animal rights activists\u2019 hearts: foie gras,\u201d said the ruling.\n\nThe California state legislature passed a foie gras ban in 2004 under pressure from animal rights advocates, who argued that foie gras is inhumane because it is traditionally made by force-feeding birds in order to enlarge their livers.\n\nThe law went into effect in 2012 after legal challenges failed, but it was habitually undermined by restauranteurs who continued to serve foie gras, saying they were not selling it but giving it away as a gift, which is not prohibited under the law.\n\nChef Ken Frank of La Toque restaurant in Napa, who was sued by the Animal Legal Defense Fund for continuing to serve foie gras, sponsored an essay contest in June on the topic, \u201cWhy California\u2019s Foie Gras Ban Is Foolish,\u201d according to San Francisco Eater.\n\nFoodies rejoiced at the decision. Mr. Frank posted a celebratory message on Twitter shortly after the judge\u2019s ruling was issued Wednesday: \u201cFoie Gras is legal again in California. On the menu tonight.\u201d\n\nChef David Bazirgan of Dirty Habit in San Francisco posted a photo on Instagram showing him holding up two packages of foie gras with the caption, \u201cCALI FOIE BAN OVERTURNED. GOOD THING I ALWAYS HAVE IT ANYWAY!!! We have lots of foie gras for tonight!\u201d\n\nBruce Friedrich of Farm Sanctuary, representing a coalition of animal protection groups that includes the ALDF and Humane Society of the United States, urged California Attorney General Kamala Harris to appeal the ruling.\n\n\u201cFoie gras is a product of egregious cruelty to animals, and the state of California has an absolute right to ban it,\u201d Mr. Friedrich said in a statement. \u201cThis is a principle that has been strongly supported by both the conservative and the progressive members of the federal bench, and this holding will prove a clear anomaly \u2014 it will not stand.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by Canadian and Hudson Valley duck and geese farmers and the Hot\u2019s Restaurant Group.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They tried to ban large sodas in New York City, and the courts said \u201cno.\u201d And now the same thing has happened to the ban on foie gras in California.
