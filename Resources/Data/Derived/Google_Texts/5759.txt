PNC's fall economic survey has found that Michigan's small- and midsize-business owners lean toward the optimistic in their views of the state's economy.

Among the findings released today:

* 33% of Michigan business owners expect to raise their employees' pay, up from 26% in the spring.

* 88% are optimistic about their company's prospects.

* 59% expect housing prices to rise in their local markets, compared to 55% in the spring and 53% last fall.

But finding good workers remains a constraint:

* 41% say it has become harder to hire qualified employees compared to last spring.

* 16% who are not hiring say it's because they cannot find the right skilled workers.

The growing optimistic reflects the improving nature of the state's economy. Michigan's unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% in August, its lowest point since 2001. Auto sales remain strong, and construction of residential housing is up this year thanks to strong multi-family construction in Detroit's downtown apartment market.

PNC's Michigan outlook mirrors an optimism expressed by business owners nationally. The positive outlook is helped by a decline in energy prices.

“Small businesses are like the economy’s grass roots based on the employment and economic activity they create,” said PNC’s Chief Economist Stuart Hoffman. “These encouraging results demonstrate the job market will continue to grow for at least six more months and also strongly support PNC’s forecast for real GDP growth of 2.5% — comparing fourth quarter this year to 2014.”

Other key findings of PNC's national survey were:

* Almost half believe their company’s cost for employee health care will rise in the next six months. More than half (53%) said they believe the Affordable Care Act will have a negative impact on business costs in 2015, up from 49%.

* 58% expect housing prices to rise in their local market in the next six to 12 months, on a par with 59% six months ago and 52% one year ago.

PNC Financial Services Group is one of the largest diversified financial services institutions in the U.S. It has conducted its surveys of business owners since 2003.
