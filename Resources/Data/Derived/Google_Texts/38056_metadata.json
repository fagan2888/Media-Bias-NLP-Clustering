Anyone looking for an example of the panic overtaking the Republican Party as Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign continues to steamroll all comers could hardly do better than Klein\u2019s piece. It is a window into the schism in the GOP that no one in the party seems to have any idea how to fix.\n\nHere\u2019s how the column opens:\n\nFor decades, liberals have created a caricature of Republicans as being more about bombast and white resentment than substance and principles. Should Donald Trump win the GOP presidential nomination, it would help validate this cartoonish portrait.\n\nSet aside for a moment the hilarity of trying to deflect liberals\u2019 broad caricatures of Republicans by\u2026broadly caricaturing left-wing critiques of conservative policy. Conservative \u201csubstance and principles\u201d are not mutually exclusive from \u201cwhite resentment.\u201d I would argue that the principles upon which some \u2013 not all \u2013 conservative policies are based appeal to and are rooted in white resentment.\n\nFor example, there is ample evidence that conservative attempts at ending the \u201cwelfare state\u201d succeed in attracting white votes so long as the voters think of the welfare state as being benefits that go to poor black folks in the ghetto and not the Medicare and Social Security that keeps the Republican base of mostly older white voters alive and voting for the GOP.\n\nPut another way, Ronald Reagan did not exactly suffer conservative opprobrium for his famous comments about a \u201cCadillac-driving welfare queen\u201d and \u201cthe strapping young buck\u201d using welfare money to buy T-bone steaks. Nor, to my knowledge, did he ever have to admit that the welfare queen was an exceptional case, a fraudster in Chicago who ran a years-long scam to collect benefits, and whom he used to smear black women on welfare in general. Meanwhile, his efforts to rein in Social Security and Medicare spending were done in part by congressional Republicans.\n\nIronic, then, that Klein later cites Reagan in positive terms and complains about liberals holding him up as an example of a \u201cpersonality rather than substantive leader.\u201d Oh, he was substantive all right. And that substance often took the form of dog-whistles to racial resentment. And he\u2019s still the heroic president Republicans hold up as an example to be emulated by today\u2019s candidates. Which they do in a variety of ways such as talking about how Democrats attract minority votes by promising \u201cfree stuff\u201d and \u201cgoodies.\u201d They do this while promising to protect Medicare benefits, which a majority of elderly white people rely on, while promising to cut food stamps, which are disproportionately used by poor blacks.\n\nKlein continues:\n\nTo Republicans and conservatives who got involved in politics to advance a set of ideas \u2014 the type of people who get their kicks debating the finer points of tax policy, national security, and Commerce Clause jurisprudence \u2014 this liberal caricature has seemed utterly bizarre and intentionally dishonest.\n\nConservatives involved in politics, sure, but that is a subset of Republicans. Liberals are talking about the voters who are supporting Trump, of whom there are a lot more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump has revealed the ugly underside of the conservative movement.
