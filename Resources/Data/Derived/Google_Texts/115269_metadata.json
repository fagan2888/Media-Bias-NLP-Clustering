Goalie Jacob Sievers recorded his first shutout, while Beal also had three assists thanks to his unusually long throw-ins that acted almost like corner kicks.\n\nThe convincing win was just what Hammen was looking for as the Eagles get ready to return to Northern Conference play.\n\n\"Coming off a tough loss we really came out with vengeance and found our offensive firepower. Today was excellent,\" Hammen said. \"We were up 3-0 at halftime and all three goals came off long throws from Lucas, so it was a pretty awesome game. It was nice to get out and kick some goals in.\"\n\nPanthers 3, Indians 0\n\nLoveland won't likely face a tougher test this year than Boulder, a state semifinalist from a year ago and a champion in 2012. So although the Indians lost, they still gained plenty, especially considering they went into halftime tied 0-0.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's good to know that we can play with the big boys because just about every team in our league is a big boy. It's nice to know we're going to fight for a playoff spot in our league,\" said LHS coach Chad Arthur, whose team dropped to 2-2-1. \"It always stinks to lose, and it hurts knowing we were playing with them for a vast majority of the first half, but it's good to know these next few weeks we're gong to be in those games too and we have a good chance to win them.\"\n\nWith some injuries to some key players in the second half, LHS leaned on some up and comers, including sophomore defender Josh Stackhouse and junior midfielder Sean Walters.\n\nSoftball\n\nSpartans 12, Raptors 10\n\nLONGMONT \u2014 Berthoud jumped out to a 9-0 lead only to have host Silver Creek tie the game by scoring five runs in the bottom of the sixth. But the Spartans were able to respond, scoring two in the top of the seventh to seal the non-league road victory.\n\nThe Spartans mashed out 15 hits, six for extra bases, including homers by Taylor Armitage and Sydney Kouns, and a double and triple by Jessi Boruff.\n\n\"We kept battling hit after hit and not just hits, but solid bombs and line drives,\" said BHS coach Ashtin Williamson, whose team is now 8-5. \"Our team came out swinging like we know how. By the seventh we were able to tighten things up and secure the win.\"\n\nSpartans 12, Raptors 10\n\nAt Silver Creek HS\n\nBerthoud\n\n003 601 2 \u2014 12 15 1\n\nSilver Creek\n\n000 505 0 \u2014 10 10 4\n\nW \u2014 Larissa Royer.
