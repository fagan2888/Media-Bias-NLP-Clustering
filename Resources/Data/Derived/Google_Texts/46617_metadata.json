Independent Lois Capps at her home in Santa Barbara. (April. 6, 2015) Capps Announces She Won\u2019t Seek Reelection The Nine-Term Congresswoman Says \u2018It Just Feels Right to Me\u2019 Originally published 10:30 a.m., April 8, 2015\n\nUpdated 2:00 p.m., April 8, 2015\n\nSince 1997, Lois Capps has run for her congressional seat no less than 19 times. This Monday, Capps \u2014 the nine-term Democrat representing Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties in Congress \u2014 announced that she would not seek reelection. \u201cFor everything there is a time and season,\u201d said Capps, a onetime Yale divinity student not to mention former high school nurse, during an interview at her Santa Barbara home. \u201cLo and behold, it\u2019s been 17 years since I\u2019ve been in Congress. If anyone told me I would be here that long, I would never have believed them.\u201d Capps, now 77, declined to offer many specifics as to what guided her announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t make decisions based on lightning bolts,\u201d she noted. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking on this a while, and it just feels right to me. No one called up and said, \u2018You have to go now.\u2019\u201d Since filling the Congressional vacancy created when her husband Walter died of a heart attack in 1997, Capps has emerged as a potent, abiding force in the course of Santa Barbara politics. The substantial get-out-the-vote efforts she\u2019s waged, especially in Isla Vista, have helped not just her own campaigns but those of untold Democrats; to an unusual degree, Capps\u2019s endorsements have always carried weight. Republicans, it should be noted, held a 47-year lock on the district until Walter was elected in 1996. Over the years, a string of Republican candidates have been quick to dismiss Capps as \u201ca nice lady\u201d only to have her clean their clocks. In Congress, Capps has played the role of team player and party loyalist. She\u2019s also enjoyed profound family ties to the Obama administration. Hers has been a reliable vote on issues relating to health care, education, coastal oil drilling, environmental protection, gender equity, and gay rights. Though Capps\u2019s name is attached to no landmark legislation, she takes intense pride in the role she played getting the Affordable Care Act passed out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on which she sits. \u201cThirty-three thousand people now have health care in Santa Barbara County who didn\u2019t before,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe that doesn\u2019t get a lot of headlines, but I think it\u2019s a pretty big deal.\u201d Almost as big \u2014 at least at the time \u2014 was Capps\u2019s vote not to authorize President George Bush to wage war against Iraq. Only a handful of congressmembers voted to oppose the war. Capps\u2019s announcement has long been the subject of intense anticipation in Democratic circles, especially among younger political figures impatient to further the trajectory of their elected careers. First District Supervisor Salud Carbajal has been so overt about his congressional intentions that they\u2019ve become fodder for jokes on the political roast circuit. Less conspicuous has been Santa Barbara Mayor Helene Schneider, but she too has been making noises common to congressional campaigns. And then there\u2019s Capps\u2019s daughter, Laura, whose return to Santa Barbara from the nation\u2019s capitol \u2014 where she and her husband, Bill Burton, ranked as a certified \u00fcber power couple \u2014 have given rise to much speculation about political dynasties.\n\nThere\u2019s been no shortage of Republican names about which to speculate, either. Leading the list is San Luis Obispo State Assemblymember Katcho Achadjian, but Justin Fareed \u2014 who lost the Republican primary to perennial candidate Chris Mitchum \u2014 has re-activated his campaign committee. Santa Barbara City Councilmember Dale Francisco \u2014 just elected head of the Republican Central Committee \u2014 said he\u2019s \u201cruminating\u201d whether to run.\n\nCapps declined to comment on who she might endorse, if she will, or when. \u201cGive me a little space,\u201d she said in mock exasperation.\n\nCertainly Capps\u2019s last year in office ranked among her hardest. Once again, she found herself a member of the minority party in a gridlocked institution where many Republicans demonstrated a willingness to shut the federal government down. Even Capps, known for the resolute determination of her optimism, conceded the critical mass of partisan rancor has made political life difficult.\n\nOn the eve of last November\u2019s election, the federal government agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle a DUI hit-and-run death case involving Capps\u2019s employee Raymond Morua. Morua had gotten drunk at a Christmas Party the year before hosted by The Santa Barbara Independent and killed Mallory Dies, a popular bartender in town. On the advice of counsel, Capps insisted that Morua was not on the clock at the time of the accident and that he was not representing her when he attended the party.\n\nThe Dies family was incensed and accused Capps of ducking. They dogged her at public events. How could Capps not know, they demanded, that Morua had a history of DUIs and hit-and-runs? Capps said she tried calling the family the day after the accident. \u201cThey were not in a position to take my call,\u201d she said. As for Morua, Capps said she thought she knew him. \u201cThis is a vet. This is a guy who starts a veterans group on campus when he comes back. He worked as an intern for me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a formal screening process before. Now there is.\u201d\n\nBy any reckoning, Capps\u2019s campaign against Republican challenger Christopher Mitchum last November should have been a cakewalk. It was anything but. Given predictions of low voter turnout and the backlash against an anti-fracking ballot measure, Capps\u2019s pollsters reckoned the race was dead even. Pulling out the stops, Capps aired attack ads quoting Mitchum saying he wasn\u2019t running \u201cto represent the 24th congressional district.\u201d In fact, he had said he wasn\u2019t running to secure baseball diamonds for the district.\n\nFor Capps \u2014 who routinely wins the nicest member of Congress award bestowed by congressional staffers \u2014 it was a departure. Ultimately, she won the race with a 4 percent cushion. But Mitchum sued, charging the ads not only cost him the election but constituted an infliction of intentional emotional distress. Capps dismissed the lawsuit \u2014 still pending \u2014 as \u201cpretty frivolous.\u201d Elections, she insisted, are not won or lost by TV ads but by grassroots campaigns. She had one. Mitchum did not.\n\nThroughout her career, Capps has gloried in her get-out-the-vote efforts. She doesn\u2019t endure them; she relishes them. She basks in the energy of young voters, casting ballots, perhaps, for the first time. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who they vote for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a habit they develop and carry on in life.\u201d The trick, she explained, is creating a space that\u2019s clean and fun. If it\u2019s at a doughnut shop, so much the better. Provide lots of pizza. Work with young volunteers and party activists. Few people have ever matched Capps\u2019s work ethic or prodigious stamina.\n\nFor Capps, that personal connection has always been at the core of her politics. \u201cIt\u2019s all about relationships. It\u2019s about the people you meet on the way to elevator,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about building trust; it\u2019s about \u2018I\u2019ll help you with a bill that affects you in your district if you\u2019ll help me with one in mine.\u2019\u201d Many of the bills Capps touts are legislative responses to personal catastrophes \u2014 often of a medical nature \u2014 visited upon one or two families living in her district. In these, Capps makes a point to \u201creach across the aisle\u201d to connect with a Republican \u2014 typically a woman \u2014 who has weathered similar storms.\n\nFor Capps, the possibility of politics is rarely found in the vast macro issues of war and peace. \u201cIt\u2019s about the vet who walks in the door and is having difficulty getting services to which he\u2019s entitled,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the real miracles take place.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Capps has about 18 months left on her term. She\u2019s mindful that few politicians get to go out at a time of their choosing and on their own terms. For that, she said she\u2019s grateful. But also a little uncertain. \u201cAll this is new to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d\n\nCapps\u2019s announcement prompted a flurry of messages Wednesday from politicians and organizations on both sides of the aisle. President Barack Obama also issued a statement.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: \u201cLois Capps and her family have served the people of Southern California for almost four decades. For 20 years, she was a nurse and public health advocate while her husband Walter served in Congress. When Walter tragically passed away, Lois ran for his seat in Congress, and for the past 17 years she has continued his legacy of service while leaving a lasting legacy of her own. She has led efforts to increase access to health care, improve mental health services, detect and prevent domestic violence, protect our environment, and improve education\u2014all while consistently being voted the \u201cnicest member of Congress.\u201d Her experience, optimism, and tenacity will be missed, but I look forward to working with Congresswoman Capps over the next two years, and Michelle and I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.\u201d\n\nSanta Barbara County Supervisor Salud Carbajal: \u201cCongresswoman Capps has done an exemplary job of representing the Central Coast in Congress for the past 17 years, following her many years of service in our local schools. She has represented our communities with grace, and her leadership has led to progress in so many areas that are critical to our unique quality of life, including protecting our environment, enhancing our public health and safety and securing resources for local infrastructure improvements. It has been an honor to work with her and to be her constituent. I wish Congresswoman Capps all the best as she continues her advocacy on our behalf.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Barbara Boxer: \u201cLois Capps has devoted her life to fighting for the things that matter - expanding access to health care, improving education and protecting the pristine Central Coast. She is one of the finest and most beloved members of Congress, and the people of the Central Coast have been fortunate to have her as their representative for the last two decades.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein: \u201cLois Capps is a dedicated public servant, first as a nurse and educator and later representing the Central Coast in Congress for nearly 20 years. Lois has fought tirelessly to improve health care and education and protect the environment, and I was proud to work with her to prevent new oil drilling off the coast of Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. I wish Lois the best in her much-deserved retirement.\u201d\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee spokesperson Zach Hunter: \u201cThe 24th District has been competitive for multiple cycles and instantly becomes a more likely pick up opportunity for Republicans in 2016 with Lois Capps\u2019 retirement.\u201d\n\nLeague of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski: \u201cCongresswoman Capps is a proven environmental champion who has worked tirelessly to protect California\u2019s coast, combat climate change and grow our clean energy economy. Her stellar voting record has earned her an impressive 96% lifetime score on LCV\u2019s National Environmental Scorecard. She has built a legacy of commonsense solutions that have helped make her district, her state and our country cleaner, healthier and more sustainable.\u201d\n\nEMILY\u2019s List, a resource for women in politics: \u201cLois Capps has been a progressive champion for the California women and families she serves in Congress,\u201d said Stephanie Schriock, President of EMILY\u2019s List. \u201cHer effective leadership on public health issues was critical in passing legislation to address the national nursing shortage, detect and prevent domestic violence against women, and bring CPR instruction to schools. The EMILY\u2019s List community of over three million members thanks Lois for fighting for policies that give women and families a fair shot and looks forward to making sure that a pro-choice Democratic woman carries on her legacy in California\u2019s 24th District.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://media.independent.com/img/croppedphotos/2015/04/08/cappslead.jpg", "description": "The Nine-Term Congresswoman Says,", "title": "Capps Announces She Won't Seek Reelection"}, "verify-v1": "ILofteeXjEGSBFwUf9oRyP4hdhxQ7F35jPp2MwAQrUE=", "y_key": "33d4a6dfbd23f58a", "description": "The Nine-Term Congresswoman Says,", "title": "Capps Announces She Won't Seek Reelection"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb990\"", "article_summary": "This Monday, Capps \u2014 the nine-term Democrat representing Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties in Congress \u2014 announced that she would not seek reelection.\n6, 2015) Capps Announces She Won\u2019t Seek Reelection The Nine-Term Congresswoman Says \u2018It Just Feels Right to Me\u2019 Originally published 10:30 a.m., April 8, 2015Updated 2:00 p.m., April 8, 2015Since 1997, Lois Capps has run for her congressional seat no less than 19 times.\nPresident Barack Obama: \u201cLois Capps and her family have served the people of Southern California for almost four decades.\nIn Congress, Capps has played the role of team player and party loyalist.\nIndependent Lois Capps at her home in Santa Barbara."}
