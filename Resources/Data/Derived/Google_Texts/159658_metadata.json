In addition to the heartbreak and emotional exhaustion of seeing my dad\u2019s personality and abilities change, there are key practical differences from taking care of my mother. Though my mom suffered a stroke, she was generally cooperative and cognizant of helping us help her. With my dad, that is not always the case.\n\nTake, for example, medication management, which can be particularly challenging. (The new study found that 84 percent of caregivers say they assist with this task, and more than 4 in 10 say it\u2019s hard because it\u2019s time-consuming.)\n\nThat certainly has been my experience. Medicine time with my dad has become one of the greatest difficulties, often taking an hour or more as we cajole, distract and sweet-talk him into swallowing pills or liquid medications. He doesn\u2019t understand why he should do so. If we\u2019re not alone, I often tag-team with my sister, Linda, and a paid caregiver to get it done. Mom simply took her pills within minutes when we gave them to her.\n\nI\u2019m certainly not alone in dealing with these challenges: Behavioral health conditions are significant for those over age 50, with 20 percent facing depression and 11 percent struggling with anxiety. The number of those with Alzheimer\u2019s disease in the U.S., currently 5 million, is projected to nearly triple by 2050. There will be fewer potential caregivers for each care recipient as boomers age, and these caregivers tend to be in the role longer than other family caregivers. We are stressed and depressed \u2013 and that will not change unless we receive better training, support, respite, care coordination and understanding of the incredible burdens we bear of the heart, mind and body.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kelly McGinnis", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Family caregivers who are caring for loved ones with cognitive and behavioral health conditions, such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and\u00a0depression, face particularly demanding challenges, according to a new report\u00a0from AARP and the United Hospital Fund.
