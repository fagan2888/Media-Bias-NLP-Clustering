The couple lives in New York City.\n\nThe former president and former secretary of state quickly retweeted their daughter\u2019s message on Twitter but did not immediately comment on the baby\u2019s arrival.\n\nThe news comes as Hillary Clinton deliberates whether to run for the White House in 2016. She is the leading Democratic contender to succeed President Barack Obama, her 2008 campaign rival, and has said she expects to make a decision around the beginning of next year.\n\nThe baby has been eagerly anticipated as Hillary Clinton considers her political future. She has called the prospect of becoming a grandmother her \u201cmost exciting title yet.\u201d She even has picked out the first book she intends to read to her grandchild, the classic \u201cGoodnight Moon.\u201d\n\nShe has said she didn\u2019t want to make any decisions about another campaign until the baby\u2019s arrival, pointing to her interest in enjoying becoming a grandmother for the first time.\n\nBill Clinton, who canceled a fundraising visit Saturday to Denver for Democrats running for the Senate and governor, has been eager to become a grandfather.\n\nDuring an event with former President George W. Bush in September, Bill Clinton\u2019s cellphone rang on stage and he joked that only two people had the number \u201cand they are related to me,\u201d musing that he hoped he wasn\u2019t becoming \u201ca premature grandfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day I get up and I say, \u2018You have to remember whose child this is. Do not interfere. Be there when you are welcome. Be loving but not judgmental,\u201d Clinton said to laughs in an interview with CNN at his annual Clinton Global Initiative, only days before the baby\u2019s arrival.\n\nThe 34-year-old Chelsea Clinton said in an interview with Glamour magazine last year that she and her husband had hoped to make 2014 \u201cthe year of the baby.\u201d She announced her pregnancy in April at the end of a forum in New York on female empowerment.\n\n\u201cI just hope I will be as good a mom to my child and, hopefully, children as my mom was to me,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nChelsea Clinton grew up in the public eye as a teenager in the White House, later graduating from Stanford and Columbia universities. She worked in finance in New York and in public health, earning a doctorate from Oxford University.\n\nShe serves as vice chair of her family\u2019s foundation, which was renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and helps direct the organization\u2019s humanitarian and philanthropic efforts around the globe. She recently departed NBC News, where she served as a special correspondent.\n\nThe new parents, who married in 2010, were friends as teenagers in Washington and both attended Stanford. Mezvinsky is a hedge fund manager and the son of former Reps. Majorie Margolies of Pennsylvania and Edward Mezvinsky of Iowa, longtime friends of the Clintons.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton are grandparents.", "title": "Chelsea Clinton gives birth to daughter Charlotte - Red Alert Politics", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/07/Clintons-Colorado_Dobs-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/09/27/chelsea-clinton-gives-birth-daughter-charlotte/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "published_time": "2014-09-27T12:32:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T12:32:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd419d\"", "article_summary": "She serves as vice chair of her family\u2019s foundation, which was renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, and helps direct the organization\u2019s humanitarian and philanthropic efforts around the globe.\nChelsea Clinton grew up in the public eye as a teenager in the White House, later graduating from Stanford and Columbia universities.\nThe baby has been eagerly anticipated as Hillary Clinton considers her political future.\nBill Clinton, who canceled a fundraising visit Saturday to Denver for Democrats running for the Senate and governor, has been eager to become a grandfather.\nTheir daughter, Chelsea, gave birth Friday to her first child, Charlotte."}
