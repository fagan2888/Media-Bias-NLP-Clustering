Road test it. Find out how it works,\u201d Huckabee said Saturday.\n\nHe also talked about being stoned and having the munchies.\n\nThe former governor of Arkansas is one of six Republicans eyeing the White House in 2016 who is speaking at the Western Conservative Summit underway in Denver this weekend. After addressing the crowd, he attended a question-and-answer session with the press and others.\n\n\u201cIf elected president would you allow states like this that legalized marijuana to continue with that policy or would you prefer to enforce federal rules\u201d against it, Huckabee was asked.\n\n\u201cIf after a few years the people of Colorado are making more money, they\u2019re bringing in more jobs, people go to work early, they stay late and they get their jobs done better and they\u2019re all happy \u2014 and other than having a bad case of the munchies they\u2019re just doing great \u2014 maybe the rest of the country will see how wise it is,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf, on the other hand, you have people who don\u2019t show up for work and who stay stoned half the time, if you have kids who end up eating what they thought was just a good nice brownie that their mama made but it makes them sick and puts them in the emergency room, if you have enough of that, then maybe the other states will step back and say, \u2018Thanks, Colorado, for protecting us from making the decision that you guys made that didn\u2019t work out real well for you.'\u201d\n\nHuckabee said that strategy is better than having a \u201c50-state mistake,\u201d which is how he described Obamacare.
