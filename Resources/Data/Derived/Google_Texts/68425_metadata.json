Originally developed as an asynchronous tool to aid communication and productivity, email has become a universal drain on employees\u2019 time, its pervasive overuse (a side-effect of its ease of use) has killed its purity.\n\nI have often wondered why we have yet to create an efficient virtual personal assistant, a VPA for email. If my smartphone knows how long it will take me to get to work when I leave and understands the traffic implications for a particular day, then my VPA should be able to inform my calendar and send apologetic emails or texts ahead of me when I\u2019m late. If my phone knows where and when I eat for routine business meeting, it should be able to send an email or negotiate with my counterpart\u2019s VPA for me. If a student needs a grade checked, thinking there has been a mistake entering it on the reporting system, my VPA should be able to check my spreadsheet and respond, only flagging me when it is a true error.\n\nNatural language processing systems and computational linguistics have been around for decades, which when combined with machine learning and predictive analytics, provides the basis for such a VPA. However, my research background in validation and verification of knowledge-based systems alerts me to the fact that while much of the emails sent only task people in routine ways, the skill lies in understanding when something requires truly expert knowledge, the human rather than virtual input. For that, I guess my VPA could always send me an email.\n\nRobert Plant (@drrobertplant) is an associate professor at the School of Business Administration, University of Miami, in Coral Gables, Fla.\n\nRead the latest Leadership Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Ask any manager what kills their productivity and the top answer is likely to be email.", "title": "How Email Kills Workers\u2019 Productivity", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/28/how-email-kills-workers-productivity/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FF877_expert_P_20141027232133.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "How Email Kills Workers\u2019 Productivity", "description": "Ask any manager what kills their productivity and the top answer is likely to be email.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "Ask any manager what kills their productivity and the top answer is likely to be email.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-10-28T10:03:04-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/28/how-email-kills-workers-productivity/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-4443", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Ask any manager what kills their productivity and the top answer is likely to be email.", "title": "How Email Kills Workers\u2019 Productivity", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2014/10/28/how-email-kills-workers-productivity/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FF877_expert_P_20141027232133.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-4443", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-28T16:50:57-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedd1\"", "article_summary": "iStockROBERT PLANT: Ask any manager what kills their productivity and the top answer is likely to be email.\nOriginally developed as an asynchronous tool to aid communication and productivity, email has become a universal drain on employees\u2019 time, its pervasive overuse (a side-effect of its ease of use) has killed its purity.\nI have often wondered why we have yet to create an efficient virtual personal assistant, a VPA for email.\nFor that, I guess my VPA could always send me an email.\nIf my phone knows where and when I eat for routine business meeting, it should be able to send an email or negotiate with my counterpart\u2019s VPA for me."}
