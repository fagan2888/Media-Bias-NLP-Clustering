Jan Brewer\u2019s request to expand AHCCCS eligibility to people who make up to 133 percent of the federal poverty limit, which is $31,322 for a family of four. The current cap is 100 percent of the poverty limit, which is $23,550 for a family of four.\n\nLed by Senate President Andy Biggs, R-Gilbert, and House Speaker Andy Tobin, R-Paulden, all but two of the lawmakers who were on the losing side of the June vote sued to challenge one of the biggest public-policy changes in Arizona in decades.\n\nThey are joined by two residents and the director of the Arizona branch of the limited-government advocacy group Americans for Prosperity.\n\nThe case revolves around whether the Legislature had the authority to approve the funding plan that would be used to pay the state\u2019s share of expanded Medicaid coverage.\n\nLawmakers approved a \u201cprovider tax\u201d to be levied against hospitals, over objections from most Republican lawmakers that the vote violated the state Constitution.\n\nThe provider tax is designed to cover the state\u2019s match to the federal dollars that will allow AHCCCS expansion.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers and allies argue that because the tax vote fell short of the two-thirds supermajority needed to approve a tax, the move was unconstitutional.\n\nThey also argue that Brewer\u2019s plan violates the separation of powers because it allows an executive-branch agency, AHCCCS, to set that rate, rather than the Legislature.\n\nOpponents dubbed the bill \u201cObrewercare\u201d because the federal Affordable Care Act gave states the option to expand their Medicaid programs. Brewer shocked many in the GOP when she announced early this year that she would pursue expansion, urging skeptics to \u201cdo the math\u201d and see that it would help not only uninsured Arizonans but also the state\u2019s health-care industry, at no cost to general taxpayers.\n\nBrewer, along with her supporters, is asking Judge Katherine Cooper to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that none of the plaintiffs have proper legal standing to challenge the policy move.\n\nHospitals have such standing, but they are not suing. In fact, many of Arizona\u2019s hospitals and health-care providers are strong supporters of Brewer\u2019s plan, which they believe will ease the crush of uninsured patients who crowd their emergency rooms.\n\nIn court filings, attorneys for Brewer and the state\u2019s AHCCCS director argue that their opponents are turning to the courts to settle a political dispute.\n\n\u201cCourts cannot, and should not, become involved in internal, legislative disputes,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe lawsuit followed after opponents failed to gather enough signatures this past summer to refer the matter to the ballot.\n\nThe case, Biggs vs. Brewer, will be heard at 3 p.m. in Maricopa County Superior Court.\n\nRegardless of Judge Cooper\u2019s decision, which is not expected immediately, both sides anticipate appeals, prolonging the legal battle.", "article_metadata": {"byline": "Mary Jo Pitzl", "description": "Medicaid battle heads to court,The battle over Medicaid expansion in Arizona moves to the courtroom today, less than three weeks before the expanded program is scheduled to take effect.", "pubdate": "Thu Dec 12, 2013  9:42 PM", "creditline": "The Republic  |  azcentral.com", "headline": "Medicaid battle heads to court", "section": "News", "og": {"url": "http://azc.cc/A2n0v", "site_name": "azcentral.com", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Medicaid battle heads to court"}, "fb": {"admins": 732445551, "app_id": 115142145268769}, "keywords": "Medicaid battle heads to court, Arizona, News", "twitter": {"account_id": 13115682, "title": "Medicaid battle heads to court", "url": "http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/20131212arizona-medicaid-battle-heads-court.html", "image": "http://www.azcentral.com/imgs/azc_fb_logo.jpg", "site": "@azcentral", "card": "summary", "description": "The battle over Medicaid expansion in Arizona moves to the courtroom today, less than three weeks before the expanded program is scheduled to take effect."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb61\"", "article_summary": "In court filings, attorneys for Brewer and the state\u2019s AHCCCS director argue that their opponents are turning to the courts to settle a political dispute.\nOpponents dubbed the bill \u201cObrewercare\u201d because the federal Affordable Care Act gave states the option to expand their Medicaid programs.\nThe GOP lawmakers and allies argue that because the tax vote fell short of the two-thirds supermajority needed to approve a tax, the move was unconstitutional.\nThe Republic | azcentral.com Thu Dec 12, 2013 9:42 PMThe battle over Medicaid expansion in Arizona moves to the courtroom today, less than three weeks before the expanded program is scheduled to take effect.\nRegardless of Judge Cooper\u2019s decision, which is not expected immediately, both sides anticipate appeals, prolonging the legal battle."}
