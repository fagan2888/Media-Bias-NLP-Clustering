The venue was packed at for what was to have been a lunchtime speech. But, when Clinton was two-hours late, the crowd did thin.\n\nClinton was introduced onto the stage by former Tulsa Mayor Kathy Taylor; and to the podium by State Senator Kay Floyd of Oklahoma City.\n\nClinton spoke for nearly 40-minutes. She lashed out at Republicans for wanting to turn the clock back on women\u2019s rights. She told the crowd reproductive rights would be protected in her administration. Clinton called for equal pay for equal work.\n\nDuring her speech, Clinton called out Governor Fallin for failure to accept funding for the Affordable Care Act, saying the Governor was tampering with the health of Oklahomans. That remark drew applause from two former Democratic Governors in the audience, George Nigh and David Walters.\n\nClinton called for a stand against terrorism at home and abroad. She repeated President Obama\u2019s request that people on the \u2018No Fly List\u2019 not be able to buy weapons. She says she does not want to take away guns, but pointed out the need to be better background checks.\n\nAfter the Hall of Fame event, she then went to the home of George and Cookie Kaiser for a private reception.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton brings her campaign for the White House to Oklahoma's Jazz Hall of Fame in Tulsa.
