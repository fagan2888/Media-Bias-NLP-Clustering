Oh I'm glad I'm not in the land of cotton Where job creation is mighty rotten ...

Buzzard, vulture, whatever.

Congratulations, Jaguarfootballfan! Your entry won the cartoon caption contest for all the right reasons. It made us laugh. Out loud. (By "us' I mean me and a couple of guys named Darrel. But that's not the important part.)

Here's the important part: "Hey look everybody! I'm the Affordable Health Care Act Vulture!" is funny. And it can be appreciated by all Alabamians, regardless of political flavoring. Because it's kinda true.

As always, this was a tough decision.

Ornery Mentions:

Incognito: "I like it up here. I can better see all the people who wish they had insurance."

Frequent Flier awards go to Reaganwasbetter and Ben for many great entries, including:

Ben: "The nuts are complimentary on this flight."

Reaganwasbetter: Alabama state bird: 'Maniacally Grinning Goonie'

Here are a couple more good'uns:

Bennbham: "I ain't takin' no salary, but I sure love the perks."

Yukon67: "I just flew in from Montgomery and boy are my constituents tired."

I was tickled, delighted and disturbed about how many of you were inspired to write music and poetry. This was my favorite of the lyrical entries:

Bottom line: Great job, y'all! Thanks for playing. Now get a job and let the governor come down to earth and get a paycheck.
