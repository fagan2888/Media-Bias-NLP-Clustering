WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, is speaking out against a proposal in Ohio that would roll back Medicaid expansion.

“Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, hundreds of thousands of Ohioans have health care coverage, some for the first time in their lives,” Brown said Wednesday in a teleconference.
