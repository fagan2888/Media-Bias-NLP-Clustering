That\u2019s the question Michael Tomasky asks in his midterm postmortem at the New York Review Of Books and Marc Ambinder distills at The Week.\n\nThe answer, a cascade of self-comforting myths, won\u2019t surprise anyone. We hear it often. Candidates might lose because they lack ideological purity. Or they might lose because their constituencies haven\u2019t been sufficiently \u201ceducated\u201d or motivated to turn out. But political parties never lose because voters have repudiated their policies. Never.\n\n\u201cCan it be true that the only way for Democrats to vote their true strength is to treat the opposing party just as poorly as the opposing party treats the Democrats?\u201d asks Ambinder. (Everyone knows how soft Democrats have been on their arch rivals up to this point.) As the column is titled, \u201cWhy Democrats should treat Republicans like their mortal enemy,\u201d you can probably guess where he falls on the question.\n\nHere\u2019s Tomasky:\n\nRepublican voters, being older and somewhat wealthier and more likely to own property, are more apt to see politics as a continuing conflict of interests that roll over from one election to the next \u2014 they can always be convinced that some undeserving person is coming to take away what they\u2019ve earned. Voters who are overall younger and have fewer assets are less likely to view politics in such stark terms.\n\n\u2026 old folk and their bizarre attachment to property!\n\nWe can concede that Americans who\u2019ve accumulated some level of wealth probably feel more incentive to take part in the political process and less inclined to support quixotic experiments that piddle wealth away. This reaction offers stability and a balance in American politics that tempers populism and drives the Left nuts. (Unexplored topic? Why do property owners feel compelled to vote against Democrats all the time? )\n\nBut with all that said, the assertion that Democrats view politics in less stark terms is an idea only a hopeless partisan could offer. How is a liberal going to get any more stark is probably a better question.\n\nIf Republicans win, we will have a tax system run by billionaires, a democracy run by tycoons, an environmental policy run by oil companies, and a health-care system that leaves millions to die. If you want to save Americans from perpetual poverty and women from the prying cold fingers of the patriarchy, whom are you going to vote for?\n\nWhy don\u2019t these serious concerns roll over from one election to the next?\n\nIf you had to pick a party that has a political anecdote for every injustice of the world\u2014serious or not\u2014which one would it be? If you had to pick a party that believes government offers the best way achieve a moral and fulfilling life, which one is it? Isn\u2019t the case against Republicans that they don\u2019t care about the suffering of the average American? That they\u2019re a party without ideas? Pretty stark, all of it.\n\nWe Don\u2019t Negotiate with Terrorists All of this springs from the biggest myth of the day: The notion that one party is far more extreme than the other. Ambinder claims that GOP \u201cextremism\u201d attracts a larger share of voters than liberal \u201cextremism\u201d does. He writes that the \u201cGOP has become more openly conservative (and therefore closer to the real views of their base voters) in the past 20 years.\u201d\n\nBy offering that Republicans have become \u201cmore openly conservative\u201d the insinuation is that they\u2019ve been batsh**t crazy but are only now being honest about it. It\u2019s been generally accepted by the media that the GOP has gone full Bircher while the Democrats are still a reasonable left-of-center entity. By believing their own press releases, Democrats saw no more need to debate.\n\nNever mind that the liberal consensus on social and economic policy is far to the left of where it was a decade ago. Never mind that only one of these parties unilaterally instituted reforms that sit outside the tradition of American governance. To a liberal pundit, a voter who favors low taxes or a balanced budget or traditional marriage is a fanatic. Is \u201cI don\u2019t like Obamacare\u201d really a radical idea? That seemed to the leading get-out-vote issue.\n\nWhy Aren\u2019t Americans Consumed by Liberal Political Concerns All the Time About Everything Always? Tomasky says that the way to fix the Democrats\u2019 problems is a \u201cmassive and very well-funded public education campaign\u201d that implores voters to take into account the idea that every election is vital. Because we don\u2019t have enough political education available to us today, apparently. Because there aren\u2019t a bunch of 24/7 cable outlets and endless websites already ignored by most Americans. Because political parties don\u2019t spend enough money. Because celebrities aren\u2019t pestering us to head to the polls every two years.\n\nBefore commencement of national reeducation, I have a few alternative theories to throw in:\n\nIf a person stays home on Election Day it can mean one of two things: either they don\u2019t care enough to vote or they\u2019re actively avoiding the vote.\n\nMaybe liberal alarmism isn\u2019t really all that believable all the time. Has increasing over-the-top rhetoric made any of it more believable? Probably not. Perhaps liberal policies aren\u2019t as profoundly beneficial to the young, poor, and minorities as partisans imagine. And Maybe some young voters realize that the GOP isn\u2019t really going to push their grandmother over a cliff or steal their condoms.\n\nNo doubt, younger voters are attracted to many liberal notions in general. The idealism of big election with a charismatic leader who gets lots of attention and makes lots of vague optimistic promises is always going to be more appealing to large groups of people who don\u2019t know anything about policy. But maybe they also want results.\n\nThere is probably an a more important reason.\n\nAmbinder writes:\n\nIt is not a new strategy for the GOP, or for conservatives. But it works better when the party, as it has done during the past several years, actively synchronizes its actions with its words \u2014 when the party that says that government is bad actively acts like government is bad.\n\nThat\u2019s probably giving Republicans too much credit. More likely, it\u2019s because words and reality aren\u2019t synchronizing that so many people don\u2019t care to vote. Maybe when a party tells us that government is always good but actively proves the opposite through its legislation and action people take notice.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Thu, 04 Dec 2014 07:41:06 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Why aren't Americans consumed by Democrats' political concerns all the time about everything always?
