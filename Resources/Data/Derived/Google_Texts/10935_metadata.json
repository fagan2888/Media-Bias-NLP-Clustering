This is a classic case of corporate welfare in Washington, an illegal move that most Americans disdain.\n\nObamacare forced Americans to pay more for their healthcare with higher premiums and deductibles, and now they\u2019re paying for it twice. It bothers those who saw this coming and now the program is riddled with cost overruns and unworkable mandates.\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough to have limited choice, the loss of trusted doctors, and higher costs. Now Obamacare is collapsing and taxpayers are hit with the bill. Americans don\u2019t want to bailout giant insurance companies as a result of a law that those companies helped to write.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity is the source of this information and they have made it easy to contact our congressman at Action Center.\n\nAnd it's not just a problem of paying double for a broken plan. America doesn't realize that Big Pharma was also a major contributer to the 20,000 page monstrosity of a law that makes prescription drugs available at tax-payers expense.\n\nAdverse Drug Reactions have made medical care the leading cause of illness and death, says Dr. Richard Ruhling, an MD who was board-certified in Internal Medicine and taught Health Science at Loma Linda University, now retired.\n\nRuhling says he visited US Senate offices with medical literature to show Rx drugs are #1 risk until one senator said, \u201cYou are wasting your time\u2014they own us,\u201d speaking of drug company donations to their re-election campaign.\n\nRuhling is 74 and has only taken one prescription in the past 50 years. He wonders why he should pay taxes for healthcare of people who choose to eat, drink, smoke and sex as they please. He says true health care is 90% wise choices in what we put in our mouths and getting some exercise.\n\nAs an aid, he recommends the DVD, \u201cEating\u201d that has Bill Clinton's cardiologist, Dr. Esselstyn from the Cleveland Clinic. Five minutes of it may be seen on his website, http://RichardRuhling.com\n\nDr. Richard Ruhling is author of Why You Shouldn't Ask Your Doctor.
