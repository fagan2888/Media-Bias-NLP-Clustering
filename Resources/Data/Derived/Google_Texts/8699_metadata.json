Demographic data was used in modelling to decide how much land was needed for retirement purposes.\n\nThe Property Council ACT has previously called for more retirement-living developments in established suburbs.\n\nAbout one in 10 Canberrans is 65 and older, with that figure expected to double by 2025.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Older people often enjoyed spacious homes, but extra options to allow easier downsizing are welcomed.", "application-name": "Canberra Times", "author": "Matthew Raggatt", "og": {"site_name": "Canberra Times", "description": "Older people often enjoyed spacious homes, but extra options to allow easier downsizing are welcomed.", "title": "Seniors happy with large homes but financial advice welcomed", "url": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/seniors-happy-with-large-homes-but-financial-advice-welcomed-20151204-glg3mt.html", "image": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/l/g/d/9/3/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.glg3mt.png/1449300525657.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Older people often enjoyed spacious homes, but extra options to allow easier downsizing are welcomed.", "title": "Seniors happy with large homes but financial advice welcomed", "image": {"src": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/l/g/d/9/3/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.glg3mt.png/1449300525657.jpg"}, "creator": "@MattRaggatt", "site": "@canberratimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open Canberra Times", "fb": {"app_id": 106020559517129}, "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/favicon.ico;", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au", "article": {"section": "ACT News", "published_time": "2015-12-05T07:28:45+0000", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T07:28:45+0000"}, "pubdate": "2015-12-05T07:28:45+0000", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Council on the Ageing, downsizing, housing in Canberra, Productivity Report on Seniors Housing"}, "article_summary": "Canberra was also failing to meet demands for retirement village places, she said.\nMs Mobbs said there was a need for financial advisers with the depth of knowledge to advise on retirement village investments, which could cost anywhere between $350,000 to $500,000 or more.\nAn advocate for Canberra's over 60s has backed a national report that indicated older people were in no rush to downsize.\nThe Productivity Commission report on seniors housing released this week found about three-quarters of Australians aged over 75 lived in detached houses and had three or more bedrooms.\nAdvertisementThe report called for reform to make it easier to seniors to free-up equity in their home, but acknowledged they had a broad reluctance to tap into this wealth and strong aversion to debt."}
