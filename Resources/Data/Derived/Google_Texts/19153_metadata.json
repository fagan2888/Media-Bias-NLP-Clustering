Rather, the prevalence of high talent on a given sports team in games such as basketball and soccer may reach a tipping point after which individual talent becomes counterproductive to the collective goal: winning.\n\nA new study published Friday in the journal Psychological Science describes how many people, including elite coaches in leagues around the world, misinterpret how individual talents contribute to success as a team. Lead author Roderick Swaab, a professor at INSEAD, says the \u201cball-hog\u201d effect may be seen among teams competing at the top levels of today\u2019s sporting events. On Tuesday, reigning champion Spain suffered an upset to Croatia in the 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament, despite a preponderance of elite players on the team. One day earlier, the star-studded Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association fell to the San Antonio Spurs, ending their two-year title reign.\n\n\u201cMost people believe that the relationship between talent and team performance is linear \u2014 the more their team is packed with talent, the better they will do,\u201d Swaab said in a press statement. \u201cYet our latest research documenting a \u2018too-much-talent effect\u2019, reveals that for teams requiring high levels of interdependence, like football and basketball, talent facilitates team performance\u2026 but only up to a point.\u201d\n\nBeyond that tipping point, the benefits of increasing individual talent would decrease team interdependence, until it eventually begins to hurt team performance. However, the idea that individual talent would hurt team success remains anathema to the non-academic, perhaps. Swaab and his colleagues cite French national team coach Didier Deschamps, who told reporters after five losses last year that acquiring more elite players would provide the key to future success \u2014 a solid conclusion in the minds of most.\n\nIn the FIFA World Cup, \u201cwe expect to see plenty of team-sheets boasting impressive lineups with top talented players,\u201d Swaab said. \u201cHowever, coaches that simply select their side with superstars may, contrary to popular belief, be the ones taking an early exit from Brazil!\u201d\n\nMore broadly, the ball-hog effect can be expanded to analyze organizational dynamics in business.\n\n\u201cWhen team success merely depends on the accumulation of individual performance [e.g. sales teams], hiring and staffing could simply focus on getting the most talented individuals on board,\u201d Swaab said. \u201cHowever, these same strategies can hurt a willingness to coordinate effectively when team success depends on high levels of interdependence [e.g. strategy teams]. When interdependence between team members is high, organizations could either hire a better mix of top talent and non-top talent and/or invest more in training to formalize roles, ranks, and responsibilities.\u201d\n\nAs for the tipping point in the NBA? Swaab says any team stocked with more than 60 percent of elite players may risk upset and dashed expectations.\n\nSource: Swaab, Roderick, et al.
