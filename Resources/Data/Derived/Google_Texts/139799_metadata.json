Some people, though, are turning to alternatives called \u201chealth care sharing ministries,\u201d one of which \u2014 Christian Healthcare Ministries of Barberton \u2014 is profiled in this New York Times story.\n\n\n\nThe piece looks at the case of Greenville, S.C., resident Theresa Bixby, 63, who learned four years ago that she had breast cancer. She had lost her job and insurance, and six months prior to the diagnosis joined Christian Healthcare Ministries.\n\n\n\nThe price was right \u2014 $45 a month for the cheapest plan \u2014 but the ministry makes no guarantees of payment.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s how it works, according to the story:\n\n\n\nMembers send their monthly \u201cgift\u201d to an escrow account, which disburses payments for eligible medical bills, excluding costs like routine physicals, continuing treatment for pre-existing conditions or procedures that members have voted to exclude, like care for pregnancies outside wedlock.\n\n\n\nEach time Ms. Bixby visited her hospital for tests or chemotherapy, she explained that she was a self-pay patient and a member of a cost-sharing ministry. Sometimes the receptionist nodded; sometimes she got a blank stare. The hospital never denied her treatment, but \u201cI was getting a two-inch stack of bills every month, and threats that they would take me to collections,\u201d she told me.\n\n\n\nChristian Healthcare Ministries assigned her case to a \u201cmember advocate,\u201d who negotiated discounts on her fees. These counted toward Ms. Bixby\u2019s $5,000 deductible, so she paid out of pocket only for office visits. In the end, the ministry persuaded the hospital to lop $220,900 off a bill of $301,540 and reimbursed or paid directly the remaining $80,640.\n\n\n\nThe Times says the four main cost-sharing ministries in the United States, including Christian Healthcare Ministries and Independence-based Liberty HealthShare, have about 340,000 members. Could this model scale?\n\n\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t something that\u2019s for everyone,\u201d said Tony Meggs, CEO of Florida-based Christian Care Ministry, which runs a health care sharing program called Medi-Share.\n\n\n\nThat might be an understatement.\n\n\n\nFrom the story:\n\n\n\n\n\nHot in Cleveland\n\nToday, Medi-Share requires members to \u201clive by biblical standards:\u201d no tobacco or illegal drugs and no sex \u201coutside of traditional Christian marriage.\u201d Samaritan Ministries, with headquarters in Peoria, Ill., requires a pastor\u2019s approval of medical expenses (and refuses to cover treatment for S.T.D.s unless \u201ccontracted innocently\u201d). Liberty HealthShare, based in Independence, Ohio, is the only Affordable Care Act-exempt ministry open to people of many faiths. It asks them to affirm that \u201cit is my spiritual duty to God and my ethical duty to others to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\u201d\n\nCleveland is one of the best U.S. cities for single people, according to this story from Forbes.com, based on a new survey by San Francisco-based financial literacy site NerdWallet.\n\n\n\nThe list looks at something called \u201cdating affordability,\u201d which Forbes.com says is \u201ccalculated as the price of a three-course meal for two, relying on data from a user-generated cost-of-living information site called Numbeo, plus two movie tickets at a midrange restaurant, taken from the Council for Community and Economic Research.\u201d It also calculates the median earnings for workers, taken from the Census, \u201cto gauge the relative affordability of dating.\u201d In addition it evaluates \u201cdate-friendliness\u201d by calculating the number of arts and entertainment businesses and restaurants per 1,000 residents, plus \u201cwalk scores. . . to evaluate how easy it is to get around and meet people,\u201d derived from a site called walkstore.com.\n\n\n\nThe final criterion: the percentage of the population 15 and over that\u2019s unmarried, also calculated from Census Bureau data.\n\n\n\nCleveland is fifth by these measures, behind only Boston, Washington, Philadelphia and Baltimore.\n\n\n\nHere is the data breakdown for Cleveland, which benefits from low costs for a date and lots of arts, entertainment and restaurant options.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis and that\n\nThe future is now: There\u2019s an intriguing \u2014 and from Cleveland\u2019s perspective, quite heartening \u2014 comment from a PricewaterhouseCoopers analyst in this Bloomberg story about an Atlanta developer\u2019s new project.\n\n\n\nThe news service reports that Portman Holdings LLC, which has built high-profile properties such as San Francisco\u2019s One Embarcadero Center, \u201cplans to break ground in June on its first U.S. office development without tenant commitments in more than 25 years.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe project is in Charlotte, N.C., \u201cwhile builders such as Houston-based Hines and San Antonio, Texas-based USAA Real Estate Co. are also looking beyond the biggest U.S. cities and starting projects in smaller markets, even without tenants lined up,\u201d according to the story. Such speculative ventures, Bloomberg says, \u201cwere shunned by developers after the 2008 property crash.\u201d\n\n\n\nMitch Roschelle, a partner at the U.S. real estate advisory practice of PricewaterhouseCoopers, tells Bloomberg, \u201cMore jobs are being created in lower-cost markets. These markets are going to be hot in terms of investments and new developments.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story also notes that technology-related jobs were the key driver of office demand last year, according to Cushman. Smaller, lower-cost markets may benefit from the emergence of new companies in that space, Roschelle says.\u201cMore and more investors in startups don\u2019t want them to be in Silicon Valley, where everything is super-expensive,\u201d he tells Bloomberg. \u201cThey want them in places like Cleveland, where operational costs are very low, and that means more demand for office space in those places.\u201dTheHill.com reports that a prominent environmental advocacy organization has found an ally in former U.S. Rep. Steve LaTourette.LaTourette is among a group of lobbyists at McDonald Hopkins Government Strategies working on behalf of the Environmental Defense Action Fund A bipartisan team at the firm will work on \u201cclimate related issues and initiatives,\u201d according to disclosure firms submitted to the Senate, TheHill.com reports.In Congress, LaTourette, a Republican, \u201cearned a 25 percent approval rating from another environmental advocacy group, the League of Conservation Voters,\u201d the website says.But \u201che appears to have taken up the climate change mantle,\u201d telling Bloomberg last year, \u201cClimate change needs to be in the mix of all of our other discussions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also can follow me on Twitter for more news about business and Northeast Ohio.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The New York Times looks at the case of a South Carolina resident diagnosed with cancer who joined the Barberton-based Christian Healthcare Ministries.
