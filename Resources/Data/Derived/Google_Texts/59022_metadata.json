It would make the Enron accountants blush. You continue to keep all of the revenues from the Affordable Care Act in this budget while you claim, and they\u2019re telling your folks, that you\u2019re repealing the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ranking Member Chris Van Hollen said at the start of the marathon markup. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t square. So once again, not a single tax break for special interests is closed to help reduce the deficit.\u201d\n\nThe 25 amendments tacked on by Democrats \u2013 which included issues like Planned Parenthood funding and an equal pay provision \u2013 were rejected by the panel while the two Republican provisions passed, including one that would provide a separate package of mandatory spending reductions.\n\n\u201cI commend Chairman Price for passing a responsible, conservative budget that cuts the deficit by $7 trillion and balances within a decade\u2014all without raising taxes,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThis blueprint also repeals Obamacare, shrinks the EPA, improves Medicare and Medicaid, strengthens our military, and calls for tax reform. It represents our vision for a smaller government and healthier economy, and it\u2019s a document that can make all conservatives proud.\u201d\n\nThe proposal could see some issues when it hits the House floor, as members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said they are unwilling to back the budget due to its spending increases.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
