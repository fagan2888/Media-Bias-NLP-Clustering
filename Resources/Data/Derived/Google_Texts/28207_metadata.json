John Cornyn (R) grilled Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u2018Navigator\u2019 program during a Congressional oversight hearing on Wednesday, suggesting that the health care law would grant convicted felons access to sensitive medical information and jeopardize Americans\u2019 privacy.\n\n\u201cThe president is in Dallas, Texas today touting the navigator program, which as you know are people who are hired to navigate the [Affordable Care Act], but I would just like to ask you this question,\u201d Cornyn said to Sebelius. \u201cIsn\u2019t it true that there is no federal requirement for a navigator to undergo a criminal background check, even though they will receive sensitive personal information for people they help sign up for the Affordable Care Act?\u201d\n\nSebelius responded that while the federal government does not require recipients of the so-called Navigator grants to conduct background checks on their employees, \u201cstates can add an additional background check and other features.\u201d\n\nIndeed, several states \u2014 including Cornyn\u2019s Texas \u2014 have either enacted or are considering additional privacy protections, though the new mandates could actually complicate Navigators\u2019 efforts to sign up low-income uninsured Americans in health care coverage.\n\nFederal rules already require Navigators to receive 20 hours of training, including instruction in client privacy, and impose fines of up to $25,000 for violations of confidentiality. Grant recipients must also abide by 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 155.260, \u201cthe statutory provisions providing for the privacy and security of personally identifiable information under the Affordable Care Act\u201d and many organizations perform additional privacy trainings for their employees.\n\nRecipients of the grants are typically experienced and trusted community centers, that have a long history of helping seniors or children enroll in government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program without incident. A state like Texas currently doesn\u2019t even require \u201ccriminal background checks of the state eligibility-determination workers\u201d who help residents learn about other federal assistance \u2014 but would suddenly demand additional checks for Obamacare Navigators.\n\nThe change would significantly impact a group like Community Council of Greater Dallas, which has decades of experience connecting low income populations to federal benefits. The group has hired 75 navigators to help guide Texans through Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through all of these issues, such as privacy and confidentiality,\u201d Martha Blainethe director of the Council said. Under new rules proposed by Rick Perry, Navigators would have to get an additional 40 hours of training, undergo a rigorous state-administered exam [and] submit to background checks. The organization would then pay a fee to cover the cost of enforcing the regulations and report the names of the people they enroll to a state database.\n\nThe additional screenings also come as private companies and some states are moving away from discriminating against employees based on their past criminal records. The big box retailer Target announced last month that it will stop asking prospective employees about their criminal records on job applications, reasoning that the question weeds out many qualified candidates. Starting next year, the company will wait until making a provisional job offer before inquiring about a prospective employee\u2019s record, giving potential hires the chance to make their case before an employer passes judgement. Last month, California enacted a law banning government employers from asking job applicants about their criminal record until later in the hiring process and at least \u201ca half-dozen states have similar laws.\u201d\n\nStill, Republican legislatures and officials \u201cin at least 17 states across the country\u201d have thrown away their anathema to government regulations and set-up \u201call manner of bureaucratic roadblocks in front of the program.\u201d Navigators are expected to help millions of uninsured Americans sign up for health insurance coverage and learn them about their options. But if states continue to raise the threshold for certification, the groups may have a hard time reaching the \u201cminorities, low\u2013income individuals, individuals with mental illnesses or substance abuse problems, and other vulnerable populations\u201d that they\u2019re meant to serve.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Get over it!", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Get over it!", "title": "Yes, Ex-Convicts Could Help You Sign Up For Obamacare And You Should Stop Freaking Out About It", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/11/06/2901881/convicted-felons/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-draft-application-youll-probably-have-to-fill-out-to-get-obamacare-coverage-e1397760672576.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Get over it!", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-draft-application-youll-probably-have-to-fill-out-to-get-obamacare-coverage-e1397760672576.jpg", "title": "Yes, Ex-Convicts Could Help You Sign Up For Obamacare And You Should Stop Freaking Out About It", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-draft-application-youll-probably-have-to-fill-out-to-get-obamacare-coverage-e1397760672576.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/the-draft-application-youll-probably-have-to-fill-out-to-get-obamacare-coverage-e1397760672576.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-06T16:05:21+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e39\"", "article_summary": "The group has hired 75 navigators to help guide Texans through Obamacare.\n\u00a7 155.260, \u201cthe statutory provisions providing for the privacy and security of personally identifiable information under the Affordable Care Act\u201d and many organizations perform additional privacy trainings for their employees.\nA state like Texas currently doesn\u2019t even require \u201ccriminal background checks of the state eligibility-determination workers\u201d who help residents learn about other federal assistance \u2014 but would suddenly demand additional checks for Obamacare Navigators.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through all of these issues, such as privacy and confidentiality,\u201d Martha Blainethe director of the Council said.\nThe additional screenings also come as private companies and some states are moving away from discriminating against employees based on their past criminal records."}
