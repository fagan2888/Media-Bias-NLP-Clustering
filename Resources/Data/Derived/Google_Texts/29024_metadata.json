(AP) - Soon after meeting her future husband Frank, Mitzi Perdue began to take notes.\n\nFrank, of course, is Frank Perdue of the Salisbury-based Perdue Farms Inc. chicken company. When Frank began working at Perdue, it was him and his father, Mitzi Perdue said.\n\nBut by the time Frank Perdue died in 2005, the company - of which Frank\u2019s son, Jim Perdue, is now chairman - had grown to many thousands of employees.\n\nMore than 25 years after Frank and Mitzi\u2019s first meeting, and after interviews with 134 people, she\u2019s written a biography of her husband Frank that can also serve as a business guide. The anecdote about taking notes is one from her book, titled \u201cTough Man, Tender Chicken: Business & Life Lessons from Frank Perdue.\u201d\n\nShe wrote a previous biography of him, \u201cFrank Perdue: Fifty Years of Building on a Solid Foundation,\u201d published in 1989.\n\nMitzi Perdue has been a columnist - including previously for The Daily Times - and currently writes a blog for the Academy of Women\u2019s Health and writes for Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News. She\u2019s also on the board of the Perdue Foundation.\n\nShe had been planning to write a different, unrelated book, but when that didn\u2019t work out, a now-executive with her book publisher, Significance Press, suggested she write about Frank Perdue.\n\nMitzi Perdue, 73, said in an interview this winter she doesn\u2019t know if her late husband, Frank Perdue, would like the biography. She writes a family newsletter, and she used to have Frank Perdue read it first.\n\n\u201cHe just, without exception, would take out anything that was like a glowing report,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said.\n\nAlthough she admits that she\u2019s biased as his widow, she didn\u2019t edit out the people who didn\u2019t rave about him. Actually, she said, the book would have been boring - and wouldn\u2019t have been fair to Frank Perdue - if she\u2019d only been positive.\n\nShe acknowledged the unique opportunity she had.\n\n\u201cI think there wouldn\u2019t be many biographers who would get a chance to ask their subject in real time at any moment what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.\n\nMitzi Perdue said she originally planned for her book on Frank Perdue, published last fall, to be for business students. But she also realized other people were just interested in Frank Perdue or about the chicken industry.\n\n\u201cThis book is about the life and work of Frank Perdue and it\u2019s really meant to be inspirational,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said. \u201cI think when you read it maybe you\u2019ll just possibly think a little bit bigger.\u201d\n\nThe book is separated into 22 chapters relating to different aspects of Frank Perdue and business, from his childhood to marketing, packaging, accounting and loyalty. Each chapter ends with a few key points from the chapter: \u201cFrank Perdue\u2019s Lessons.\u201d\n\nWords of wisdom from Frank Perdue are also compiled in the form of quotes at the end, among them:\n\n- \u201cYou can go to the worst operator there is and find something in his operation that\u2019s better than you are.\u201d\n\n- \u201cDo things right, treat people right, be honest in your dealings, and the business will grow; it will grow because you did things right, not because you wish it was big.\u201d\n\n- \u201cThere is no substitute for high quality. Quality is the one absolutely necessary ingredient of all the most successful companies in the world.\u201d\n\nThrough her interviews with others - including people who knew him before she did - she was able to learn more about her late husband.\n\n\u201cHe was very different at home than he was at work,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said. \u201cHe was really pretty easygoing at home. And at work, he really was a tough man. On the other hand, almost everybody I interviewed had stayed with him for life and wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\nHe was not only successful in business, but involved in his community and family, Mitzi Perdue said.\n\nShe said she misses Frank Perdue, who she married in 1988.\n\n\u201cI look back on the years with him as absolutely the best of my life,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said.\n\nShe said she enjoyed writing the book, which she wrote and did most of the interviews for between March and June of last year - that was 15-hour days, seven days a week, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been happier writing this book than I have been since the time of his passing,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said.\n\nFrank Perdue did very well with growing the business, Mitzi Perdue said.\n\n\u201cFrom his vast knowledge of the world that he got from so much reading and talking with people and research, he knew where he wanted to go, he figured out how to get there and most often how to get there meant learning new skills, overcoming old attitudes, just growing and becoming a bigger and bigger person,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said. \u201cAnd I think the book gives that advice over and over again, in different words.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Soon after meeting her future husband, Frank Perdue, Mitzi began to take notes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Soon after meeting her future husband, Frank Perdue, Mitzi began to take notes.", "title": "Mitzi Perdue, Frank\u2019s widow, writing book about chicken tycoon", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/8/mitzi-perdue-writes-book-about-late-husband-frank/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/11/AP840730051.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/11/AP840730051.jpg", "description": "Soon after meeting her future husband, Frank Perdue, Mitzi began to take notes.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mitzi Perdue, Frank\u2019s widow, writing book about chicken tycoon"}, "Author": "VANESSA JUNKIN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Mitzi Perdue, Frank Perdue"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb66e\"", "article_summary": "Mitzi Perdue, 73, said in an interview this winter she doesn\u2019t know if her late husband, Frank Perdue, would like the biography.\nFrank Perdue did very well with growing the business, Mitzi Perdue said.\nFrank, of course, is Frank Perdue of the Salisbury-based Perdue Farms Inc. chicken company.\nMitzi Perdue said she originally planned for her book on Frank Perdue, published last fall, to be for business students.\n\u201cThis book is about the life and work of Frank Perdue and it\u2019s really meant to be inspirational,\u201d Mitzi Perdue said."}
