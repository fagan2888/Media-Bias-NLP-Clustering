The question now is whether Childers can win in November against a Republican.\n\n\u201cI do realize people may have more money to spend than I do, but no one will out-work me,\u201d Childers said Tuesday in a phone interview as he traveled to Jackson following campaign stops in the Mississippi Delta.\n\nChilders is laying the groundwork for why he believes his message will resonate with voters in the November general election.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, the people of Washington, D.C., have forgot the working folks,\u201d Childers said. \u201cThey bicker and fight and look for reasons to disagree. Washington isn\u2019t working. I\u2019m ready to reach across the aisle.\u201d\n\nChilders said he is a small business owner and knows the issues facing small businesses. He said they are getting lost in the system.\n\n\u201cTravis Childers represents the best opportunity Democrats have had to win a U.S. Senate seat in Mississippi in a generation,\u201d said Mississippi Democratic Party Chairman Rickey Cole. \u201cWe have to work hard to introduce him to the voters in the three-fourths of the state where he has never been a candidate. I believe his down-home, common sense approach to government, his humility and his passion to serve the people will connect with the voters we need in order to win. Off-year elections are about voter turnout, and we are working on a 21st century get-out-the-vote effort in every precinct.\u201d\n\nChilders\u2019 goal is to become better known south of Jackson. He said his campaign will focus on spending more time in the southern part of the state.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been a Democratic U.S. senator since the late John C. Stennis retired in 1989. Prior to that, the late Jim Eastland, a conservative Democrat, retired in 1978.\n\nChilders said some may see him as a populist candidate, not necessarily a bad thing. A populist is described as a member of a political party claiming to represent common people.\n\n\u201cWe are hardworking people in Mississippi,\u201d Childers said. He said he\u2019s been working since he was 16.\n\nChilders said he supports job creation, increasing the minimum wage and is a strong advocate for public education. He said he attended public school and attended college on Pell grants. His two daughters attended public school. If elected to the U.S. Senate, Childers said his platform will include keeping Social Security and Medicaid strong.\n\nBut Childers doesn\u2019t see himself as a traditional Democrat.\n\nWhen he was in Congress, he voted against the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare. He opposed any ban on the right to carry firearms, and he believes marriage should be between a man and woman.\n\nChilders was a former member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative House Democrats. He and several other members were defeated in re-election bids in 2010.\n\nChilders said he voted against the Affordable Care Act because he was concerned about the health care bill\u2019s cost and the \u201cabsence of sufficiently strong language to prohibit federal funding for abortion.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/news/2014/06/03/travis-childers-looks-ahead-november/9938871/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Former U.S. Rep.
