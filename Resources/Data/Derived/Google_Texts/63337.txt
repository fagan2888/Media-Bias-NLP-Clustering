COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -

More jobs were available in Colorado last month, than ever before. But according to the state Department of Labor, the unemployment rate was up by more than 4 percent.



More than 16,000 people were unemployed last month in El Paso County.

"I've been unemployed for seven years. My last job was as a firefighter," said Mike Solner.

A sickness put Solner out of work for the last seven years.



"The experience was tough. I lost my home. I still have my daughter, but I lost everything," said Solner.



The Pikes Peak Workforce Center helps people like Solner find a job.



"People can come in and utilize our services. Twenty-six percent of the individuals who attend our events are hired," said Dana Barton of Pikes Peak Workforce Center.

A total of 11,000 jobs were added in Colorado last month. However, fewer jobs are being found.



"In the summertime, most people are home with their children so they're not making their job search has much of a priority," said Barton.

For the unemployed like Solner, being homeless makes it that much harder.



"Being out of the work force for seven years, what's available? What can I still do physically? It's going to take time, but the workforce center is helping me," said Solner.



The Salvation Army and Pikes Peak Workforce Center work together to find a home and job for the unemployed.



"I will get it back. I will get my home back. My biggest thing is my daughter's education. I plan on working a long time," said Solner.

El Paso County's unemployment rate is 5 percent. Pueblo county is 6 percent.
