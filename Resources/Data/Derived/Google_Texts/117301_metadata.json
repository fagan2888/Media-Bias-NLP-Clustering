US lawmakers embarked on another day of high-stakes political brinkmanship Wednesday, battling to scrape together an eleventh hour deal to protect Washington's battered financial standing. At midnight (0400 GMT), the US economy will sail into uncharted waters and the Treasury will no longer be able to guarantee it will be able to meet its obligations and avert a devastating debt default. The only way to avert this peril, which could send global markets into turmoil and threaten another recession, would be for Congress to agree to raise the US government's $16.7 trillion debt ceiling.

We\u2019re split on Obamacare, taxes, foreign policy and a hundred other things. We\u2019re even split on whether a politician should be the next President.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the recent poll my group commissioned so remarkable. It turns out most of us agree on one thing: Congress should not be above the ObamaCare law. Both those who support the law and those who oppose it believe that Congress should live under the law that was enacted. They don\u2019t.\n\nIn truly bipartisan fashion, albeit very quietly, Congressional leaders from both parties sought an Obamacare waiver and the White House, through the Office of Personnel Management, happily agreed. Today Congress and staff enjoy a unique distinction outside the law\u2014 they get a 75 percent subsidy for Gold Level Obamacare coverage, even though their incomes are too high to qualify for Obamacare\u2019s normal subsidies. Members can even opt much of their staff out of the law entirely. That\u2019s just flat wrong according to most Americans.\n\nIn a nationwide omnibus survey of 1,015 American adults, conducted by the polling company inc./WomanTrend on behalf of Independent Women\u2019s Voice between Oct. 1-4, a 70.7 percent majority said Congress should live under the law just as citizens do. Even self-identified Democrats (68 percent to 23 percent) agree that Capitol Hill should apply the law as written, joining Independents (72 percent to 20 percent) and Republicans (77 percent to 19 percent).\n\nAdd to that strong support among women (70 percent to 23 percent), Hispanics (68 percent to 28 percent), African-Americans (63 percent to 26 percent) and liberals (62 percent to 28 percent), and the \u201cdiscontent of the governed\u201d becomes perfectly clear. Conservatives (who are driving rejection of political \u201cinsiders\u201d) favor revoking the exemption 80 percent to 17 percent.\n\nOur questions show an opportunity for the next Speaker of the House. We asked: \u201cEven after having won majorities in both the U.S. House and Senate, Republicans have not repealed Congress\u2019 exemption from ObamaCare. How important is it to you that a criterion for the next Speaker of the House be that he promises to bring legislation to revoke Congress\u2019 special exemption from ObamaCare as one of his first acts?\u201d Roughly seven in ten Americans (71.3 percent) think that it is either \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d important that outgoing Speaker John Boehner\u2019s successor remove this accommodation (versus 23.8 percent who consider it \u201cjust a little bit\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d important).\n\nClearly, Americans are both united and emphatic about political insiders\u2019 gift to themselves. Self-identified Republicans (78.0 percent) consider revoking the special exemption an \u201cimportant\u201d criterion for their next Speaker of the House, although majorities of Democrats (67.4 percent) and Independents (65.5 percent) also share this view.\n\nWe also asked: \u201cWould you be more likely or less likely to vote for a candidate who supports ending the congressional exemption from ObamaCare?\u201d A 58.4 percent majority of those surveyed \u2014 with majorities across the political spectrum \u2014 say they are \u201cmore likely\u201d to vote for a candidate who would end the special exemption (versus 19.4 percent who are \u201cless likely\u201d).\n\nRepublicans in the House can use this moment to begin restoring credibility with the American public. The \u201cWashington Exemption\u201d is bad politics and bad policy that puts distance between those inside and outside government. It says, \u201cWe rulers deserve aristocratic treatment.\u201d Reversing this special exemption would be a significant first step to restoring trust because Democrats, Republicans and Independents also agree on another idea: the country is on the wrong track\u2014and Congress is a big part of the problem.\n\nHadley Heath Manning is Director of Health Policy at the Independent Women\u2019s Voice.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Hadley Heath Manning", "description": "Americans don't want politicians and their staffs to be exempt from Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "We Americans don\u2019t agree on much these days.
