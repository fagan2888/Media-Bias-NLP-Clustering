Following a late night in Cleveland, the 26-year-old is not wasting any time as he seeks to build a stronger conservative movement in the Buckeye State.\n\nFrustrated by the political establishment and career politicians devoid of principles, Josefczyk and co-founder Justin Powell set out to shake up Ohio politics by investing in its youth. Their newly formed organization, Forge Leadership Network, is already working with 45 young people from Ohio and neighboring states. Josefczyk wants to double that number next year and spread the movement beyond Ohio to other states in the Midwest.\n\nOver breakfast at a diner in this small village on the outskirts of Cleveland, Josefczyk introduced two of his star pupils: Peter Lyons and Rachel del Guidice.\n\nLyons, a homeschooled high school student who is starting his senior year, has his sights set on several options after college, including seminary. Del Guidice, a senior at Franciscan University of Steubenville, got hooked on politics after a Washington, D.C., internship at the Family Research Council.\n\nLyons and del Guidice are the type of young people whom Josefczyk wants Forge to attract: They have a passion for politics, hold strong conservative beliefs, and exhibit the ambition to be future leaders in a state where the farm team needs replenishing.\n\nIn its first year, Forge relied heavily on a strong word-of-mouth campaign to recruit students. The 45 who were ultimately selected participated in a four-and-a-half-day summit in July at the Statehouse in Columbus.\n\nJosefczyk, who serves as Forge\u2019s executive director, is now working to provide year-round support through a mentorship program that gives these young conservatives an edge.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re a Forge fellow, you\u2019re always one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to serve as a temp agency for them to open doors and help them get connected. We\u2019ve already placed students in internships at great conservative organizations.\u201d\n\nWith the mentorship program, Josefczyk hopes to provide the career advice and counseling for young conservatives that he thinks is lacking in Ohio and the nation. Ultimately, he believes, this will give them a better chance at success\u2014and eventually build a bigger network that keeps the farm team fully stocked.\n\nThe Inspiration Behind the Idea\n\nJosefczyk is a lifelong Ohio conservative who graduated from the University of Dayton and settled in the city with his wife Jessica, his college sweetheart. After graduation, he worked at a Christian ministry for college students and taught at Dayton Christian High School, where he\u2019s still the head coach of the varsity golf team.\n\nIt was a little more than three years ago when he got involved in Ohio politics. Josefczyk helped run a friend\u2019s primary campaign, which led to a role with Citizens for Community Values Action, where he oversaw grassroots outreach in 2012.\n\nWorking with two other conservatives, Forge co-founder Powell and Michael Hamilton, Josefczyk founded the Ohio Conservative Review to report and comment on the news.\n\nThese experiences gave him an up-close look at Ohio politics\u2014including what he viewed as the state\u2019s shortcomings.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of young people with conservative convictions and a desire to be engaged in public square\u2014people who really buck the stereotype of college students,\u201d Josefczyk said. \u201cAt the same time, these young people were getting disillusioned or burned out because of their involvement with party politics. They didn\u2019t want to help someone move up the political ladder who wasn\u2019t fighting for the principles they believe in.\u201d\n\nThe lack of this farm system\u2014a term typically used in sports\u2014prompted Josefczyk to act. He saw great programs in Washington, D.C., but none happening in Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe started talking about the need for this about a year ago,\u201d said Wesley Goodman, a Forge board member who previously worked for Rep. Jim Jordan in Washington. \u201cWhen you have young people who are coming of age in Ohio and the Midwest, it\u2019s important for us to identify, equip and train this next generation of leadership. And that\u2019s not just in politics. It\u2019s in business, industry, ministry, culture and media.\u201d\n\nBuilding the Farm Team\n\nThe highlight of Forge\u2019s work so far is the summit, which ran from July 14-18 in Columbus. Josefczyk spread word throughout the Midwest about the opportunity, drawing students from as far as Nebraska and Missouri to Ohio for the four-and-a-half-day event.\n\nStudents stayed at Ohio Christian University and interacted with state leaders on the floor of the Statehouse for two days. It was an intense experience with a lot of activities and little sleep, but one that del Guidice said was worthwhile.\n\n\u201cI was really intimidated,\u201d del Guidice said. \u201cBut by the end, I learned more in those four days about government than I did in high school or college. You really begin to understand how things work.\u201d\n\nThe legislative simulation put students in committees to craft bills and debate legislation. There was disagreement on many issues, including proposals on the militarization of police and the Article 9 convention.\n\n\u201cBeing on floor and going through the process with bills we passed in committee was pretty amazing,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThat was unique. I didn\u2019t expect to do that.\u201d\n\nDel Guidice said it was particularly helpful to have six state representatives interact with the students. They worked together in committee rooms, providing advice on how to navigate the legislative process.\n\nIn addition to spending time at the Statehouse, students heard from national leaders about a range of topics. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Heather Pfitzenmaier, director of the Young Leaders Program, was among the speakers. Representatives from Alliance Defending Freedom did media training to help students hone their message.\n\nGoodman, who recently moved back to Ohio from Washington, was among the speakers. He told the students about the importance of staying engaged and active.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not enough to be a Republican or even a conservative anymore,\u201d he told The Daily Signal. \u201cYou have to be willing to stand up and fight for what you believe in to win these cultural and political arguments so we can have a bigger impact. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re trying to [do] with Forge.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nAs they head back to school, Lyons and del Guidice will have the benefit of working with a mentor over the coming year. Josefczyk has also tasked them with spreading the message about Forge to recruit new people for next year\u2019s summit.\n\nLyons, who was one of the youngest people at the summit, already has deeply held convictions about politics and the role he wants to play in the future.\n\n\u201cOur relationships are inherently political,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cThe only way a society can survive is if enough people participate in political process. In America, that\u2019s how it works. I feel the need to be well-informed because it\u2019s the duty of educated man to contribute to his country.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s ultimately what Josefczyk wants Forge participants to take away from the experience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not training 50 students a year to run for office,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, some of our students will be the next principled statesmen and stateswomen. But we want to have others who are titans in private sector, in media, sound legal minds defending the Constitution, and a lot of different vocations.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Lyons and del Guidice, for example, a political career might not be in their future. But whether it\u2019s a pastoral position for Lyons or journalism job for del Guidice, they\u2019ve both found something of value from Forge.\n\n\u201cIt does not matter if you want to be a doctor, legislator or banker\u2014you\u2019ll learn so much about the process by going to Forge,\u201d said del Guidice. \u201cIt\u2019ll make your life richer because you experienced it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe beauty of Forge was not that I learned a lot about politics. Politics is not for everybody. What Forge offered me was a birds-eye view of our country from a classical standpoint. If you don\u2019t understand those principles, you can\u2019t be a good American citizens who fulfills your responsibilities.\u201d\n\nForge shared this video with The Daily Signal featuring some of the summit\u2019s participants:\n\nThis story was updated to include Justin Powell\u2019s name as a co-founder of Forge and include photo credits for Danny Woods and Jena Powell.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adam Josefczyk set out to shake up Ohio politics by investing in its youth through a newly formed organization, Forge Leadership Network.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Adam Josefczyk set out to shake up Ohio politics by investing in its youth through a newly formed organization, Forge Leadership Network.", "title": "Ohio Conservative Builds a Farm Team of Future Leaders", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150828_ForgeRachel.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-27T23:00:43+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UfxXWK"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Adam Josefczyk set out to shake up Ohio politics by investing in its youth through a newly formed organization, Forge Leadership Network.", "title": "Ohio Conservative Builds a Farm Team of Future Leaders", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150828_ForgeRachel.jpg"}, "creator": "@RobertBluey", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-08-27T15:40:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-27T23:00:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ohio, politics, conservatism, Forge Leadership Network, Adam Josefczyk, Wesley Goodman"}, "article_summary": "It was a little more than three years ago when he got involved in Ohio politics.\nThe Inspiration Behind the IdeaJosefczyk is a lifelong Ohio conservative who graduated from the University of Dayton and settled in the city with his wife Jessica, his college sweetheart.\nIt was an intense experience with a lot of activities and little sleep, but one that del Guidice said was worthwhile.\nWorking with two other conservatives, Forge co-founder Powell and Michael Hamilton, Josefczyk founded the Ohio Conservative Review to report and comment on the news.\nAs they head back to school, Lyons and del Guidice will have the benefit of working with a mentor over the coming year."}
