Because HRAs don't meet set rules and the IRS is defining them as group health plans, employers can be fined an outrageous amount.\"\n\n\n\nThe fine is $100 per day per employee.\n\n\n\n\"That can accumulate pretty quickly,\" Stevenson said. \"For many small businesses, that fine is really a financial unknown that's starting to add up. If you're currently a small business owner and you offer an HRA to your 10 employees, you're going to owe the IRS more than $366,000 by the end of the year.\"\n\n\n\nBecause of that, she said, small businesses that simply want to do the right thing can't afford the punishment.\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, they're going to have to stop offering assistance through HRAs,\" Stevenson said.\n\n\n\n'Sooner rather than later'\n\n\n\nLegislation has been introduced in both houses of Congress to address what Stevenson called \"a backwards IRS ruling.\"\n\n\n\nThe bill is called The Small Business Relief Act.\n\n\n\n\"It's HR 2911 in the House and S1697 in the Senate,\" she said. \"The bill would protect small businesses with fewer than 50 employees, folks who don't have the time or manpower to manage a group health plan. The legislation would protect them from outrageous fines for providing HRAs as an option to their employees.\"\n\n\n\nStevenson said both bills have been referred to committee.\n\n\n\n\"The House bill currently has 72 bi-partisan co-sponsors and the Senate bill has 12 bipartisan co-sponsors,\" she said. \"My organization is actively engaged in trying to educate members of Congress and their staff members about the bills about what's happening with HRAs and the IRS interpretation, working to garner additional co-sponsors in support and we're obviously hoping to move this legislation sooner rather than later.\"\n\n\n\nBrian Jopek may be reached via email at bjopek@lakelandtimes.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArticle Comment Submission Form Please feel free to submit your comments.\n\n\n\nArticle comments are not posted immediately to the Web site.
