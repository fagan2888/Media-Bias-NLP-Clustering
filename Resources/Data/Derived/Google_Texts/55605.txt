New footage from “Winnie Mandela,” the biopic that depicts the life of Nelson Mandela’s longtime wife, has arrived online. The film stars Jennifer Hudson as Winnie and Terrence Howard as Nelson, the revered human rights activist and former South African president.

Set during the apartheid era, the movie chronicles the “untold love story” between Winnie and Nelson Mandela, as well as her struggle for their freedom.

In the clip, Hudson depicts a distraught but defiant Winnie, as she’s arrested and placed in solitary confinement under the apartheid regime. In May 12, 1969, Winnie was detained at her Soweto home and held in isolated confinement in Pretoria Central Prison, along with other freedom fighters for over a year. Nelson Mandela had already been in prison almost seven years by then.

The “Winnie Mandela“ film is set to hit theaters on Sept. 6, almost two months before another Mandela film, “Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom,” starring Idris Elba as Nelson and Naomie Harris as Winnie, debuts in U.S. theaters.
