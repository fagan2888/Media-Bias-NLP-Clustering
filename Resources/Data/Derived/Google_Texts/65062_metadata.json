He left disappointed, not necessarily in the music, which he couldn\u2019t hear amid the thunderous crowd noise, but in his fellow audience members. In a diary entry written a week later, he was still confounded by the behavior he\u2019d witnessed among the masses:\n\n\u201cI was truly horrified and shocked by the audience. It was like a mass masturbation orgy\u2026.To realise that the majority of the modern adolescent world goes ritualistically mad over those four innocuous, rather silly-looking young men is a silly thought\u2026.Personally I should have liked to take some of those squealing young maniacs and cracked their heads together. I am all for audiences going mad with enthusiasm after a performance, but not incessantly during the performance so that there ceases to be a performance.\u201d\n\nWhat Coward harrumphed at was the phenomenon known as Beatlemania \u2014 that potent alchemy of adoration, hormones and fandom that whipped adolescents into a shrieking frenzy each time one of the Fab Four came within eyesight. Teenagers had swooned over Frank Sinatra\u2019s velvety vocals and Elvis Presley\u2019s swiveling hips, but the hysteria that hounded the Beatles was different \u2014 more fervent, almost atavistic, and even dangerous at times.\n\nBeatlemania arguably reached its crescendo during the band\u2019s blockbuster first appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in February 1964, when roughly 73 million Americans tuned in for their five-song repertoire. But to truly appreciate the scope and ardor of Beatlemania you have to turn to their first motion picture, \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night,\u201d which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month. Shot in seven weeks following the Beatles\u2019 triumphant tour of the United States, \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d is not so much about the Beatles, who play caricaturized versions of themselves (John Lennon remarked that the film is a \u201ccomic-strip version of what was going on\u201d with the band), but about Beatlemania itself: the ways it shaped, constricted and occasionally imperiled their day-to-day existence. And it\u2019s this filmic representation of unbridled fandom that continues to exert enormous influence on how emerging pop stars measure and depict their success.\n\n\u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d was not intended to be a great film. Shortly after the term \u201cBeatlemania\u201d was coined by the Daily Mirror in late 1963, United Artists approached the Beatles about making an inexpensive feature film to showcase their new songs. By that time, so-called jukebox musicals already had gained a deservedly poor reputation, exemplified by Elvis Presley\u2019s cringe-worthy acting forays. The Beatles were wary of the hackneyed plotlines that these musicals trafficked in. Richard Lester and Alun Owen, the director and screenwriter of \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night,\u201d came up with a fitting solution: They disregarded plot almost entirely in favor of a pseudo-documentary style that drew out the Beatles\u2019 distinct personalities and witty interactions.\n\nDuring his first meeting with the group, Richard Lester asked John Lennon if he liked Sweden, where the Beatles had just played a string of concerts. \u201cYes, very much,\u201d Lennon replied. \u201cIt was a room and a car and a car and a room and a concert and we had cheese sandwiches sent up to our hotel room.\u201d This answer greatly informed Lester\u2019s representation of the Beatles. The subtext of \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d is that the Beatles have become entrapped by their success, confined to a series of interchangeable interior spaces broken up only by live performances, mad dashes into chauffeured vehicles, and inane interviews with the befuddled press corps. It\u2019s a glimpse of Beatlemania from the inside \u2014 more tedious than exhilarating. The film exposed a central irony of the Beatles: They were always on the move, but their movements were increasingly restricted. They traveled from one exotic locale to another, but each new place looked just like the last.\n\nLester didn\u2019t need to worry about re-creating Beatlemania on the big screen. The crowds came to him. The film opens with Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr fleeing from actual hordes of fans at a train station. Later, Lester covertly filmed the Beatles gawking from the backseat of a car at the shrieking fans who encircled them. Overall, the movie feels like it takes place in the unstable eye of a perpetually powerful storm. If the Beatles ventured too far from their sheltered spaces, they risked being engulfed by the very forces they helped create.\n\nLester\u2019s hand-held camera style reinforced the overall sense of claustrophobia. In the opening scenes in the train and hotel room, Lester often holds the camera tight to the Beatles\u2019 faces. In contrast, in the film\u2019s most iconic scene, the Beatles burst out the backdoor of the television studio where they\u2019re rehearsing and discover that the crowds are nowhere to be seen. \u201cWe\u2019re out!\u201d Ringo yells in relief. As they rush onto an empty field, Lester switches to a panoramic helicopter shot, underscoring their sudden freedom. The Beatles frolic through the field with childlike joy, almost as if they haven\u2019t been outdoors like this in months. They seem to be burning off all the energy pent up from their programmatic, fishbowl-like existence.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"A Hard Day's Night\" put the teen screams in Beatlemania.
