Santiago is one of an increasing number of San Francisco seniors who are facing rising rents and eviction.\n\nSantiago \u2014 a ballroom-dance instructor, and teacher for special needs children in the San Francisco Unified School District \u2014 is energetic yet frail. He walks with a cane and wears an array of colored cowboy hats.\n\nFor nearly four decades, Santiago has called his apartment on Duboce Avenue home. Today, each room is a time capsule. Drums and percussion instruments line the floors. Dance instruction books paint the shelves. In one room, a sleeping pad and tarp make up his bed, an image that calls back memories of Santiago\u2019s homeless days before getting his apartment.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of history here,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cI\u2019ve gone from a starving artist hustling for dance students, to having a real job.\u201d\n\nFor years, Santiago held many odd jobs around San Francisco, making just enough money to cover the monthly rent of $575.\n\n\u201cBeing in this space has allowed me to focus on my art without having to worry about survival,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cAs long as I have my apartment over my head, I can give more to the community.\u201d\n\nAround Thanksgiving of 2013, Benito arrived home to a notice on his door. He was being Ellis Act evicted. The Ellis Act is a state law that was designed to allow a property owner to leave the rental business, thereby vacating rental units. However, the Ellis Act is being abused. Groups of investors are buying property as landlords seek retirement or pass away, and they are evicting tenants by using the Ellis Act. Speculators buy property hoping to flip the apartments into an easy profit.\n\nSuddenly, the prospect of not having a roof over Santiago\u2019s head was all too real.\n\n\u201cThey wanted me out so they could turn the building into condominiums,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I had sleepless nights.\u201d\n\nSantiago was offered a $20,000 buyout and was told to be out in one month. He started giving away tables and chairs, slowly offloading what he could. Even with the $20,000 dollars, he would only be able to afford living in his apartment for five months.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out that the going rate for this apartment was $4,000 dollars a month, and not $575 like what I am paying,\u201d laughed Santiago. \u201cI mean how am I going to afford that?\u201d\n\nSantiago reconsidered the offer and along with other tenants in his building, began to fight the eviction. He filed appeals as a senior citizen on disability. He went on protests and fought for tenants\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to stand my ground and see if I can make a difference,\u201d said Santiago. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak up for myself and speak up for the seniors, the disabled, the educators, the students and the families who give to the community and then are being displaced.\u201d\n\nAs of July 1, Santiago continues that fight as he remains in his apartment. His Ellis Act Eviction appeals are pending, and the next chapter of his life with his apartment is unwritten.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Austin Meyer,benito santiago,ellis act,eviction,gentrification,San Francisco,video,Business & Money,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia,Real Estate", "description": "Benito Santiago, 63, is one of an increasing number of seniors facing rising rents and eviction under the Ellis Act \u2014 a state law that enables speculators to\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda261\"", "article_summary": "Santiago \u2014 a ballroom-dance instructor, and teacher for special needs children in the San Francisco Unified School District \u2014 is energetic yet frail.\nSantiago is one of an increasing number of San Francisco seniors who are facing rising rents and eviction.\nHis Ellis Act Eviction appeals are pending, and the next chapter of his life with his apartment is unwritten.\nSan Francisco resident Benito Santiago, 63, lived in his Mission District apartment for 37 years before getting his Ellis Act eviction notice in November of 2013.\nThe Ellis Act is a state law that was designed to allow a property owner to leave the rental business, thereby vacating rental units."}
