Gallinari will end this season missing the final 23 games of it.\n\n\u201cVery disappointing,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the way it is. We\u2019re not fighting for anything right now. As a player, it\u2019s one of the worst feelings ever because if you\u2019re not fighting for anything it\u2019s even tougher to find the motivation to play a game.\u201d\n\nGallinari\u2019s right ankle, injured at Dallas on Feb. 26, is healing well, he said. But he\u2019s not moving at full speed yet. He did some things at shootaround on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing good,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cMost of the stuff on the court I\u2019m not doing at a game speed. So, you know, shooting, sliding, running, any kind of motion, but not at game speed yet. That\u2019s the level I\u2019m at right now.\u201d\n\nGallinari had been having the best season of his career with averages of 19.5 points and 5.3 rebounds. He said the decision to shut it down for the rest of the season wasn\u2019t made in effort to preserve himself for his Italian national team obligations this summer at the Olympics in Rio.\n\n\u201cIt was not in my mind, to be honest,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cI\u2019m paid a lot of money right here in Denver to play basketball and do my job. That was my focus, to get back, even if I had to play the last two games, that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I can\u2019t do it, so right now the focus is to get healthy and get ready for the summer.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: @dempseypost or cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "description": "Though he continues to make good progress on a badly injured right ankle, Danilo Gallinari will not play another game for the Nuggets this season.", "title": "Danilo Gallinari says he will not play again this season", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2016/04/02/danilo-gallinari-says-wont-play-season/14137/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2016/04/GALLOLOOKS-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Though he continues to make good progress on a badly injured right ankle, Danilo Gallinari will not play another game for the Nuggets this season.", "title": "Danilo Gallinari says he will not play again this season", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2016/04/02/danilo-gallinari-says-wont-play-season/14137/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/files/2016/04/GALLOLOOKS-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Christopher Dempsey,Danilo Gallinari,Denver Nuggets"}, "article_summary": "Though he continues to make good progress on a badly injured right ankle, Danilo Gallinari said he will not play another game for the Nuggets this season.\nSo, you know, shooting, sliding, running, any kind of motion, but not at game speed yet.\nGallinari will end this season missing the final 23 games of it.\n\u201cI\u2019m paid a lot of money right here in Denver to play basketball and do my job.\nThat\u2019s the level I\u2019m at right now.\u201dGallinari had been having the best season of his career with averages of 19.5 points and 5.3 rebounds."}
