But Democrats took the opportunity to debate a more contentious topic with an amendment that would have expanded Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance to low-income Texans. That amendment, by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, failed with a vote split along party lines, 20-11.\n\nThe debate over how to consolidate the health and human services agencies will now go to the House.\n\nSB 200 comes amid controversy at the Health and Human Services Commission over how the agency awarded a $20 million contract to a private company outside of the competitive bidding process.\n\nThe bill has gone through several rounds of changes since it was filed this year \u2014 a chain of events started last year when the Sunset Advisory Commission recommended that all five agencies be consolidated in the hopes of making them more efficient.\n\nBut as the scandal developed at the health commission, lawmakers slowed down their approach to the ambitious recommendations amid enhanced scrutiny of the executive management of the Health and Human Services Commission.\n\nSenators on the Health and Human Services Committee voted to pump the brakes on consolidation after two reports published in recent weeks \u2014 one commissioned by Gov. Greg Abbott, and the other by the state auditor\u2019s office \u2014 found the Health and Human Service Commission\u2019s management had made serious missteps in its handling of a private contract for fraud detection software.\n\n\u201cIt is now more clear than ever that the Texas Health and Human Services Commission has been riddled with operational, managerial, structural and procedural problems that go far beyond any individual or contract,\u201d Abbott said in a statement at the time. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThe five agencies within the HHSC system have about 54,000 employees and a budget of about $34.5 billion, according to the Sunset Advisory Commission.\n\nBefore the Senate voted, state Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, questioned how much money the agency consolidation would save, particularly from laying off state employees.\n\n\u201cOf course taxpayers are liable not only for the salaries for the tens of thousands of employees, but also for their benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reduction?\u201d\n\nNelson said she could not supply an exact figure. The original Sunset report for five-agency consolidated predicted 32 full-time employees would lose their jobs.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
