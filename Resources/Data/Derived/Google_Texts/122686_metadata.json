But I virtually lose it when my bill is more than it should be.\n\nA survey last month by Consumers Union found that nearly one in four Californians with private insurance faces surprise medical bills, in which the insurer paid less than expected.\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to give you some very simple advice to deploy if \u2014 and when \u2014 you receive a surprise bill:\n\nFight it.\n\nThis advice applies to people with private insurance \u2014 purchased either on or off the Covered California marketplace \u2014 or employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nIt also applies to a broad range of surprises, whether you think you were charged too much for a procedure, wrongly penalized for going out of network or otherwise incorrectly billed.\n\n\u201cAt least 50 percent of the time, you will prevail,\u201d says Wendell Potter, a former health insurance company executive and author of \u201cDeadly Spin,\u201d an expos\u00e9 about the health insurance industry\u2019s practices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very much worth it\u201d to fight, he says.\n\nQ: My insurance company billed me for going to an out-of-network doctor, but the same insurer told me beforehand that the doctor is in-network. What should I do?\n\nA: It\u2019s time to make some calls.\n\nMany of you don\u2019t realize you have appeal rights. Or you give up before trying.\n\nIn the Consumers Union survey, 40 percent of those who received surprise bills didn\u2019t take action.\n\nMore than half of those said it was because they \u201cdidn\u2019t think it would make a difference,\u201d and 18 percent said they didn\u2019t know how to complain.\n\n\u201cPeople often are intimidated by the process of trying to get their insurance company to approve something that\u2019s been denied,\u201d Potter says.\n\nInsurance companies know it and bank on it, he says.\n\n\u201cThey know that people are not very savvy when it comes to dealing with insurance companies,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get savvy.\n\nStart with your insurer. The Explanation of Benefits will have instructions explaining how to contest the bill, or just call the customer service number on your health insurance card.\n\nInsurance companies devote entire departments to consumer appeals and urge you to take action if there\u2019s something amiss with your bill, says Nicole Kasabian Evans of the California Association of Health Plans.\n\n\u201cIf you have a concern, or something looks or feels funny, challenge it,\u201d she says.\n\nIf your appeal isn\u2019t resolved within 30 days or you\u2019re not satisfied with the outcome, go to your regulator, says Rodger Butler, spokesman with the state Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC).\n\nI wish I could tell you there\u2019s just one regulator for everyone, but in California, we have two state departments with authority over health plans: DMHC and the Department of Insurance.\n\n(To complicate matters, for some people with employer-sponsored insurance, the U.S. Department of Labor is the regulator.)\n\nTo simplify, start by calling DMHC\u2019s Help Center at 888-466-2219. DMHC regulates the vast majority of individual/family, small business and large-group health plans in the state.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know who to call, call us,\u201d Butler says.\n\nIf DMHC is your regulator, you can move forward with the appeal process by phone or file your complaint online (www.HealthHelp.ca.gov). If not, the Help Center can connect you to the correct regulator, Butler says.\n\nIf you\u2019ve gone through that process and you\u2019re still facing a bill, go to the doctor, hospital or other provider where you received the service and bargain, suggests Julie Silas, senior attorney at Consumers Union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth picking up the phone and seeing if you can negotiate a reduced bill or payment plan with your provider,\u201d she says.\n\nI realize that fighting your insurance company doesn\u2019t sound pleasant, especially if you\u2019re sick and in treatment.\n\nBut you have allies.\n\n\u201cWe can assist in the appeal process with the insurer so that consumers don\u2019t have to do it themselves,\u201d says Janice Rocco, deputy commissioner at the Department of Insurance.\n\nI won\u2019t deny that fighting an insurance bill requires time, effort and probably some frustration, even if you get help. But given the complexity of the health insurance world \u2014 and the dizzying pace of change \u2014 you need to be active and engaged in your coverage.\n\n\u201cThis is an example of the changing landscape of health care, where the consumer really needs to be their own advocate,\u201d Kasabian Evans says.\n\nPotter puts it another way: \u201cIt\u2019s important to be a squeaky wheel.\u201d\n\nHis tips:\n\nBe persistent. \u201cIf you make one call and don\u2019t make progress, call again and keep calling,\u201d he says.\n\nBe organized. Note the time and date of your calls with customer service representatives, and the name of the person you\u2019re talking to. If you mail documents, make a copy for your files first.\n\nMost insurance companies have executive teams that deal with \u201csqueaky wheels,\u201d Potter says. \u201cIf you send a letter to the CEO, there\u2019s a good chance that letter will be sent to the people who are dedicated to high-profile cases,\u201d he says.\n\nIf all else fails, he says, \u201cyou might hire an attorney.\u201d\n\nQuestions for Emily: AskEmily@usc.edu\n\nClick here to find previous Ask Emily columns.\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with news organizations to cover California health policy.
