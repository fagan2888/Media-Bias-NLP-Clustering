Using unauthorized internal documents, The Guardian newspaper this week had a piece on one of the most influential conservative organizations around:

An influential US lobbying network of Republican politicians and big businesses is seeking to avert a looming funding crisis by appealing to major donors that have abandoned it over the past two years following criticism of its policy on gun laws…. [T]he American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), which shapes and promotes legislation at the state level across the US, has identified more than 40 lapsed corporate members it wants to attract back into the fold under a scheme referred to in its documents as the "Prodigal Son Project". The target firms include commercial giants such as Amazon, Coca-Cola, General Electric, Kraft, McDonald's and Walmart, all of which cut ties with the group following the furor over the killing of the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida in February 2012.

ALEC serves as a clearinghouse for conservative legislation -- in the above case, it was stand-your-ground legislation that surface in a number of states, including Georgia.

But also sandwiched in the documents is a state-by-state assessment of ALEC membership – something we’ve never seen before. Ninety members of the Georgia General Assembly are also members of ALEC. That's more than any state in the South, and a higher proportion than any other Southern state except South Carolina.

If you assume that membership is a purely Republican thing, ALEC’s influence in the Legislature is even greater. The combined GOP caucuses number 154 out of a total 236 lawmakers. A quick look:

-- Georgia: 90 members, 38 percent;

-- South Carolina: 65 members, 38 percent;

-- Mississippi: 51 members, 29 percent;

-- Louisiana: 42 members, 29 percent;

-- Tennessee: 36 members, 29 percent;

-- Florida: 29 members, 18 percent;

ALEC membership is even stronger in Midwestern states. In South Dakota, all 105 lawmakers are counted as members of the organization.

Earlier this year, state Rep. Brian Thomas, D-Lilburn, resigned to take a job in Maine.

His replacement was sworn in on Thursday. State Rep. Dewey McClain is president of the Atlanta North Georgia Labor Council (AFL-CIO) – and a former linebacker for the Atlanta Falcons. McClain won the special election for his seat by acclamation. He faced no opposition, in either the Democratic primary or the special general election.

Many of those attending the House chamber ceremony were fellow (and mostly former) professional athletes. McClain identified his friends in the photo above as follows:

(Front row, left to right) Perry Kemp, former wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers; Moses White, former tight end for the San Diego Chargers; McClain; Dextor Clinkscales, safety for the Dallas Cowboys; Tim Broady, former defensive back for the Philadelphia Eagles; state Rep. “Coach” Williams, D-Avondale Estates; (back row, left to right) Edgar Fields, former defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons; Jim Washington, former forward for the Atlanta Hawks; and Bob Pickens, former offensive tackle for the Chicago Bears.

House Speaker David Ralston, R-Blue Ridge, who attended the brief affair, offered the rookie legislator some sobering advice: “Today is about as popular as you will ever be. Tomorrow, you will take a position. You will tell somebody no. You’re at a peak today, brother. Enjoy it.”

In Washington, House and Senate negotiators are nearing agreement on a modest budget deal that could avoid a January round of brinksmanship. From the New York Times:

The deal would increase revenue by raising some fees and would shift some cuts away from domestic and defense programs, partly alleviating the squeeze of across-the-board spending cuts imposed last year, which are set to worsen in 2014. Spending on defense and domestic programs would rise to about $1 trillion for the current fiscal year from $986 billion, the fiscal 2013 level that remains in effect under the continuing resolution passed in October.

Democrats will be required to carry much of the load. For Republicans seeking to move up a rung on the D.C. ladder, the deal would be untouchable. From the same NYT report:

Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia who is chairman of the labor and health appropriations subcommittee and is running for the Senate, captured the dilemma. “As a chairman, it will be helpful. As a candidate, I’m not so sure,” he said.

The Gallup organization says the awkward rollout of the Affordable Care Act website hasn’t hurt – or helped – when it comes to popular opinion:

After two months of glitches with the new federal healthcare website and attempts to fix it, the percentage of Americans who prefer that Congress scale back or entirely repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or "Obamacare," has changed little. Fifty-two percent favor scaling back (20%) or repealing (32%) the law, similar to the 50% from mid-October.

Nelson Mandela's death touched a nerve with politicians across Georgia, but not many could claim to have met him. State Sen. Jason Carter, who hangs a picture of the leader on his office wall, said his encounter with Mandela during his Peace Corps stint in South Africa was one of the highlights of his life.

The Democratic candidate for governor sent out a picture of the two shortly after Mandela's death, along with praise for the former president for helping instill a sense of community and humanity in a nation on the brink of civil war.

"He was a leader in every sense of the word, and the life he led was one of the greatest in history," said Carter. "One of the best moments of my life was meeting him."
