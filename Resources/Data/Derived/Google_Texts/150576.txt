SAVANNAH, Ga. - Police are still investigating the death of a politically connected Colombian man found in a Savannah hotel room.

Hotel staff members discovered the body of 43-year-old Andres Felipe Blackburn Cardona just before 2 p.m. Thursday.

Cardona had previously been reported missing in his home country, where he was a member of a prominent political family.

The Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department said no foul play is suspected.

Cardona is the son of Jose Blackburn, one of the founders of a political party that arose in the 1980s to fight the nation's drug cartels. The younger Blackburn's disappearance had been front-page news with his family originally speculating that he had been abducted after leaving his house in Bogota in a taxi.



An autopsy has been performed, though police did not release findings.
