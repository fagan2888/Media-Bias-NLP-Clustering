He heads the infectious diseases division at the University of Miami\u2019s Miller School of Medicine. He\u2019s done pioneering research on HIV.\n\nBut until last year he\u2019d barely registered Zika.\n\n\u201cFour months ago,\u201d Stevenson told me, \u201cI thought Zika was an Italian football player.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s since learned Zika is a mosquito-borne virus \u2013 one that\u2019s marauding so badly throughout Latin America and the Caribbean that the World Health Organization this week declared it a global health emergency.\n\nRELATED: A Good Way To Stop Zika From Harming Latin American Babies: Stop Teen Pregnancy\n\nAlong the way, UM has assumed a major role in helping to stem it, starting in Stevenson\u2019s lab at the school\u2019s Life Science Building in Overtown. Among its efforts, WLRN got a first look at a new test Stevenson and his team have created that will diagnose Zika more quickly and reliably.\n\nFor Stevenson, the urgency can feel personal as well as clinical.\n\nIf he and other scientists were unfamiliar with Zika before, it\u2019s because its symptoms are usually mild compared to similar but more serious tropical sicknesses like dengue. But one thing has made this Zika outbreak especially scary: It may be linked to microcephaly, a birth defect that results in abnormally small brains and heads. That tragic condition is suddenly being found in thousands of babies born to pregnant women infected with Zika.\n\nMost are in Brazil \u2013 and Stevenson\u2019s wife is from Northeast Brazil, where the epidemic has hit hardest.\n\n\u201cMy wife\u2019s cousin is expecting twins,\u201d he says, \u201cand she is terrified.\u201d\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been infected, but Stevenson is all too familiar with the anxiety.\n\n\u201cPeople are living in fear,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for them to protect themselves in areas where mosquitoes are just everywhere. These are very wet tropical climates. There\u2019s stagnant water everywhere.\u201d\n\nStevenson, a Scotland native, met his wife while doing work on the HIV virus in Brazil. UM and Brazilian scientists have combated HIV together for years, and that collaborative relationship makes it less surprising that UM has moved forward on a better Zika detection test \u2013 which Brazilian doctors sorely need. It should arrive in the coming days.\n\n\u201cThe test used [currently] to detect the virus unfortunately cannot distinguish dengue from Zika,\u201d Stevenson says as he and an associate examine a royal blue dye containing the molecular process.\n\n\u201cThis test does that. It amplifies the genetic information of the Zika.\u201d\n\nWhile Stevenson is working to expose the Zika virus, another UM researcher is laboring to expunge it.\n\nDown the hall is pathology professor David Watkins. He too works closely with Brazil on viruses like HIV and dengue. And now: a Zika vaccine.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that Brazil has seen this virus,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cSo nobody has any pre-existing immunity to it. And that probably is the reason that it is enjoying such explosive growth.\u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time Watkins has seen Zika. In fact, you could say he and Zika grew up on the same street. Watkins is the son of a Welsh tropical agronomist \u2013 and he was born in Uganda near the forest where the Zika virus was discovered some 70 years ago.\n\nWatkins has a number of battle plans on the board.\n\n\u201cFor example, we could take the envelope, the outer surface of Zika, and put it into the yellow fever vaccine,\u201d he says.\n\nRight now, Watkins is on at least half a dozen daily phone conferences with counterparts at Brazilian biomedical institutes like the Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo. It helps that he speaks Portuguese \u2013 which also reflects his own fondness for Brazil.\n\n\u201cI would say,\u201d Watkins admits, \u201cthat Brazil is my favorite country in the world\u201d \u2013 and you need only look inside his office, which is filled with stunning samba costumes from past Rio de Janeiro Carnaval parades.\n\nLOCAL TRANSMISSION\n\nOne of the Brazilians Watkins is brainstorming with is Dr. Esper Kallas, a vaccine expert at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. Kallas says UM is helping Brazil \u201cincrease our capacity to confront this crisis.\u201d But he notes the Brazilians are giving researchers like Watkins a better fix on how factors like global warming could lead to Zika infection in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe increase in temperature may set the stage for Aedes aegypti [the Zika-carrying mosquito] to spread northbound,\u201d says Kallas. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be much surprised if you find a local transmission of this virus within the year.\u201d\n\nBack in South Florida, many Brazilian expats like Vera Joffe, a S\u00e3o Paulo native and Coral Springs psychologist, say they\u2019re ready to help. Joffe specializes in child development disorders and is keenly concerned about Brazil\u2019s microcephaly outbreak.\n\n\u201cThe Brazilian community here could help distribute reliable information to areas most affected,\u201d says Joffe, \u201cspecifically to pregnant women and women who would like to get pregnant.\u201d\n\nJoffe also points to one of Brazil\u2019s best known assets:\n\n\u201cBrazilian people are very resilient and they have a very positive way to face crisis.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s something we may see this weekend \u2013 when Brazil\u2019s annual Carnaval celebration starts amid the Zika sorrow.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/miami-versus-zika-south-florida-scientists-battle-brazilian-epidemic", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201602/465396996.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Miami Versus Zika: South Florida Scientists Battle A Brazilian Epidemic"}, "story_id": 465279470, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Tim Padgett", "org_id": 482, "dc": {"title": "Miami Versus Zika: South Florida Scientists Battle A Brazilian Epidemic"}, "nid": 13512, "datePublished": "2016-02-04", "keywords": "zika, Zika virus, University of Miami, mosquito-borne disease, mosquito-borne illness, mosquito-borne virus", "wordCount": 1252, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Among its efforts, WLRN got a first look at a new test Stevenson and his team have created that will diagnose Zika more quickly and reliably.\nIt amplifies the genetic information of the Zika.\u201dWhile Stevenson is working to expose the Zika virus, another UM researcher is laboring to expunge it.\nUM and Brazilian scientists have combated HIV together for years, and that collaborative relationship makes it less surprising that UM has moved forward on a better Zika detection test \u2013 which Brazilian doctors sorely need.\nWatkins is the son of a Welsh tropical agronomist \u2013 and he was born in Uganda near the forest where the Zika virus was discovered some 70 years ago.\nThat tragic condition is suddenly being found in thousands of babies born to pregnant women infected with Zika."}
