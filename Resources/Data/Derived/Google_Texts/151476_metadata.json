Regarding the Watchman, Mahoney says, \u201cthis product will certainly be a key product in our portfolio,\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re really excited about the prospects of bringing this to market in the US.\u201d Mahoney also discusses the medical device tax, saying \u201cwe don\u2019t think an industry as valuable to the U.S. economy as medical device should have a medical device tax,\u201d and that it is \u201csomething we\u2019d like to see repealed as part of a broader package.\u201d\n\nBoston Scientific CEO on FDA approval of the Watchman device:\n\n\u201cThis is a really a first of its kind device that I am really excited about. The FDA wanted to be really careful with this device because it\u2019s a breakthrough device that helps patients who are indicated for atrial fibrillation to help reduce the impact of stroke. It also impacts the ability for patients to reduce the use of Warfarin for indicated patients. So the FDA was really smart in terms of ensuring that we have long term clinical safety benefits for the device, which we do. We have over 10,000 implants around the world and over 3,000 in the US, so it\u2019s a proven device, it helps patience and we\u2019re really excited about the prospects of bringing this to market in the U.S.\u201d\n\nOn the importance of the Watchman device for Boston Scientific growth:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important product line for us. We actually implanted our first product yesterday in the US. But the company has a lot of momentum. In 2014 we grew 6 percent, six out of our seven businesses grew faster than market. We\u2019re improving our operating income margin. And we delivered EPS growth of 15 percent. So this product will certainly be a key product in our portfolio and will really help us with our physicians, both interventional cardiologist and electrophysiologists meet their broader needs. So it\u2019s a perfect solution for us at Boston Scientific and it\u2019s really a breakthrough device for patients.\u201d\n\nImpact Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical devices has had on the business\n\nIt\u2019s been onerous for BSC, for Boston Scientific in the extent that we pay about $75 million a year for the tax. We believe the medical device industry is a terrific industry for the US, we\u2019re a net exporter, we drive innovation that impacts patient\u2019s lives, and we also create a lot of jobs. And we have seen an impact of the medical device tax reduce jobs, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the investment from the venture capital industry. So we don\u2019t think an industry as valuable to the U.S. economy as medical device should have a medical device tax. At Boston Scientific, we are paying the tax, but clearly it\u2019s something we\u2019d like to see repealed as part of a broader package.\u201d\n\nBoston Scientific CEO on upcoming deals they are working on:\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t comment on more deals, but we have been an active acquirer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney talks with FBN's Maria Bartiromo about the recent FDA approval of their new Watchman device.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.6.0", "og": {"site_name": "ValueWalk", "description": "Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney talks with FBN's Maria Bartiromo about the recent FDA approval of their new Watchman device.", "title": "Boston Scientific CEO: Repeal Medical Device Tax", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 750, "identifier": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/boston-scientific-logo.jpg", "height": 350}, "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/03/boston-scientific-bsx-ceo/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) CEO Mike Mahoney talks with FOX Business Network\u2019s (FBN) Maria Bartiromo about the recent FDA approval of their new Watchman device and the impact Obamacare\u2019s medical [...]", "title": "Boston Scientific CEO Would Like To See The Medical Device Tax \u201cRepealed\u201d", "url": "http://www.valuewalk.com/2015/03/boston-scientific-bsx-ceo/", "image": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/boston-scientific-logo.jpg", "creator": "@ valuewalk", "site": "@valuewalk", "card": "photo"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 294013504001864, "pages": 144640855575863}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-ValueWalk-site-icon-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/valuewalk", "section": "Stocks", "tag": "Watchman device", "published_time": "2015-03-25T10:59:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/valuewalk"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So we don\u2019t think an industry as valuable to the U.S. economy as medical device should have a medical device tax.\nBoston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) CEO Mike Mahoney talks with FOX Business Network\u2019s (FBN) Maria Bartiromo about the recent FDA approval of their new Watchman device and the impact Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax has had on the company.\nAnd we have seen an impact of the medical device tax reduce jobs, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in the investment from the venture capital industry.\nWe believe the medical device industry is a terrific industry for the US, we\u2019re a net exporter, we drive innovation that impacts patient\u2019s lives, and we also create a lot of jobs.\nSo it\u2019s a perfect solution for us at Boston Scientific and it\u2019s really a breakthrough device for patients.\u201dImpact Obamacare\u2019s tax on medical devices has had on the businessIt\u2019s been onerous for BSC, for Boston Scientific in the extent that we pay about $75 million a year for the tax."}
