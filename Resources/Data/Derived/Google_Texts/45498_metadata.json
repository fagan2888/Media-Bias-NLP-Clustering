Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Reps. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) and Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-N.M.) had an afternoon news conference to announce their efforts to provide more help for people to live independently as well as to educate and engage Congress on these issues.\n\n\u201cWe hope to bring attention to what caregivers are going through,\u201d Ayotte said. \u201cWe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nLujan Grisham, a former director of New Mexico\u2019s Agency on Aging and today a family caregiver for her mother, said, \u201cI ran for Congress because I wanted to be in a position with my colleagues to not just raise national awareness\u2026but to help family caregivers.\u201d\n\nA newly released AARP caregiving survey of registered voters age 40 and older found that people \u2014 regardless of political party \u2014 are looking to Congress for help in providing more access to services and resources that people need to continue living independently and that provide caregivers with respite care.\n\nCaregiving Resource Center \u2014Planning Resources, Assisted Living, End of Life Care and more \u00bb\n\n\u201cCaregiving issues affect people across the lifespan,\u201d said AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins. \u201cWhile anyone at any age can need the assistance of a family caregiver \u2014 and even young people can be called upon to provide care \u2014 people 50-plus represent the largest segment of those needing and almost half of those providing care.\u201d\n\nMore than 42 million family caregivers each year provide care for aging parents, spouses, friends and other loved ones. They supply services that range from helping with personal hygiene and meal preparation to managing finances and medication regimens \u2014 an equivalent of $450 billion annually in unpaid care.\n\nAARP Foundation Tax-Aide: Get free help preparing and filing your taxes \u00bb\n\nBlack, who worked 40 years as a nurse, said caregiving is \u201ca consuming job and responsibility.\u201d Lending credence to that at the news conference, family caregivers Tobey Partch-Davies of New Hampshire, Don Schierling of Colorado, Chris Courington of Tennessee and Marianita Gorman of New Mexico \u2014 all members of the AARP I Heart Caregivers online community \u2014 shared compelling stories about personal sacrifices and the challenges of balancing work, family and caring for loved ones.\n\n\u201cThey are the unsung \u2014 and unseen \u2014 heroes in our society,\u201d Bennet said.\n\nPhotos: T.J.
