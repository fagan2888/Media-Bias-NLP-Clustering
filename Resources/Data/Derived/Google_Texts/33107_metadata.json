E! News correspondent Ryan Seacrest does his best to change this every year. This time, he's questioning the arrival of blue tuxedos for men.\n\nOn the red carpet, Seacrest called Jason Sudeikis's decision to wear a blue tux \"irreverent.\" Olivia Wilde did wear black, so it was somewhat of a daring move.
