Given his background in finding vulnerabilities in software and websites, spotting security flaws , he couldn\u2019t help noticing a vulnerability that would allow someone to take over another person\u2019s account on the California site.\n\nHe tried contacting Covered California \u201cat least 15 times\u201d by email, phone or chat about the problem, but got no response for over a month.\n\nHermansen, frustrated that the flaw had been out there for over a month already, decided to release a video of the exploit to YouTube. That got the attention of a Covered California lawyer who contacted him to take the video down.\n\nHermansen then spoke by phone to the lawyer and a chief security person. \u201cThey were not interested in talking about the security issues but about getting the video or any other online mention of the flaw taken down.\u201d\n\nHermansen said he found more serious issues \u2014 such as an exposed admin interface and a potentially raidable database that might have made it easy to steal complete social security numbers en masse \u2014 but that he did not explore or expose them publicly to avoid running afoul of the law.\n\nHe was most dismayed though by how the site\u2019s administrators reacted to his finding flaws: first ignoring him, then trying to sweep his disclosure under the rug, rather than immediately addressing or fixing the problem that he had found.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hermansen said the FBI visited him and told him not to talk about this publicly anymore.\n\nMatt Ploessel, a security researcher who collaborated with Hermansen, reported the problems to the government\u2019s vulnerability clearinghouse US-CERT. He said he also got a call from the F.B.I. Wednesday. \u201cThey told me that creating a test account because we didn\u2019t want to touch real live data is fraudulent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "\u201cThey were not interested in talking about the security issues.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "description": "\u201cThey were not interested in talking about the security issues.\"", "title": "FBI Warned Security Expert Not to Talk About Gov Health Website's Dangers", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/216611/fbi-warned-security-expert-not-talk-about-gov-daniel-greenfield", "updated_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:04-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/216611/fbi-warned-security-expert-not-talk-about-gov-daniel-greenfield", "description": "\u201cThey were not interested in talking about the security issues.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "FBI Warned Security Expert Not to Talk About Gov Health Website's Dangers"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-17T05:22:02-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-22T23:38:04-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a01\"", "article_summary": "L.A.-based security researcher Kristian Erik Hermansen was signing up for Obamacare via the Covered California site.\nMatt Ploessel, a security researcher who collaborated with Hermansen, reported the problems to the government\u2019s vulnerability clearinghouse US-CERT.\nThat got the attention of a Covered California lawyer who contacted him to take the video down.\nShoot the messenger is the standard bureaucratic response of the system to its own ineptitude all the way down from ObamaCare's HealthCare.gov to Covered California.\nHe tried contacting Covered California \u201cat least 15 times\u201d by email, phone or chat about the problem, but got no response for over a month."}
