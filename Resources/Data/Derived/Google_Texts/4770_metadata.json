Jeff Satur said the woman's St. Bernard also got caught up in the fight, but was not being aggressive with officers.\n\nAll the dogs were injured, and one might not survive.\n\nSatur said police responded to 21 Exner Place at 10:30 p..m. Saturday on a report of a woman, 55, being mauled by multiple dogs and screaming for help.\n\nFive officers found the woman being attacked by her dogs, and they began to pepper-spray the animals and hit them with batons, Satur said.\n\nSatur said officers were able to round up three of the dogs, but had to use a Taser to subdue the last one.\n\n\"The fourth dog was not as easy,\" Satur said. \"Eventually, it was clear that pepper spray was not convincing this dog to back down.\"\n\nAll of the dogs were taken to a veterinary clinic, but one might not survive because of injuries sustained in the dog fight, Satur said.\n\nHe said the woman was taken to Longmont United Hospital, but has since been released.\n\n\"The owner was very thankful at the hospital,\" Satur said. \"She very much appreciated the efforts put forth to save her, get her dogs safely into custody and get them the medical attention they needed.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohn Bear 303-684-5212, bearj@times-call.com or twitter.com/johnbearwithme", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29661663/woman-mauled-during-massive-dog-fight-longmont-saturday", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "sailthru.author": "By John Bear \n  Staff Writer", "description": "A woman suffered serious injuries to her hands  after being mauled trying to break up a fight between her three English bull terriers during what Longmont police are calling a \"massive dog fight\" on Saturday night.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29661663:view"}, "startDate": "2016-03-20T09:01:01-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29661663/woman-mauled-during-massive-dog-fight-longmont-saturday", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "type": "article", "description": "A woman suffered serious injuries to her hands  after being mauled trying to break up a fight between her three English bull terriers during what Longmont police are calling a \"massive dog fight\" on Saturday night.", "title": "Woman mauled during 'massive dog fight' in Longmont"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "A woman suffered serious injuries to her hands  after being mauled trying to break up a fight between her three English bull terriers during what Longmont police are calling a \"massive dog fight\" on Saturday night.", "title": "Woman mauled during 'massive dog fight' in Longmont", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_29661663/woman-mauled-during-massive-dog-fight-longmont-saturday", "image": "http://local.timescall.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/timescall.png", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-20T09:01:01-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Woman mauled during 'massive dog fight' in Longmont", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By John BearStaff", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "modificationDate": "2016-03-21T08:56:46-0600", "endDate": "2026-03-20T09:01:01-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "pubDate": "2016-03-20T09:10:13-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "article_summary": "Police use pepper spray, Taser to subdue dogs; 1 may not surviveA woman suffered serious injuries to her hands after being mauled trying to break up a fight between her three English bull terriers during what Longmont police are calling a \"massive dog fight\" on Saturday night.\nAll of the dogs were taken to a veterinary clinic, but one might not survive because of injuries sustained in the dog fight, Satur said.\n\"Eventually, it was clear that pepper spray was not convincing this dog to back down.\"\nHe said the woman was taken to Longmont United Hospital, but has since been released.\nJeff Satur said the woman's St. Bernard also got caught up in the fight, but was not being aggressive with officers."}
