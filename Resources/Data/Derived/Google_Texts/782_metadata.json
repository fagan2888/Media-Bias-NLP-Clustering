While there is no law against it, Republican policy makers say that it\u2019s time to reexamine the programs in light of an explosion in the number of Americans collecting both unemployment compensation and disability insurance.\n\nRelated: 117,000 Americans Get Jobless and Disability Benefits\n\nThe idea has been trotted out before, as part of the ongoing debate over helping the long-term unemployed, and President Obama included a version of a plan to discourage double-dipping in his fiscal 2014 budget.\n\nSome critics warn that implementation and enforcement of the proposed new policy by the Social Security, which handles disability and state governments responsible for distributing unemployment insurance, could be complicated and difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a simple administrative matter,\u201d said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and an expert on federal government spending. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a major administrative cost coming at a time when the Social Security Administration is already straining to administer its programs with shrinking appropriations.\u201d\n\nHouse and Senate leaders have abandoned hope of passing comprehensive legislation this summer that would extend highway and transit spending for the next six years roughly along the lines of current spending levels.\n\nInstead, there is widespread agreement that Congress must pass a short-term, six month extension of spending authority to prevent the Highway Trust fund from going bankrupt in late July or early August, as the Department of Transportation has projected.\n\nRelated: Why You\u2019ll Need a Tank to Drive America\u2019s Highways\n\nThe highway trust fund has operated on an 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax that hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993. Currently, the tax generates about $39 billion a year, but the trust fund faces annual shortfalls of roughly $20 billion as owners of more fuel-efficient vehicles pay less into the fund while construction costs rise.\n\nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said this week that Congress is facing \u201ca mayday situation\u201d because \u201cwe are on the verge of a transportation government shutdown.\u201d\n\nAlready, 26 states have reported that \u201ccritical transportation projects\u201d will either be delayed or scrapped in anticipation that federal funds will be cut off, according to Boxer.\n\nRelated: 700,000 Jobs at Risk If Highway Trust Fund Falters\n\nIn all, about 700,000 highway construction-related jobs could be lost or jeopardized if the trust fund goes belly-up next month, according to the Transportation Department.\n\nTrying to raise the estimated $8 billion to $10 billion needed to replenish the near bankrupt federal fund and keeping federal dollars flowing to the states for highway, bridge and transit projects this summer will not be easy.\n\nThat became apparent on Thursday during a special meeting of the Senate Finance Committee to review proposals for salvaging the highway trust fund. The gathering highlighted the major fiscal fault-line between Democrats and Republicans over what should be the proper mix of fresh tax revenues and spending cuts to underwrite critical government policy.\n\nCommittee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) unveiled what he described as a \u201cbipartisan\u201d approach he ironed out the night before with several senior Republicans that would largely underwrite the cost with a host of tax maneuvers and gimmicks that would generate $7.59 billion over the coming decade.\n\nMuch of that money would be raised through a series of \u201ctax compliance and modernization provisions\u201d designed to squeeze extra revenue out of the tax code.\n\n\u201cI did everything I could to come up with the most benign [cost] offsets possible,\u201d Wyden told the committee members. That included beefing up mortgage reporting rules, modifying the required distribution rules for pension plans, and transferring $750 million from a fund for detecting and cleaning up leaks from underground petroleum storage tanks to the highway trust fund.\n\nRelated: Americans Face a Bumpy Road As Highway Bill Stalls\n\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota \u2013 a member of the Senate GOP leadership \u2013 laid down a tough marker of his own requiring that virtually all of the new highway and infrastructure spending be offset by reductions in other federal programs.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Chairman Wyden\u2019s interest in acting as quickly as possible to find the funding necessary to ensure the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund in the short-term,\u201d he said. \u201cBut moving forward, I believe the package that will be considered by this committee must include reasonable spending reforms.\u201d\n\nThune and other Republicans plan to push for an amendment that would strike out Wyden\u2019s tax revenue increases and replace them primarily with cutbacks in spending on disability and unemployment insurance. Thune\u2019s approach would also count on royalties from projected increases in U.S. energy production \u2013 an idea favored by Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the newly elected House Majority Leader, and other House Republicans.\n\nThune\u2019s main target would be the roughly 117,000 Americans who double-dipped by cashing unemployment and Social Security disability checks during the worst of the economic crisis. That practice cost taxpayers a combined $856 million in fiscal 2010 alone, according to a Government Accountability Office report issued in September 2012. According to one projection, the additional strain on the system will make the SSDI trust fund insolvent by 2016.\n\nRelated: Disability Benefit Program Is Going Broke\n\nDisability insurance was designed for people who are unable to work because of medical conditions, while unemployment insurance provides modest assistance for job seekers who were laid off. The average double-dipper collected $7,316 in fiscal 2010, according to the GAO. About 1,500 reaped more than $40,000 a year.\n\nThune\u2019s approach is modeled after a proposal drafted earlier this year by Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH). Under it, any month in which a person receives unemployment benefits would be deemed a month in which that person has engaged in \u201csubstantial gainful activity.\n\nThat designation would prevent that person from receiving UI and Social Security disability insurance simultaneously. It would also delay eligibility for disability insurance and Medicare for some people with serious disabilities \u201cand hasten the loss of benefits for others,\u201d according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nPortman\u2019s plan would save an estimated $5.4 billion over the coming decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, after factoring in administrative costs. A separate study of Portman\u2019s plan by Social Security actuaries pegs the ten-year savings at a much higher level -- $10.3 billion.\n\nBy contrast, the Obama administration approach \u2013 which is far less rigid -- would save only $1.2 billion over ten years, according to CBO, and $3.55 billion according to the actuaries. Obama\u2019s approach would eliminate double dipping by reducing disability benefits dollar-for-dollar by the amount that an individual receives in unemployment insurance.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The fate of a multi-billion dollar emergency package to avert a nationwide shutdown of highway and bridge projects this summer may hinge on the outcome of a political tug of war over how to pay for it, with Republicans pressing to slash spending \u2013 including funds for Social Security disability payments and unemployment insurance.", "title": "GOP Targets \u201cDouble Dippers\u201d to Pay for Highway Bill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/GOP-Targets-Double-Dippers-Pay-Highway-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03202012_highway_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/27/GOP-Targets-Double-Dippers-Pay-Highway-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03202012_highway_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The fate of a multi-billion dollar emergency package to avert a nationwide shutdown of highway and bridge projects this summer may hinge on the outcome of a political tug of war over how to pay for it, with Republicans pressing to slash spending \u2013 including funds for Social Security disability payments and unemployment insurance.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c64\"", "article_summary": "That became apparent on Thursday during a special meeting of the Senate Finance Committee to review proposals for salvaging the highway trust fund.\nRelated: 700,000 Jobs at Risk If Highway Trust Fund FaltersIn all, about 700,000 highway construction-related jobs could be lost or jeopardized if the trust fund goes belly-up next month, according to the Transportation Department.\n\u201cI appreciate Chairman Wyden\u2019s interest in acting as quickly as possible to find the funding necessary to ensure the solvency of the Highway Trust Fund in the short-term,\u201d he said.\nRelated: Why You\u2019ll Need a Tank to Drive America\u2019s HighwaysThe highway trust fund has operated on an 18.4-cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax that hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993.\nBy contrast, the Obama administration approach \u2013 which is far less rigid -- would save only $1.2 billion over ten years, according to CBO, and $3.55 billion according to the actuaries."}
