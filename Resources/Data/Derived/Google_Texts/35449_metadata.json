So I thought, you know there might be some medical reasons for taking another look at this.\u201d\n\nReid cited CNN and NPR reports about children suffering from seizures as well, to make the case that over the past several years, he\u2019d come to think that marijuana seemed a sensible and humane treatment for people suffering from particular conditions with no other treatment or cure.\n\nCurrently, Las Vegas, Henderson and Yerington have placed moratoriums on applications, permits and licensing for medical marijuana dispensaries while they figure out how to regulate the industry.\n\nCouncilmembers voting unanimously for the Las Vegas moratorium in September cited concerns that marijuana still was considered a Schedule 1 controlled substance.\n\nThe debates in Nevada municipalities are taking place against a dynamic national backdrop. At least 20 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have legalized some form of medical marijuana use, and at least six other states have legislation to do the same pending. In Nevada, voters approved Question 9 in 2000 to amend the state's constitution to recognize the medical use of marijuana. The law took effect Oct. 1, 2001.\n\nNevada\u2019s local moratoriums on medical marijuana are also coming at approximately the same time as another Western state, Colorado, experiments with the country\u2019s first legalization of marijuana for recreational use.\n\nReid stressed that his opinions only pertain to medical uses of marijuana, and he waved off a question about whether Nevada should follow Colorado\u2019s lead.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI just think that we need to look at the medical aspects of it.\u201d\n\nBut Reid did say that he thought the current legal system for prosecuting and sentencing marijuana users was extremely flawed.\n\n\u201cI guarantee you one thing,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe waste a lot of time and law enforcement going after these guys that are smoking marijuana.\u201d\n\nStaff writer Andrew Doughman contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "everal Nevada municipalities are issuing moratoriums on medical marijuana dispensaries, but Harry Reid really thinks they should be moving in the opposite direction \u2013 toward making medicinal pot legal. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me this question a dozen years ago, it would have been easy to answer \u2013 I would have said no, because (marijuana) leads to other stuff,\u201d the Senate majority leader told the Sun today. \u201cBut I can\u2019t say that anymore.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "LasVegasSun.com", "description": "everal Nevada municipalities are issuing moratoriums on medical marijuana dispensaries, but Harry Reid really thinks they should be moving in the opposite direction \u2013 toward making medicinal pot legal. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me this question a dozen years ago, it would have been easy to answer \u2013 I would have ...", "title": "Legalized medicinal pot has new supporter: Harry Reid", "url": "//lasvegassun.com/news/2014/jan/16/legalizing-medicinal-marijuana/", "image": "http://photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2013/12/03/20131203_SUN_HarryReid Visit_0027_t378.jpg?42670983c634e7c20626cc4856c543752c0d8b2f", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "//photos.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2013/12/03/20131203_SUN_HarryReid Visit_0027_r100x100.jpg?b3c07ccb2170322b6086abdb714037205a461b06", "creator": "@karoun", "account_id": 12055942, "card": "summary", "site": "@LasVegasSun"}, "fb": {"app_id": 112951308742607}, "vr": {"type": "text"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-16T13:17", "modified_time": "2014-01-16T14:25", "author": "//lasvegassun.com/staff/karoun/"}, "verify-v1": "ABQIAAAA8L3JFDSZBbRKiOI0oC2hURQtzf2N5nUcl5FoJ4HJzSUUnGQdoBRCXoBzqBg3VizzahR0b1gDldhrew", "y_key": "33c272341f5beade", "news_keywords": "News,Breaking News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbff8\"", "article_summary": "Legalized medicinal pot has new supporter: Harry ReidSeveral Nevada municipalities are issuing moratoriums on medical marijuana dispensaries, but Harry Reid really thinks they should be moving in the opposite direction \u2013 toward making medicinal pot legal.\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t say that anymore.\u201d\u201cI think we need to take a real close look at this,\u201d Reid went on.\nIn Nevada, voters approved Question 9 in 2000 to amend the state's constitution to recognize the medical use of marijuana.\nAt least 20 states, as well as the District of Columbia, have legalized some form of medical marijuana use, and at least six other states have legislation to do the same pending.\nNevada\u2019s local moratoriums on medical marijuana are also coming at approximately the same time as another Western state, Colorado, experiments with the country\u2019s first legalization of marijuana for recreational use."}
