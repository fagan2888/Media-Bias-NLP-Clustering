NEW YORK (MainStreet) — A major change to the 2014 Form 1040 resulting from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) – aka Obamacare – is the new refundable Premium Tax Credit.

The IRS describes the Premium Tax Credit is an “advanceable, refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families with low or moderate income afford health insurance.” To qualify for the credit your household income – Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and the MAGIs of all your dependents – must be between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line for your family size.

This credit is only available to individuals who purchased coverage through the Obamacare Health Insurance Marketplace. If you otherwise qualify for the credit based on household income, but purchased your health insurance directly from an insurance provider, you are out of luck – you are not eligible for the credit.

When applying for coverage through the Obamacare Marketplace, you estimated your household income for the year to see if you qualified for a credit. If you did, you had the option of receiving an “advance payment” of the credit to apply against your monthly premiums, reducing your monthly “out of pocket.”

If you received advance payment of the credit during the year, when you file your 2014 tax return, you must reconcile the advance payments based on your estimated household income to the credit amount to which you are entitled based on your actual 2014 household income.

You calculate the Premium Tax Credit on new IRS Form 8962. If the advance payments received are more than the actual credit you are entitled to, you must pay back the excess on Line 46 of the 2014 Form 1040 or Line 29 of Form 1040A. If the credit determined on Form 8962 is more than the advance payments received during the year, you can claim the additional amount on Line 69 of Form 1040 or Line 45 of Form 1040A. The additional credit amount is refundable.
