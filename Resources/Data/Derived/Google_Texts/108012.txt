Two officers at a Kansas prison were hospitalized Friday afternoon after they were battered by an inmate.

The incident happened around 4 p.m. at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility's central unit. The Kansas Department of Corrections did not provide specifics of the incident but said the two officers were treated at a local hospital and released.

The inmate was placed in administrative segregation pending the outcome of the investigation. His name was not released, and it's not yet known if he'll face charges.
