We sat down with Sollett to talk about the process behind the film, Ellen Page\u2019s historic coming out speech, and the future of gay marriage in this country.\n\nThe following interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nWhat drew you to this story?\n\nWhat drew me in was Ron\u2019s amazing script. I found it to be one of the most moving love stories I\u2019d ever read. And Ellen Page was attached to it when I read it and I thought: This is going to be fantastic.\n\nWhen you signed on to make the film, how much were you thinking about the current political landscape surrounding gay marriage?\n\nIt was very much in our minds in different ways at different times. While were making the movie it seemed that the Supreme Court was not going to be able to avoid this case, and we didn\u2019t know how they were going to take it or how they were going to roll. And we thought that either we were going to have a film that dramatized the reasons we needed marriage equality in the country, or we were going to have a film that reminded everybody how it was the activism of thousands of people over many years that turned the country toward marriage equality and reminded us why we need to defend it. In both ways, a movie worth making and a movie we would be proud of.\n\nIn making the film, did you have any hope or intent to change the opinions of viewers who may not have been on board with gay marriage?\n\nI didn\u2019t, and I didn\u2019t want us to be trying to persuade people. I think if our agenda was to persuade people to adopt a certain position on an issue then we ran the risk of making a film that was didactic and ultimately that people resisted. Our agenda was to make a beautiful love story. And we felt that if the audience invested in that love story then they would support the concept that [their] love is as equal as any other.\n\nJulianne Moore and Ellen Page had such a powerful onscreen dynamic. As a director, how did you help them foster this onscreen relationship?\n\nIt was fascinating. You\u2019re talking about two of the great screen actors of our time, and it\u2019s thrilling to watch, it\u2019s thrilling to witness greatness at work. We spent a lot of time together; we spent a lot of time with the real-life people. And the ladies spent time on their own, getting comfortable with one another. But they\u2019re good. They can figure it out.\n\nJulianne Moore\u2019s last TIFF film, \u201cStill Alice,\u201d where she also plays a character with an illness, won her the Oscar. Do you have awards on the brain at all?\n\nNot really. I didn\u2019t know about \u201cStill Alice\u201d \u2014 I knew she had made a film before our film but I didn\u2019t know the guys who made it \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what the story was while I was shooting. And I was like, oh, uh, hmm, interesting, in good ways and\u2026 we\u2019ll see. And we were cutting the movie and she was at the Oscars and we were texting and it was all very exciting, and then she won, and it was great for her and great for our film and hopefully more people will see it and enjoy it.\n\nHow important was it for you, and for Julianne and Ellen, to portray Stacie and Laurel accurately? Were the characters in the film very close to real life, or was there some artistic license there?\n\nThey\u2019re pretty close. I mean, obviously when you distill a whole life down into a few hours you emphasize certain aspects of peoples\u2019 characters so you can tell the story in a concise way. But both of those actors did extensive research with the real-life characters and their families and did the very best to render them in a way that was accurate.\n\nDid Stacie like the film?\n\nYeah, we showed her the film and she was really moved and happy and relieved, and I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing it together. I\u2019m looking forward to having a lengthy conversation with her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Julianne Moore and Ellen Page star in this TIFF standout about a landmark LGBT rights case", "title": "\u201cFreeheld\u201d director Peter Sollett on marriage equality and the ongoing fight for LGBT rights: \u201cI hope this film reminds us why it\u2019s important to protect this\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Julianne Moore and Ellen Page star in this TIFF standout about a landmark LGBT rights case", "title": "\u201cFreeheld\u201d director Peter Sollett on marriage equality and the ongoing fight for LGBT rights: \u201cI hope this film reminds us why it\u2019s important to protect this\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/12/freeheld_director_peter_sollett_on_marriage_equality_and_the_ongoing_fight_for_lgbt_rights_i_hope_this_film_reminds_us_why_its_important_to_protect_this/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/freeheld.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Julianne Moore and Ellen Page star in this TIFF standout about a landmark LGBT rights case", "title": "\u201cFreeheld\u201d director Peter Sollett on marriage equality and the ongoing fight for LGBT rights: \u201cI hope this film reminds us why it\u2019s important to protect this\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/freeheld.jpg", "creator": "@annaesilman", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Anna Silman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2015 Toronto Film Festival, anti-lgbt discrimination, Editor's Picks, ellen page, Freeheld, Julianne Moore, LGBT Rights, Marriage equality, Peter Sollett, TIFF", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e07\"", "article_summary": "When you signed on to make the film, how much were you thinking about the current political landscape surrounding gay marriage?\nWe sat down with Sollett to talk about the process behind the film, Ellen Page\u2019s historic coming out speech, and the future of gay marriage in this country.\nAnd Ellen Page was attached to it when I read it and I thought: This is going to be fantastic.\nJulianne Moore and Ellen Page had such a powerful onscreen dynamic.\nIn making the film, did you have any hope or intent to change the opinions of viewers who may not have been on board with gay marriage?"}
