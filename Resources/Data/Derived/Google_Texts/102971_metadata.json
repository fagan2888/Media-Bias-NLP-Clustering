Twelve percent said President Barack Obama's signature legislative accomplishment should be left alone, 35 percent said it should be repealed, and two percent said they weren't sure.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re trying to have a better society, we have to look out for all people, not just certain segments,\u201d said Sherry DuPree, 67, a retired professor from Gainesville, Florida, who participated in the poll. \u201cIt has brought people who were on the street into the doctor\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe number of Americans who want the law erased has remained fairly consistent over the past five years since Obama signed it. In July 2010, 37 percent said the law should be repealed. Two years later, 34 percent favored repealing the law.\n\nApproximately 16.4 million Americans have gained health insurance since Obamacare was enacted, the government says.\n\nViews of the law are sharply divided by party. Sixty-eight percent of self-identified Republicans said they supported repeal, as did 37 percent of independents and just 10 percent of Democrats.\n\nDell Stone, 83, says she \u201ccertainly hopes\u201d the law gets repealed. She blames limits on medical testing in the act for her need to take cholesterol medication for three months this year after her cardiologist wasn't willing to repeat a seemingly inaccurate but very high reading.\n\n\u201cThe doctors are very dissatisfied, and many of them are not able to give their patients the attention that they feel that they need because they can\u2019t have too many appointments, too many tests,\u201d said Stone, a retired elementary school principal from Alexander City, Alabama.\n\nThe poll was conducted April 6-8 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, among 1,008 U.S. adults. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
