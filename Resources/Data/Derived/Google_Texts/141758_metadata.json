Ted Cruz said Tuesday morning that he\u2019s giving his own presidential aspirations a close look in advance of 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something I\u2019m looking at very seriously, and I think we\u2019re at a time of enormous challenge,\u201d Cruz told FOX & Friends. \u201cWe are starting a national debate this year about the direction of the Republican party and about the direction of the country. I think the challenges facing us \u2014 they\u2019ve never been greater. The Obama economy, it\u2019s not working. Obamacare is a disaster. Our constitutional rights are under assault from Washington. And as we look abroad, it seems like the entire world is on fire right now.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s comments come a day after he delivered a well-received speech at the Heritage Foundation that explored both domestic and foreign policy issues. The Texas Republican pushed for a conservative agenda and cautioned against the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d politics of D.C. he has cautioned against frequently.\n\n\u201cFor all the Republicans saying \u2018let\u2019s get things done,\u2019 if we simply settle into business as usual in this town \u2026 we will demoralize the millions of men and women who came out in November,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nA bevy of other Republicans have publicly or reportedly talked about their 2016 prospects in recent days, with Sen. Marco Rubio (undecided) and Rep. Paul Ryan (out) commenting, and speculation rising that former Republican nominee Mitt Romney will launch a third consecutive bid. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was the first potential contender to make an obvious move toward running.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Without giving too much away, Sen.
