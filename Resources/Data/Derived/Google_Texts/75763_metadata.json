But those who are eligible have to consent to the expedited enrollment, and the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) will only send one letter notifying people of the opportunity \u2013 so advocates are busy making sure that families in CalFresh are on the lookout for the letters and know not to discard them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is a tremendous opportunity to enroll a lot of children and parents in a quick and easy way,\u201d says Kristen Golden Testa, the California Health Program director of The Children\u2019s Partnership, a national nonprofit.\n\n\n\nBecause California opted to expand its Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act, income eligibility requirements for CalFresh and Medi-Cal are now comparable, so anyone who qualifies for CalFresh is also likely to qualify for Medi-Cal. The federal government has given states the option of using their SNAP data to get both adults and children enrolled in Medicaid if they weren\u2019t already signed up.\n\n\n\nDHCS sent letters to over half a million non-elderly adults who are enrolled in CalFresh but not enrolled in Medi-Cal during the first week of February, and is expected to send letters regarding over 150,000 eligible children before the end of this month.\n\n\n\nElizabeth Landsberg, the director of legislative advocacy at the Western Center on Law and Poverty, agrees with Golden Testa, calling the new enrollment option \u201csmart government.\u201d She explains that many non-elderly adults are newly eligible for Medi-Cal because of Medicaid expansion, and though children in CalFresh were eligible for free health coverage even before Medicaid expansion, there are a variety of reasons why such a large number of kids who qualify for Medi-Cal weren\u2019t already enrolled.\n\n\n\n\u201cOftentimes hunger is the more immediate need \u2013 for example, if you have a family in which a parent was laid off,\u201d says Landsberg, explaining why a family might prioritize getting enrolled in CalFresh over looking into health care options.\n\n\n\nEach letter sent by DHCS includes a PIN number unique to each eligible family member. Individuals can consent to enrollment for themselves or their children in three different ways \u2013 by signing and returning the letter, by calling 1-844-212-0003 and giving their PIN, or by visiting the DHCS website and entering their PIN.\n\n\n\nSome families enrolled in CalFresh also may not be aware that they are already enrolled in Medi-Cal, says Golden Testa; such families would not receive an expedited enrollment letter, and should contact their county Medi-Cal office to find out if they are already in the program.\n\n\n\nIf your child is uninsured and enrolled in CalFresh, and you would like to see a copy of the letter you may be sent by DHCS, click here.
