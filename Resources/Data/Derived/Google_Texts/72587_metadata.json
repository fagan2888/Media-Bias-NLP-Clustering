They gave two of last year\u2019s best performances in \u201cConcussion,\u201d a sprightly, sneaky indie you can stream right here:\n\nA decade Chris Rock defended gay marriage, saying homosexuals \u201chave the right to be as miserable as everybody else.\u201d That\u2019s what\u2019s happened to \u201cConcussion\u201d\u2019s 40-something hero Abby (Weigert, \u201cDeadwood\u201d), who\u2019s in a stilted, sexless suburban gay marriage, with kids. An accidental baseball to the head becomes the catalyst that gets Abby to make a curious decision: By day she retires to the Manhattan apartment she\u2019s rehabbing and offers her services as a high-end prostitute.\n\nHomosexuality is treated casually (when Abby refers to \u201cmy wife,\u201d no one bats an eye), but that\u2019s part of the sly commentary; as a lesbian, she\u2019s still treated as a mysterious outsider, as when a bi-curious neighbor (Siff, \u201cSons of Anarchy\u201d) becomes a client. It\u2019s Luis Bunuel\u2019s surrealist \u201cBelle de Jour,\u201d in which wife Catherine Deneuve takes a job at the local brothel, in a realistic bent \u2014 but not too realistic. First-time director Stacie Passon establishes a quasi-comic tone that\u2019s at once assured and uneasy, while Weigert is thrillingly anxious, coming into her own only when tending to clients.\n\nRead our interview with star Robin Weigert right here.\n\nStream other movies on our site here.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2014-10-12", "description": "'Concussion' has two of 2013's best performances \u2014 stream it here", "author": "Matt Prigge", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "'Concussion' has two of 2013's best performances \u2014 stream it here", "title": "\"Concussion\" Has Two of 2013's Best Performances \u2014 Stream It Here", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/concussion-has-two-of-2013-s-best-performances-stream-it-here/tmWnaC---12iLgaDohAuis/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$jjnv253iarlgq9flq3to82tvqaszyks/ENT_DistrifyPiece_0130-614x306.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "'Concussion' has two of 2013's best performances \u2014 stream it here", "title": "\"Concussion\" Has Two of 2013's Best Performances \u2014 Stream It Here", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$jjnv253iarlgq9flq3to82tvqaszyks/ENT_DistrifyPiece_0130-614x306.jpeg"}, "creator": "Matt Prigge", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Movies,Region National,streaming movies,concussion, Distrify, Maggie Siff, movies, Robin Weigert, Stacie Passon, streaming movies", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/movies", "published_time": "2014-01-29T12:06:41Z", "modified_time": "2014-01-29T12:06:41Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Movies,Region National,streaming movies,concussion, Distrify, Maggie Siff, movies, Robin Weigert, Stacie Passon, streaming movies"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc5e\"", "article_summary": "Maggie Siff (right) and Robin Weigert play neighbors who get close in \"Concussion.\"\nRead our interview with star Robin Weigert right here.\nCredit: RADiUS-TWCThey haven\u2019t been nominated for any major awards, but that\u2019s voters\u2019 faults for not recognizing Robin Weigert and Maggie Siff.\nIt\u2019s Luis Bunuel\u2019s surrealist \u201cBelle de Jour,\u201d in which wife Catherine Deneuve takes a job at the local brothel, in a realistic bent \u2014 but not too realistic.\nStream other movies on our site here."}
