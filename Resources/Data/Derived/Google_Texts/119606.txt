Tea, SD

If you were near Tea today, you likely saw heavy black smoke pouring from a large grain bin this afternoon.

That's because area fire departments set the grain bin on fire intentionally. There was 125 firefighters from eight different counties from the southeast part of the state on hand to take part in a training exercise. The grain bin wasn't being used, and it was recently purchased by the city of Tea.

"It fulfills an exercise requirement for those of us from emergency management and also it's good training for all the people that are here. So if we ever have something like this happen at another time we know how to set it up and control it the best we can," Lincoln County Emergency Manager Harold Timmerman said.

Once the grain bin is gone, the city plans on using the land for its parks and recreation department.
