Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking (DISB) said Tuesday that it reviewed proposed rate increases from all of the insurers that offer plans through D.C. Health Link, the local marketplace created under the health-care law.\n\nThe insurers who offer individual plans on the marketplace initially asked for rate increases ranging from 6.5 percent to 14.5 percent, DISB said. But after the rate review process, they agreed to smaller increases \u2014 an average of 2 percent for CareFirst HMO plans, 4.6 percent for CareFirst PPO plans and 6.6 percent for Kaiser Permanente HMO plans.\n\nDISB also approved rate increases ranging from 0.2 percent to 11.2 percent for the eight categories of small-business insurance plans on the marketplace.\n\nPhilip Barlow, DISB associate commissioner for insurance, said after the insurers submit proposed rates, the city examines the information used to reach those prices and challenges any assumptions it believes are incorrect.\n\n\u201cWe work very hard to make sure that we don\u2019t have the kind of increases like they\u2019re having to do in Maryland, because we find those particularly difficult for consumers,\u201d Barlow said.\n\nResidents can enroll in the plans from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31.\n\nThe upcoming year will be the third year of operation for the state health exchanges created under the law. Health policy experts are paying close attention to rates in 2016, because it is the first year that insurers are setting their rates based on a full year of data from real patients\u2019 use of the coverage they obtain via the exchanges.\n\nIn Maryland, insurers found that those patients cost more than they budgeted for when they set their earlier prices.\n\n\u201cPeople who are in that pool in Maryland are, in fact, older and sicker than we expected them to be,\u201d said a spokesman for CareFirst, which covers the largest number of Marylanders who obtain insurance through the exchange rather than a job.\n\nWith next year\u2019s rate increases in the District, a CareFirst PPO plan for a typical 40-year-old will cost on average $253 a month for a \u201cbronze\u201d level plan, according to the DISB announcement Tuesday.\n\nThat 40-year-old\u2019s insurance would cost $420 monthly for a \u201cgold\u201d plan or $512 for a \u201cplatinum\u201d plan.\n\nRates are lower \u2014 an average of $168 for \u201cbronze\u201d to $449 for \u201cplatinum\u201d \u2014 for a CareFirst HMO plan. For a Kaiser HMO, the average 40-year-old\u2019s plan will cost $207 to $371.\n\nMany low-income customers who purchase insurance through the marketplace receive subsidies to cover some of the cost.\n\nAmy Goldstein contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rate increases will be much more affordable than in Maryland, where the most popular plan goes up 26%.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/julie.zauzmer", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The rate increases will be much more affordable than in Maryland, where the most popular plan goes up 26%.", "title": "Rates for health plans on D.C. marketplace to rise 4% on average", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/rates-for-health-plans-on-dc-marketplace-to-rise-4percent-on-average/2015/09/15/68a1b874-5be5-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JulieZauzmer"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "health, healthcare, health insurance, policy, insurance, plan, rate, increase, charge, price, exchange, marketplace, Affordable Care Act", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/julie.zauzmer"}, "eomportal-uuid": "68a1b874-5be5-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "health, healthcare, health insurance, policy, insurance, plan, rate, increase, charge, price, exchange, marketplace, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "DISB also approved rate increases ranging from 0.2 percent to 11.2 percent for the eight categories of small-business insurance plans on the marketplace.\nThe insurers who offer individual plans on the marketplace initially asked for rate increases ranging from 6.5 percent to 14.5 percent, DISB said.\nThe D.C.
