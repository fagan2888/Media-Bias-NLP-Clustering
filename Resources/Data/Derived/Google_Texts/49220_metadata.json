He parked his vehicle, donned his cape and mask and grabbed his banner \u2014 an inverted U.S. flag, signifying distress. .\n\nWhen police later stopped him and told him to remove the mask, Harrell said he politely refused, asserting his First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly.\n\nThe arresting officer and her supervisor assumed Harrell was part of demonstration, but \u201cin actual reality,\u201d he told Red Pill Philosophy. \u201cI was alone at the time. I was a soldier of one.\u201d\n\nHarrell said he only identified himself as a police officer \u201cafter the fact, because I didn\u2019t want to get any preferential treatment.\u201d\n\nThe simple response would have been to remove the mask. Had Harrell done so, the officer would have moved on and that would have been the end of it.\n\nBut Harrell isn\u2019t a simple man.\n\nHis Facebook page describes him as a \u201cFront Line Oath Keeper 1992 to present.\u201d Oath Keepers are current and former U.S. military and law enforcement personnel who advocate disobeying orders that violate the U.S. Constitution.\n\nFlorida Statutes 876.155, under which Harrell was arrested. had been revised since it was originally drafted, he said. It was signed into law \u201csometime in the 1950s because of the Ku Klux Klan trying to intimidate a certain group of people \u2014 a certain race of people,\u201d Harrell said.\n\nHere is the statute.\n\nIn short, he\u2019s not a criminal and is not looking to overthrow the government of the United States. Quite the opposite, he\u2019s just living up to the oath he took as a Marine and as a police officer, to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d\n\nHis oath isn\u2019t just a collection of empty words \u2014 his service appears to be exemplary. The Sentinel reported:\n\nAccording to the North Miami Beach city website, Harrell was named Officer of the Month in August 2007 for stopping a burglary to a business, which began after he noticed a turned over trash can on the corner of a strip store. He investigated further and found a broken front window of a nearby business and found his suspect hiding in a trash bin. He was praised at the time for his \u201ckeen sense of observation and immediate actions.\u201d\n\nHarrell told Red Pill he wouldn\u2019t have done anything differently.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a greater issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a daughter \u2014 I have children. I don\u2019t have the luxury of not being involved.\u201d\n\nOf his oath, he said, \u201cWe are the front-line defenders to the Constitution. Our job is greater than just arresting people for petty crimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a war coming, and we\u2019re in the midst of it,\u201d Harrell added. \u201cI no longer can be afraid.\u201d\n\nUntil the charges against him are resolved, Harrell has been placed on administrative leave, the Sentinel reported.\n\nCheck out A cappella group\u2019s amazing version of \u2018Little Drummer Boy\u2019 goes insanely viral.\n\n[poll id=\u201d144\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A veteran South Florida police officer and former Marine arrested late last month for refusing to remove his Guy Fawkes mask near an anti-Obamacare demonstration has now come forward to say what motivated him.
