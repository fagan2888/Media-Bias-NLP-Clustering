Marty Sacks and I did have that innate chemistry and I don't know why we just did,\" McCune said.\n\n\"In saying that I've never had any problem with my leading men\n\n\"I always get along well with any of the colleagues I've had to work with.\"\n\nMcCune did however admit that Tahu-Rhodes is perfect for the role of The King in the production which will go into rehearsals not long after the closing night of South Pacific which still has legs in Adelaide and Perth yet to run.\n\n\"For Teddy, he had to act in (South Pacific) and he loved it but there's probably more for him to do in the King and I which is great because he's actually a very funny guy so I think he will enjoy it very much.\"\n\nThe King and I is set to open in Brisbane next September and will travel to Melbourne and Sydney though Tahu Rhodes will be replaced for the Melbourne run due to a conflict of commitments.", "article_metadata": {"description": "IT is a relationship that neither Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes are yet to speak publicly about.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "IT is a relationship that neither Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes are yet to speak publicly about.", "title": "Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes set to team up for latest production of The King and I", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/lisa-mccune-and-teddy-tahu-rhodes-set-to-team-up-for-latest-production-of-the-king-and-i/story-fni0cwl5-1226738524573", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/10/11/1226738/524544-38bf6b2e-3216-11e3-9340-621b5c4994e7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2013/10/11/1226738/524488-ae76865a-316b-11e3-9a6a-b85a6f767d2b.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226738524573, "keywords": "stage show, people stars, musical theatre stars, publicity stunt, prominent musical theatre, South Pacific, music theatre guru, Sydney Opera House, pair getting intimate, Lisa McCune, box office records, Tim Disney, John Frost, Deborah Kerr, Teddy Tahu Rhodes, King and I, South pacific", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Fri Oct 11 18:11:51 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Fri Oct 11 18:11:51 EST 2013", "author": "AMY HARRIS"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb7f\"", "article_summary": "Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes set to team up for latest production of The King and IIT is a relationship that neither Lisa McCune and Teddy Tahu Rhodes are yet to speak publicly about.\nAnd Frost candidly admits he debated the idea of bringing McCune and Tahu Rhodes back for what could be viewed by some as a publicity stunt.\nThe King and I is set to open in Brisbane next September and will travel to Melbourne and Sydney though Tahu Rhodes will be replaced for the Melbourne run due to a conflict of commitments.\nNeither McCune nor Rhodes have ever addressed their personal relationship or the photos of the pair getting intimate which began to circulate in tabloids in around July last year.\nBut it seems two of Australia's most prominent musical theatre stars are happy to let their performances do it for them, with the pair set to return for the upcoming production of The King and I."}
