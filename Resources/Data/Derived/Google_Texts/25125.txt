WASHINGTON — The Department of Health and Human Services is partnering with an advocacy organization that is asking gay men to send selfies from the gym to promote Obamacare, the Washington Free Beacon reports.

The agency announced this week it was joining with several LGBT groups to encourage the community to enroll.

“As part of LGBT Week of Action from Dec. 7-11, Out2Enroll and other organizations will hold enrollment activities and provide in-person assistance across the country,” the department said. “Additionally, partners will leverage social media campaigns to ask their members and affiliates to sign up for an affordable health plan for 2016 through the Health Insurance Marketplace.”

One social media campaign started by the agency’s main partner, “Out2Enroll,” is #HealthySelfie.

“We’ve showed [sic] you ours, now you show us yours,” the group’s Facebook post reads, featuring mostly images of men at the gym, the Beacon reports.

Among the participants are model Colby Melvin; R.J. Aguiar, founder of Not Adam and Steve; and Jack Mackenroth, an HIV educator and former contestant on “Project Runway,” the Beacon reports.

Out2Enroll was created in 2013 and began partnering with the government to promote the law.
