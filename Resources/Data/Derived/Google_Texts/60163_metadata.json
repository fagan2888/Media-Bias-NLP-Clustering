State officials expect the program to eventually reach 520,000 participants.\n\n\n\nThe expansion was funded by money approved as part of the Affordable Care Act and originally designed to pay for an expansion of the traditional Medicaid program for low-income Americans.\n\n\n\nPence\u2019s decision to accept that money was controversial among his fellow conservatives.\n\n\n\n\u201cA close look at Pence\u2019s plan reveals what is perhaps the worst of all the Republican Medicaid expansion \u2018alternatives\u2019 to date,\u201d wrote John Davidson, director of the Center for Health Care Policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, in an article on the conservative website The Federalist.\n\n\n\nBut liberals questioned the Obama administration\u2019s decision to embrace HIP 2.0\u2019s use of health savings accounts and its requirements that participants contribute $1 to $25 per month to those accounts.\n\n\n\nIf they fail to make those payments, Hoosiers can be locked out of coverage for two months. If their incomes are below the federal poverty limit, Hoosiers cannot be denied coverage, but they can be switched from a plan with more generous benefits to one without dental or vision coverage, which does require co-pays.\n\n\n\nWith other states, such as Kentucky, looking to copy HIP 2.0, the Obama administration, in an unusual move, recently tapped the liberal-leaning think tank the Urban Institute to conduct a review of HIP 2.0. Pence asked for that contract to be canceled, saying the state has already hired a firm to conduct a review.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Pence administration expects the program\u2014which uses federal Medicaid money to pay for a state-designed health insurance system\u2014to eventually serve 520,000 participants.", "csrf-token": "taMm+DAfVUs2Iv7rERb6NdH6ALiOt3p4UflICvktPfA=", "twitter": {"description": "The Pence administration expects the program\u2014which uses federal Medicaid money to pay for a state-designed health insurance system\u2014to eventually serve 520,000 participants.", "card": "summary", "title": "2015 TOP STORIES: State' HIP 2.0 signs up 360,000 Hoosiers"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "The Pence administration expects the program\u2014which uses federal Medicaid money to pay for a state-designed health insurance system\u2014to eventually serve 520,000 participants.", "title": "2015 TOP STORIES: State' HIP 2.0 signs up 360,000 Hoosiers"}, "keywords": "health care,health insurance,Medicaid,Healthy Indiana Plan,Mike Pence,low-income,poor,HIP 2.0,2015 top stories", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "With other states, such as Kentucky, looking to copy HIP 2.0, the Obama administration, in an unusual move, recently tapped the liberal-leaning think tank the Urban Institute to conduct a review of HIP 2.0.\nStarting last February, HIP 2.0 ramped up enrollment, soaring from 60,000 customers to more than 360,000.\nAfter two years of negotiations and posturing, Gov, Mike Pence and President Barack Obama\u2019s administration came to terms on a deal to use Medicaid money to expand the Healthy Indiana Plan.\nPence asked for that contract to be canceled, saying the state has already hired a firm to conduct a review.\nIf they fail to make those payments, Hoosiers can be locked out of coverage for two months."}
