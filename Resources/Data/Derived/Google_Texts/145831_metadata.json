Angie Crouch reports for the NBC4 News at 6 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 12, 2015. (Published Monday, Jan. 12, 2015)\n\nKaiser Permanente mental health professionals represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers began a weeklong statewide strike Monday to protest what they say is Kaiser's \"chronic failure to provide... quality mental health care.\"\n\nPicketing took place around the state, the union said, including at the following Southern California locations:\n\nVideo More Than 30 Ill After Eating Three Kings Bread\n\nWest Los Angeles Medical Center, 6041 Cadillac Ave., West Los Angeles;\n\nAnaheim Medical Center, 3440 E. La Palma Ave., Anaheim;\n\nSan Diego Medical Center, 4647 Zion Ave., San Diego; and\n\nFontana Medical Center, 9961 Sierra Ave., Fontana.\n\n\"Kaiser Permanente's 2,600 California mental health clinicians -- psychologists, therapists, and social workers represented by the (NUHW) --will launch a statewide strike (today) to protest Kaiser's chronic failure to provide its members with timely, quality mental health care,\" the union said in a statement.\n\n2015 Southern California Images in the News\n\n\"Kaiser staff will be on 65 picket lines at more than 35 locations throughout the scheduled weeklong strike,\" the union said.\n\nPicketing began in the morning, the union said.\n\nThe union hasn\u2019t been able to reach an agreement with Kaiser since the union formed five years ago.\n\n\u201cIn some clinics you can get in initially, but once you get into the system ou cannot see your provider for four, five, six weeks,\u201d said Elizabeth White, a psychiatric social worker who was picketing in West LA.\n\nGail Evanguelidi is the mother of an adult son with schizophrenia. She volunteers to help other families negotiate the mental health system and agrees Kaiser needs more staff.\n\n\u201cI cannot explain the excruciating pain you feel when you see your son or daughter and you know how much they\u2019re hurting,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have to sit in the hospitals from two to maybe eight months, sometimes a year, waiting for a bed.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, state regulators fined Kaiser $4 million for failing to provide mental health treatment in a timely manner.\n\nBut a Kaiser spokesman says it has hired several hundred new staffers in the past year due to an increase in patients since the Affordable Care Act went into effect. Kaiser\u2019s management insists they\u2019re complying with state regulations and it\u2019s the strikers who are hurting patients by walking off the job.\n\n\u201cThe union has chosen to use a strategy for several years now to attack our organization, to try to damage our reputation, to make allegations that are misleading or gross exaggerations,\u201d said John Nelson, a Keiser vice-president of government relations.\n\nKaiser says some patients are being rescheduled during the strike. Those who need immediate care are being treated by other staff.\n\nA prominent Kaiser Permanente ad appeared in the Los Angeles Times Monday, warning that news about the strike may sound \"like Kaiser Permanente medical offices aren't open, or that we aren't ready to serve your health care needs.\n\nCopyright City News Service", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 2,000 Kaiser employees begin a week-long strike to bring patients &quot;timely, quality mental health care&quot;.", "title": "Kaiser Permanente Mental Health Clinicians Strike for Quality Health Care", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "More than 2,000 Kaiser employees begin a week-long strike to bring patients \"timely, quality mental health care\".", "title": "Kaiser Permanente Workers Begin Strike", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Kaiser-Health-Care-Workers-Strike-288295651.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/1110-2014-Kaiser.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 2,000 Kaiser employees begin a week-long strike to bring patients \"timely, quality mental health care\".", "title": "Kaiser Permanente Workers Begin Strike", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Kaiser-Health-Care-Workers-Strike-288295651.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/1110-2014-Kaiser.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "taboola_lead": "video", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "Kaiser, Health Care, Therapists, Strike, Clinicians, Statewide Strike, Strike Locations", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Kaiser, Health Care, Therapists, Strike, Clinicians, Statewide Strike, Strike Locations"}, "article_summary": "Kaiser Permanente mental health workers began a weeklong statewide strike for quality health care.\n(Published Monday, Jan. 12, 2015)Kaiser Permanente mental health professionals represented by the National Union of Healthcare Workers began a weeklong statewide strike Monday to protest what they say is Kaiser's \"chronic failure to provide... quality mental health care.\"\nA prominent Kaiser Permanente ad appeared in the Los Angeles Times Monday, warning that news about the strike may sound \"like Kaiser Permanente medical offices aren't open, or that we aren't ready to serve your health care needs.\n\"Kaiser Permanente's 2,600 California mental health clinicians -- psychologists, therapists, and social workers represented by the (NUHW) --will launch a statewide strike (today) to protest Kaiser's chronic failure to provide its members with timely, quality mental health care,\" the union said in a statement.\nShe volunteers to help other families negotiate the mental health system and agrees Kaiser needs more staff."}
