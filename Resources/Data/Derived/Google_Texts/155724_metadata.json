Just because there is a whole mess of better-qualified individuals doesn\u2019t mean one cannot pursue a job they\u2019ve long wanted.\n\nI absolutely loved that he made his intentions known on Facebook. Since his last election win was 18 months before Facebook was launched, this shows sensitivity to the GOP\u2019s social media weakness, especially when compared to the Democrats.\n\nObviously, initial support for Bush will be unlikely to come from tea party-types or conservatives. But they\u2019ll jump on board after he wins the primary. I\u2019ll advise him that he should certainly acknowledge their importance, but refrain from keeping their influence from becoming significant. They\u2019ll show up to vote on Election Day, as they always do.\n\nGoing for the moderate voter with moderate positions will obviously be the theme of Bush 2016 campaign. The positions for which he is a well-known moderate \u2013 enthusiastic support of nationalized education curriculum via Common Core and amnesty for illegals \u2013 are fairly controversial, so I\u2019ll advise him to not put them at the tippy top of his speech-topics list.\n\nUnderstanding the current political appetite of the country and the major issues that are of significant import to Americans, these are the key items I\u2019ll suggest he repeatedly emphasize in an effort to get hired by his team:\n\nCall for an increase in the minimum wage. It\u2019s time to put the \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t care about workers\u201d narrative to rest. Look at the political success similar programs have had in Seattle, San Francisco, and elsewhere. In most cases, supporters of raising the minimum wage get elected (or even better yet, reelected!).\n\nCall for an effective fix of the Affordable Care Act. Polls show that people like getting coverage. They also show that reducing the price of healthcare is incredibly popular as well. The ACA is intended to do both, so just focus on those areas that need some adjustment. The GOP members calling for defunding or dismantling it altogether are on the extreme fringes of the country and you\u2019ll want to distance yourself from them.\n\nCall for a reasonable evaluation of federal spending priorities. Politicians that demand budget cuts get put into awful campaign ads. You don\u2019t want to be in an awful campaign ad. And every single voter can agree with on a \u201creasonable evaluation\u201d because that basically means they\u2019ll understand that the other guy\u2019s favorite program is the one that\u2019ll get whacked.\n\nCall for bi-partisan cooperation. It\u2019s time to end conflict and intra-party squabbling in Washington. We all want the same things and it\u2019s time for all of us to come together. Part of this will be to create a list of blue-ribbon panels that will focus on specific problems. Catchy names are good, think \u201cGang of 8\u201d or something, but the optics of a handful of leaders, actively working out the details for everyone else in America, are so perfect.\n\nCall for more women and minorities in government and in business. In today\u2019s America, the tally means more than the talent and it\u2019s time the GOP recognized that. \u2018Nuff said.\n\nAs I put my portfolio together to present to the Bush 2016 team, I\u2019d be interested in a critique of this list, so don\u2019t hesitate to let me know of any needed fine-tuning. There may also be a couple more things to add to the list, as well.
