It's a subsidiary of The Doctors Company, the nation's largest physician-owned medical malpractice insurer, which services upwards of 77,000 members and claims $4.3 billion in assets.\n\n\"Today's announcement with OSMA is another step in our journey to provide the support independent physicians need to succeed in value-based contracts,\" said Medical Advantage Group CEO Paul MacLellan in a statement. \"This partnership will also help us deliver a broad scope of value-based healthcare solutions to health systems, independent physician associations, physician hospital organizations, and accountable care organizations.\"\n\nThe focus of the Ohio State Medical Association, for its part, is more local in scope, representing just shy of 16,000 Ohio physicians, residents, fellows, medical students and practice managers.\n\nOSMA co-CEO Todd Baker said the partnership came about organically.\n\n\"It was sort of natural,\" said Baker. \"We had seen some of the work they had done in Michigan,\" and the relationship really took off when representatives of Medical Advantage Group attended an OSMA symposium earlier this year. \"We talked about what a partnership might entail.\"\n\nPart of what it will entail, according to Baker, is helping doctors and clinicians move to a value-based payment model that focuses more on the quality of healthcare, zeroing in on a capitated payment model.\n\nOSMA has entered into similar partnerships in the past, notably with athenahealth. But, \"this is the first that's focused on this particular area,\" Baker said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/physicians-group-partners-ohio-medical-association", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/ohio-state-healthcare-association-hfn-feature.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The partnership is expected to help deliver a broad scope of value-based healthcare solutions.", "title": "Physicians group partners with Ohio medical association, marches towards value-based pay"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/ohio-state-healthcare-association-hfn-feature.jpg"}, "description": "The partnership is expected to help deliver a broad scope of value-based healthcare solutions.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Physicians group partners with Ohio medical association, marches towards value-based pay"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Physician advocate Medical Advantage Group will partner with the Ohio State Medical Association in a marriage that both organizations expect to help physician members successfully transition to new payment models.&#13; Medical Advantage Group alone services more than 2,000 independent physicians.
