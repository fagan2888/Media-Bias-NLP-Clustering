The probe was to find out if Goolsbee gained unauthorized access to the tax returns of brothers Charles and David Koch, two wealthy libertarian philanthropists who own Koch Industries.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest addressed an inquiry about the case last week.\n\n\u201c[The Obama administration] has been very rigorous in following all of the rules and regulations that govern proper communications between treasury officials and White House officials and the Internal Revenue Service,\u201d Earnest reported.\n\nThis response did not sit well with Cause of Action Executive Director Dan Epstein, who argues that the mere existence of the records proves that unlawful activity took place.\n\n\u201cWe know for a fact that the IRS broke the law,\u201d Epstein communicated to Fox News.\n\nAt the end of November, TIFTA admitted for the first time that the records did exist, however, it refused to oblige requests made under the FOIA to conduct an investigation.\n\nBack in September, a federal judge\u2019s ruling indicated that TIGTA was prohibited from refusing to declare whether or not an investigation took place \u2014 one that the agency already admitted publically speaking about.\n\n\u201cThe fact that TIGTA has publicly announced that it has investigated unlawful disclosures of, or access to, that body of information protected by statute as \u2018return information\u2019 strongly suggests that the fact of an investigation is not, itself, \u2018return information,\u2019\u201d the judge declared.\n\nU.S. Treasury Department Special Agent Daniel K. Carney also indicated that things had already been set in motion.\n\n\u201cThe final report relative to the investigation of Austan Goolsbee\u2019s press conference remark is completed, has gone through all the approval processes,\u201d Carney emailed, according to the Washington Examiner.\n\nHere we go again \u2026\n\nIncidentally, Goolsbee has been involved in similar scandals before, such as the time he accused the Koch brothers of not paying income taxes during a background press briefing in 2010.\n\nThe Koch brothers, who have been verbal over the years in their criticism of the Obama administration, are considered by conservative lawmakers and advocates alike as being discriminatorily singled out as a political foe by the President, who is using his ties with the IRS to illegally access confidential IRS tax information.\n\nAfter six Republican senators sent an inquiry to TIGTA, the agency responded by proclaiming that Goolsbee\u2019s comments were under investigation. No investigative report was ever issued to the senators or the media.\n\nBacktracking, TIGTA followed up by refusing to confirm or deny whether the investigation responding to numerous FOIA requests from Koch Industries, Cause of Action and the Washington Free Beacon ever took place.\n\nNow, TIGTA is saying it is caught up in dealing with the ongoing investigation of the latest dimensions of the IRS scandal.\n\nNot this time\n\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice Associate Counsel for Government Affairs and Media Advocacy Matthew Clark says this latest scandal is just another piece of the puzzle being laid out uncovering an unethical administration.\n\n\u201cAs the whole process drags out, it further exemplifies the problems not only of rampant corruption in a runaway, politically charged IRS, but the inherent problem of allowing the Obama Administration to continue to investigate itself as evidence of wrongdoing piles up,\u201d Clark contends. \u201cIf [it is] true that the White House was seeking and obtained confidential taxpayer information from the IRS in stunning violation of federal law, it would further explode an already burgeoning IRS scandal.\u201d\n\nClark just wants the President to have to play by the same rules as everybody else without being shielded by whatever loophole he can gasp.\n\n\u201cThe IRS cannot be allowed to be the political enforcement wing of the Obama Administration,\u201d Clark concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration is reportedly caught in the midst of yet another scandal, this time for allegedly conspiring with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect confidential taxpayer data used by the White House to try and inflict damage against its political enemies.", "og": {"url": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/politics-govt/2014/12/13/obama-administration-a-conspirator-in-irs-scandal", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "height": 500}, "description": "The Obama administration is reportedly caught in the midst of yet another scandal, this time for allegedly conspiring with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect confidential taxpayer data used by the White House to try and inflict damage against its political enemies.", "title": "Obama administration a conspirator in IRS scandal?"}, "twitter": {"site": "@onenewsnowcom", "image": "http://www.onenewsnow.com/images/ogimage.jpg", "description": "The Obama administration is reportedly caught in the midst of yet another scandal, this time for allegedly conspiring with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect confidential taxpayer data used by the White House to try and inflict damage against its political enemies.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama administration a conspirator in IRS scandal?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1597751183824293}, "keywords": "American Center for Law and Justice Associate,attorney,Austan Goolsbee,Barack Obama,Cause,Cause of Action,Charles Koch,Counsel,Dan Epstein,Daniel K.
