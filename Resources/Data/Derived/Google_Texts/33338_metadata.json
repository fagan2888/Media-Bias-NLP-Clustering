There isn\u2019t much to it besides that.\n\nYet, I shudder at the paragraphs sure to flow about #TheDress today.\n\nSo, I made you a shield from all the thinkpieces, so you can be armed and dangerous.\n\n1.

Naw. But you 80% done with your thinkpiece? Cool.\n\n10. Of the myriad kinds of writers, only bloggers use the word \u2018think piece\u2019 regularly.\n\nRant over.*\n\nShare This Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\n* \u2014 Was this a think piece\u2026?", "article_metadata": {"description": "We don't need think pieces on the color of a dress.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"On #TheDress And The Reasons Why Writing Too Many Think Pieces Is Lazy And Uninteresting\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/uproxx.com\\/smokingsection\\/the-dress-think-pieces\\/\",\"image_url\":\"https:\\/\\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\\/2015\\/02\\/the-dress.jpg?quality=90&w=650\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"UP-858292\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-27T17:51:42Z\",\"author\":\"TSS Crew\",\"section\":\"SMOKINGSECTION\"}", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@UPROXX", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TSSCrew"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Culture for the Digital Generation", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\": \"story\"}", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109605093", "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "page_id": 116548701336, "app_id": 117400151618132}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16", "application-name": "UPROXX", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "keywords": "thedress, llamagate, think pieces,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX", "published_time": "2015-02-27T17:51:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-11T18:10:09+00:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "UPROXX", "description": "We don\u2019t need think pieces on the color of a dress.", "title": "On #TheDress And The Reasons Why Writing Too Many Think Pieces Is Lazy And Uninteresting", "url": "http://uproxx.com/smokingsection/the-dress-think-pieces/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/the-dress.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "height": 444}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "thedress, llamagate, think pieces,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda499\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s a Stan with a hit-piece loaded up about your think piece and he is waiting to pull that trigger.\nSomeone is already think-piecing your think piece when you, in your self-satisfied haze, thought it was over.\nOf the myriad kinds of writers, only bloggers use the word \u2018think piece\u2019 regularly.\n*Share This Facebook Twitter EMAIL* \u2014 Was this a think piece\u2026?\nIt taught me that most of the human experience can be summed up in a phrase: It is what it is."}
