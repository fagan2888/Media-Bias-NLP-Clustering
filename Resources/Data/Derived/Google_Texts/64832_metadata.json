Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio) at a rally for Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in 2008. (David Richard/AP)\n\nA former Republican congressman who says government doctors missed his pancreatic cancer is laying the groundwork to sue for medical malpractice.\n\nSteven C. LaTourette, who represented Ohioans on Capitol Hill for nine terms, said he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year \u2014 two years after a doctor at George Washington University Hospital discussed the need for testing with a doctor from the Office of Attending Physician (OAP), which handles legislators\u2019 health care. The GW physician had discovered a lesion in LaTourette\u2019s pancreas.\n\nYet: \u201cNo follow-up studies were ordered or performed by any OAP physician, and Mr. LaTourette was never informed of the MRI results or recommendation for follow-up,\u201d the former lawmaker claimed in court documents posted on the Cleveland.com Web site.\n\nThough they have yet to file suit, LaTourette and his wife, Jennifer LaTourette, asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to allow him to give his testimony now, calling his diagnosis \u201cgrave.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. LaTourette\u2019s diagnosis carries with it a grim prognosis statistically, and he is likely to succumb to rapid physical and cognitive deterioration,\u201d the petition read. \u201c\u2026 It is highly unlikely that Mr. LaTourette will be able and/or available to provide deposition testimony in any action to be filed in the future.\u201d\n\nLaTourette\u2019s attorney plans to videotape LaTourette\u2019s deposition \u2014 but hopes his client will survive long enough to see his planned lawsuit\u2019s outcome.\n\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll never need it,\u201d LaTourette\u2019s attorney, Patrick Regan, told Cleveland.com of the planned deposition. \u201cHopefully it will sit somewhere in cyberspace.\u201d\n\nLaTourette\u2019s lawsuit does not fit into popular conceptions of congressional health care. As the debate over the Affordable Care Act unfolded in 2009, legislators against Obamacare were often singled out for the quality health care they allegedly enjoyed.\n\n\u201cLawmakers also get special treatment at Washington\u2019s federal medical facilities and, for a few hundred dollars a month, access to their own pharmacy and doctors, nurses and medical technicians standing by in an office conveniently located between the House and Senate chambers,\u201d the Los Angeles Times wrote at the time. And in 2011, Roll Call called the OAP \u201ca model of efficiency, according to staffers and Members who have sought treatment there.\u201d\n\nYet the OAP has been sued before. In 1990, the widow of John East, a Republican senator from North Carolina, filed a lawsuit after East killed himself. She said a physician had failed to diagnose a thyroid problem that led to depression. (A court found that the OAP had not been negligent, according to Roll Call.)\n\nLaTourette\u2019s counsel was confident about the chances of success.\n\n\u201cGiven what happened here, this was a pretty clear case of negligence by the health care professionals who were treating Mr. LaTourette,\u201d Regan told Politico. \u201cI expect there should be a serious effort from [the government] to see if they can\u2019t resolve this case.\u201d\n\nIn his final years in office and after his retirement, LaTourette was known as a centrist Republican unafraid of challenging more conservative House Republicans, whom he called \u201cknuckledraggers.\u201d\n\n\u201cProgressives may say they bemoan the \u2018radicalism\u2019 of the tea party, and tea party advocates may claim to despise the \u2018tactics\u2019 of liberals, but the truth is that both sides have abdicated the most basic responsibilities of elected officials,\u201d he wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece after his retirement. \u201cBoth sides are complicit in creating an environment in which nothing can be accomplished.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former lawmaker asked a court to let him testify now, calling his diagnosis \"grave.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The former lawmaker asked a court to let him testify now, calling his diagnosis \"grave.\"", "title": "Former GOP congressman fighting cancer intends to sue government doctors for malpractice", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/28/former-republican-congressman-fighting-cancer-intends-to-sue-government-doctors-for-malpractice/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/05/GettyImages-120333540.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@justinwmmoyer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/28/former-republican-congressman-fighting-cancer-intends-to-sue-government-doctors-for-malpractice/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Steve LaTourette, malpractice, cancer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Steve LaTourette, malpractice, cancer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb41\"", "article_summary": "(David Richard/AP)A former Republican congressman who says government doctors missed his pancreatic cancer is laying the groundwork to sue for medical malpractice.\n\u201cHopefully it will sit somewhere in cyberspace.\u201dLaTourette\u2019s lawsuit does not fit into popular conceptions of congressional health care.\nAs the debate over the Affordable Care Act unfolded in 2009, legislators against Obamacare were often singled out for the quality health care they allegedly enjoyed.\n\u201cGiven what happened here, this was a pretty clear case of negligence by the health care professionals who were treating Mr. LaTourette,\u201d Regan told Politico.\nThen-Rep.
