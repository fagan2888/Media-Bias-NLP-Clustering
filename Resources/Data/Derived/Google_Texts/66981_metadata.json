(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post)\n\nBefore Metro\u2019s Silver Line opened over the summer, Jazmine Jenifer, 21, worked for her mother at Glamour Girls Hair Studio in Temple Hills, Md. Her job was \u201chelping out\u201d around the shop, she said, and her pay was \u201cwhatever my mother could give me.\u201d\n\nWhich she realized was no way to make a living.\n\nNow, with Metrorail extending into the relatively job-rich Tysons Corner area, Jenifer rides a bus from Fort Washington, where she lives, to the Green Line\u2019s Branch Avenue station in Suitland. From there, she travels eight subway stops to the L\u2019Enfant Plaza station in the core of Washington. Then she transfers to a Silver Line train, rides 14 stops to the Tysons Corner station, gets off and walks a short distance to her new workplace.\n\nIt\u2019s an hour-plus trek in each direction, more than $12 a day in fares.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d said Jenifer, who was hired last month as a $9.25-an-hour cashier at the Nordstrom cafe in the Tysons Corner Center mall.\n\nView Graphic A look at the busiest originating stations for each of the new Silver Line stops.\n\n\u201cAfter they started the Silver Line,\u201d she said, \u201cI was like, \u2018Okay, new opportunities.\u2019 Because [there are] a lot of people living where I live at, they aren\u2019t going to travel to Tysons for work. So I figured I\u2019d have a better opportunity getting a job out here.\u201d\n\nWith the Silver Line\u2019s first phase creating a rapid-transit link between the Tysons area and the District \u2014 and the line\u2019s second phase scheduled to connect Tysons to Dulles International Airport in 2018 \u2014 planners predict huge economic growth in coming years.\n\nThey envision dozens of new high-rise office buildings near the four Tysons Silver Line stations and an influx of corporate tenants offering thousands of well-paying jobs.\n\nIn the meantime, a surprisingly large number of long-distance commuters are using the Silver Line to get to Tysons, as well as to the Silver Line station at Wiehle Avenue in Reston, according to an analysis of Metro ridership data by Ben Ross, president of Action Committee for Transit, a public transportation advocacy group.\n\nAnd, like Jenifer, many of those riders travel to Tysons and Reston from areas where jobs are harder to find \u2014 from neighborhoods east of the Anacostia River in the District and from parts of Prince George\u2019s County inside the Capital Beltway, Ross\u2019s analysis found.\n\nLouis Lang, 44, a stock clerk at a store in Tysons Corner Center, has been commuting from Suitland since he landed a job in the mall last year. He boards a train near the southern end of the Green Line and follows the same route to Tysons that Jenifer takes.\n\nBefore Silver Line service began in July, Lang would transfer to an Orange Line train at L\u2019Enfant, then ride to the West Falls Church Metro station and catch a bus to Tysons. Like several other commuters from Southeast Washington and Prince George\u2019s who were interviewed recently, Lang said he wishes he could live in Tysons.\n\nBut he can\u2019t swing it on a stock clerk\u2019s wages.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d need a high-paying job that you can actually afford your bills with,\u201d said Lang, who lives alone in a $900-a-month Suitland apartment and has two daughters. Gesturing to the new skyscraper headquarters of a satellite communications company near the Tysons station, he said: \u201cIt would take you having a tech job or something. I mean, the average rent out here is $1,800, I think. There\u2019s no way you can do that.\u201d\n\nAs for Jenifer, she lives rent-free with her mother and stepfather. \u201cUntil I find a job closer to home,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep on riding the train.\u201d\n\nRoss, author of the book \u201cDead End: Suburban Sprawl and the Rebirth of American Urbanism,\u201d lives in Montgomery County and said he enjoys fiddling with numbers, especially numbers related to public transportation.\n\nWith computer help, Ross said, he studied reams of Metro ridership data covering five days and nights starting Monday, Sept. 8 \u2014 thousands upon thousands of numbers, including the passenger entry and exit figures at each of the rail system\u2019s 91 stations, recorded at 15-minute intervals, and the origins and destinations of every trip.\n\n\u201cJust to see what patterns I could find,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter \u201cmany, many hours\u201d of work, Ross said, he noticed that a sizable number of passengers getting off at the five new Silver Line stations that week had begun their trips in Southeast Washington and Prince George\u2019s. He narrowed his focus to the morning rush hours, defined by Metro as 5 to 9:30, and calculated daily averages.\n\nOf the average 2,987 Silver Line riders who exited at the McLean, Tysons Corner, Spring Hill, Greensboro and Wiehle Avenue stations each morning, 432 of them, or 14 percent, had started their rides at 20 stations in the Anacostia area and Prince George\u2019s, Ross discovered. Of the 432, he said, 126 got off at Tysons.\n\n\u201cThe most common motivation for Silver Line riders from the east side is surely economic necessity, as most board at stations that draw riders from less affluent neighborhoods nearby,\u201d Ross said on the Greater Greater Washington blog, where he posted a summary of the data. \u201cThese ridership figures are a reminder of how painful it is when low wages meet land use policies that separate jobs from affordable housing.\u201d\n\nFor instance, here was Dexter Clarke, 24, a cook at BJ\u2019s Restaurant and Brewhouse in Tysons who rents a small house on Ridge Road SE in the District: \u201cMan, look at this place,\u201d he said as he hurried past a new steel-and-glass luxury apartment tower next to the mall. He scoffed and shook his head, continuing on his way to work.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even want to look,\u201d he said.\n\nIf the Silver Line spawns a vast Tysons skyline of new office, hotel and residential buildings in the years ahead, as economic development officials anticipate, then the flow of service workers into the area will become a massive tide, said Michael Caplin, executive director of Tysons Partnership, an association of business leaders, homeowners, county officials and others who are monitoring the redevelopment.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be just millions and millions of square feet of space needing to be maintained,\u201d Caplin said. \u201cAnd traffic in the hotels in this area is driven by the business community rather than vacationers. So when business really kicks up, there\u2019s an increase in business travel and a need for more service staff at all the hotels.\u201d\n\nRoss acknowledged that not all of the current long-distance commuters necessarily work in lower-wage jobs. And not all are annoyed by their time-consuming rides.\n\n\u201cI get up at 6 and leave out of my house about 6:40,\u201d said Charmel Tate, 31, who lives near the Green Line\u2019s Naylor Road station in Temple Hills and works as a surgical counselor at See Clearly Vision, an ophthalmology practice in Tysons. \u201cI get on my train about 7, and it takes me about an hour to get out here. So I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s happy to be working. Her former employer, a vision-care center in downtown Washington, closed last year, and she spent six months looking for a job before finding one in Tysons in March. She said it\u2019s worth the long commute and $11 or so in daily fares.\n\nSmiling, she said, \u201cYou know, I\u2019ll just read, listen to my music.\u201d\n\nRoss\u2019s findings came as no surprise to Gerald L. Gordon, chief executive of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority. \u201cBecause historically, we have imported almost half our workforce,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the current figure is either 47 or 48 percent of the people who work in Fairfax County come from outside.\u201d\n\nFor years, as planners have mapped the hoped-for transformation of Tysons from suburban sprawl into a quasi-urban community of high-rises and walkable green spaces, they have wrestled with the question of how to provide affordable housing for the legions of service workers who would arrive with the growth, Gordon said.\n\n\u201cEven nurses and police officers and teachers can\u2019t afford to live close in,\u201d he said, adding that a solution to the problem of \u201cworkforce housing\u201d remains elusive.\n\n\u201cBut the fact is, they have always been able to get here, whether they\u2019re driving or they\u2019re taking the bus,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if they can get here on the Metro in 70 minutes, probably that\u2019s better than their drive time from east of the Anacostia.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s about how long it takes for Jackie Williams to commute from Temple Hills: a bus to the Naylor Road station, a Green Line train to L\u2019Enfant, a Silver Line train to Tysons and a short walk into Nordstrom, where she has worked for about a year in the store\u2019s call center, answering customer queries by phone.\n\nWilliams, 27, lives by herself in a $1,055-a-month apartment, \u201cand that\u2019s with all utilities included,\u201d she said. A comparable place in Tysons, without utilities included, \u201cwould be too expensive for me. . . . I\u2019ve looked into it. I would literally have to have a roommate, and I don\u2019t particularly care too much for roommates.\u201d\n\nSo she rides. And rides. And rides.\n\n\u201cSometimes, I don\u2019t even realize how far out I am on the Metro until I look up in a while, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, wow, I\u2019m almost there,\u2019 \u201d Williams said. \u201cSome people don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s all right with me. I mean, honestly, it gives me more time to sleep.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Silver Line, Metro, long-distance Metro commuters, Tysons corner, commuters from east of the Anacostia, Jazmine Jenifer, Ben ross, Louis Lang, Dexter Clarke, Michael Caplin, Tysons Partnership: Charmel Tate, Gerald L.
