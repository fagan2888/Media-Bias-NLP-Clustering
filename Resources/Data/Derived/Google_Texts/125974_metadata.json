I noted missed opportunities to make policy changes that would help to make the Pentagon budget sustainable in these times of fiscal restraint.\n\nLast week the House of Representatives passed its version of the Pentagon appropriations bill. Unlike the authorization bill, which sets policy, the appropriations bill is where the fiscal rubber meets the road. Once the president signs the appropriations bill (after Senate action and then a meeting to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions), checks can be cut by the U.S. Treasury and money begins to flow.

The committee also added close to $1 billion for 12 additional EA-18G \u201cGrowler\u201d aircraft for the Navy. While the Growler and other aircraft currently in our inventory can fulfill many of the F-35 missions at a fraction of the cost, the only way we can achieve those savings is by not buying the hugely expensive F-35.\n\nThe committee also prohibited the Pentagon from taking even the smallest step toward saving some of the money spent on the nuclear \u201ctriad\u201d (the three different ways the U.S. can deliver nuclear weapons) by saying the Air Force cannot conduct a study of the environmental impact of placing some missile silos into an \u201cinactive\u201d status.\n\nDuring consideration of this massive spending bill in the full House of Representatives, several lawmakers offered fiscally sound amendments.
