Millennials were content with their inexpensive catastrophic insurance (medical savings accounts), and have no need for regular prostate checks, mammograms, stress tests or colonoscopies. Why should they have to pay for them?\n\nGenerational parenting psychology\n\nSome of this is generational. The World War II generation doted over their children, because many of them had seen the Great Depression. They wanted better for their children, so they tried to give them everything. They created the literal \u201cLand of the Free, Home of the Brave\u201d and handed it to their Baby Boomers, who enjoyed it.\n\nThey ate and they drank. They didn\u2019t always pay their bills, and they didn\u2019t teach their children to do so, either. The Baby Boomers gave birth to the Gen Xers, who are having children now. The problem is human nature. The Baby Boomers and their Gen Xers sat on cruise control most of their lives, as the eager hogs of destruction in media and culture ate away everything their grandparents had worked so hard to give them \u2013 namely, freedom and courage.\n\nOrder Gina Loudon\u2019s book \u201cLadies and Gentlemen: Why the Survival of Our Republic Depends on the Revival of Honor\u201d \u2013 how atheism, liberalism and radical feminism have harmed the nation.\n\nGen Xers had what they needed growing up, but they had no idea how they got it. Gen X and their children, the Millennials, elected Barack Obama. This formula resulted in the great-grandchildren of the Greatest Generation getting stuck with the bill for their Baby Boomers, who are like the spoiled child with a trust who can\u2019t appreciate anything. They stood by distracted while Hollywood tore down men and glorified world peace and transvestites. Then Hollywood joined forces with the D.C. beltway and planned the final knife in the back of America \u2013 undermining the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.\n\nIt all sounded so good in the name of tolerance, but it doesn\u2019t do much when the country is faced with an enemy, and homes raised by single parents are lying in ruin at the feet of this once great nation. The saddest part of all might be that in one administration, this president and his cronies have taken the hard-earned \u201cLand of the Free and Home of the Brave\u201d and turned it into \u201cThe Land of the Enslaved Effeminates and the Home of the Cowards.\u201d\n\nThey don\u2019t recognize tyranny even when their government is handing down edicts to enslave them. They have no motivation or courage to stand up to what has happened because they are too distracted with \u201cBread and Circus.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s classic.\n\nThe Greatest Generation never thought its work would be so taken for granted. The Baby Boomers just wanted to jitterbug and smoke Marlboros. Their parents did so much for them that they knew how to do little for themselves, so they gave the \u201cwhatever\u201d attitude to their Gen X children, who had no clue how to raise God-fearing children who appreciate the Constitution that their grandparents fought and died to protect. Hell, they couldn\u2019t even have a conversation with them, let alone understand their passion for God and country. The road to this hell was paved with the Greatest Generation\u2019s best intentions to give their children and grandchildren everything.\n\nEnter Richard Simmons\n\nFirst they paraded the nightmare-provoking \u201cPajama Boy\u201d stalking us and telling us, \u201cGet covered!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me cover you\u201d \u2013 ugh, no thanks!\n\nNow they go to Richard Simmons? He appeals to Millennials how? An old man twerking to \u201cI Will Survive\u201d? Can you imagine other countries trying to understand what has happened in America?\n\nSince Covered California has $80 million to spend to get Millennials to sign up for Obamacare, every other commercial on TV and radio now is for Covered California. It\u2019s embarrassing. All of the Millennials I know are outraged that they are presumed to be idiots who will fall for anything.\n\nWe thought Obamacare had stooped as low as it could go, spending half-a-billion dollars of taxpayer money on one big failed website, but no! They have hit an all-time low! Homo-erotic twerking \u2013 this makes Miley Cyrus look like Mary Poppins!\n\nThey take the immediate gratification era, in which people love to eat chips while playing video games, then drink Red Bull to get through the night, and give them a six-hour infomercial led by a questionably stable Baby Boomer with a fro in red tights?\n\nOh, maybe Richard Simmons is the one they put in charge of building the website! Now it is all making sense!\n\nPoor taxpayers! Couldn\u2019t that $80 million have just gone to the Millennials to go ahead and solidly bribe them to enroll? It might have been a tidier investment.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that young people might be na\u00efve, but they feel it just as much when you kick them in the wallet. A rate of $5,200 a year for the silver plan to subsidize old guys like Richard Simmons is going to wake a sleeping giant. And the left might just get a very rude awakening!\n\nSometimes in life we look into a mirror, and, in a moment, we see what we have never seen and we are horrified with what we are and where we are going. This might be one of those moments.\n\nHow have we gone from John Wayne to Richard Simmons? How is it that even California Gov. Jerry Brown, born into the generation between the Greatest and the Boomers, when handed $80 million, thinks a six-hour long Richard Simmons dance off is the answer to appeal to Millennials? How is it that the Greatest Generation\u2019s own children don\u2019t mind their great-grandchildren footing the bill for their health care? How is it that when communist redistribution between classes has failed, this country has resorted to generational theft?\n\nMiracles still happen\n\nLike all young, idealistic generations, the Millennials are yet na\u00efve. But they will wake up when their tax returns don\u2019t come, when the IRS knocks on their door, and when the NSA uses their private data. It won\u2019t be long.\n\nIn some other Asian and Polynesian cultures, they believe that long passed relatives can inflict values on current, living generations. As the Greatest Generation signs off, could it be that they will laugh last?\n\nThey fought and died for the hope of the \u201cLand of the Free and the Home of the Brave.\u201d As the Millennials glance in the reflecting pond, and see Richard Simmons looking back at them in red tights and a fro, perhaps, just perhaps, their mind will come to consider the miracle of free markets and capitalism as every thriving nation in the history of mankind has come to know. Perhaps this is, in the oddest of odd ways, our magic moment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.wnd.com/2014/01/obamacare-resorts-to-homo-erotic-twerking/", "type": "article", "site_name": "WND", "description": "Where in the U.S. Constitution does it say President Obama can use our tax dollars ($80 million) for California to hire Richard Simmons to market Obamacare to con young people into funding his failed program?
