Ltd. /quotes/zigman/198337/delayed JP:4502 Takeda, in fact, received approval last week from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to sell Velcade for patients who have relapsed even after using the treatment for their first bout with myeloma.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, Amgen also announced a voluntary recall of what it said were nine lots of its anemia drug Aranesp after particles of what is believed to be cellulose and/or polyester were found in prefilled syringes of the treatment. Company officials said a total of 15,880 syringes were being recalled.\n\nAmgen said none of the lots were distributed in the U.S. but instead went to 14 nations in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nThe FDA has said that, depending on the quantity of particles, patients could experience inflammatory and allergic responses, and contamination of the syringes could be life threatening.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nWill Robin Williams\u2019s death focus more attention on mental health?\n\nInsurers look to hike Obamacare premiums by an average of 8%\n\nHealth-care companies do better than other S&P firms in second quarter", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-08-13T17:55:08-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Amgen Inc. gives its investors a double dose of bad news with disappointing test results and a recall on one of its products.", "title": "Amgen gives investors a double dose of bad news after the close", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/13/amgen-gives-investors-a-double-dose-of-bad-news-after-the-close/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CO515_AMGN_0_MG_20140728173721.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Amgen Inc.,biotechnology,drug test,health care,recall", "article.headline": "Amgen gives investors a double dose of bad news after the close", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Amgen Inc.,biotechnology,drug test,health care,recall", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Amgen Inc. gives its investors a double dose of bad news with disappointing test results and a recall on one of its products.", "article.published": "2014-08-13T17:55:08-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/13/amgen-gives-investors-a-double-dose-of-bad-news-after-the-close/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Amgen Inc. gives its investors a double dose of bad news with disappointing test results and a recall on one of its products.", "title": "Amgen gives investors a double dose of bad news after the close", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/13/amgen-gives-investors-a-double-dose-of-bad-news-after-the-close/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CO515_AMGN_0_MG_20140728173721.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2947", "article.updated": "2014-08-13T17:55:08-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd77\"", "article_summary": "Amgen Inc. shares appear to be headed for a fall when trading opens on Thursday after the biotechnology giant gave investors a double dose of bad news after the close Wednesday.\nAmgen said none of the lots were distributed in the U.S. but instead went to 14 nations in Europe and the Middle East.\nInsurers look to hike Obamacare premiums by an average of 8%Health-care companies do better than other S&P firms in second quarter\nFollow @russbrittmktwFollow @MWHealthBlogMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:Will Robin Williams\u2019s death focus more attention on mental health?\nBloombergThe company /quotes/zigman/19815/delayed /quotes/nls/amgn AMGN said it was unable to meet its primary goal in a test of the effectiveness of its blood-cancer drug Kyprolis when compared with current regimens involving two other drugs \u2014 dexamethasone or similar corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide."}
