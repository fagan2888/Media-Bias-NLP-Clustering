Steve Cohen called tea party congressional Republicans \u201cdomestic enemies\u201d against which he must defend the country, describing them as rabid, sophomoric and in ambitious pursuit of their policies.\n\n\u201cI obviously do not have an opportunity to go within the conference, the Republican \u2014 we call it a caucus, they call it a conference,\u201d Cohen said on Saturday\u2019s broadcast of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cUp with Steve Kornacki.\u201d \u201cBut I know some of the members there \u2014 and a lot of those members \u2014 they\u2019re rabid, they\u2019re sophomoric, literally, they\u2019re second term in Congress, never worked in politics before, and they think they are somehow like \u2014 it\u2019s all talked in military terms. They think they\u2019re some kind of guerrillas there to strike a blow for freedom.\u201d\n\nThe Tennessee Democrat warned the tea party may try to pursue its shutdown strategy once again. But he added that it was his duty as a member of Congress to support the country from all enemies domestic and foreign \u2014 portraying the tea party members as domestic enemies.\n\n\u201cI think they may try to pull this off again,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhat John Boehner is going to have to do is decide that he\u2019s not going to be speaker in 2015 and work with the same crew that gave us the opening-up of government. Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Democratic caucus and give or take 80 reasonable Republicans and pass some bills to avoid another CR problem and shutdown and avoid the debt crisis, protect the country from these people, who really, you got to think, we take an oath to support the country against all enemies foreign and domestic, and these are the domestic enemies.\u201d\n\nCohen is no stranger to controversy. Back in 2011, the Tennessee Democrat likened attacks on Obamacare to Nazi Germany in a speech on the House floor. Cohen later apologized for those remarks.\n\n(h/t Mark Finkelstein, Newsbusters)\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "\u2018We take an oath to support the country against all enemies foreign and domestic\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Tennessee Democrat Rep.
