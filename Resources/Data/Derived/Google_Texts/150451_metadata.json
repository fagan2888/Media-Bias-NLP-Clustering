Bernard Tomic 6-3, 6-1\n\nBernard Tomic\u2019s mental resolve will again come under fire after the world No.52 put in a below-par performance to lose his Sydney International title 6-3, 6-1 to Juan Martin del Potro in less than a hour.\n\nTomic did little to endear himself to a parochial home crowd with an uninspiring effort, barely testing the world No.5 who cruised to victory in 53 minutes in what was the shortest final in Sydney in terms of games played since 2000.\n\nIt was a limp defence of Tomic\u2019s only career title and well short of the performance he produced to beat world No.20 Kevin Anderson last year. Tomic had impressed in the earlier rounds of the tournament with good wins against the likes of Sergiy Stakhovsky, Alexandr Dolgopolov and Blaz Kavcic to move to the final but his effort on Saturday night was anything but impressive.\n\nDown and out: Bernard Tomic.

He was broken at 3-3 in the opening set and never recovered. Now he faces a stiffer test \u2013 a match-up against world No.1 Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open on Tuesday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTomic said he would leave for Melbourne on Sunday. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s going to be an amazing match,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s a tough ask. I wanted to win this championship but Juan played too good. Now my focus is on playing Rafa. I\u2019m playing a legend. Unfortunately I have to play him in the first round. I\u2019m going to bring it to him. The odds aren\u2019t in my favour. I\u2019m happy with the way I competed [against del Potro] but I got killed.\u2019\u2019\n\nDel Potro \u2013 who became the first top-ranked seed since Lleyton Hewitt in 2005 to win the title \u2013 needed just one of his two set points to again break Tomic\u2019s serve to claim the opening set. The second set mirrored the opener, with Tomic unable to compose himself after he again gave up his serve early in the set. Del Potro said he was impressed with his own performance.\n\n\u2018\u2018Finals are never easy but I was surprised by my level,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018I thought I played great. I made a lot of winners. Every long, running rally we played I won all of them.\n\n\u2018\u2018I think he was a little frustrated after seeing me very focused on the match and hitting the ball so well. He is still young in some moments of the match. He has everything to win titles and will reach finals very soon.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe former US Open champion broke with the score at 2-1 in the second set, with the fourth game of the second set going to deuce before the Argentine held his own serve before breaking Tomic to love. With eight aces, the taller Del Potro looked sharp in perfect conditions.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Tennis", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "As if a horror Australian Open draw wasn't enough, now Bernard Tomic has been stripped of his Sydney International crown as well.", "title": "Sydney International men's final: Bernard Tomic hammered by Juan Martin del Potro", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/tennis/sydney-international-mens-final-bernard-tomic-hammered-by-juan-martin-del-potro-20140111-30nya.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/o/0/k/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.30nya.png/1389438925360.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/0/o/0/k/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.30nya.png/1389438925360.jpg"}, "title": "Sydney International men's final: Bernard Tomic hammered by Juan Martin del Potro", "description": "As if a horror Australian Open draw wasn't enough, now Bernard Tomic has been stripped of his Sydney International crown as well.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "As if a horror Australian Open draw wasn't enough, now Bernard Tomic has been stripped of his Sydney International crown as well."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6cca\"", "article_summary": "Juan Martin del Potro def.\nWith eight aces, the taller Del Potro looked sharp in perfect conditions.\nDel Potro said he was impressed with his own performance.\nBernard Tomic 6-3, 6-1Bernard Tomic\u2019s mental resolve will again come under fire after the world No.52 put in a below-par performance to lose his Sydney International title 6-3, 6-1 to Juan Martin del Potro in less than a hour.\nThe second set mirrored the opener, with Tomic unable to compose himself after he again gave up his serve early in the set."}
