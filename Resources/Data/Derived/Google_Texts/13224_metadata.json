I\u2019ve heard he really appreciates offensive linemen. Not a bad guy to block for.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhere he will block for Manning isn\u2019t certain, Sambrailo said. Coach Gary Kubiak said last Friday that he would start Sambrailo at right tackle, but for now, Sambrailo said he\u2019s playing \u201cwherever\u201d in mini camp to spread out reps for players trying to earn roster spots.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 fourth-round pick Garcia, however, said the plan is for him to learn the guard position and then transition to center \u201cas I learn the offense and get more comfortable.\u201d\n\nBut like Sambrailo, hearing from Manning after he was drafted and then meeting him Thursday left Garcia a bit starstruck.\n\n\u201cHe actually shot me a text after I got drafted, so that was pretty cool,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI just looked at my phone for like 10 minutes. I was like, \u2018Wow, I just got a text message from Peyton.\u2019 But I met him and he\u2019s a really down-to-earth guy. We just talked a little bit about football and that was it. But yeah, I enjoyed it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Gary Kubiak,Max Garcia,Peyton Manning,Ty Sambrailo", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Broncos rookie offensive linemen Ty Sambrailo and Max Garcia both said they were excited to finally speak with Peyton Manning.", "title": "Ty Sambrailo, Max Garcia excited to meet, play alongside Peyton Manning", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/05/08/ty-sambrailo-max-garcia-excited-to-meet-play-alongside-peyton-manning/33920/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/05/471431356-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Broncos rookie offensive linemen Ty Sambrailo and Max Garcia both said they were excited to finally speak with Peyton Manning.", "title": "Ty Sambrailo, Max Garcia excited to meet, play alongside Peyton Manning", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/05/08/ty-sambrailo-max-garcia-excited-to-meet-play-alongside-peyton-manning/33920/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/05/471431356-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Broncos rookie offensive linemen Ty Sambrailo and Max Garcia both said they were excited to finally speak with Peyton Manning."}, "article_summary": "But meeting Peyton Manning was high on the list.\nNot a bad guy to block for.\u201dWhere he will block for Manning isn\u2019t certain, Sambrailo said.\nThe biggest highlight of the many offensive linemen Ty Sambrailo and Max Garcia experienced this past week was, of course, hearing their name called in the 2015 draft.\nI was like, \u2018Wow, I just got a text message from Peyton.\u2019 But I met him and he\u2019s a really down-to-earth guy.\n\u201cHe came up and said hi and said he\u2019s excited to get to work,\u201d Sambrailo said Friday, after Day 1 of rookie mini camp."}
