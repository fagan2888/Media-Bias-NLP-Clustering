Real Estate in Loveland. \"It's important for people to be aware of the situation.\"\n\nKurtz put a vacant three-bedroom Loveland home on the market in early June and closed on it in July, but a scammer had the property listed on craigslist, an online advertising directory, as being for rent. In the past year, she had three of her for-sale properties listed by scammers as being rentals, she said.\n\nInformation for the rental likely was pulled from tax records and a listing service at realtor.com to obtain the address and a description of the house, Kurtz said.\n\n\"In this case, they used the homeowner's name, so the potential renter thinks they're talking directly to the homeowner,\" Kurtz said. \"In my situation, my homeowner doesn't even have a computer, so she doesn't have access to craigslist, so that's not a possibility for her to have posted it for rent.\"\n\nKurtz learned that three Loveland residents fell for the scam and sent a nonrefundable fee of $1,700 for the deposit and first month's rent to addresses in New Mexico and Wisconsin. The residents were asked to make their checks out to the name of Kurtz's client, and the checks most likely were deposited in a fake bank account, Kurtz said.\n\nWhat the residents were asked to pay for rent was below market value at $700, $500 less than Kurtz would expect for such a property, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe low rental rate presented a red flag, as did not requiring the signing of a lease before sending the deposit and rent, Kurtz said.\n\n\"What they were told is, once we receive the rent money, we'll send the lease. That's a red flag but three people fell for it,\" Kurtz said.\n\nThe applicants filled out rental applications and went through some of the same processes renters go through with a property manager, making the situation seem real, Kurtz said.\n\n\"The people on the other end are really good,\" Kurtz said. \"It sounded professional.\"\n\nDebbie Hansen, a broker associate at The Group, said she encountered a couple of similar scams.\n\nIn once case, one of her properties was listed on craigslist as a rental, but the interested renter drove by and saw a sign indicating it was for sale, Hansen said.\n\n\"The only way I found out it occurred is somebody had called on one of my properties wanting to know if it was for rent,\" she said.\n\nKurtz mentioned other red flags to look for, such as checking if the property is vacant or if there is a sale sign in the yard and not meeting face to face to sign the paperwork.\n\n\"It's a newer thing,\" Kurtz said. \"They figured out a new way to scam.\"\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Shelley Widhalm at 970-669-5050 or swidhalm@reporter-herald.com.
