The need for a program like Navicare became apparent after the launch of West Virginia\u2019s drug abuse hotline, Smith said \u2014 many of the callers seeking help were uninsured and didn\u2019t know how to obtain insurance.\n\n\u201cThey found that a lot of the people calling in didn\u2019t have health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was their No. 1 barrier to getting the treatment they needed, so [First Choice] decided to apply for the Affordable Care Act Navigator Grant. We\u2019re really excited to start the work that will help all West Virginians.\u201d\n\nAlthough First Choice is based in Charleston, the Navicare Program plans to send navigators to other cities, including Huntington, Parkersburg and Beckley, once a week to provide in-person assistance for those who are uninsured, whether they qualify for Medicaid or need help selecting a private insurance plan.\n\n\u201cThe population we\u2019re reaching out to is all over the map,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt\u2019s really for anybody who doesn\u2019t have health insurance, for one reason or another.\u201d\n\nThe WV Navicare Program will hold several in-person assister events, including an event in Charleston between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday at the Bureau for Senior Services offices in the Charleston Town Center Mall, as well as a Monday event in Huntington at the Marshall University Student Center.\n\nFor more information on WV Navicare, including a full list of in-person events, frequently asked questions and other resources, visit www.wvnavicare.com.
