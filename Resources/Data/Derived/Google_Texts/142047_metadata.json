The so-called \u201cBridge to Nowhere\u201d -- a proposed bridge to replace the ferry currently connecting the Alaskan town of Ketchikan with the sparsely populated Gravina Island \u2013 became the poster child for dubious earmark spending.\n\nRelated: One Sure Way to Get the Do-Nothing Congress to Do Something\n\nWhile Congress formally imposed a moratorium on this sort of fiscal mischief in 2010, the funding for many previously approved transportation, parks, museums and defense projects lives on in the accounts of federal departments and agencies.\n\nA new study issued this week by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), aptly named \u201cJurassic Pork,\u201d documents the billions of dollars\u2019 spent on previously approved projects that just won\u2019t go away.\n\n\u201cLike Tyrannosaurus Rex, Brontosaurus, Triceratops and other terrible lizards of the past, the infamy of many congressional earmarks lives on to this day,\u201d Flake wrote in the introduction to his detailed report. \u201cThe indoor rain forest in Iowa, a teapot museum in North Carolina, and of course the notorious Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska.\u201d\n\nFlake said that by all accounts, the earmark ban has been a resounding success, with no new earmarks approved since the official start of the ban. Still, in one form or another, legacy spending on earmarks continues on.\n\nRelated: The $20 Million Political Boondoggle That Just Won\u2019t Die\n\nIn some cases, the appropriated funding has yet to be spent. In other cases, such as new programs for national parks or preferences in the tax code, the earmarks were permanently set in concrete by Congress.\n\nAccording to Citizens Against Government Waste, earmarks cost taxpayers $2.6 billion in 1991 and steadily grew to $29 billion at the height of the abuse of earmarks in 2006.\n\n\u201cFossilized within the federal budget, these projects continue to cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d the Arizona Republican wrote. \u201cMany have even outlasted the terms of the politicians who created them.\u201d\n\nThe release of the report was timed to coincide with the release of \u201cJurassic World,\u201d the latest in the \u201cJurassic Park\u201d film series.\n\nRelated: Defense \u201cEarmarks\u201d Squander $1.6 Billion a Year.\n\nHighway spending provided extraordinarily fertile ground for long-lasting earmarked projects, according to the report. Some 1,282 transportation earmarks worth $5.9 billion are still on the books, although the funding authorization sits idle in Department of Transportation accounts.\n\nFor example, Congress directed $500,000 to the Georgia Department of Transportation for historic preservation of the 1906 AB&A Railroad Building in Fitzgerald. There are also three earmarks totaling $5.6 million for Massachusetts transportation officials to design and build bike paths between Providence, R.I., and Worcester, Mass.\n\nThe American Ballet Theatre in New York has received $810,000 of earmarks since 2005, thanks in part to the intervention of Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY), a champion of the ballet, who once played a dead body in a performance of \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d\n\nRelated: Outrageous Corporate Earmarks Stage a Comeback\n\nThe report also targets a legacy earmark for genetic-grape research, which, even after the moratorium, secured $2 million in federal funding. And the report complains that the government continues to spend millions on Steamtown USA, a historic train museum and tourist center in Scranton, Pa., that had been heavily promoted for years by former Rep. Joseph McDade (R-PA).\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Five years ago, lawmakers on Capitol Hill congratulated themselves for finally putting", "title": "\u2018Jurassic Pork\u2019 Breaks Ban on Congressional Earmarks", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/15/Jurassic-Pork-Breaks-Ban-Congressional-Earmarks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Ketchikan_and_Gravina_Island_Ferry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/15/Jurassic-Pork-Breaks-Ban-Congressional-Earmarks", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Ketchikan_and_Gravina_Island_Ferry.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Five years ago, lawmakers on Capitol Hill congratulated themselves for finally putting", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Some 1,282 transportation earmarks worth $5.9 billion are still on the books, although the funding authorization sits idle in Department of Transportation accounts.\nThe so-called \u201cBridge to Nowhere\u201d -- a proposed bridge to replace the ferry currently connecting the Alaskan town of Ketchikan with the sparsely populated Gravina Island \u2013 became the poster child for dubious earmark spending.\nStill, in one form or another, legacy spending on earmarks continues on.\nAccording to Citizens Against Government Waste, earmarks cost taxpayers $2.6 billion in 1991 and steadily grew to $29 billion at the height of the abuse of earmarks in 2006.\n\u201cFossilized within the federal budget, these projects continue to cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d the Arizona Republican wrote."}
