And although I think I hung in there against the defenders of secession and others \u2014 many of them, weirdly, transplanted Yankees \u2014 who passionately defended the monuments and the decision of the General Assembly and Gov.

The sizable crew of dissidents was just as Southern as Robert E. Lee and might be astonished to see Confederate monuments all over the state today.

She simply had no idea when the monuments went up, saying it was \u2018shortly after the War Between the States.\u2019 If someone had tried to put up Confederate monuments all over North Carolina shortly after the Civil War, there might have been another war. The unanimous Confederate white South is nothing but a cherished myth \u2013 especially in North Carolina.\u201d\n\nRead the rest of Tyson\u2019s fine, myth-busting essay by clicking here", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1352\"", "article_summary": "The sizable crew of dissidents was just as Southern as Robert E.
