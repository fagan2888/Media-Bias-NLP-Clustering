BEDFORD, N.H. – Over lunch yesterday in New Hampshire with a dozen business people, former Gov. Rick Perry made a somewhat startling claim about the high number of uninsured Texans.

“People criticize us for having a large number of uninsured,” he said. “That’s what Texans decided they wanted. They did not want government forcing everyone to buy insurance.”

He was defending Texas’ refusal, under his leadership, to create an insurance marketplace or expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

Today, Texas Democrats hit back.

“Rick Perry should be ashamed of himself for saying that the people of Texas did not want increased coverage and expanded access to healthcare. More than one million hardworking Texans are living without affordable care because of his failure to partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap,” state Democratic Party spokesman Javier Gamboa said. “This lame excuse won’t work for him in Texas, New Hampshire or the rest of the nation as he runs for president.

“Perry owes the hard working people of Texas — especially those who would be covered under Medicaid expansion, and are forced to go without coverage — an apology for his lack of leadership as governor of Texas,” Gamboa asserted.

When Perry made the comment, the hand-picked guests were unfazed.

Shawn Walsh, 49, CEO of a computer consulting firm, had prompted Perry’s comment by complaining about rising costs of insurance for his business and its employees. And afterward, he said he liked Perry’s answer.

“He hit it right on the head,” Walsh said.
