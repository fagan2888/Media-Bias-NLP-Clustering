May has previously run for the 19th District, albeit unsuccessfully, in 2003 and 2014.\n\nIn an interview with KFYO News, May said he expected the vote in the rural counties to be double of the previous primary in 2014. He also stated that his campaign will focus on three major areas: agriculture, water and natural resources, and national security.\n\nConcerning the federal government, May said, \u201cThe federal government is there to protect us. Not to draft us. Not to harass us. Not to tell us what to eat. Or how much water we can use for our shower, or what kind of a vehicle we can drive; or what we can do, or what we can\u2019t do. Our federal government is there to protect us from our enemies: domestic and foreign. As I said, we need to cut taxes and regulations.\u201d\n\nMay also discussed military veterans, \u201cWe need to take care of our veterans,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t care for our veterans we are not going to attract good men and women to our military. If our veterans need help, they need to be able to go to a veterans facility, or another medical facility. If they need urgent help, they need to be able to get that help right away; not the next day, not the next week, not the next month.\u201d\n\nMay was asked about a defamation lawsuit he filed earlier this year against a female Texas Tech law school student. He was accused of sexual harassment and the suit is still working its way through a Lubbock County District Court. \u201cThat situation, we just found out about in the recent past, but apparently happened back in 2012,\u201d he said.\n\nMay continued, \u201cA person was making allegations against me at the 2012 Texas Republican Convention. This person wanted to be the lead delegate (for Texas) at the Republican National Convention. That didn\u2019t work out, unknowing to me, apparently the allegations continued. We weren\u2019t able to find out what these allegations really were, the person was not cooperative so we had no choice but to file a legal suit. I think the greatest information you can find in this is that in our first hearing her attorney filed a paper. And that paper will explain the situation very well as to what is going on.\u201d\n\nI asked May if he sees the ongoing lawsuit as a distraction for his congressional campaign. \u201cI\u2019m going up to Washington to initiate lawsuits,\u201d May said. \u201cMy job up there is to challenge the government, to challenge people. When something isn\u2019t right, our legal system is there for the purpose of resolution of problems.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cSo, I look at this as simply showing \u2018I\u2019m not afraid to stand up to anybody\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not afraid to stand up to anything\u2019. I don\u2019t sweep things under the rug. I address them. I\u2019m going up there to Washington, and there\u2019s problems, and my Republican colleagues up there often just ignore them and put them under the rug. Because they\u2019re afraid they won\u2019t be re-elected if they start addressing problems.\u201d\n\nThe complete interview with Dr. Donald May, conducted by KFYO News\u2019 Rob Snyder and KCBD\u2019s Scott Mann, can be heard in the video below.\n\nMay will be running against a number of Republicans in the 2016 Primary for the 19th Congressional District: including, but not limited to: Glen Robertson, Jodey Arrington, Greg Garrett, DeRenda Warren, and Col. Bob Starr, of Abilene.\n\nMay released an abbreviated version of his campaign launch speech, which can be listened to on the first video in this story.\n\nFrom Donald R. May, MD, FACS:\n\nTo the People of the Texas 19th Congressional District\n\nI am running for the United States House of Representatives because I am alarmed by how very rapidly Obama has greatly damaged our nation by weakening our national security, destroying our jobs, and undermining our prosperity.\n\nOur national security must be rapidly restored, especially our military preparedness.\n\nOur border must be rapidly and completely secured by our military and a combination of federal, state, and local police agencies. We need to know who and what is entering and leaving our nation.\n\nAgriculture production and the economic prosperity of our farms is a vital part of our national security. Without the increased domestic production of food and natural fibers, our nation cannot be secure or prosperous.\n\nOil, natural gas, coal, and electricity production are foundational to our national security and our future prosperity.\n\nOur national debt has spiraled out of control, the outrageous rate of growth in the size of our federal government has increased, and ObamaCare has destroyed our Liberty and greatly increased the cost of our healthcare.\n\nI will represent you by actively addressing the problems that threaten our nation. I will bring West Texas values and common sense to Washington.\n\nI will speak from the floor of the House as often as possible. I will update you and the news media every day. I will spend my time in Washington doing important work and not seeking to be important.\n\nI will write bills intended to incrementally take apart ObamaCare, the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, and the bloated welfare system. This money and power must be returned to the people and to the individual states where the Tenth Amendment tells us it belongs in the first place.\n\nYou and I believe that Liberty is the answer, with each man and woman able to make decisions for themselves and their families. Our Constitution protects you and me from our government, from politicians, from bureaucrats, from tyrants, and from elitist busy bodies.\n\nWashington is broken, and both parties are to blame. Much of the Republican Party has not had the courage to confront Obama and the Far Left.\n\nThat is why I am running for the Texas 19th Congressional District House seat. We need accountability in Washington. We need leaders who are not afraid to fight for our Conservative values.\n\nAmerica\u00b9s best days are always before us when We the People stand up to fight for those values that built our great nation.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/kfyo.com/files/2015/10/DonaldMay20151029_112907.jpg", "sailthru.author": "kfyonews", "description": "Dr. Donald May is making his third run for the 19th District.
