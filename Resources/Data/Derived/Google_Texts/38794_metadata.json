The second big lie\n\nposted at 11:21 am on November 14, 2013 by Bruce McQuain\n\nEveryone lately has been focused on President Obama\u2019s whopper about being able to keep one\u2019s insurance policy if they liked it. But perhaps the biggest lie about the entire law is to be found in it\u2019s official title with the word \u201caffordable\u201d. The Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. ObamaCare, made the promise that everyone would have health care insurance and (except for those who liked their plan and planned on keeping it \u2014 period) it would be \u201cmore affordable.\u201d Everyone would have lower premiums and better options.\n\nOh they used the magic buzz word \u201ccompetition\u201d to try to make their government run and regulated exchanges sound like a real marketplace, but in reality they are anything but that.\n\nResult? Well that\u2019s where the biggest lie comes in:\n\nIt also isn\u2019t funny to those who are seeing their premiums go up. According to Heritage researcher Drew Gonshorowski, premiums are going to increase for individuals buying insurance in the exchanges in at least 42 of 47 states. In fact, health care costs will rise across the board. As Bob Moffit, a Senior Fellow for Health Policy Studies at Heritage, has said, \u201cNo matter how you look at this, health care costs both for individuals and for the country as a whole are going to increase.\u201d There are many reasons for this, as Moffit mentioned\u2014namely, 18 new tax hikes, $1.8 trillion in new health care entitlement spending, and new benefit mandates.\n\nGullibility is another word that needs to be talked about a bit more as well. How gullible are those who really believed that expanding health insurance via 18 new tax hikes and $1.8 trillion in new entitlement spending was going to somehow be more \u201caffordable\u201d in the first place and not effect them in the second? And when we found out that ObamaCare would require every policy to have minimum benefits whether or not the policy holder wanted or needed them, how did we figure that would be cheaper and \u2013 something we could keep, period?\n\nThen add on the 18,000 or so new IRS agents, the untold number of boards and bureaucrats and the mountains of rules and regulations. Cheaper? More affordable? Really?\n\nThe Democrats and Obama counted on a large portion of the population being gullible enough to believe the big lie, despite the obvious tons of reasons (and facts) not to believe them. And, as polls have indicated from the beginning, the majority of America wasn\u2019t at all convinced that the promises had any basis in reality. They and the GOP were against it and resisted it from the beginning. As it turns out, they were right to do so.\n\nThere is nothing \u201caffordable\u201d about this farce known as the Affordable Care Act. As Ed Fuelner says at the Heritage Foundation:\n\nObamacare is an unmitigated disaster for our country. This is why it would have been better to defund it before it took the toll that it is already taking on so many American citizens.\n\nNote the third word of interest in this post \u2013 \u201cdefund\u201d. Somehow among much of the GOP \u201cdefund\u201d has turned into \u201creplace\u201d, as in \u201cwith what should we replace this disaster\u201d.\n\nThat brings us to a quote by another great American, Thomas Sowell, who answers the question quite succinctly:\n\nNo matter how disastrously some policy has turned out, anyone who criticizes it can expect to hear: \u201cBut what would you replace it with?\u201d When you put out a fire, what do you replace it with?\n\nNothing. And that\u2019s why ObamaCare\u2019s future should be to end up in the ash heap of history and be replaced with \u2026 nothing. It was a lie from the beginning, it is a failure on implementation and as any good tactician will tell you, you don\u2019t reinforce failure.\n\n~McQ\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The biggest lie.", "title": "Affordable Care Act?
