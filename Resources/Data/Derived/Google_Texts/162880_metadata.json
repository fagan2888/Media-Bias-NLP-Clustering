Many more could follow.\n\nAnother 673 hospitals nationally are teetering on the edge of closure due to a number of federal funding decisions, according to a report prepared in collaboration with an association representing rural hospitals.\n\nIn Sayre, located in a county of fewer than 23,000 people, the 35-bed nonprofit hospital seems to have been hit by a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors, said Belinda Graham, executive director of the Sayre Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible loss for our community,\u201d she said.\n\nThe nearest hospital now is the Great Plains Regional Medical Center in Elk City. That\u2019s 12 miles away, which could mean life or death if you\u2019re having a heart attack or are severely injured, she said.\n\nHelping the hospitals, though, will cost money \u2014 a lot of it \u2014 and both hospital executives and their advocates are unsure of the prospects of getting much from Washington. Complicating matters is an election year, when Congress schedules long breaks to go home and campaign, making it difficult to get anything done.\n\nWhen Sayre shut down Feb. 4, it issued a statement blaming a number of factors.\n\nMaggie Elehwany, the National Rural Health Association\u2019s vice president of government affairs, said its story is familiar.\n\nFederal spending limits that went into effect in 2013 reduced Medicare payments to the Oklahoma hospital by 2 percent, according to its press release.\n\nNationally, automatic budget cuts have cost rural hospitals $2.8 billion in Medicare reimbursements, according to the study by a consultant, iVantage Health Analytics. Though not funded by the hospital group, the study done with its cooperation was presented at association\u2019s conference in Washington earlier this month.\n\nThe government has also cut reimbursements to hospitals that treat uninsured patients, dropping payments from 100 percent of a hospital\u2019s costs to 65 percent, the study found.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s health care law was expected to decrease the number of patients without insurance, whose treatment means a financial loss for hospitals, Elehwany said in an interview.\n\nBut states including Oklahoma declined to expand Medicaid to more people \u2014 a central component of the Obamacare plan.\n\nIn addition, more and more insurance plans carry higher deductibles, the study said. Hospitals have more trouble collecting payments from patients and absorb more losses.\n\nThe iVantage study judged whether hospitals are vulnerable of closing based on factors such as what they charge compared to the cost of service; if they serve areas with high rates of illness; and the costs of treating those conditions.\n\nThose deemed vulnerable represent about a third of all rural hospitals.\n\nHospitals in Southern states face the greatest threat. The study found 79 percent of Mississippi\u2019s rural hospitals are vulnerable. The figure was 58 percent in Louisiana. In Georgia, it\u2019s 53 percent, and in Texas it\u2019s 50 percent. The study does not list the financial conditions of specific hospitals.\n\nThe rural hospital association is backing a proposal, introduced by Reps. Sam Graves, R-Missouri, and Dave Loebsack, D-Iowa, to put the hospitals on better footing.\n\nIt exempts funding for rural hospitals from the automatic budget cuts, among other things. While the federal government cannot force states to expand Medicaid, it can restore reimbursements for treating the uninsured.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for a dime in new funding \u2014 just for the cuts to stop,\u201d Elehwany said.\n\nBudget analysts in Congress have not yet priced the proposal.\n\n\u201cIt would be expensive,\u201d said Elehwany. Part of the cost will be offset, she added, by the savings of people who are treated in rural areas, where prices are less expensive, instead of going to urban or suburban hospitals.\n\n\u201cThe reason this costs money is that it\u2019s money now being taken out of the pockets of rural hospitals,\u201d she said.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said during a call with reporters Wednesday that he\u2019s open to the ideas, but he is skeptical of getting Congress to cough up the money.\n\nInstead, Grassley proposes removing the requirement that hospitals provide inpatient care to get federal funding. They would still be required to provide 24/7 emergency service.\n\nGrassley said his bill, which he hopes to bring to a vote this year, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the huge cost that the House bill has.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s fiscally possible,\u201d he said, noting that his bill would at least bring some immediate relief.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, is also preparing legislation to increase Medicare funding for hospitals in lower-income areas, his office said. It would help 14 rural hospitals in Georgia avoid closing.\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, is backing Grassley\u2019s bill.\n\nHis office didn\u2019t respond when asked about the Graves-Loebsack proposal.\n\nBut Lankford sympathized with the plight of rural hospitals in a meeting of the association in Washington earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe threat of closure of rural hospitals is a serious risk to the livelihood of these communities,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, said his office tried unsuccessfully to find government money to keep Sayre Memorial open. In a statement, he didn\u2019t endorse anyone\u2019s plan but said he continues to seek ways to help rural hospitals find resources.\n\nElehwany said that Grassley\u2019s and Isakson\u2019s ideas will help rural hospitals, but they face deeper problems.\n\n\u201cOne important but small band aid is not going to stop the bleeding,\u201d she said of Isakson\u2019s bill.\n\nKery Murakami is the Washington, D.C. reporter for CNHI\u2019s newspapers and websites.
