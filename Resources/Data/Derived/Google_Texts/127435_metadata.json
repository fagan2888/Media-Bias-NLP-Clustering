That\u2019s simple enough if you have only one retirement account. But who has just one these days?\n\nYounger Baby Boomers held almost a dozen jobs from ages 18 to 48, and non-retiring workers more often choose to leave retirement funds in their former employer\u2019s plan rather than rolling them over into an IRA, adding them to a new employer plan, or withdrawing the cash. That means retirement accounts keep piling up. It can get even more complicated when you add a spouse\u2019s accounts to the mix.\n\nThe once-simple task of asset allocation must occur over many accounts, some that you can actively grow and others, like legacy 401(k)s that you can\u2019t. The solution can be daunting.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of A-R-T that goes into working out this puzzle,\u201d says Roger Stinnett, managing director of wealth planning at First Foundation in Los Angeles. \u201cAllocation, resources and taxes.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Best and Worst States for Retirement\n\nConsolidate and simplify\n\nMany financial advisers recommend consolidating as many accounts as possible, like rolling over ex-employer 401(k)s to your current employer\u2019s 401(k) or an IRA. That should help to streamline account management and maintain your ideal asset allocation.\n\n\u201cYou might also consider simplifying your investment strategy,\u201d says Taylor Schulte, a financial planner with Define Financial in San Diego. \u201cYou don't need 15 funds to get ample diversification.\u201d\n\nInstead, you may just need a handful of low-cost index funds or a one-fund solution such as a target-date fund, Schulte says. But don\u2019t forget to consider any fees associated with the investment because they can put a dent on long-term returns.\n\nBut \u201cif an account has a different goal or tax structure, then your allocation will likely look different across accounts and it will require a more tactical approach,\u201d he says.\n\nAllocate each account\n\nInstead of putting your bond investments in one account and your growth stocks in another, apply your ideal asset allocation to each and every account. Rebalance each account when allocation skews by 3 percent to 5 percent, says Daniel Lash, a certified financial planner at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.\n\nFor example, if your ideal allocation is 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, you will need to rebalance when that allocation has moved to 55 percent stocks and 45 percent bonds.\n\nHere\u2019s how: Pick the bonds that are up the most and sell them to return to your 40-percent allocation. Reinvest that money and buy equity investments that have fallen the most in value to return to the 60-percent allocation.\n\n\u201cDoing so forces investors to sell at relative highs and buy at relative lows,\u201d says Lash. \u201cAllocating one account to all bonds and another to all stocks makes this process of rebalancing more difficult since you may not be able to move money between accounts.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Your Retirement Calculator Could Be Your Downfall\n\nGet sophisticated\n\nInstead of applying your asset allocation to each account, treat your separate accounts as one big portfolio and allocate accordingly. This may mean that each account doesn\u2019t reflect the ideal allocation by itself, but taken together they do. Start with the retirement accounts with the most limited menu of investments, says Stinnett. For instance, if your current employer's 401(k) only offers large-cap equity and bond funds, then start with those.\n\nIf you have multiple accounts that have limited options, look at them side by side and choose the better investment to fill a certain asset type or category. If the account is likely to grow, go for a balanced allocation to make it easier to rebalance in the future. For smaller accounts with the most flexibility, invest in core holdings of your asset allocation.\n\n\u201cThis approach helps to alleviate the need to rebalance this account,\u201d Stinnett says, \u201cand makes it easier to rebalance your large account that you may be adding contributions to.\u201d\n\n\u2018Asset location\u2019\n\nInvestors thinking about the tax consequences of their investments may consider an even more complicated plan to manage multiple retirement accounts. Randy Bruns, a wealth advisor at HighPoint Planning Partners in Downers Grove, Illinois, calls his strategy \u201casset location.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Retirement Revolution That Failed: Why the 401(k) Isn\u2019t Working\n\n\n\nFor example, Roth funds should be used for assets that offer the greatest long-term growth potential\u2014stocks\u2014because these accounts grow tax-free and have the longest time horizon. On the other hand, bonds should be held in pre-tax retirement accounts. This strategy shelters income and could possibly reduce your required minimum distributions later on if bonds underperform stocks, he says.\n\n\u201cSmaller distributions could mean less taxes, ultimately helping your nest egg last longer in retirement,\u201d he says. \u201cThe trouble with asset location is that it's extremely complex to implement and manage. You'll need to monitor your overall allocation a few times per year and make adjustments when necessary.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the best strategies for saving for retirement is to have a mix of stocks and bo", "title": "How to Simplify Your Retirement Accounts \u2014 and Make More Money", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/15/How-Simplify-Your-Retirement-Accounts-And-Make-More-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09302012_retirement_piggies_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/15/How-Simplify-Your-Retirement-Accounts-And-Make-More-Money", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09302012_retirement_piggies_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One of the best strategies for saving for retirement is to have a mix of stocks and bo", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Start with the retirement accounts with the most limited menu of investments, says Stinnett.\nThat means retirement accounts keep piling up.\nOn the other hand, bonds should be held in pre-tax retirement accounts.\nThat\u2019s simple enough if you have only one retirement account.\nThe once-simple task of asset allocation must occur over many accounts, some that you can actively grow and others, like legacy 401(k)s that you can\u2019t."}
