First to witness the toxic contamination was the Southern Ute Tribe, then the Navajo Nation saw what Navajo President Russell Begaye described as looking \u201clike orange juice\u201d flow through the sprawling 27,000-square-mile reservation. The Animas River flows into the San Juan River in Farmington, New Mexico. Roughly 215 miles of the San Juan River runs through the Navajo Nation. The impact of the Gold King Mine spill, according to Begaye, would be felt by thousands.\n\nRELATED: Navajo Nation \u2018Weeping\u2019 as Toxic Mining Spill Flows Through Reservation\n\nRELATED: Southern Ute Tribe Declares Disaster Over Mining Spill in Animas River\n\nOn September 16, the SCIA held a hearing titled: \u201cEPA\u2019s Gold King Mine Disaster: Examining the Harmful Impacts to Indian Country,\u201d with EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy.\n\nDuring the hearing Barrasso addressed the accountability of the EPA by stating, \u201cSince the responsibility for this spill lies with the EPA, the agency, I believe, has to go above and beyond the standard response to address the needs of the communities impacted \u2013 specifically the tribal communities.\u201d Barrasso asked if anyone had been held accountable?\n\nMcCarthy said she is waiting for the Department of the Interior to independently look at the information before making a judgment based solely on the EPA\u2019s internal review. \u201cWhether or not we took every precaution and made sound judgments is something that I am waiting the DOI independently to look at,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we find that there were inaccuracies \u2026 bad judgment we will take action.\u201d When pressed about accountability by Barrasso again, she stated the EPA is being held accountable.\n\nOn October 22, the DOI released a 132-page report stating the disaster was the result of rushing with inadequate engineering know-how and that it could have been prevented as The Denver Post reported.\n\nFollowing the DOI report, Barrasso released a statement saying, \u201cLiterally and figuratively, the EPA blew it. The government\u2019s own report directly refutes the EPA\u2019s claim that a toxic spill that caused 3 million gallons of toxic wastewater from the Gold King Mine to poison rivers in three states was \u2018likely inevitable.\u2019 Responsibility for this disaster lands directly on the EPA\u2019s doorstep. I want to know who at the EPA will be held accountable for this disaster.\u201d\n\nOn November 12, Colorado officials asserted the state\u2019s position originally presented to the EPA on September 2, that the state gave advice but did not approve EPA actions The Denver Post reported. An Internal review by the EPA along with the DOI investigation \u201cconcluded state experts approved EPA efforts to drain the mine,\u201d according to The Post.\n\nMike King, Colorado natural resources director, disagreed with the findings. King said the state shared information about similar techniques used at other mines as \u201cgeneral advice only.\u201d The state\u2019s position on September 2 appeared in a letter written by King which the EPA\u2019s inspector general received Tuesday The Post reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of the Interior released its findings that the Gold King Mine spill that had an impact on tribal communities could have been prevented.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/11/15/gold-king-mine-could-have-been-prevented-162427", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/animas_river_mine_spill-la_plata_office_of_emergency_management.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Gold King Mine Could Have Been Prevented"}, "abstract": "The Department of the Interior released its findings that the Gold King Mine spill that had an impact on tribal communities could have been prevented.", "dc": {"title": "Gold King Mine Could Have Been Prevented"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/11/15/gold-king-mine-could-have-been-prevented-162427", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Gold King Mine, Sen.
