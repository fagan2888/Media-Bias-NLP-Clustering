Her piece is worth reading in its entirety, but here are some highlights.\n\n\u2026 the on-screen version [shows] North Koreans discovering what a blubbering idiot their supreme leader is, and how revolution ultimately comes from within.\n\nI would point out that a well-established distribution channel exists in North Korea for the dissemination of forbidden video content: USB thumb drives. Video players that accept thumb drives have been dropped and smuggled into North Korea in significant numbers.\n\nAfter watching The Interview twice online, I\u2019ll venture to say the comedy goes even deeper into \u201cmessaging\u201d territory about the danger of the regime than the legendary \u201cronery\u201d Kim Jong-il send-up in Team America: World Police. Is it Oscar material? Of course not, but it\u2019s well-paced and even funnier if you\u2019re up on current events. A few observations without spoilers: John Kerry referenced as \u201cthat oak tree-looking f**k\u201d \u2014 need I say more?\n\nEminem and Rob Lowe have very funny cameos\n\nRandall Park as Kim Jong-un is at times more refined than we can ever imagine the young dictator, yet most of the time he\u2019s as silly and off his rocker as we expect him to be. He was all bravado and bluster in one moment, and blubbering the next.\n\nConcise foreign policy quote that sums up Kim well: \u201cHe says that he\u2019s going to blow up the world just to prove that he\u2019s the s**t\u201d\n\nJohnson points out the abundance of un-PC content:\n\nOne can imagine that at least some of the panning of the The Interview as a useless, poor movie is a reaction to the massive volume of political incorrectness within \u2014 The Guardian, for example, rated The Interview as \u201c20% sexism \u2026 10% \u2018funny\u2019 accents\u201d; The Verge referred to the film as a \u201cdumb, racist, homophobic, misogynistic comedy that also happens to depict the fiery death of a sitting political leader.\u201d\n\nIntelligence veteran G. Murphy Donovan has pointed to several signs that The Interview may in fact be part of a psy-ops campaign sanctioned by American intelligence officials. We can\u2019t know with any certainty, but the worldwide brouhaha over the film, with official North Korean denunciations, can\u2019t hurt in making the film attractive in the underground North Korean distribution system.
