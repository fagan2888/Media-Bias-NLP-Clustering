Department of Health and Human Services refused her earlier requests for a copy of an existing gender-neural marriage license. DHHS is led by Aldona Wos, a Greensboro physician and wealthy Republican fundraiser appointed by Gov. Pat McCrory in January 2013.\n\nRiddick kept her office open until after 9 p.m. Friday evening to issue marriage licenses after U.S. District Court Judge Max Cogburn Jr.\u2019s order at around 5:30 p.m. that night declaring North Carolina\u2019s ban on gay marriages unconstitutional.\n\nSome of the first legal gay couples to marry in the state did outside Riddick\u2019s office, including Wake County Sheriff Department employees Chad Briggs and Chris Creech who exchanged their vows as local news stations broadcast the union on live television.\n\nRiddick, along with other Registers of Deeds across the state, hoped to have her department\u2019s computer systems updated and ready when the expected federal court order legalizing same-sex marriages came down. (Click here for background on issue.)\n\nDHHS withholding the form was \u201cneither justified nor professional,\u201d Riddick said in a statement.\n\nFrom Riddick\u2019s statement:\n\nPreparing for the major change in one of our core public services was made needlessly difficult and complicated by the state Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s decision to withhold from North Carolina\u2019s 100 Register of Deeds the state\u2019s new gender-neutral marriage form, which has been ready for some time. In my view, that was neither justified nor professional. Since August, after the 4th Circuit ruled in Virginia\u2019s Bostic case, I repeatedly asked DHHS to provide us the new form \u2013 which is a public record under state law \u2013 so we could get our computer system ready for a likely court order to issue same-gender marriage licenses here. But my requests, like those of other Registers of Deeds across the state, fell on deaf ears at DHHS. Particularly once it became clear the U.S. Supreme Court was allowing same-gender marriages to go forward throughout the 4th Circuit, there was no legitimate rationale \u2013 if there ever had been \u2013 to withhold the forms. I apologize to our customers for any confusion or frustration the State\u2019s inaction might have caused them. We have done our best to adjust to this unnecessary impediment to delivering efficient customer service via 21st century technology.\n\nRiddick also had well wishes to offer.\n\n\u201cMany more couples, straight and gay, will come to this office for marriage licenses \u2013 all of whom have our best wishes for a happy and fulfilling union,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery customer who uses the Wake County Registry can expect courteous, respectful, and professional treatment from us. That is our job.\u201d\n\nVideo of the Briggs-Creech wedding, from the News & Observer:", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceacd\"", "article_summary": "After last night\u2019s historic ruling legalizing same-sex marriages in North Carolina, one county register of deeds says the McCrory administration unnecessarily delayed releasing gender-neutral marriage license forms.\nBut my requests, like those of other Registers of Deeds across the state, fell on deaf ears at DHHS.\n\u201cEvery customer who uses the Wake County Registry can expect courteous, respectful, and professional treatment from us.\nRiddick, along with other Registers of Deeds across the state, hoped to have her department\u2019s computer systems updated and ready when the expected federal court order legalizing same-sex marriages came down.\nWe have done our best to adjust to this unnecessary impediment to delivering efficient customer service via 21st century technology."}
