An observational study shows they're behind more of the exaggerated health claims than mainstream media.\n\nAcademic press releases largely take health and science news and make it more palatable for the general public. And as it turns out, they\u2019re not above exaggerating research claims for more clicks. Yep, we\u2019re talking about clickbait. Jon Stewart might have described it best to New York magazine when he said, \u201cIt\u2019s like carnival barkers, and they all sit out there and go, \u2018Come on in here and see a three-legged man!\u2019 So you walk in and it\u2019s a guy with a crutch.\u201d\n\nUp until now, a majority of the exaggerated health-related claims have been blamed on mainstream media. But researchers from Cardiff University in the UK weren\u2019t so sure it was the media so much as it was the academic press releases. So they set out to identify a true source.\n\nFirst, what does it mean for claims to be exaggerated? Researchers narrowed down three common types: \u201cgiving direct advice to readers to change their behavior, making causal claims from correlational (observational) data, and making inference about humans from animal findings.\u201d Then, they analyzed 462 press releases on health and biomedical-related science issued by universities in the UK in 2011, alongside their associated peer reviewed research papers and 668 national news stories.\n\nAnd in comparison to peer-reviewed journals, researchers found 40 percent of press releases contained exaggerated advice, 33 percent exaggerated casual claims, and 36 percent exaggerated inference to humans from animal research. What\u2019s more is an exaggerated press release, any type, led to exaggerated news coverage 58, 81, and 86 percent of the time, respectively. This was significantly less (up to 18 percent) when press releases properly reported the study\u2019s findings.\n\n\"Our principle findings were that most of the inflation detected in our study did not occur [from the beginning] in the media but was already present in the text of the press releases produced by academics and their establishments,\" researchers wrote.\n\nHowever, they added their study is only observational, which means they can\u2019t draw any definitive conclusions. Ben Goldacre, a research fellow at the London School of Hygiene & Topical Medicine, did add in an accompanying editorial that \u201cconsiderable quantitative research has already been done on misrepresentation of medical research in mainstream media.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvidence suggests that media coverage can have an effect on the uptake of treatments and services; and even on subsequent academic citations,\u201d Goldacre wrote. \u201cIt might be useful to build on the features of academic journals that improve standards and earn trust in science: accountability, transparency, and feedback.\u201d\n\nSource: Sumner P, et al.
