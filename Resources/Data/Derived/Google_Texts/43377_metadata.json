I think that lack of trust has deepened in recent years.\u201d\n\nSestak is seeking the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in the April 26 Pennsylvania Primary. He is opposed by Katie McGinty and John Fetterman. The primary winner will face Republican incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey in November.\n\nSestak said he will not participate in \u201ctransactional leadership\u201d \u2014 defining that as \u201cwe give you this, then you do that\u201d politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doubling down on what I saw in 2010,\u201d Sestak said, referring to the year he defeated Sen. Arlen Specter in the Democratic primary before losing to Toomey by two percentage points in the general election. \u201cI\u2019m doubling down on the people approach.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why Sestak completed a statewide \u201cWalking in Your Shoes\u201d campaign, meeting with people in all parts of Pennsylvania to, as he put it, learn what issues are most important to the ones he would serve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s jobs and wages,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just a job, but a good-paying job. And education \u2014 people feel the way ahead is through education.\u201d\n\nSestak said he has raised about $4.5 million to date and expects to spend most of that between now and the primary. He said 98 percent of his campaign contributions have come from people giving $200 or less.\n\nOn the issues:\n\n\u2022 Sestak favors raising the minimum wage to $10.80 per hour. He said at that rate, few jobs would be lost. He said the increase would help about 3 million Americans, but he said the larger issue is that the average wage for all Americans needs to increase.\n\n\u2022 Small businesses are the key to creating new jobs, Sestak said. He said that 70 percent of all new jobs are created by small businesses. He favors easing regulations, improving access to investment capital and lessening the tax burden on small businesses. He expects a return of manufacturing jobs from overseas and supports improving the community colleges to be able to train workers for those jobs.\n\n\u2022 Supports improving the Affordable Care Act. He said the ACA has extended the solvency of Medicare through 2030 and has made it possible for Americans to take greater control over their own health care.\n\n\u201cIf you have a pre-existing condition, insurance companies cannot deny or drop you from plans,\u201d Sestak said. \u201cThe rate of uninsured Americans has dropped to 10 percent \u2013 a historic low.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Sestak favors stronger immigration enforcement and supports a detailed path to citizenship. He said any path to naturalization for undocumented immigrants should include stringent requirements: significant fines for having violated immigration laws, repayment of any back taxes, criminal background checks, proof of employment and passing a basic English language test.\n\n\u2022 Sestak feels free college education is not possible. He said college students \u201cshould have some skin in the game.\u201d He favors lowering the interest rates on college loans.\n\nExpects party unity\n\nSestak said if he is his party\u2019s nominee, he expects support from party leadership.\n\n\u201cIn a year of anti-establishment sentiment, it\u2019s good that I am walking to my own drummer,\u201d Sestak said. \u201cLet me make it clear \u2014 this is not about party or type, it\u2019s the people that matter most.\u201d\n\nJoe Sestak, Democatic candidate for the U.S. Senate, speaks to the Times Leader Opinion Board Monday. http://timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/web1_TTL041216sestak1.jpg Joe Sestak, Democatic candidate for the U.S. Senate, speaks to the Times Leader Opinion Board Monday.
