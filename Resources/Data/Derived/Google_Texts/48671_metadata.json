Students receive training, mentoring and a field experience related to their major to help them connect their studies to their culture and community. The annual gathering allows for networking and sharing of research and ideas.\n\nHopa Mountain invests in rural and tribal citizen leaders who are working to improve education, ecological health, and economic development. The Native Science Fellows program is offered in collaboration with the Blackfeet Native Science Field Center at Blackfeet Community College, Salish Kootenai College, Montana State University and the University of Montana. It is made possible with generous support from the National Science Foundation and Hopa Mountain members.
