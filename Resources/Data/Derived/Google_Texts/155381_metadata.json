Bannon and Editor-in-Chief Alexander Marlow, Trump spoke in an easy, matter-of-fact way that America needs a leader that understands international relationships and global politics.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter delivering a rousing speech that shook the Hoyt Sherman Place auditorium at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Trump told Bannon and Marlow that he is \u201cvery, very serious\u201d about what\u2019s at stake for America and the need for new leadership in 2016. Trump emphasized in his speech on Saturday that \u201cpoliticians are all talk and no action.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been watching the IRS. I\u2019ve been watching Benghazi. I\u2019ve been watching immigration and \u2018the walls we\u2019re going to build,\u2019 and it\u2019s all talk. It\u2019s talk for two days and then it dies, and nobody does anything about it,\u201d he lamented. Trump claims that it\u2019s not just Democrats who keep kicking the political can down the road but Republicans too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in them. I\u2019m a very strong Republican and a conservative Republican, a very conservative Republican. I am somebody that gets things done. They don\u2019t get things done,\u201d Trump asserted. The brash businessman says that he\u2019s a fighter and that Republicans have to learn how to fight. \u201cI\u2019m all for getting things done, and competently getting things done. Right now we have a president who is grossly incompetent and we have to change things around,\u201d he added.\n\nMarlow asked Trump if it was time for a non-politician to become president. Trump recounted that he is in many ways very politically oriented. The real estate tycoon explained that he has been doing very well with politicians all over the world and in America for twenty-five years.\n\nTrump referenced his very public political battles with politicians in NYC, noting that \u201cpeople say that if you can get a zoning law changed in New York, you can get anything.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten more zone changes in New York than anybody. I built a city on the Westside of Manhattan.\u201d\n\nTrump asserted that if he runs for president in 2016 his theme would be: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d In order to achieve that goal the first priority for Trump is to get rid of Obamacare. \u201cWe have to repeal and replace it with something far better and far less expensive,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan includes \u201cfreeing up the borders\u201d of Obamacare, so that you can buy insurance from any company in the United States and not be restricted to buying only from regional companies. \u201cThe insurance companies are making a fortune with Obamacare and it is outrageous,\u201d he stated. Breitbart\u2019s Executive Chairman agreed, pointing out the surge in insurance company stock prices. \u201cThat\u2019s because the government mitigates their risks and they get all the upside,\u201d explained Bannon.\n\n\u201cThey are making a fortune and it\u2019s a joke. You should bring it back to free enterprise and you would see much better health care,\u201d Trump said. He added that the deductibles are now so high that you pay for everything anyway and you never really use your health plan.\n\nNext on his agenda, the purveyor of Celebrity Apprentice said that he would put an end to \u201cthese foreign countries from just ripping us with the deals they are making. They make deals with us that are so good they just laugh.\u201d\n\nBannon asked Trump how he would change things. \u201cFirst I would let China know that it is over. There is no more free ride,\u201d said Trump. Bannon chimed in, \u201cYou\u2019re saying no more free ride in Africa? No more free ride in Latin America?\u201d Trump answered that China is benefiting from all these countries\u2019 natural resources without lending a hand to fighting terrorism or dealing with disease control.\n\n\u201cDo you ever see Chinese soldiers trying to stop ISIS?\u201d he asked. \u201cChina\u2019s all over the place but don\u2019t want to go near the people with the Ebola, because they don\u2019t want to be infected. Yet we are sending thousands of soldiers over there helping them.\u201d\n\nTrumps says that China, along with other countries, is doing another thing that is hurting America\u2019s economy and getting away with it: devaluing their currency \u201cto a point that no one thought would be possible and get away with it.\u201d The devaluation makes US exports far less competitive with Chinese products.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t play by the same rules that we do,\u201d he told the Breitbart team. America won\u2019t be doing business with China in a Trump administration unless they drastically change their ways, he maintained.\n\nMoreover, Trump stated confidently that he thinks that he would do a \u201cfantastic job\u201d as Commander-in-Chief. \u201cI would bring this country back to the highest level it has ever been. And I think I would make America great again.\u201d\n\nMarlow asked Trump what qualities he has that distinguishes him from the other candidates speaking at the Summit. He explained that he would be able to create jobs because, \u201cThat\u2019s what I do. I have thousands of people working for me.\u201d He added that he has had \u201cthousands of successes\u2026 The nice part is that I can self-fund my campaign\u2026 I would just use my own money. It is much easier.\u201d\n\nIn evaluating why Mitt Romney lost to Obama in 2012, Trump stated, \u201cHe choked. He choked. He failed to be a candidate in the last month. He had it won. You know a lot of people don\u2019t know how to win. He couldn\u2019t close. Like I said in my speech he is like a deal maker who can\u2019t close a deal. By the way most people are like that, just so he doesn\u2019t feel too bad.\u201d\n\nTrump says that the reason he is willing to put himself through the grueling process of running for president is because \u201cI want to make this country great again. And I don\u2019t think anyone else will be able to do it but me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patriot, entrepreneur, American Donald Trump told Breitbart News Sunday that \u201cI can make this country great again.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Patriot, entrepreneur, American Donald Trump told Breitbart News Sunday that \u201cI can make this country great again.\u201d", "title": "Donald Trump: \u201cI Can Make America Great Again\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Donald-Trumpbf4ef4d4981.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-01-26T08:13:57-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/26/donald-trump-i-can-make-america-great-again/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patriot, entrepreneur, American Donald Trump told Breitbart News Sunday that \u201cI can make this country great again.\u201d", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Donald-Trumpbf4ef4d4981.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump: \u201cI Can Make America Great Again\u201d", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump, Iowa Freedom Summit,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Donald Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-26T03:45:32-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-01-26T08:13:57-07:00", "tag": "Iowa Freedom Summit", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "And I think I would make America great again.\u201dMarlow asked Trump what qualities he has that distinguishes him from the other candidates speaking at the Summit.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI can make America great again,\u201d entrepreneur and television host Donald Trump told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview broadcast on SiriusXM Patriot Sunday.\nAmerica won\u2019t be doing business with China in a Trump administration unless they drastically change their ways, he maintained.\nI built a city on the Westside of Manhattan.\u201dTrump asserted that if he runs for president in 2016 his theme would be: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d In order to achieve that goal the first priority for Trump is to get rid of Obamacare.\nNo more free ride in Latin America?\u201d Trump answered that China is benefiting from all these countries\u2019 natural resources without lending a hand to fighting terrorism or dealing with disease control."}
