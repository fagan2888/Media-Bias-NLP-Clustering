There are still many changes they can still make.\"\n\nReeder and his team had no special access to the back-end of HealthCare.gov, where most of the functionality problems exist. All of these mistakes are visible from the end, Reeder emphasized, which raises questions about the structure of rest of the site.\n\nThe Obama administration official in charge of overseeing the site, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Director Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, testified at a congressional hearing earlier this month that HealthCare.gov would be \"fully functioning\" by the end of the month.\n\nBut Obama, himself, appeared to lower expectations on Thursday when he discussed the issue with reporters.\n\n\"The website will work much better on November 30th, December 1st, than it worked certainly on October 1st,\" he said before quickly acknowledging, \"That's a pretty low bar.\"\n\n\"The majority of people who go to the website will see a website that is working the way it's supposed to,\" he continued. \"I think it is not possible for me to guarantee that 100 percent of the people 100 percent of the time going on this website will have a perfectly seamless, smooth experience. We're going to have to continue to improve it even after November 30th, December 1st.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The front end of Healthcare.gov is working better, but many problems identified in the days after its launch persist, engineers who analyzed the site say", "pubdate": "2013-11-15T20:14:15Z", "author": "By Adam Aigner-Treworgy, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The front end of Healthcare.gov is working better, but many problems identified in the days after its launch persist, engineers who analyzed the site say", "pubdate": "2013-11-15T20:14:15Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/15/politics/obamacare-engineers/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131114220738-obama-obamacare-sullen-gi-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131114220738-obama-obamacare-sullen-gi-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/15/politics/obamacare-engineers/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Engineers: HealthCare.gov better, but initial problems persist - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2013-11-15T20:14:15Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd57f1\"", "article_summary": "07:56JUST WATCHED AHIP 'concerned' over Obamacare fix Replay More Videos ...
