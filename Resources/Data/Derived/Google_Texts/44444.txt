In another astonishing embarrassment to the traditions and magnificent history of the United States Navy, politicians and admirals (indistinguishable these days) have allowed two Russian Su-24's to rip past one of our destroyers in the Baltic Sea on Monday.

The USS Donald Cook (DDG-75) was conducting flight operations with a Polish helicopter when the two Russian jets approached at aggressive speeds and buzzed the Navy destroyer as the helicopter was taking off from the destroyerâ€™s flight deck, the defense official told Fox News.

On Sunday, Russian jets came within 1,000 yards of the destroyer, flying just 100 feet off the ground, a defense official said. The next day, a Russian jet came within just 30 feet of the destroyer.

This is strategic failure of catastrophic proportions in regards to the United States Navy's bearing on the rest of the world. After tremendous and cunning victories throughout World War II, we were seen as the undisputed champions of our global oceans and now we are now giving that hard-earned title away for free. Politicians and the admirals they control are to blame in this, not cherished as we so commonly do.

Do not forget when Iran captured 10 U.S. sailors and flew UAV's and rockets over an aircraft carrier and destroyer in the Persian Gulf just two months ago. What was the response? Nothing. What will the response to Russia's actions be? Nothing.

Meanwhile in Washington. D.C.
