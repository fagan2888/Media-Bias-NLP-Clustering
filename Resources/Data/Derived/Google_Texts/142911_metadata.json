That work had nothing to do with the Nevada Republican caucuses, which were just hours away, and which Donald Trump handily won, besting his closest rivals, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, by a double-digit margin. Ad Policy\n\nInstead, it was just another day of work for the Nevada state director of the Libre Initiative, a group funded by the conservative donor network run by Charles and David Koch. Najarro had wrapped up his morning radio talk show, a 15-minute segment that runs Tuesdays through Fridays on KENO 1460AM, a Spanish-language sports station in Vegas. Najarro\u2019s show is called Generaci\u00f3n Libre, or \u201cFree Generation,\u201d and is inspired by the name of his parent organization.\n\n\u201cWe talk about our plans, our events, our activities,\u201d which include an upcoming concert starring the Latino Christian singers Karina Moreno and Hermanos Medina, and a driver\u2019s licenses exam workshop set for March. \u201cBut then we also talk about issues.\u201d That usually means conversations about property rights, rule of law, but first and foremost, free enterprise. And that, in a nutshell, is how the savvy and rapidly growing Libre Initiative operates. The group is playing the long game, which is why it\u2019s sitting out the 2016 presidential primaries.\n\nLike any good organizing campaign, though, the group regularly heads out on weekends to knock on doors and chat with Latinos about the ills of government regulation. They hit up 1,000 homes in both February and January, Najarro says. And like any decent community-services organization, they also offer the kinds of services Latinos need and crave. The New Mexico office of Libre runs English classes. Libre hosts back-to-school nights, health checkups, financial planning, and GED completion courses. Najarro is preparing for Libre\u2019s seventh driver\u2019s license\u2013exam workshop, called Pasa la Prueba, or Pass the Test. The exam-prep courses are so successful and so accessible (they\u2019re not just conducted in Spanish, they\u2019re also free) that Libre\u2019s become well-known for them; they draw hundreds of Latinos at a time to a swap meet in Vegas.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Libre_Initiative_otu_img-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Julianne Hing", "description": "On Tuesday afternoon, Ronnie Najarro sat in the converted four-bedroom home in Las Vegas that serves as his office, working on the future of the conservative Latino movement.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "On Tuesday afternoon, Ronnie Najarro sat in the converted four-bedroom home in Las Vegas that serves as his office, working on the future of the conservative Latino movement.", "title": "A Glimpse Inside the Operation to Nurture Conservative Latinos", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/a-glimpse-inside-the-operation-to-nurture-conservative-latinos/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Libre_Initiative_otu_img.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 907}, "updated_time": "2016-02-24T14:43:30+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Tuesday afternoon, Ronnie Najarro sat in the converted four-bedroom home in Las Vegas that serves as his office, working on the future of the conservative Latino movement.", "title": "A Glimpse Inside the Operation to Nurture Conservative Latinos", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/a-glimpse-inside-the-operation-to-nurture-conservative-latinos/", "image": {"height": 907, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Libre_Initiative_otu_img.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Libre_Initiative_otu_img-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1440}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "February 24th, 2016", "sailthru.title": "A Glimpse Inside the Operation to Nurture Conservative Latinos", "keywords": "election 2016, immigration policy, politics, republicans, the right, donald trump, latinos, presidential primary", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 203942, "sailthru.tags": "Election 2016,Immigration Policy,Politics,Republicans,The Right,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "presidential primary", "published_time": "2016-02-24T12:46:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-24T14:43:30+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/julianne_hing/"}, "sailthru.description": "Yes, Donald Trump won a surprising number of Latino votes in Nevada.
