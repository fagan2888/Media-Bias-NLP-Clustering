That has not happened.\"\n\n\n\nRead MoreGrant: Central bank mispricing is backdrop to selloff\n\n\n\nEl-Erian told CNBC on Sunday that what markets needed to stabilize was positive economic news or announcements of further stimulus\u2014not from the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank, but the emerging world.\n\nAbsent those developments, emerging market economies will find it difficult to pull themselves out of a hole as commodity prices continue to tumble.\n\nThe short-term problem is the lack of that an emerging market circuit breaker, or policy intervention tool, he said Monday. But the long-term issue is lack of economic growth.\n\nNow, the slowdown in emerging markets and currency complex implosion is transmitting contagion to wider markets, he said.\n\nThat said, value has already been created in some pockets of the market, he said. One of those spaces is the currency market.\n\n\"There's been tremendous overshoot, particularly in emerging market currencies,\" he said. \"So if you have the stomach for enormous volatility, there's already value there, but if you are a beta investor as a whole, then you have to wait a little bit.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Mohamed El-Erian said Monday stocks must fall much further before investors can be coaxed back into the market.", "author": "Tom DiChristopher", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Mohamed El-Erian said Monday stocks must fall much further before investors can be coaxed back into the market.", "title": "El-Erian: Stocks have a lot lower to go from here", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/el-erian-stocks-have-a-lot-lower-to-go-from-here.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/10/15/102090600-492847037.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mohamed El-Erian said Monday stocks must fall much further before investors can be coaxed back into the market.", "title": "El-Erian: Stocks have a lot lower to go from here", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/el-erian-stocks-have-a-lot-lower-to-go-from-here.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/10/15/102090600-492847037.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@tdichristopher", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "U.S. Markets, Markets, Market Outlook, Central Banks, U.S. Markets, Investing, Wall Street, Squawk Box U.S., Mohamed El-Erian, European Central Bank, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-08-24T08:39:09-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "U.S. Markets", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T09:28:05-0400", "tag": "European Central Bank"}, "pageNodeId": 102941676, "news_keywords": "stock market selloff, mohamed el-erian, lower to go, central banks"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5cdb\"", "article_summary": "There has been this enormous faith in central banks, and that faith in central banks means we have borrowed returns and growth from the future, hoping that central banks will be able to hand off to higher growth.\nThe short-term problem is the lack of that an emerging market circuit breaker, or policy intervention tool, he said Monday.\nNow, the slowdown in emerging markets and currency complex implosion is transmitting contagion to wider markets, he said.\nAbsent those developments, emerging market economies will find it difficult to pull themselves out of a hole as commodity prices continue to tumble.\n\"There's been tremendous overshoot, particularly in emerging market currencies,\" he said."}
