Bush, requested a federal investigation into DC Health Link in a Nov. 13 letter to the Office of Special Counsel\u2019s Carolyn Lerner.\n\nPainter says DC Health Link appears to be subject to the Hatch Act, which limits political activity by federal employees, because the health exchange was created by the D.C. government and is acting on its behalf. He noted that the exchange may have violated the Hatch Act after it promoted OFA\u2019s pro-Obamacare activism on Twitter.\n\nPainter said DC Health Link may have also violated the Hatch Act by \u201cfollowing\u201d OFA\u2019s D.C. twitter account and retweeting one of its messages on Nov. 8.\n\nThe Office of Special Counsel determined that federal agencies cannot \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d political parties, partisan political campaigns or partisan political groups on social media platforms. Agencies are also restricted to posting content that is related to official business and politically neutral.\n\n\u201cThe communications that I believe violated the Hatch Act were made on Twitter and all relate to Organizing for Action (\u201cOFA\u201d), formerly known as Organizing for America, an organization the [Office of Special Counsel] has specifically identified as a \u2018partisan political group,\u2019\u201d wrote Painter.\n\nOn Nov. 5, DC Health Link\u2019s Twitter handle wrote, \u201cOur friends at @OFA_DC are looking to hear your experience with #Obamacare. Share your feedback with them at [link].\u201d The link directed users to my.barackobama.com, the official OFA website.\n\nOFA describes itself as a nonpartisan organization. It previously operated as an arm of the Obama campaign under the name Organizing for America, which was deemed a partisan political group by the Office of Special Counsel.\n\nPresident Obama will join an OFA call Monday night to discuss Obamacare, which has been plagued with problems during its rollout", "article_metadata": {"description": "Online communications with OFA allegedly violated Hatch Act", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A former chief White House ethics lawyer has filed a Hatch Act complaint against a D.C.-based health care exchange, alleging that its online communications with liberal activist group Organizing for A", "title": "D.C.-Based Health Care Exchange May Have Engaged in Illegal Political Activity", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/d-c-based-health-care-exchange-may-have-engaged-in-illegal-political-activity/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DCHealthLinklogo-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A former chief White House ethics lawyer has filed a Hatch Act complaint against a D.C.-based health", "creator": "@alanagoodman", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DCHealthLinklogo-150x150.jpg", "title": "D.C.-Based Health Care Exchange May Have Engaged in Illegal Political Activity", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2890\"", "article_summary": "The Office of Special Counsel determined that federal agencies cannot \u201cfriend,\u201d \u201clike,\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d political parties, partisan political campaigns or partisan political groups on social media platforms.\nOn Nov. 5, DC Health Link\u2019s Twitter handle wrote, \u201cOur friends at @OFA_DC are looking to hear your experience with #Obamacare.\nPainter says DC Health Link appears to be subject to the Hatch Act, which limits political activity by federal employees, because the health exchange was created by the D.C. government and is acting on its behalf.\nHe noted that the exchange may have violated the Hatch Act after it promoted OFA\u2019s pro-Obamacare activism on Twitter.\nPainter said DC Health Link may have also violated the Hatch Act by \u201cfollowing\u201d OFA\u2019s D.C. twitter account and retweeting one of its messages on Nov. 8."}
