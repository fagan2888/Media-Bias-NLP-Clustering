Students who attended schools following a four-day week schedule had improved test scores, specifically in math, according to a report published by the Association for Education Finance and Policy.\n\nResearchers Mary Beth Walker of Georgia State University and D. Mark Anderson of Montana State University compared the reading and math scores of students in fourth and fifth grade between those who attended school for five days a week versus those who attended for four.\n\nThe researchers found that the students with shorter school weeks had better math scores. Reading scores were not affected.\n\nWalker said the findings were the opposite of what she expected.\n\n\u201cWe thought that especially for the younger, elementary school kids, longer days on a shorter school week would hurt their academic performance because their attention spans are shorter,\u201d Walker said in a statement. \u201cAlso, a longer weekend would give them more opportunity to forget what they had learned.\u201d\n\nColorado, where the study took place, is among a handful of states containing rural school districts that have had a four-day week schedule for years to save money through reduced overhead and transportation costs.\n\nWalker said the study suggests there is little evidence that school districts looking to cut cost through a shorter week negatively impacts student performance.\n\nShe underlined a handful of explanations, including lower student and teacher absenteeism and the longer days providing teachers with the opportunity to use different instructional processes.\n\n\u201cMy own personal hypothesis is teachers liked it so much\u2014they were so enthusiastic about the four-day week\u2014they did a better job,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThere\u2019s some evidence in other labor studies that four-day work weeks enhance productivity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A recent study found that students with a four-day school week had improved test scores in math.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A recent study found that students with a four-day school week had improved test scores in math.", "title": "Report: Shorter School Week Improves Academic Performance", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150915_FourDaySchool_Johnson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gp22FL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A recent study found that students with a four-day school week had improved test scores in math.", "title": "Report: Shorter School Week Improves Academic Performance", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150915_FourDaySchool_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-09-16T13:48:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Four-day school week, education reform, Mary Beth Walker, D.
