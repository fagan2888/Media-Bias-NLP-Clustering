Robert Bentley, who said he would not sign it tonight.\n\nThe House passed the budget by a vote of 70-21.\n\nThe Senate had passed it earlier tonight by a vote of 23-9.\n\nBoth chambers voted to end the special session tonight.\n\nLawmakers approved about $166 million in new revenue for the General Fund, covering most of a projected $200 million shortfall.\n\nThey voted to raise the cigarette tax by 25 cents a pack, generating an estimated $70 million a year, and to move $80 million in use tax revenue from the Education Trust Fund to the General Fund.\n\nNew taxes on pharmacies and nursing homes would generate a total of about $16 million a year for Medicaid.\n\nSen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, the Senate budget chairman, said the budget would protect critical state services for the elderly, children, the mentally ill and Medicaid recipients.\n\nIt would also provide level-funding for the state court system and for prisons, plus additional money needed for reforms intended to reduce prison crowding.\n\n\"All those services being level-funded was a great achievement, I think, by the Legislature, to get that done,\" Orr said.\n\nOther agencies were generally cut by about 5.5 percent, although that varied, Orr said.\n\nThe budget would spend $1.76 billion from the General Fund, a reduction of about $83 million, or 4.5 percent from this year.\n\nOrr said the plan was a \"much, much better\" than a spending plan that passed during the regular session in June, which Bentley vetoed, and one that failed to pass in the first special session in August.\n\nThose budgets, without new revenue, would have slashed spending by about $200 million.\n\nMany Democrats criticized the Republican-led budget plan, saying that it falls short of the reforms needed to fund state services in the long run.\n\n\"We'll be back here next year with the same problem,\" Rep. John Rogers, D-Birmingham, said. \"We haven't done anything to stop the real bleeding.\"\n\nMost Democrats opposed the tax increases and plan to move money from education that closed much of the budget shortfall.\n\nThey have pushed unsuccessfully for a vote on a state lottery and for the governor to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The Republicans had three options: Cut services, raise taxes or raid the Education Trust Fund,\" said Rep. Craig Ford, D-Gadsden, the House minority leader. \"Somehow or another they did all three in one special session.\"\n\nOther bills are expected to partly offset the transfer of $80 million in use tax revenue from the ETF to the General Fund.\n\nThe Legislature also approved changes to the education budget Rolling Reserve Act that are expected to free up more money for classrooms.\n\nRepublicans said the use tax transfer, which is permanent, would also be an important reform because it provides a growing revenue source for the often stagnant General Fund.\n\nOrr said a misunderstanding over what constituted level funding for the Alabama Medicaid Agency required some last-minute adjustments today.\n\nThe Senate took about a three-hour recess to revise the budget, adding $16 million to Medicaid from money that was taken from other agencies.\n\nOrr said the money was needed, in part, to enable primary care doctors who see Medicaid patients to continue to receive reimbursement at the higher levels paid by Medicare.\n\nOtherwise, those payments to doctors would have dropped substantially to the Medicaid levels on Oct. 1, likely reducing the number of physicians who treat Medicaid patients and reducing access to care, Orr said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Arthur Orr, Robert J.
