Small businesses and Affordable Care Sage Holdings Group finds ACA didn't hurt bottom line as much as feared

Owner Vincent Salvia at Rochester-Hills based Sage Holdings Group Ltd., which does business as Generations Home Care Group, feared the Affordable Care Act would have a major impact on profitability.



That hasn't come to pass, but that doesn't mean Salvia or his top brass are happy with the new way of doing things.



He had been looking through financial statements since 2013, trying to predict outcomes.



"At the highest insurance projection, there was agony and stress," said Salvia. "I thought, why even stay in business if I have to give all of my money away?"



Generations has 110 employees and is expected to reach $4.3 million in revenue this year. Its revenue last year was $3.5 million.



Companies with 100 or more full-time workers, defined as employees who work more than 30 hours per week, had to comply this year or face financial penalties of at least $2,000 and up to $3,000 per worker.



"The penalty was crazy," said Salvia.



Businesses with 50-99 employees also will be required to offer health care insurance to workers in 2016.



Salvia contemplated selling divisions of his company to keep his employee count at 50 people per division.
