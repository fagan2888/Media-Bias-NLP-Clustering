Burwell, the Affordable Care Act case, and Obergefell v. Hodges, the same-sex marriage case. But his dissenting opinions were probably quoted more often, and more extensively, than the majority opinions that laid down the law. Who, after all, could resist including Scalia\u2019s use of \u201cjiggery-pokery\u201d in a story about King, or otherwise focusing on Scalia\u2019s \u201czingers\u201d at the expense of the substance of the cases? Hardly anyone, apparently. Google \u201cjiggery-pokery,\u201d and you\u2019ll see what I mean.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Scalia\u2019s turns of phrase are, in Boston Globe columnist Dante Ramos\u2019s words, \u201cfun to read.\u201d As I read through Scalia\u2019s apoplectic dissenting opinion in Obergefell, I confess to smiling at the footnote in which he said he wouldn\u2019t join an opinion that began the way Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s majority ruling did without hiding his head in a bag. Guilty.\n\nBut why is a Scalia zinger entertaining? It\u2019s entertaining because it shocks. It\u2019s entertaining because you cannot quite believe that a Supreme Court justice would treat one of his colleagues with such profound disrespect. When you see it actually happen in black and white, it\u2019s astonishing. It\u2019s a bit like mud-wrestling: appalling, yet difficult to look away from.\n\nOr maybe not mud-wrestling so much as the judicial equivalent of pornography. Like porn, Scalia\u2019s zinger-laden opinions are titillating, but over time they coarsen the culture of which they are a part. Cultural critics lament the \u201cpornification\u201d of advertising, pop culture and other aspects of contemporary society. Legal observers should similarly lament the \u201cScaliafication\u201d of judicial opinions \u2014 especially dissenting opinions, which have a long and honorable history at the Supreme Court.\n\nOf course, dissenting justices have always sought to call attention to the errors supposedly committed by the majority with which they disagree. That, after all, is a dissenting opinion\u2019s purpose. But they rarely used to do so in the intensely personal, unnecessarily antagonistic terms that Scalia favors.\n\nIn the past, dissents made for good reading not when their insults were especially clever but when they put forth a particularly compelling legal argument, such as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.\u2019s famous dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States, in which he introduced to U.S. jurisprudence the notion that the First Amendment requires a robust marketplace of ideas. Or, as another example, Scalia\u2019s own brilliant, prescient and zinger-free dissent in Morrison v. Olson, written less than two years into his Supreme Court tenure, in which he both set out a compelling separation-of- powers argument and also predicted, with uncanny accuracy, how a law authorizing the creation of an independent prosecutor could go wrong. Now, though, as we approach the 30th anniversary of Scalia\u2019s joining the court, the unfortunate trend of justices following Scalia\u2019s lead by questioning not only their colleagues\u2019 legal reasoning but also their intelligence, legal abilities and commitment to basic democratic principles shows no sign of abating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike porn, zinger-laden Scalia dissents such as those in King and Obergefell are nasty and degrading. Moreover, Scalia\u2019s zingers add nothing of substance to his opinions; they are there to entertain, not to explain or enlighten. We should not treat them as harmless, \u201cfun to read\u201d guilty pleasures but as a truly unfortunate development in the history of an institution that once served as a model for how to disagree about important issues in a civil manner \u2014 something from which not only the legal and political worlds but also society as a whole, would benefit. We would do ourselves a favor by giving Scalia\u2019s clever, but pointless and ultimately harmful, zingers the attention they deserve: none.\n\nDavid Kravitz served as a law clerk for then-Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor from 1994 to 1995 and for then-U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Stephen Breyer from 1993 to 1994.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By David KravitzSpecial to The Washington Post.Justice Antonin Scalia ended up on the losing side of two of the biggest cases from the Supreme Court\u2019s just-concluded term: King v.
