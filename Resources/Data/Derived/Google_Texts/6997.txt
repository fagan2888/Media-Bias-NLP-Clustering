Dayton, Ohio-based CareSource Inc. recently signed a deal with Learfield Sports to become the first title sponsor of the Indiana University Radio Network.

The radio network, which is carried by dozens of stations statewide, will now be called the CareSource Radio Network.

“That’s the first of its kind for Indiana University,” said Steve Smitherman, president of Indiana operations for CareSource.

Officials for IU and Learfield, which has a deal with the school to broadcast its sporting events, were not available for comment.

The deal will begin with the radio broadcast of the IU men's basketball team season opener on Friday against Eastern Illinois.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but sports marketers estimated the value in the low to mid six-figure range annually.

IU is ranked in the top 15 nationally in several preseason polls.

CareSource is a health insurer that sells individual insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The company moved into Indiana last year and began an aggressive statewide marketing campaign. It is also launching a Medicare Advantage insurance plan for seniors this year in Indiana.

The IU Radio Network deal is “just another example of our commitment to the state of Indiana," Smitherman said.

The CareSource office in Indianapolis is growing and expects to have 40 employees by the end of the year.
