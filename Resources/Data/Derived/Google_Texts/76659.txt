Ed Schultz: Maybe Glenn Beck's Illness Will Make Him Rethink Obamacare

ED SCHULTZ: As Glenn Beck suffered excruciating pain, he had access, he had access. And he had opportunity to visit doctors and undergo rounds of testing, he was offered treatment and guidance. Glenn Beck found help, because he could afford it.



The Affordable Care Act, which Republicans hate, [gives] the American people an unprecedented opportunity for care. But Beck telling this story I think is powerful, because it brings us right to the crossroads where this country sits right now: How do you say no to your next-door neighbor because they have pre-existing condition, maybe like Glenn Beck has?



â€¦Iâ€™m curious about his motivations for sharing this illness with his viewers and the people that basically are followers of what the guy says and does. I hope that that his story motivates those that think that Obamacare is bad, that maybe they will rethink the situation.
