Over the weekend in Ferguson, Mo., an unarmed 18-year-old black man named Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. The incident is under investigation by the St. Louis County police department and reports indicate the FBI has opened a “civil rights investigation” of the shooting. Meanwhile, riots and angry protests have erupted for five consecutive days and nights in defense of Brown. As unrest grew, police used tear gas to dissolve crowds.
