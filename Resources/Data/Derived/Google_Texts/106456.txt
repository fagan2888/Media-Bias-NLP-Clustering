KALAMAZOO, Mich. (NEWSCHANNEL 3) - Western Michigan University says it will no longer offer health insurance for students.

This means some students may enter the new school year without coverage.

WMU says the students this affects will have options under the Affordable Care Act so they don't have to go the whole year without insurance.

Losing your current health coverage is considered a "qualifying life event" under the Affordable Care Act, meaning those students would qualify for a special enrollment period.

WMU says those affected have 60 days to sign up and it's important to remember there is a fine for not having health coverage in the U.S.
