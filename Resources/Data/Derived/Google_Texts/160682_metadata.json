Instead of working directly for the district where they are taking charge of classrooms, substitutes in Normandy work for a division of Kelly Services, a company that has provided temporary workers in other sectors for years. For the coming school year, Parkway will use Kelly as well.\n\nBesides relieving districts of the pressure of finding subs to fill last-minute absences, the outsourcing will also eliminate a limit on the number of hours that retired Missouri teachers, who make up a large contingent of substitutes, may return to work in the schools and still claim their full pension. Because they aren\u2019t working directly for a district any more, no restrictions apply. And there\u2019s no worry about running afoul of the health-care law\u2019s new mandates, either.\n\nStill, outsourcing substitute teachers won\u2019t solve all of a district\u2019s worries about making sure there is an adequate teacher in every classroom. Normandy has discovered that challenge when it comes to tough-to-fill positions, such as someone to take over a high school physics class, or even to take over for routine absences.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten as large a substitute pool from Kelly as we were told at the time that we made the switch,\u201d says Peter Kachris, who is the district\u2019s liaison with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. \u201cWe\u2019re still not getting the numbers, which was really the first issue.\u201d\n\nWhether the company\u2019s subs are really equipped to handle a classroom is another issue, but Scott Apsey of Kelly says they put prospective substitutes through what he terms a \u201cbehavioral interview\u201d to see how they would handle classroom situations.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for folks that are going to be calm under pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be able to work with the lesson plan that is delivered, and to basically maintain good classroom management skills.\n\n\u201cIt does take a fair amount of recruiting to find the right folks to place within a school district. One of the things that we don\u2019t want is to just kind of watch the class.\u201d\n\nSink the sub\n\nFrom Cheech and Chong\u2019s Sister Mary Elephant to Key and Peele\u2019s Mr. Garvey, the difficult dynamic between substitutes and students has been a subject of comedy that often rings true. Kids aren\u2019t kidding around when they play a game called \u201cSink the Sub.\u201d\n\nThat challenging atmosphere \u2014 coming in on short notice into a situation rife with potential pitfalls \u2014 is one of the areas where Apsey says Kelly can help, using its long-time experience in a different way.\n\n\u201cIn the traditional business, it\u2019s much more of a situation where you get a request from the customer, then you have time to search your existing database or go out and recruit for new folks,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThe substitute business is very fast-paced. The average assignment is a day to two days, so really it\u2019s more about having enough subs who are available to go to work to meet the demand of a school, versus placing an administrative assistant for the next three months. You have to have the pool in place, hired and ready to go, and then you have to deploy that pool based on the demand.\u201d\n\nPlus, Apsey said, because every state and every district has its own regulations and requirements, the sub market is a tough one. He said Kelly now serves 5,400 individual schools in 36 states, filling 2 million classroom assignments every year. In Missouri, it works with 23 districts. Normandy was the first in the St. Louis area.\n\nApsey added that an outside company like Kelly can bring business expertise plus a hometown perspective.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cOur kids are in the schools. We\u2019re connected, providing jobs in other elements of the community. We have all of those recruiting and networking elements associated with us, plus we take on the employer\u2019s costs. We are the employer of record.\u201d\n\nObamacare considerations\n\nThat last point is relevant because of new rules brought on by the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare. Besides the 550-hour annual limit for retired Missouri teachers who want to keep their full pension, the new federal health-care plan requires that companies provide health insurance for all employees who work at least 30 hours a week on average.\n\nThat was one of the factors discussed when Parkway voted last month to approve a one-year contract with Kelly to provide substitute teachers and nurses for the coming school year. The district noted that its current substitute program, handled in-house, requires covering 110 absences a day, with two full-time employees handling logistics, at a cost of more than $2.5 million a year.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s provisions would require the district to either offer health insurance to subs who average more than 30 hours a week or pay penalties that could total more than $4 million a year.\n\nWith more than 400 substitutes on its roster, Parkway officials said they could make changes that would comply with federal law, limit costs and probably restrict its sub pool. But that restructuring brings possible effects on student learning. The other option was for the district to outsource the substitute function. It received five proposals, narrowed it to two, then chose Kelly\u2019s plan to present to the board.\n\nThough the Kelly contract, for $2,893,000, was $58,000 higher than the projected costs for keeping the program in-house, the district said avoiding possible penalties and shedding the administrative and logistical responsibility for subs would be worth the money. The board agreed and approved the plan unanimously.\n\nNormandy\u2019s experience\n\nAt Normandy, Kachris said the second-semester experience with Kelly handling the substitute program hasn\u2019t always met expectations.\n\nJust as with regular teachers, he explained, some substitutes work out fine, some are clearly mismatched and some might get better with time and training.\n\n\u201cThere are some substitutes that come in and they may not be particularly effective at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you work with them, they may improve enough so you can say, I want to keep these people.\u201d\n\nThat situation can become particularly troubling, Kachris added, in a class like physics. A recent Post-Dispatch story that found students sleeping in their physics class prompted strong reaction. Kachris said that class was being handled by a substitute because that was all the district could find.\n\n\u201cThat teacher was viewed as working hard, improving. [She was] someone we felt was effective, given her capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was probably the best person we could have in there now to get us through the end of the year.\u201d\n\nThat situation, Kachris added, can be common when dealing with substitutes, particularly those on long-term assignments.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re working with someone that\u2019s in front of you,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019ve said, \u2018I\u2019ve had this person for six weeks and they\u2019ve improved.\u2019 They\u2019ve got a relationship with the kids. The judgment that was made was that she has improved a lot. Physics is difficult to fill in any case. And they were satisfied. The judgment was made that she was effective and working hard.\u201d\n\nSo districts are happy to find subs like Little, the retired educator who has stepped in to handle elementary and middle school classes in Parkway. He said he likes to keep his hand in education and use his experience. Besides, subbing keeps him occupied in the winter months, when he can\u2019t enjoy his other passion.\n\n\u201cWhen it's cold,\u201d he said, \u201cyou can't play golf.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "_delete1", "description": "Lloyd Little spent more than three decades in public education in outstate Missouri, so he knows how difficult the job of a substitute teacher can be.
