Riley England, an 8-year-old with epilepsy who was left unable to speak following seizures that started when he was 18 months old, was enjoying a night out with his family at the Stag-N-Doe pizza restaurant in China Grove, N.C., when the group was approached by their waitress.

The restaurant employee was carrying a note and told the England family, "I'll try to do this without crying." She explained that another customer decided to pay their bill and even left a note that read “God only gives special children to special people."

Ashley, Riley’s mother, admits that her son became “a little rowdy” while they were sitting down for dinner. She also said his uncontrollable outbursts are a result of him not being able to speak and that he is subject to constant judgment wherever they go.

"The past few weeks have been very hard and trying for us - especially with public outings,” Ashley told WBTV. “Riley was getting loud and hitting the table and I know it was aggravating to some people."

One customer was undeterred by Riley’s outbursts and was even touched by the parenting skills needed to care for a special needs child. The mystery diner decided to anonymously pay for the family’s entire dinner. The good deed brought Ashley to tears.

"To have someone do that small act towards us shows that some people absolutely understand what we are going through and how hard it is to face the public sometimes," Ashley told WBTV. "They made me cry, blessed me more than they know - I felt like out of all the rude negative comments that we are faced with - these outweighs them. The people who care!"
