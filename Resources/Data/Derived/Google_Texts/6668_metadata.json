So instead of answering the usual weekly question The Guy pauses to scan what sort of religious stuff provoked interest since December, 2012. That\u2019s when this blog began posting non-sectarian answers to anonymously posted questions on \u201cany old thing about any and all faith options,\u201d after a strategic boost from Terry Mattingly of the estimable www.getreligion.org.\n\nThe Guy, as a journalist, naturally wants current topics in the mix, and thus recently dealt with: new movies, the career of Chick-fil-A\u2019s pious founder Truett Cathy, the Supreme Court ruling on birth control under \u201cObamacare,\u201d suicide and the Robin Williams tragedy, religious conflict in Ukraine, and the disputes about tax exemption, civic prayers, legalized marijuana, and same-sex marriage.\n\nYet check the handy archives on the blog\u2019s home page and you\u2019ll see less timely topics predominate. A prime principle in education is that there\u2019s no such thing as a stupid question, and The Guy welcomes queries about basic information. Many others will have asked themselves the same thing. So The Guy examined Catholic intermarriage policy, whether military service is sinful, a deceptively simple query on \u201cwhat is faith?\u201d and this golden oldie: \u201cWhen does life begin?\u201d (the blog\u2019s very first question).\n\nReaders have wondered how to define \u201cmainline\u201d Protestants, and \u201cevangelical\u201d Protestants, and \u201cnew age\u201d religion. You\u2019ve asked why some ancient faiths died out while others survived. Why are so many U.S. churches in slow decline? What can be done about it? Where are the exceptions? More cosmically, are we seeing \u201ca seismic shift in religion worldwide\u201d?\n\nPredictably, we\u2019ve coped with many queries about Jesus or the Bible. Here\u2019s a good one: \u201cWhy are holy scriptures so complicated?\u201d Another: \u201cWhy do Christians ignore so many biblical laws?\u201d And another: \u201cWhich Bible version is the most authentic?\u201d And of course The Guy was asked about the latest twist in this tired old tale: \u201cWas Jesus married?\u201d\n\nReaders want to learn about prayer, hell, purgatory, heaven, who gets there, and whether heavenly \u201cnear-death\u201d experiences are valid. Concerning organizations, we\u2019ve treated Catholicism and the new pope along with aspects of the far less numerous Episcopalians, Quakers, Unitarians, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Jews, Jains, and Sikhs. Even Psychiana and Natural Hygiene came in for mention.\n\nThere\u2019s perpetual interest in Islam including its bloodthirsty factions (eight questions), in the Latter-day Saints a.k.a. Mormons (five questions), and in atheism (five questions). Boy, is there interest in atheism!\n\nContinue reading \"Religion stuff over the past 22 months\" by Richard Ostling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the 100th \u201cReligion Q and A\u201d posting.
