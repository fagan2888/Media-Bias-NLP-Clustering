Oh no! What to do? I guess the only thing for a rebuttal is a rebuttal to a rebuttal.\n\nWe compiled a list of the most awesome minarchist libertarians in history. We know that anarcho-capitalists like to claim these libertarian heroes as their own, but it seems that these people don\u2019t self-identify as such. We put together this list to show that it\u2019s pretty awesome to be a libertarian minarchist because it forms a cohesive philosophy and legal theory.\n\nLet these 8 awesome libertarians explain why the nightwatchman state is preferable to a dystopian \u201cMad Max-style\u201d anarchist state.\n\n#1. Ron Paul\n\nCongressman Ron Paul gave birth to a modern liberty movement full of vibrant ideas, energy, and young people dedicated to advancing constitutional, limited-government principles. The former congressman from Texas bold positions on constitutionalism and free markets made him a hero to millions across the country, and helped bring about the Tea Party movement which saw his son rise to power as a U.S. Senator and now a presidential candidate.\n\nWhen asked directly by Tom Woods if Dr. Paul was an anarchist, Paul said \u201cI haven\u2019t accepted the idea that tomorrow we can scratch it and have no government.\u201d Paul poo-poo\u2019d the idea of privatized police forces, arguing that \u201cit\u2019s a problem because the world isn\u2019t made up of perfect people.\u201d He went on to say that he believes that \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to the point where all problems can be solved without any government whatsoever, I think that competing police forces could become a problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "You thought libertarians were anarchists?
