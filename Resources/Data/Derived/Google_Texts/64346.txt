A fatal accident shut down parts of Interstate 35 Sunday night.

About 8:40 p.m., a woman heading down the I-35E service road between the President George Bush Turnpike and West Frankford Road drove through a grassy median, flipped over the concrete barricade and landed in the northbound lanes of the highway, Carrollton police said.

The driver was ejected and died at the scene.

Carrollton police shut down the on-ramps from eastbound and westbound President George Bush Turnpike.
