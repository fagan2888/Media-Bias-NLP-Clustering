PMV is a joint venture between Mexican petrochemicals consortium Mexichem and state oil firm Pemex.\n\nJavier Duarte, governor of the state of Veracruz, told CNN affiliate Televisa that the blast was felt about 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Emergency protocols were put in place, with surrounding municipalities evacuated and schools closed in others, officials said.\n\nA government Twitter account showed photos of plant workers being evacuated from the facility in a convoy.\n\nPemex said on its Twitter account that the fire had been brought under control by early Wednesday evening and that the plume of toxic smoke was dissipating quickly.\n\nVeracruz government spokesman Raul Gutierrez told CNN that emergency personnel were collaborating with Pemex to evaluate the extent of the damage from the explosion.\n\nIt's not clear what caused the blast.\n\nThe blast was only the latest of several incidents reported at facilities linked to the Mexican state oil company in recent years.\n\nIn 2013, at least 37 people were killed in a blast at Pemex's headquarters in Mexico City, and a year earlier, dozens were killed in a fire at a Pemex gas facility in the state of Tamaulipas.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Tim Hume, Karina Maciel and Fidel Gutierrez CNN", "og": {"site_name": "OURQUADCITIES", "title": "Death toll rises in Mexican chemical plant blast", "url": "http://www.ourquadcities.com/news/death-toll-rises-in-mexican-chemical-plant-blast", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/04/23/Mexico-Flag-jpg_8247883_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 979124188767212}, "google-site-verification": "2vs6Ae0GE_bJ_zIUevxlSajPbKw-4X51OdF6nvVhpuQ", "keywords": "News", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2016-04-23T21:42:24+0000", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T21:42:24+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The blast was only the latest of several incidents reported at facilities linked to the Mexican state oil company in recent years.\nThree days after a huge explosion at a Mexican petrochemical plant, the death toll stands at 28, officials said.\nJavier Duarte, governor of the state of Veracruz, told CNN affiliate Televisa that the blast was felt about 10 kilometers (six miles) away.\nA government Twitter account showed photos of plant workers being evacuated from the facility in a convoy.\nPMV is a joint venture between Mexican petrochemicals consortium Mexichem and state oil firm Pemex."}
