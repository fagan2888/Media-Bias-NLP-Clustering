A video of one of the fights was posted to social media and has since been shared on Facebook more than 700 times.\n\nPolice said multiple people were assaulted, including students and two or three teachers trying to break up the fight.\n\nPolice arrested a total of five juvenile suspects in connection to the incidents. A 16-year-old was arrested on a felony aggravated assault and battery complaint, after being caught on camera kicking the unconscious victim in the face while on the ground.\n\nA second suspect was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery, after being caught on camera knocking out the victim with one punch. A third juvenile suspect was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery, for assaulting a coach/teacher.\n\nTwo juveniles, both 17 years old, were arrested on a felony charge of threatening an act of violence. One of them reportedly made verbal threats at a teacher with specific violent acts, and the other one made threats on his social media account against the school and teachers after going to the OKCPD Administration Building.\n\nAll of the suspects will be transported to the Juvenile Detention Center (Berryhouse) and booked in.\n\nPolice believe the incidents are gang-related. They are presenting charges to the District Attorney, and the juvenile suspects could be charged as adults.\n\n#MORE: @okcpd have additional law enforcement at Capitol Hill HS today in response to fight caught on camera @NEWS9 pic.twitter.com/ALAwQwpRD4 \u2014 Justin Dougherty (@DoughertyNews9) January 13, 2016\n\nNews 9 reporter Justin Dougherty said there is an increased police presence at the school.\n\nRIGHT NOW: @okcpd cars outside of Capitol Hill HS.
