But try not to follow its example.\n\nAlthough the fate of federal legislation impacting a number of tax laws remains uncertain, it\u2019s still beneficial for taxpayers to approach year-end tax strategies as a proactive opportunity to save money.\n\n\u201cTax laws are merely a series of incentives,\u201d says Tom Wheelwright, CEO of the Tempe, Arizona-based tax firm ProVision and author of \u201cTax Free Wealth.\u201d \u201cWhether it\u2019s for your retirement or education, it\u2019s essential to look at taxes as financial incentives.\u201d\n\nNo matter your financial priorities, with several weeks to go before 2014 calendars head for the recycling bin, give some thought to these savvy tax strategies.\n\nWatch the 'extenders bill'\n\nWhen 2013 came to a close, so too did a host of tax laws that mattered to millions of taxpayers, including:\n\n\u2022 Deduction of mortgage insurance premiums\n\n\u2022 \u201cAbove the line\u201d deduction for higher education costs (meaning expenses up to $4,000 could be deducted before gross income was calculated for tax purposes)\n\n\u2022 Tax-free distributions from individual retirement plans for charitable purposes. This applies to people subject to required minimum distribution rules \u2014 see below.\n\nThese and other tax measures \u2014 more than 50 in all \u2014 are part of a \u201ctax extenders\u201d package that may or may not be considered by the lame duck Congress before the end of the year, leaving taxpayers in a state of limbo.\n\n\u201cAs of now, we don\u2019t know for sure what the tax laws are going to be,\u201d says Joseph Anthony, a Portland, Oregon, enrolled agent and tax preparer.\n\nSo, keep an eye on the so-called extender\u2019s bill as the calendar slides toward 2015, and stay in touch with a tax pro to know just how to approach overall tax planning.\n\nRetirement savings\n\nSome elements of tax planning always make sense, no matter the political climate. One of those is taking time to review retirement plan contributions for the year. Contribution limits for 2014 are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Traditional and Roth IRA \u2014 $5,500\n\n\u2022 401K, 403b and simplified employee pension \u2014 $17,500\n\n\u2022 Simple IRA \u2014 $12,000\n\nWhether you can deduct any or all of your contributions to a retirement account depends on the specific plan (check with a tax pro or consult the Internal Revenue website at http://www.irs.gov.) And, as Dallas CPA Wray Rives adds, people over 50 may be allowed even higher contribution levels under IRS \u201ccatch up\u201d provisions.\n\nCapital gains\n\nCapital gains \u2014 taxes that apply to profits from the sale of an investment, such as stock or real estate \u2014 may seem a rather pleasant problem to deal with. But those with gross annual income in excess of $200,000 \u2014 would do well to mitigate those gains. Rives points out that 2013 was the first year of an \u201cincome excise tax\u201d \u2014 a 3.8 percent tax on certain forms of investment income.\n\n\u201cWhile capital gains are generally taxed at a lower tax rate than ordinary income, some of that lower rate is lost to the investment income tax,\u201d says Rives.\n\nOne effective strategy is to time capital losses to help offset any capital gains \u2014 sell off investments that have lost money to counter the tax effects of profitable investments. \u201cYou can even consider writing off any worthless securities you still own,\u201d adds Rives.\n\nBut don\u2019t let tax considerations dictate investment strategy. Only sell off losing investments if they don\u2019t seem worth holding onto from an investment standpoint. \u201cSell it if you really feel that it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d cautions Wheelwright.\n\nCharitable giving\n\nFor many taxpayers, charitable giving remains fairly clear cut as 2014 winds down. One rule of thumb is simple \u2014 high income earners should look to charitable giving before year\u2019s end to reduce their overall tax burden. \u201cIf you had a good year so far as income, it\u2019s a good year to give to charity,\u201d says Anthony.\n\nCapital gains can also prove advantageous to charitable giving. Consider donating stocks and other investments that have increased in value in lieu of cash. That not only avoids capital gains tax, but the full donation can be deducted from taxable income. \u201cAnd, if you like, you can just turn around and buy the stock again,\u201d Wheelwright says.\n\nAnother charitable giving option exists for older people. Prior to the expiration of tax laws included in the extenders bill, people 70.5 years and older could make tax-free charitable contributions directly from their IRAs. The deal was sweet \u2014 not only were charitable withdrawals tax-free (unlike conventional withdrawals), they fulfilled the requirement that those who qualify begin making annual withdrawals from their retirement accounts.\n\nNo matter what happens on the legislative front, Anthony suggests that older taxpayers who want to use their IRA withdrawals as a vehicle for charitable giving still do so. If Congress reinstates the tax-free donation provision, they\u2019re in the clear, tax-wise. And, if nothing happens, they\u2019ll owe taxes on the distribution \u2014 something that, since they\u2019re bound by law to begin making retirement account withdrawals, would have occurred anyway \u2014 and they'll be able to take an itemized deduction for the value of their gift.\n\nOther steps to consider\n\nA few other year-end tax-related dos and don'ts:\n\n\u2022 Pay your January mortgage before the first of the year and get an extra month\u2019s mortgage interest deduction.\n\n\u2022 Take advantage of workplace flexible spending accounts. These let you set aside pretax dollars for qualified health care or dependent care expenses. Putting money in by Dec. 31 saves on current year taxes and sets you up to meet next year\u2019s bills. Also, if you have funds that you stand to forfeit once the new year arrives (the \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d provision), try to spend that money on some form of appropriate health care cost.\n\n\u2022 Organize any relevant paperwork if you purchased health insurance through a healthcare exchange under the Affordable Health Care Act. You\u2019ll have additional reporting in your 2014 return to reconcile your income to the projections you used when signing up for coverage.\n\nJeff Wuorio lives in southern Maine where he covers personal finance and entrepreneurship.
