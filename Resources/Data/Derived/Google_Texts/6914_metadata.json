It can take longer to receive a text message because someone must enter the text, the message then goes through the system, and the telecommunicator must read the text and then text back. Picking up the phone and calling 9-1-1 is still the most efficient way to reach emergency help. Texting is not always instantaneous, which is critical during a life-threatening emergency.\n\n\u2022 Providing location information and nature of the emergency in the first text message is imperative since emergency communicators will not be able to access the cell phone location or speak with the person who is sending the text. Text abbreviations or slang should never be used so that the intent of the dialogue can be as clear as possible.\n\n\u2022 Customers must be in range of cell towers in Durham County. If customers are outside or near the edge of the county, the message may not reach the Durham Emergency Communications Center.\n\n\u2022 Texts sent to 911 have the same 160 character limit as other text messages.\n\n\u2022 AT&T wireless customers must have mobile phones that are capable of sending text messages. Any text message to 911 will count either against their messaging plan or be charged in accordance with their wireless plans.\n\n\u2022 The texting function should only be used for emergency situations that require an immediate response from police, fire, or emergency medical services. Non-emergency issues should still be communicated to the Durham Emergency Communication Center by calling its non-emergency line at (919) 560-4600.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-03-13 16:32:00", "description": "AT&T wireless customers in Durham can now text emergency operators for help.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-03-13 16:34:38", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13477021|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "AT&T wireless customers in Durham can now text emergency operators for help.", "title": "911 now a text away for Durham AT&T customers :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/911-now-a-text-away-for-durham-at-t-customers/13477021/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/state/2009/06/19/5399126/5399127-1394742732-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-13T16:32:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "AT&T wireless customers in Durham can now text emergency operators for help.", "title": "911 now a text away for Durham AT&T customers :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/911-now-a-text-away-for-durham-at-t-customers/13477021/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/state/2009/06/19/5399126/5399127-1394742732-400x300.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8184\"", "article_summary": "The technology is made possible by Intrado, an emergency communications technology provider that installed next-generation 911 software allowing Durham residents to send texts to the Durham Emergency Communications Center.\nIt can take longer to receive a text message because someone must enter the text, the message then goes through the system, and the telecommunicator must read the text and then text back.\nYou must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters\u2014 AT&T wireless customers in Durham can now text emergency operators for help.\nOfficials say those contacting emergency operators through texting should be aware of the following:\u2022 Customers should text emergency operators only when calling 911 is not an option.\nNon-emergency issues should still be communicated to the Durham Emergency Communication Center by calling its non-emergency line at (919) 560-4600."}
