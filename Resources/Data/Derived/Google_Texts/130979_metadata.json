Robert Bentley has held fast to that decision, arguing that the state cannot afford even marginally higher costs and that it makes no sense to pour resources into what he calls a broken system.\n\nOn Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Giden Room of the Fairhope Public Library, the Baldwin County chapter of the League of Women Voters will sponsor a forum on the issue. Jessie Rose, who is on the group's Medicaid committee, said the state chapter has endorsed the expansion. Although the Baldwin chapter has not taken a formal stance on the issue, the forum's speakers have a decidedly pro-Medicaid bent. They include:\n\nDr. R. Allen Perkins, chairman of the University of South Alabama Division of Family Medicine, and president of Alabama's Rural Health Association.\n\nDr. Suzanne Tormoen, an internist in Fairhope with an additional specialty in nutrition and diet. She has 15 years of experience and privileges at three hospitals.\n\nJim Carnes, policy director of the Arise Citizens Policy Project, which advocates on behalf of low-income Alabamians.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government pays 100 percent of the expansion costs to Medicaid for the first three years and then gradually ratchets back to 90 percent. It was a key component of the health reform legislation.\n\nBut after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not compel states to expand their Medicaid programs, Alabama and many other states rejected it. It has left millions of people across the country ineligible for subsidies to buy private insurance on the government-run exchanges and also uncovered by Medicaid.\n\nIn Alabama, that number is between 181,000 and 324,000. A study over the summer by Families USA estimated that more than half of Alabamians who would qualify have jobs.\n\nThe University of Alabama and the University of Alabama at Birmingham both produced studies suggesting that the state stood to gain more than 30,000 jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars from the expansion. Troy University's Johnson Center for the Political Economy countered with its own study challenging those findings.\n\nUpdated at 10:40 a.m. to correct the name of Dr. R. Allen Perkins.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, news", "title": "Pro-Medicaid advocates to speak at Fairhope forum on consequences of failing to expand", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "On Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Giden Room of the Fairhope Public Library, the Baldwin County chapter of the League of Women Voters will sponsor a forum on the impact of Alabama's decision not to expand Medicaid.", "title": "Pro-Medicaid advocates to speak at Fairhope forum on consequences of failing to expand", "url": "http://www.al.com/news/mobile/index.ssf/2014/09/pro-medicaid_advocates_to_spea.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_mobile_impact/photo/phillips-tormoenjpg-606ee4f4fbd09cba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/news_mobile_impact/photo/phillips-tormoenjpg-606ee4f4fbd09cba.jpg", "description": "On Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Giden Room of the Fairhope Public Library, the Baldwin County chapter of the League of Women Voters will sponsor a forum on the impact of Alabama's decision not to expand Medicaid.", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary", "title": "Pro-Medicaid advocates to speak at Fairhope forum on consequences of failing to expand"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, September 19, 2014, 10:41 AM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, September 19, 2014,  6:00 AM", "article_author": "Brendan Kirby", "Description": "On Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Giden Room of the Fairhope Public Library, the Baldwin County chapter of the League of Women Voters will sponsor a forum on the impact of Alabama's decision not to expand Medicaid."}, "article_summary": "Jessie Rose, who is on the group's Medicaid committee, said the state chapter has endorsed the expansion.\nFAIRHOPE, Alabama \u2013 A pair of doctors and advocate for the poor will discuss the impact of the state's decision to reject federal funds to expand the Medicaid program under Obamacare.\nAlthough the Baldwin chapter has not taken a formal stance on the issue, the forum's speakers have a decidedly pro-Medicaid bent.\nBut after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not compel states to expand their Medicaid programs, Alabama and many other states rejected it.\nOn Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the Giden Room of the Fairhope Public Library, the Baldwin County chapter of the League of Women Voters will sponsor a forum on the issue."}
