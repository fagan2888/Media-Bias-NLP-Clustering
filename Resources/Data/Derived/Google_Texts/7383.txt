"They weren't just a little bit over the limit," MSgt. Gary Knight said. "They were well over the limit. It's not the first time there's been issues there."

Owner Jeff Rodgers was not cited, but manager Ellen Travis was slapped with a misdemeanor. Travis was held in police custody and later released in the field. Besides fire issues, police say it's difficult to respond to calls in crowded bars. Police also warn alcohol and limited personal space is not a good idea.

"You can accidentally brush up against somebody and they take offense," Bricktown area David Perry said. "Stuff could happen like that."

Some bar patrons say the solution to the overcrowding issue is to build more clubs. News 9's calls to the Candy Nightclub were not returned before Monday's 6 p.m. newscast.

Police say last weekend's incident was the third time in less than a month officers found Candy Nightclub to be overcrowded.
