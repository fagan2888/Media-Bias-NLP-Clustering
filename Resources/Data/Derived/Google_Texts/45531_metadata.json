I think he\u2019s done some good things domestically, like the health program and so forth. But on the world stage, just to be as objective about it as I can, I can\u2019t think of many nations in the world where we have a better relationship now than we did when he took over. You know, if you look at Russia, if you look at England, if you look at China, if you look at Egypt, and so forth\u2014I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s his fault, but we have not improved our relationship with individual countries. And I would say that the United States\u2019 influence and prestige and respect in the world is probably lower now than it was six or seven years ago.\n\nDuring his off-the-cuff announcement remarks, Christie also criticized Obama for \u201cweak and feckless foreign policy\u201d and warned his audience not to \u201cturn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nCarter reiterated that he doesn\u2019t \u201cblame\u201d Obama because \u201cit\u2019s been circumstances that have evolved.\u201d\n\nThe former president and Georgia governor repeated praise for John Kerry, whom Obama chose to succeed Clinton as secretary of state.\n\nTo applause, Carter called Kerry \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201cone of the best secretaries of state we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d He later said Kerry is \u201cvery courageous and innovative and dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe Washington-based Aspen Institute is an educational and policy studies organization with a mission \u201cto foster leadership based on enduring values and to provide a nonpartisan venue for dealing with critical issues.\u201d\n\nIsaacson\u2019s hour-long conversation with Carter and his wife, former first lady Rosalynn Carter, took place June 23.
