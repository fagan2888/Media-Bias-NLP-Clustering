Pearl Harbor, HI

Japanese and U.S. cities, together with the U.S. Navy, have marked the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II with a memorial service at Pearl Harbour.

Mayors and city council members from Honolulu and Nagaoka on Friday joined the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet in laying wreaths and unveiling a new plaque.

Fireworks resembling white chrysanthemum flowers were launched at the end of the ceremony.

White chrysanthemums are often presented at memorial services in Japan to honor the dead.

Nagaoka is the hometown of the late Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of the attack on Pearl Harbour that launched the U.S. into the war in 1941.

U.S. planes bombed the city during the last weeks of the war, killing nearly 2,000 people.

The war ended when Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, which was still August 14 in Hawaii and other parts of the U.S.

The December 7, 1941, bombing of Pearl Harbour killed about 2,400 sailors, Marines and soldiers on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

Around the world, there were 15 million battle deaths and 45 million civilian deaths from the war, according to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans.
