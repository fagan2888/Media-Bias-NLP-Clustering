Keith Bedford for The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Haitian government is seeking partners for a seemingly daunting task: building a world-class resort destination in one of the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n\nThis nation of 10 million people has chosen a 16-mile stretch of largely unoccupied beachfront on the country\u2019s southern coast, known as C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer, on which to build. Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Tourism estimates it will need up to $350 million in private investment to develop the area, including infrastructure such as utilities, a sewer system and roads.\n\nThe plan calls for a new international airport, an 18-hole golf course and 4,000 new hotel rooms, which would be a 50% increase from the island\u2019s current room count.\n\nThe government is aiming for the first phase of the plan, which includes four hotels and the airport with its own passport station, to open by 2017.\n\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer would represent Haiti\u2019s most ambitious hotel and real-estate project in 30 years. But the challenges the country faces in raising money show how hard it can be to lure investors to a natural tourism destination racked with poverty and crime.\n\nTourism minister Stephanie Villedrouin Balmir has been traveling the U.S. and Europe trying to line up investors as well as hotel operators to run the properties. Her pitch: a 15-year tax-free investment period and the chance to get in on the ground floor.\n\n\u201cWe are telling them that this is an amazing opportunity to create a new destination in the Caribbean,\u201d she says.\n\nThere has been some interest but few solid commitments. Grupo PuntaCana, a Dominican Republic-based airport operator, has agreed to build and manage the airport and to make an investment for an undisclosed amount, Ms. Villedrouin Balmir says.\n\nMore In Haiti Haiti Hopes For Help \u2014 But Not Charity\n\nA spokeswoman for Grupo PuntaCana said the company is working with the Haitian government and \u201chas invested in the planning, designs and studies necessary for the development of this new destination.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank, an organization that supports development projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, has agreed to spend $36 million to upgrade waterfalls, caves and other points of nature in neighboring villages. C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer is located between the beach and a mountain range, apart from the rest of the island.\n\nRick Newton, founding partner of the travel-advisory firm Resort Capital Partners LLC, sees reason for skepticism that it can succeed. Besides raising the money, Haiti needs to convince airlines to add flights to C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer. It also has to train thousands of workers. Haiti would be years behind competing Caribbean destinations like Mexico and the Bahamas.\n\nRead the full story at wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The Haitian government is seeking partners to create a world-class resort destination in one of the world's poorest countries.", "title": "Haiti Pitches a Ritzy Oasis on an Island of Misfortune", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/haiti-pitches-a-ritzy-oasis-on-an-island-of-misfortune/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CF380_HAITI_P_20140930140158.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Haiti Pitches a Ritzy Oasis on an Island of Misfortune", "description": "The Haitian government is seeking partners to create a world-class resort destination in one of the world's poorest countries.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Craig Carmin", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "The Haitian government is seeking partners to create a world-class resort destination in one of the world's poorest countries.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-01T11:45:07-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/haiti-pitches-a-ritzy-oasis-on-an-island-of-misfortune/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-1213", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The Haitian government is seeking partners to create a world-class resort destination in one of the world's poorest countries.", "title": "Haiti Pitches a Ritzy Oasis on an Island of Misfortune", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/10/01/haiti-pitches-a-ritzy-oasis-on-an-island-of-misfortune/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MI-CF380_HAITI_P_20140930140158.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-1213", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-01T11:45:41-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba3c\"", "article_summary": "Haiti\u2019s Tourism Minister Stephanie Balmir Villedrouin speaks during an interview with the Wall Street Journal.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer is located between the beach and a mountain range, apart from the rest of the island.\nBesides raising the money, Haiti needs to convince airlines to add flights to C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 de Fer would represent Haiti\u2019s most ambitious hotel and real-estate project in 30 years.\nHaiti would be years behind competing Caribbean destinations like Mexico and the Bahamas."}
