He is the author of the new book \"The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again. House Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration.\n\nMcConnell proposed that there would be a separate vote on the immigration issue. When Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no. The final bill provides funding for one more week, at which point Congress needs to take up the issue again.\n\nYet from a different perspective, congressional Republicans are achieving their goal. Once again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time. Congress has already squandered several months rather than addressing bigger questions, such as economic inequality or climate change, which the White House hoped to put at the center of political debate even if the Republicans refused to do anything about these problems.\n\nWhile the odds of the president making progress on key issues is extremely slim, President Obama has not even had a chance to introduce issues fully into public debate -- a key function of presidents who hope to build the groundwork for future legislative breakthroughs and shape the national conversation -- or to even to attempt to make progress on issues, like tax reform, where there is potential support for a bipartisan breakthrough.\n\nUsing up the legislative clock has been central to the Republican strategy since the 2010 midterm elections, a tactic that the Democrats have found difficult to fight back against.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP hogs the spotlight with funding deadlines like the battle over money for the Department of Homeland Security.", "pubdate": "2015-03-02T23:55:09Z", "author": "Julian Zelizer", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "The GOP hogs the spotlight with funding deadlines like the battle over money for the Department of Homeland Security.", "pubdate": "2015-03-02T23:55:09Z", "title": "Republicans run down Obama's clock", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/02/opinion/zelizer-gop-runs-down-clock/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150217133943-john-boehner-presser-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "opinion", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/02/opinion/zelizer-gop-runs-down-clock/index.html"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "template-top": "opinion,art-vid", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "keywords": "opinion, Republicans run down Obama's clock - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2015-03-02T23:55:09Z", "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150217133943-john-boehner-presser-large-169.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8bc\"", "article_summary": "(CNN) It looks like the Republicans in Congress have failed again.\nHouse Republicans defeated a plan pushed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to fund the Department of Homeland Security, money that congressional Republicans have been holding hostage in their effort to overturn President Obama's executive order on immigration.\nWhen Speaker John Boehner proposed an even narrower compromise, funding the Department for only three more weeks, his caucus said no.\nStory highlights Julian Zelizer: GOP hogs the spotlight with funding deadlines like the battle over money for the Department of Homeland Security.\nOnce again they are using up a valuable chunk of President Obama's political time."}
