Reporters are drawing new connections between Bill\u2019s speeches and Hillary\u2019s work at State, while Clinton opponents are dissecting the statements of Clinton Foundation representatives in search of falsehood or misdirection.\n\nThe book, Clinton Cash, by conservative author Peter Schweizer, makes a circumstantial case for possible wrongdoing by Clinton, tying the timing of speaking fees paid to her husband and donations to the foundation to actions taken by the State Dept. that benefited the donors.\n\nWhile Schweizer has no proof of any quid pro quos, the attention generated by the not-yet-published book has forced the Clinton Foundation into a defensive posture, and in the early going, things aren\u2019t working out very well.\n\nLast week, the foundation was forced to acknowledge errors in its tax filings and said it would refile several years\u2019 worth of Internal Revenue Service documentation to better identify the foreign donors that gave money to its various programs.\n\nRelated: Forget Benghazi \u2013 Blame Hillary for the Disastrous Russian Reset\n\nOn Sunday, in a blog post on the foundation\u2019s website, acting CEO Maura Pally addressed the refiling issue and also explained the relationship between the foundation and a Canadian charity called the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership.\n\nWhile the Clinton Foundation disclosed money it received from the Partnership, it did not disclose the names of those who gave money to the Partnership. This looked fishy to some, because Frank Giustra, the Canadian billionaire who helped found the organization, also owned U.S. uranium-mining rights that he wanted to sell to a Russian company associated with President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. government committee that eventually approved the sale included the State Department run by Hillary Clinton.\n\nSome of the donors to the partnership, it turned out, were also affiliated with Giustra\u2019s company.\n\nPally defended the foundation, saying that it had simply complied with Canadian disclosure laws. \u201cThis is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency \u2013 unlike in the U.S., under Canadian law all charities are prohibited from disclosing individual donors without prior permission from each donor,\u201d Pally wrote.\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Exploits Explosive New Book on the Clintons\n\nToday, though, came news of more questionable timing between the financial dealings of former President Clinton and then-Secretary of State Clinton.\n\nThe International Business Times reported on Monday afternoon that the investment bank Goldman Sachs forked over $200,000 to have Bill Clinton deliver a speech to its clients just three days before Hillary made a speech at State praising Goldman\u2019s involvement in sending U.S. students to travel in China. A few months later, Goldman would begin lobbying the State Department on various international issues.\n\nAlso on Monday, the conservative website The Federalist took issue with a claim by the Clinton Foundation, made in a tweet last week that 88 percent of its expenditures \u201cgo directly to our life-changing work.\u201d\n\nMore than 88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work: http://t.co/5BrnpBtIp6 pic.twitter.com/GoKfRE9rKq \u2014 Clinton Foundation (@ClintonFdn) April 25, 2015\n\nFederalist writer Sean Davis notes that unless you torture the meaning of the words \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201clife-changing,\u201d it\u2019s hard to make the foundation\u2019s numbers add up. In 2013, he says, tax returns suggest the foundation spent about 10 percent of its money on charitable grants. The vast majority went to operational expenses such as rent, travel and other overhead.\n\nRelated: Why Benghazi Is Not Going Away for Hillary\n\n\u201cIn 2013, for example, only 10 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s expenditures were for direct charitable grants,\u201d Davis writes. \u201cThe amount it spent on charitable grants\u2013$8.8 million\u2013was dwarfed by the $17.2 million it cumulatively spent on travel, rent, and office supplies. Between 2011 and 2013, the organization spent only 9.9 percent of the $252 million it collected on direct charitable grants.\u201d\n\nIf these circumstantial allegations stick to Clinton, it can affect not only the presidential race, but also tilt the balance in the House and Senate. As of now, no other Democrat is a seriously challenging to Hillary Clinton. If someone is waiting on the sidelines, he or she could be waiting too long to raise the money necessary to make a serious run for the White House.\n\nBut take heart, America. Only 561 days until the 2016 elections.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The media, both mainstream and partisan, has caught Clinton-fever once again.
