But many of these people are misguided liberals who see his tenure as the dawn of a new, progressive church.\n\nAt first blush, the church\u2019s fan base appears to have grown more or less equally on either side of the aisle. According to the survey, both liberals and Democrats\u2019 positive views of the church (39 and 35 percent, respectively) grew at about the same rate as those of conservatives and Republicans (22 and 27 percent).\n\nYet when we look within the parties, a different picture emerges. The Pew Research Center also polled on the ratio of those whose view of the church improved to whose view worsened. While Republican and conservative popular opinion is pretty evenly split (3-1 for Republicans, 2-1 for conservatives), the data indicates that the pope\u2019s visit swept liberals off their feet. For every liberal whose view of the church worsened, ten liberals\u2019 views improved. For Democrats, the ratio is an even more extreme 17-1.\n\nClearly, the pope is having a moment when it comes to progressive Americans. For such strong results, one would expect that Francis\u2019 visit must have been a string of liberal victories \u2014 official sanctioning of marriage equality, perhaps, or the announcement of inclusive policies regarding gay priests. Or maybe he finally opened up ordination to women?\n\nWell, not exactly. The pope reinforced a number of traditional, conservative stances during a visit that has been inaccurately hailed as somehow a boon for the left. Pope Francis made an unscheduled stop to see the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that has filed a lawsuit against the federal government over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate. He declared in his closing mass that it is the \u201ccovenant of man and woman\u201d that reveals God. And, of course, he met (mistakenly or not) with Kim Davis.\n\nWhat happened to our Hyundai-driving, global-warming acknowledging, liberal pope?\n\nA closer look at the pope\u2019s record might indicate that he didn\u2019t exist in the first place. Certainly Pope Francis\u2019 stances on human sexuality aren\u2019t as liberal as progressives would like to think, whether we\u2019re talking about marriage equality, contraception, or abortion. Neither is he terribly far to the left on immigration or poverty. Pope Francis myopically refuses to acknowledge overpopulation, for example, undermining his call in July to \u201cwelcome and protect\u201d all immigrant children, and making his support of capitalism look particularly misguided.\n\nIf we take a wide lens, the Catholic Church has one of the worst institutional human rights records in history. Converting people at the point of the sword, forcibly eradicating whole cultures, and telling a surprisingly big proportion of the world that they\u2019re going to hell has not quite exemplified Jesus\u2019 teachings of love and mercy.\n\nYet with Wednesday\u2019s Pew survey, which shows that it was progressives, not conservatives, whose views of the church the pope\u2019s visit most improved, you would be forgiven for thinking all that\u2019s different now. It\u2019s clear that progressives really want to believe that the pope \u2014 and by extension, the entire institution \u2014 is finally with them. The man celebrated his birthday by giving 400 sleeping bags to the homeless, for crying out loud.\n\nBut to read Pope Francis\u2019 acknowledgement of global warming as the dawn of a new era in the Catholic Church is thinking just as wishful as Pope Francis\u2019 belief that we can end poverty without sanctioning contraception. And that\u2019s unfortunate. By creating a folk hero where one doesn\u2019t exist, progressives are impeding their ability to call for real change in the Catholic Church. For once, maybe the liberals ought to look to the conservatives on this one.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Boston University News Service", "description": "A new survey shows that liberals have a more positive view of the Catholic Church in the wake of Pope Francis\u2019 visit to America, despite a visit spent reinforcing traditional, conservative stances.\u2026", "title": "Pope Francis\u2019 Conservative Visit To America", "url": "http://bunewsservice.com/jo15/pope-francis-conservative-visit-to-america/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://bunewsservice.com/jo15/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pope4.jpg", "height": 1000}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-14T20:47:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-01T15:48:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bunewsservice.com/jo15/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pope4.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "viewport": "user-scalable=yes, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4daf\"", "article_summary": "But to read Pope Francis\u2019 acknowledgement of global warming as the dawn of a new era in the Catholic Church is thinking just as wishful as Pope Francis\u2019 belief that we can end poverty without sanctioning contraception.\nCertainly Pope Francis\u2019 stances on human sexuality aren\u2019t as liberal as progressives would like to think, whether we\u2019re talking about marriage equality, contraception, or abortion.\nWhat happened to our Hyundai-driving, global-warming acknowledging, liberal pope?\nPope Francis made an unscheduled stop to see the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of nuns that has filed a lawsuit against the federal government over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate.\nBy Alexandra Werner WinslowBU News ServiceA new Pew Research Center survey came out Wednesday showing that in the wake of Pope Francis\u2019 visit to America, 28 percent of U.S. adults have a more positive view of the Catholic Church."}
