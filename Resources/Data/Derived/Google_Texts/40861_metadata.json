This is due to the mandatory annual inflation adjustments provided under U.S. Tax Code.\n\nThe latest report from Wolters Kluwer, CCH offers estimated ranges for each 2015 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal exemption and the standard deduction.\n\n\n\n\u201cIndexing effectively provides an automatic tax cut for most individuals, without the need for Congress to agree on legislation each year to make it happen,\u201d said George Jones, JD, LLM and CCH Senior Federal Tax Analyst. \u201cMost taxpayers benefit from inflation adjustments since the adjustments tend to preserve the value of most, but not all, of the dollar-based benefits under the Tax Code year after year.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen there is inflation, indexing of brackets lowers tax bills by including more of people\u2019s incomes in lower brackets \u2012 in the existing 15-percent bracket, for example, rather than the existing 25-percent bracket. The formula used in indexing showed a slightly higher amount of inflation this year over last, representing a change of just under 1.58 percent. Nevertheless, so-called \u201crounding conventions\u201d required under the Internal Revenue Code keep some tax amounts for 2015 the same as they are for 2014, such as the $14,000 gift tax annual exclusion and the $5,500 limit on IRA contributions, but most 2014 figures will move higher.\n\n\n\nMost taxpayers will experience modest savings generated by indexing of the 2015 individual income tax rate brackets for taxpayers.\n\n\n\nBecause of inflation adjustments, a married couple filing jointly with a total taxable income of $100,000 should pay $125.50 less income taxes in 2015 than they will on the same income for 2014 because of indexing of their tax bracket for 2015.\n\nA single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe $62.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate brackets between 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n\nAdd to those savings the additional tax savings realized in most cases by slightly higher 2015 standard deduction and personal exemption amounts, as well as amounts that might be claimed from an increase in the income ceilings imposed on tax benefits such as education credits, individual retirement account (IRA) contributions and more. Combined, inflation-based tax savings for the 2015 tax year can become substantial.\n\n\n\nHigher-income Taxpayers Also Benefit\n\n\n\nThe 2015 year represents the third year that the 39.6-tax bracket for higher-income taxpayers, enacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), will be imposed. For 2015, Wolters Kluwer, CCH projects that the minimum income amounts at which this top tax rate will kick in will rise to $464,850 (from $457,600) for married joint filers, $439,000 (from $432,200) for heads of households, $413,200 (from $406,750) for unmarried filers, and $232,425 (from $228,800) for married separate filers. These inflation-adjusted amounts also trigger a 20-percent tax on that portion of taxable income attributable to net capital gains and qualified dividends that exceed these bracket amounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHigher-income\u201d taxpayers also must face the new \u201cMedicare\u201d taxes that started in 2013. They are the 3.8-percent surtax on net investment income and a 0.9-percent Medicare contributions tax on earned income. The net investment income tax is triggered when adjusted gross income exceeds: $250,000 (married joint filers and qualifying widowers), $200,000 (for heads of households and single filers), and $125,000 (for married single filers). The additional Medicare contributions tax is triggered when a taxpayer\u2019s wages, compensation, or self-employment income exceed these same threshold amounts. These amounts, however, are not adjusted for inflation and therefore remain the same for 2015.\n\n\n\nInflation Adjustments\n\n\n\nSince the late 1980s, the U.S. Tax Code has required that federal income tax brackets be adjusted for inflation annually, and inflation adjustments have been inserted into the Internal Revenue Code in recent years with increasing frequency.\n\n\n\nFor example, the Code now requires over 50 other inflation-driven computations to determine deduction, exemption and exclusion amounts in addition to the 40 separate computations needed to inflation-adjust the tax bracket tables each year. In fact, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act added an even greater number of inflation adjustments to the tax code, including figures affecting the Code Sec. 36B premium assistance tax credit, the income level under which an individual may not be penalized for failure to comply with the individual mandate, and the amount of salary reductions that can be made through a flexible spending arrangement. Some of these health-related inflation adjustments, however, have been delayed for tax years after 2014 or beyond.\n\n\n\nNotable as one of the provisions that ATRA now requires to be permanently adjusted for annual inflation is the estate and gift tax applicable exemption. Set at a $5 million level for 2011, the amount has been adjusted for inflation by Congress to $5,120,000 for 2012, $5,250,000 for 2013, $5,340,000 for 2014, and now projected at $5,430,000 for 2015. A spousal portability election can now effectively protect double that amount against estate and gift tax ($10,860,000 for 2015).\n\n\n\nMost adjustments are based on Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers\u2019 figures for September through August immediately prior to the adjusted year. However, some inflation-adjusted figures are computed earlier and some later. For example, amounts such as the 2015 vehicle depreciation limits won\u2019t be available until later in 2014, while the 2015 standard business mileage rate (that is currently set at 56 cents for 2014) isn\u2019t expected to be computed and released until December 2014.\n\n\n\nAMT Exemptions Indexed\n\n\n\nJones observed that ATRA provided for annual inflation adjustments to the exemptions from the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Previously, Congress was required to explicitly increase the amounts by statute every time the so-called \u201cAMT patch\u201d was set to expire.\n\n\n\nBefore ATRA, Congress relied on one- or two-year AMT patches to account for inflation from the initially set amounts of $33,750 and $45,000, respectively. However, the new law now provides for base exemption amounts of $78,750 for married joint filers and surviving spouses, $50,600 for single taxpayers, and $56,000 for heads of households.\n\n\n\nWolters Kluwer, CCH projects that for 2015, the AMT exemption for married joint filers and surviving spouses will be adjusted upward to $83,400, up from $82,100 for 2014. For unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2015 exemption will be $53,600, up from $52,800 for 2014. For married single filers, the exemption will increase to $41,700, up from $41,050 in 2014.\n\n\n\nStandard Deduction, Personal Exemption Rise\n\n\n\nThe standard deduction and personal exemption amounts are also subject to indexing. Projections for 2015 indicate that the trend will continue, with increases across the board. The standard deduction for single taxpayers, heads of households and married couples filing jointly will all show increases for 2015, by $100, $150 and $200, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe standard deduction for joint filers, for example, would rise from $12,400 to $12,600 in 2015. Any increase in the standard deduction, of course, can produce lower taxes by decreasing the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income.\n\n\n\nThe additional standard deduction for those 65-years-old and older or who are blind will increase to $1,250 for 2015, up from $1,200 in 2014 for married individuals and surviving spouses, but the $1,550 additional amount for single aged 65 or older or blind filers will remain the same. The personal exemption amount gets bumped up by inflation by $50, to $4,000 in 2015, up from $3,950 in 2014 after having increased $100 between 2012 and 2013.\n\n\n\nTaxpayers for many years have had to lose a good portion of the value of personal exemptions and itemized deductions when their incomes rise above certain levels, which have also been adjusted for inflation. Starting in 2010, these \u201cphase outs\u201d disappeared from the Tax Code, but ATRA reintroduced them starting last year for certain higher-income taxpayers. ATRA set forth base amounts for the phase-out ranges, which represented increases from their pre-2010 levels, even before inflation adjustments.\n\n\n\nThe 2014 phase-out range for personal exemptions under ATRA begins at $309,900 for joint filers and $258,250 for single filers. The phase out is complete once these levels reach, respectively, $432,400 and $380,750. The same income ranges apply to the phase out of itemized deductions.\n\nFor a complete look at how income ranges for each tax bracket are projected to shift next, see the Wolters Kluwer, CCH tables below.\n\n\n\n\u201cKiddie\u201d Deduction, Gift Tax Exemption\n\n\n\nIn general, inflation adjustments are rounded to the next-lower multiple of $50, so if the adjustment produces an increase of less than $50, no increase is made. The \u201ckiddie\u201d deduction, used on the returns of children claimed as dependents on their parents\u2019 returns, increased only six times in the years 2001 through 2014 because of rounding. It last rose for the 2013 tax year. For 2015 the deduction will increase again, to $1,050.\n\n\n\nThe Code only allows the gift tax exemption to rise when the inflation adjustment would produce an increase of $1,000 or more. The last increase occurred in 2013, when it rose to $14,000. It remains unchanged for 2015.\n\n\n\nWolters Kluwer, CCH 2014 Tax Projections\n\nWolters Kluwer, CCH\u2019s projections for other indexed amounts are based on the relevant inflation data released September 17, 2014, by the U.S. Department of Labor. The IRS usually releases official numbers by December each year.\n\nWolters Kluwer, CCH tax bracket projections are provided for illustrative purposes only, and should not be used for income tax returns or other federal income tax related purposes until confirmed by the IRS later this year.\n\nMarried Filing Jointly (& Surviving Spouse)\n\n\n\nTax Rate 2015 Taxable Income 2014 Taxable Income 10% $0 \u2013 $18,450 $0 \u2013 $18,150 15% $18,450 \u2013 $74,900 $18,150 \u2013 $73,800 25% $74,900 \u2013 $151,200 $73,800 \u2013 $148,850 28% $151,200 \u2013 $230,450 $148,850 \u2013 $226,850 33% $230,450 \u2013 $411,500 $226,850 \u2013 $405,100 35% $411,500 \u2013 $464,850 $405,100 \u2013 $457,600 39.6% $464,850+ $457,600+\n\nUnmarried Individuals (Other Than Surviving Spouses and Heads of Households)\n\n\n\nTax Rate 2015 Taxable Income 2014 Taxable Income 10% $0 \u2013 $9,225 $0 \u2013 $9,075 15% $9,225 \u2013 $37,450 $9,075 \u2013 $36,900 25% $37,450 \u2013 $90,750 $36,900 \u2013 $89,350 28% $90,750 \u2013 $189,300 $89,350 \u2013 $186,350 33% $189,300 \u2013 $411,500 $186,350 \u2013 $405,100 35% $411,500 \u2013 $413,200 $405,100 \u2013 $406,750 39.6% $413,200+ $406,750+\n\nHead of Household\n\n\n\nTax Rate 2015 Taxable Income 2014 Taxable Income 10% $0 \u2013 $13,150 $0 \u2013 $12,950 15% $13,150 \u2013 $50,200 $12,950 \u2013 $49,400 25% $50,200 \u2013 $129,600 $49,400 \u2013 $127,550 28% $129,600 \u2013 $209,850 $127,550 \u2013 $206,600 33% $209,850 \u2013 $411,500 $206,600 \u2013 $405,100 35% $411,500 \u2013 $439,000 $405,100 \u2013 $432,200 39.6% $439,000+ $432,200+\n\nMarried Individuals Filing Separate Returns\n\n\n\nTax Rate 2015 Taxable Income 2014 Taxable Income 10% $0 \u2013 $9,225 $0 \u2013 $9,075 15% $9,225 \u2013 $37,450 $9,075 \u2013 $36,900 25% $37,450 \u2013 $75,600 $36,900 \u2013 $74,425 28% $75,600 \u2013 $115,225 $74,425 \u2013 $113,425 33% $115,225 \u2013 $205,750 $113,425 \u2013 $202,550 35% $205,750 \u2013 $232,425 $202,550 \u2013 $228,800 39.6% $232,425+ $228,800\n\nStandard Deduction Amounts\n\n\n\nFiling Status 2015 2014 Increase Married Filing Jointly (& Surviving Spouse) $12,600 $12,400 $200 Married Filing Separately $6,300 $6,200 $100 Single $6,300 $6,200 $100 Head of Household $9,250 $9,100 $150\n\nStandard Deduction for Dependents (\u201cKiddie\u201d Standard Deduction)\n\n2015 2014 Increase $1,050 $1,000 $50\n\nPersonal Exemption Amounts\n\n2015 2014 Increase $4,000 $3,950 $50\n\nGift Tax Exclusion\n\n2015 2014 Increase $14,000 $14,000 $0\n\n* These numbers are projected for the 2015 tax year and have not been confirmed by the Internal Revenue Service (www.irs.org).\n\n'", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest report from Wolters Kluwer, CCH offers estimated ranges for each 2015 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal exemption and the standard deduction.", "og": {"site_name": "CPA Practice Advisor", "description": "The latest report from Wolters Kluwer, CCH offers estimated ranges for each 2015 tax bracket as well as projections for a growing number of inflation-sensitive tax figures, such as the personal exemption and the standard deduction.", "title": "New IRS Data Suggests Taxpayers Will Pay Less in 2015", "url": "http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12004828/new-irs-data-suggests-taxpayers-will-pay-less-in-2015", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://r3.cpapracticeadvisor.com/files/base/CSN/image/2014/09/16x9/1280x720/119102054_1024x768_1_.541b377e1b95f.jpg", "height": 720}, "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 203013999739730}, "keywords": "Income Taxes, income tax, Internal Revenue Service, IRS, Tax Refunds, Wolters Kluwer CCH, Tax", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe10b0\"", "article_summary": "Most taxpayers will experience modest savings generated by indexing of the 2015 individual income tax rate brackets for taxpayers.\nWolters Kluwer, CCH tax bracket projections are provided for illustrative purposes only, and should not be used for income tax returns or other federal income tax related purposes until confirmed by the IRS later this year.\nCombined, inflation-based tax savings for the 2015 tax year can become substantial.\nA single filer with taxable income of $50,000 should owe $62.50 less next year due to the adjustments to the income tax rate brackets between 2014 and 2015.\nFor unmarried single filers and heads of households, the 2015 exemption will be $53,600, up from $52,800 for 2014."}
