This led to and exchange between Shkreli and CNBC anchors, including @ScottWapner. \u201cThis is the same @MartinShkreli who also insulted our star healthcare reporter @megtirrell on Twitter. I guess that tells you more\u2026\u201d Wapner tweeted.\n\nShkreli responded by saying that CNBC conducted bait and switch in an interview. \u201cYou invite me on and then bait-and-switch topics. Great journalism ethics. Meg is not a star, she\u2019s a moron,\u201d he tweeted. Shkreli went on to denigrate the CNBC network. He has an interview with Fox Business News tomorrow morning.\n\nBut there is some good news.
