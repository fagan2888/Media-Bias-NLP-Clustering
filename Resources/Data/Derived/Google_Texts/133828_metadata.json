That move ultimately generated losses steep enough to force the company to chop its earnings forecast. UnitedHealth Group Inc. sold coverage on just four exchanges in 2014.\n\nThe Minnetonka, Minnesota, company will decide next year whether to sell coverage for 2017 on the exchanges, a key element in the ACA\u2019s push to cover millions of uninsured people.\n\nBut Hemsley also told investors Tuesday that any decision to pull back from that market will not be permanent.\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
