Since forever, it occurs to me now, my preferred way of dressing in fall and winter has been to pair a black sweater with a pair of blue jeans, or slip into a little black dress that hovers just above my knees.\n\nIs it because I\u2019ve gone Goth? Or gone into perpetual mourning? Nothing of the sort; it\u2019s simply that I\u2019ve always thought the color black looks good on me (and, yes, a little slimming).\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nIn summer, by contrast, I tend to do the reverse: As the mercury climbs, almost everything I wear is white. A little stark, perhaps, but oh so easy.\n\nBut thanks to a recent session with image consultant Candy Gould , the head color expert from the British-based House of Colour, I\u2019m leaning much less on those old standbys and much more on bright blues and greens, as well as subdued creams. The results have been dramatic: My face looks brighter. My eyes seem bluer. And friends have told me I look less tired, even \u2013 dare I say it? \u2013 a tad younger.\n\nSo how\u2019d the switch come about?\n\nAccording to Gould, I\u2019m a \u201cSpring\u201d \u2013 and, as you can imagine, Springs do not wear black or white. When I looked skeptical, Gould broke down her process for me:\n\n\u201cIt all starts with skin tone,\u201d Gould explained, \u201cnot hair or eye color \u2013 both of those can easily be fiddled with.\u201d (And how!) \u201cBut skin tone remains the same throughout our lives, no matter our age.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of age, Gould diplomatically pointed out that wearing the wrong color, especially one as harsh as black (unless you\u2019re a confirmed \u201cWinter\u201d), can drain the face, create shadows under the eyes and have an overall aging effect.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nIt turns out that color analysis, based on theories put forth by Bauhaus artist Johannes Itten, entails both science and art: Color experts use an adaptation of Itten\u2019s color wheel, which reflects all the colors of nature. Each season gets to wear 25 percent of these colors. (Half the wheel is based in blue, the other half in yellow.)\n\nGetting your \u201ccolors done\u201d can therefore be a worthwhile investment, especially if you want to avoid buying something only to let it languish in your closet. Get your colors right upfront, and the chances of that happening go way down. Plus you\u2019ll look fab in the process!\n\nFor more dish on how to \u201cembrace your inner colors,\u201d watch this episode of The Best of Everything After 50 series on AARP\u2019s YouTube Channel:\n\nPhoto: RockMyHeels\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "My go-to cold-weather color has always been black.
