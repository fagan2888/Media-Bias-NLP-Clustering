The resolution asserted that there was no proof that the named officials knew about the abuses or intended for the program to be implemented in that illegal manner.\n\nThe initial case brought against former President Fujimori\u2014who was convicted of murder, kidnapping and crimes against humanity in 2009 \u2013included charges that he knew of the forced sterilization programs during his administration that lead to at least 18 deaths and involved deception and threats against hundreds of thousands of mainly indigenous women.\n\nRELATED: Forced sterilization of indigenous case re-opened in Peru\n\nWhile the case against Fujimori was mostly resolved, the cases involving the forced sterilization programs were ongoing until the recent resolution.\n\nFor Demus, a women\u2019s rights defense organization in Peru, the resolution \u201cextends a cloak of impunity over one of the gravest violations of human rights committed by this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis resolution again violates the right to the truth and access to justice and reparations for the victims of forced sterilization in our country,\u201d according to the Demus press release. Demus was one of the human rights organizations that had originally filed charges against the officials on behalf of Mamerita Mestanza, one of the women who died as a result of forced sterilization.\n\nThe women\u2019s rights organization asserted that \u201cthe forced sterilizations implicate crimes contemplated in the Peruvian penal legislation and constitutes grave human rights violations\u2026and merits investigation and sanctions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials who forcibly sterilized thousands of indigenous Peruvian women in the late 1990s will not face charges according to a recent ruling.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/02/officials-will-not-be-charged-perus-forced-sterilization-program-153330", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/former_peruvian_president_alberto_fujimori_-_karel_navarro_ap.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Officials Will Not Be Charged in Peru\u2019s Forced Sterilization Program"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-02-02T09:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Officials Will Not Be Charged in Peru\u2019s Forced Sterilization Program"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/02/officials-will-not-be-charged-perus-forced-sterilization-program-153330", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Forced Sterilization, Peru, Women\u2019s Rights, President Alberto Fujimori, Minsters of Health, Salud Costa, Alejandro Aguinaga, Eduardo Yong, National Reproductive Health and Family Planning Program, Indigenous Women", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Officials Will Not Be Charged in Peru\u2019s Forced Sterilization Program"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8726\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Forced sterilization of indigenous case re-opened in PeruWhile the case against Fujimori was mostly resolved, the cases involving the forced sterilization programs were ongoing until the recent resolution.\nWomen\u2019s rights advocates in Peru are condemning the ruling that drops charges against the officials implicated in the forced sterilization of thousands of indigenous women as part of the National Reproductive Health and Family Planning Program of 1996-2000.\nMany thousands of indigenous Peruvian women were forcibly sterilized in the late 1990s and the people in charge of the program will not face charges according to a recent ruling.\nDemus was one of the human rights organizations that had originally filed charges against the officials on behalf of Mamerita Mestanza, one of the women who died as a result of forced sterilization.\nThe women\u2019s rights organization asserted that \u201cthe forced sterilizations implicate crimes contemplated in the Peruvian penal legislation and constitutes grave human rights violations\u2026and merits investigation and sanctions.\u201d"}
