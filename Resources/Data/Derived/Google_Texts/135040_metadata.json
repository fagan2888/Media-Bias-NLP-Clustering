The aide said those proposals indicate that Democrats thought at one point that legislation was needed, and that their goal couldn't be achieved through a new rule.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans in the House and Senate have proposed legislation that would reverse an Obama administration rule that would make it easier for parents to skip out on child support payments and force children to rely on federal welfare payments.\nLate last year, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services issued a rule that would require states to relieve non-custodial parents from their child support obligations if they go to prison.
