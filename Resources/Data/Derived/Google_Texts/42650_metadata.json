But if home run title is still up for grabs, the financial champion among this year\u2019s contestants is already a lock.\n\nSluggers Troy Tulowitzki, Jose Bautista and Adam Jones will make more than $13 million each this year \u2013 a fitting salary figure for power bats with name recognition. Three other plays competing in tonight\u2019s Home Run Derby at Target Field in Minnesota \u2014 Josh Donaldson, Brian Dozier and Todd Frazier \u2013 will make less than $1 million.\n\nData from Deadspin and the Associated Press shows that annual salary isn\u2019t indicative of production, though. For example, Donaldson and Tulowitzki have 20 and 21 home runs, respectively, this year. Donaldson will make $500,000 while Tulowitzki is making $16 million. Baseball\u2019s leading slugger heading into the All-Star break, rookie Jose Abreu of the Chicago White Sox, is making $8.7 million.\n\nAbreu, who leads the league with 29 homers, isn\u2019t participating in the Home Run Derby. Neither are Nelson Cruz of the Baltimore Orioles (28 home runs) or Toronto\u2019s Edwin Encarnacion, who is injured (26 home runs), or rising superstar Mike Trout of the Angels (22 home runs).\n\nHere\u2019s who will be taking hacks at the home run contest, and how much they\u2019re making this year:\n\nAmerican League\n\nJose Bautista: Toronto Blue Jays, 17 home runs, $14 million\n\nToronto Blue Jays, 17 home runs, $14 million Adam Jones: Baltimore Orioles, 16 home runs, $13.1 million\n\nBaltimore Orioles, 16 home runs, $13.1 million Yoenis Cespedes: Oakland Athletics, 14 home runs, $10.5 million\n\nOakland Athletics, 14 home runs, $10.5 million Brian Dozier: Minnesota Twins, 16 home runs, $540,000\n\nMinnesota Twins, 16 home runs, $540,000 Josh Donaldson: Oakland Athletics, 20 home runs, $500,000\n\nRelated: 10 Cities with Booming Job Growth\n\nNational League\n\nTroy Tulowitzki: Colorado Rockies, 20 home runs, $16 million\n\nColorado Rockies, 20 home runs, $16 million Giancarlo Stanton: Miami Marlins, 21 home runs, $6.5 million\n\nMiami Marlins, 21 home runs, $6.5 million Justin Morneau: Colorado Rockies, 13 home runs, $5 million\n\nColorado Rockies, 13 home runs, $5 million Yasiel Puig: Los Angeles Dodgers, 12 home runs, $3.7 million\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers, 12 home runs, $3.7 million Todd Frazier: Cincinnati Reds, 17 home runs, $600,000\n\nRegardless of who wins the contest, one player can claim victory over the digital space. That would be Jose Bautista and his 527,000 Twitter followers. The derby contestant with the second highest number of followers is Puig with 144,000.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Major League Baseball\u2019s Home Run Derby tonight should be a showcase of some of the gam", "title": "Which Three Home Run Derby Contestants Make Less Than $1 Million?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/14/Which-Three-Home-Run-Derby-Contestants-Make-Less-1-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07142014_Giancarlo_Stanton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/14/Which-Three-Home-Run-Derby-Contestants-Make-Less-1-Million", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07142014_Giancarlo_Stanton.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Major League Baseball\u2019s Home Run Derby tonight should be a showcase of some of the gam", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca75\"", "article_summary": "Major League Baseball\u2019s Home Run Derby tonight should be a showcase of some of the game\u2019s top sluggers bashing balls for miles.\nAbreu, who leads the league with 29 homers, isn\u2019t participating in the Home Run Derby.\nThree other plays competing in tonight\u2019s Home Run Derby at Target Field in Minnesota \u2014 Josh Donaldson, Brian Dozier and Todd Frazier \u2013 will make less than $1 million.\nBut if home run title is still up for grabs, the financial champion among this year\u2019s contestants is already a lock.\nDonaldson will make $500,000 while Tulowitzki is making $16 million."}
