To the contrary, though, Mosley found that the tapeworms increased his appetite and actually made him pack on a couple of extra pounds.\n\n\"When I first saw the worms, I was in an Indian restaurant,\" said Mosley, according to Yahoo! Shine. \"I shouted out, 'Blimey! There's a tapeworm in me!' The other diners looked very surprised.\"\n\nThe tapeworm diet has been slowly gaining steam after some say ingesting the parasites has helped them lose weight. But prior to its popularity as a diet technique, tapeworms were actually something that people dreaded and avoided at all costs. According to Mayo Clinic, an adult tapeworm has a head, neck, and a chain of tentacle-like digits called \u201cproglottids.\u201d When people get intestinal tapeworm infections, the tapeworm head attaches to the wall of the intestines and begins to produce eggs. Tapeworms can live in a person\u2019s body for up to 20 years. Symptoms of an intestinal tapeworm infection include nausea, weakness, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n\nMosley traveled to Kenya in order to pick up the parasites, which came from cysts on a cow\u2019s tongue that contained tapeworm eggs. After ingesting the tapeworm, Mosley tracked his progress for about six weeks. He kept a food diary in which he noted any changes in his behavior or physical appearance. Contrary to what some may believe about the tapeworm diet, Mosely said he found himself craving carbohydrates and sugars. He gained about 2 lbs. during the experiment. Eventually, Mosely took a medication to get rid of the tapeworm. He has had no lasting symptoms since taking the meds.\n\nSo maybe the tapeworm diet doesn\u2019t work for weight loss. It didn\u2019t work for Mosley, at least. One thing is for sure though, the risk is probably not worth any of the possible benefits. In August, after an Iowa woman ingested a tapeworm she bought on the internet, the Iowa Dept. of Health wrote an open letter to people thinking of trying the diet. \u201cIngesting tapeworms is extremely risky and can cause a wide range of undesirable side effects, including rare deaths,\u201d wrote Department of Health Director Dr. Patricia Quinlisk. \u201cThose desiring to lose weight are advised to stick with proven weight-loss methods \u2014 consuming fewer calories and increasing physical activity.\u201d\n\nYou can watch Mosley\u2019s journey below:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tapeworm diet, dr michael mosley, parasitic infection, infection, parasite, tapeworm, weight loss,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Dr. Michael Mosley intentionally infected himself with a tapeworm to see if it would make him lose weight.
