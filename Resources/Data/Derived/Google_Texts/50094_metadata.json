Case in point: Rep. Cory Gardner released an ad Tuesday calling for making birth control pills available over the counter, but Sen. Mark Udall isn\u2019t wild about the idea.\n\nMr. Gardner \u2014 he\u2019s the Republican \u2014 says in the television ad that birth control pills should be available without a prescription. The Food and Drug Administration has long required women to obtain a doctor\u2019s prescription for oral contraceptives, though not for morning-after pills with the same active ingredients.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between me and Mark Udall on contraception? I believe the pill ought to be available over the counter, round the clock, without a prescription. Cheaper and easier, for you,\u201d says Mr. Gardner in the ad that\u2019s airing statewide.\n\nSEE ALSO: Colo. senator\u2019s re-election bid dogged by Obamacare woes\n\nThe goal is to rebut the Udall campaign\u2019s \u201cwar on women\u201d strategy, which has proven enormously effective for Democrats in Colorado. What\u2019s changed this year is that Republicans like Mr. Gardner are meeting the issue squarely by arguing that their agenda is more woman-friendly than that of the Democrats.\n\n\u201cMark Udall\u2019s plan is different,\u201d Mr. Gardner continues in the ad. \u201cHe wants to keep government bureaucrats between you and your health care plan. That means more politics, and more profits for drug companies. My plan means more rights, more freedom and more control for you \u2014 and that\u2019s a big difference.\u201d\n\nMr. Udall \u2014 he\u2019s the Democrat \u2014 has raised concerns about the proposal, telling the Coloradoan in July that requiring a prescription for oral contraceptives is actually a better deal for consumers because the Affordable Care Act covers birth control.\n\n\u201cI believe it would put more barriers to women\u2019s health and contraception,\u201d Mr. Udall told the Fort Collins newspaper.\n\nEven though Obamacare requires insurance companies to cover birth control without a copayment, that doesn\u2019t mean all oral contraceptives are free. As Planned Parenthood notes in an online post, \u201cthere are a few reasons why your insurance may not cover a specific type of birth control at no cost.\u201d\n\nFor example, insurance companies only need offer one type of birth control pills. Women who want a certain brand of oral contraceptives not offered by their insurance plan may still need to meet a copay. In addition, insurance plans that are \u201cgrandfathered\u201d aren\u2019t required to meet Obamacare\u2019s standards, according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nMr. Udall\u2019s campaign released a statement Tuesday calling the Gardner ad \u201cjaw-dropping\u201d in light of his stance on \u201cpersonhood.\u201d While the pro-life Mr. Gardner is one of 132 House co-sponsors of the Life at Conception Act, he has disavowed his previous support for a state personhood amendment, saying he was concerned it would ban some forms of birth control.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gardner will do anything to hide his backwards agenda from Colorado women,\u201d said Udall for Colorado spokesperson Kristin Lynch in a statement. \u201cThe undeniable fact is Gardner continues to push radical, anti-woman measures that would ban common forms of birth control. One 30-second ad doesn\u2019t make up for that.\u201d\n\nShortly after Mr. Gardner\u2019s ad went online, the Udall campaign pointed to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concerns about the Republican\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cCost is a major factor in a woman\u2019s consistent use of contraception, and many women simply cannot afford the out of pocket costs of contraceptives without health insurance coverage,\u201d ACOG said in July.\n\nBut in a June 19 op-ed in the Denver Post, Mr. Gardner argued that making oral contraception available over the counter would bring down the price for a product that \u201cpresents very few risks or complications for the more than 10 million women who use it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also the convenience factor. \u201cFewer unneeded doctors\u2019 appointments mean fewer missed workdays and child care expenses, more productivity and more time with family,\u201d said Mr. Gardner. \u201cThis is particularly true for rural families like mine where doctors are not always nearby.\u201d\n\nReal Clear Politics has ranked the Colorado Senate race a toss-up, with Mr. Udall running one percentage point ahead of Mr. Gardner on average, less than any poll\u2019s error margin.\n\n\u2022 Tom Howell Jr. contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's getting harder to tell the Democrats from the Republicans in Colorado.
