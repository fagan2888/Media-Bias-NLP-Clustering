The inspector general found that miscommunication and a lack of coordination between these departments has led to confusion and could potentially lead to security lapses.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Cyber Security Failure Creates Greater Threat Than ISIS\n\n\u201cThis lack of understanding has led to conflicts regarding assignments and response to incidents,\u201d the report reads. \u201cUltimately, the confusion may have restricted DHS from using all of its cyber security capabilities or caused delays in its response and recovery efforts.\u201d\n\nThe IG\u2019s audit recommends that the DHS create a centralized cyber training program for all of its employees. Some agencies within the department are spending large amounts of money to create their own training courses, but a department-wide training program would be more cost-effective, the IG report says.\n\nDHS officials have also complained that mandated budget cuts have limited the scope and effectiveness of cybersecurity training programs. One employee told the auditors that budget cuts have prevented him from attending any formal cybersecurity training in four years, but that he has invested his own time and money in such training.\n\nWhile the report did say that DHS has taken steps to address these bureaucratic hindrances, additional actions are still needed to strengthen the department\u2019s vulnerabilities. \u201cIf not addressed, these deficiencies could result in the loss, misuse, modification, and unauthorized access to the Department\u2019s information systems and data,\u201d the report warns. In other words, the websites and computer systems of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Secret Service are vulnerable to attack.\n\nRelated: Cyber Security Office Deemed Dysfunctional\n\nThe newly established DHS Office of Cyber, Infrastructure and Resilience (CIR) has been tasked with improving relations across agencies and preventing redundancies and duplication of effort, but hasn\u2019t yet been able to fulfill its duties due to limited staffing and having been created only recently, according to the report.\n\nThe inspector general cited the need for the division to develop a strategic implementation plan, without which, it \u201ccannot ensure that DHS is effectively performing its cyber mission or ensure that components clearly understand one another\u2019s cyber responsibilities, capabilities, or key mission areas.\u201d\n\nDHS agreed with all of the recommendations that the inspector general offered and said it has already started working on some.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A U.S.", "title": "Department of Homeland Insecurity?
