More than 3.4 million languish in France\u2019s unemployment lines. In August, the jobless rate rose for the ninth consecutive month, leaving more than one-in-ten out of work.\n\nAcross Europe there are fears the malaise in the euro zone\u2019s second largest economy could re-ignite the crisis of confidence that almost destroyed the currency bloc two years ago.\n\nThe reformers versus the populists\n\nSocialist President Francois Hollande\u2019s popularity ratings have plummeted to record lows under 20 percent.\n\nHis 2012 election pledge to reverse the unemployment rate within months is widely mocked. The publication of a kiss-and-tell biography by the former first lady he spurned for a younger actress has added to public scorn.\n\nValls, a fresh face whom Hollande appointed in April, has failed to turn things around.\n\nA vote of confidence in the National Assembly next week will be close, with leftist ministers threatening to withdraw support from the prime minister. If Valls loses, France could be forced into snap elections, with the ultra-nationalist National Front riding high in the polls.\n\nOver the weekend, Valls warned that the far right stands \u201cat the gates of power.\u201d\n\nThe National Front emerged as France\u2019s biggest party in European Parliament elections in May. Polls show the nationalists\u2019 leader Marine Le Pen as the most popular choice among likely candidates to replace Hollande when his term ends in 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is no longer a glass ceiling that can stop our victory,\u201d Le Pen told a rally of her party\u2019s youth wing Sunday.\n\nTo weaken the far right, Valls has called for the left in France and across Europe to embrace reforms needed to regenerate the economy.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi faces similar problems. Italy is the only major euro zone economy still in recession. Its debt of $2.79 trillion and rising is a European record.\n\nLike Valls, Renzi also faces ferocious criticism from a firebrand populist, in the shape of former comedian Beppe Grillo.\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Matteo Renzi may be the one man who can save Italy\n\nRenzi and Valls both want German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other northern European leaders to ease European Union deficit targets which are forcing governments into austerity policies.\n\nEU officials have complained French reforms under Hollande have been too timid, but if it survives next week\u2019s confidence vote Valls\u2019 government will have more leeway to push reforms to loosen the state\u2019s role in the economy, reduce taxes and inject flexibility to labor markets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If economic woes overwhelm Hollande's government and buoy the far right, the whole eurozone could feel the impact", "title": "France is a mess, and Europe is worried", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If economic woes overwhelm Hollande's government and buoy the far right, the whole eurozone could feel the impact", "title": "France is a mess, and Europe is worried", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/13/france_is_a_mess_and_europe_is_worried/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_26906014-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If economic woes overwhelm Hollande's government and buoy the far right, the whole eurozone could feel the impact", "title": "France is a mess, and Europe is worried", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_26906014-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Paul Ames", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, economy, EU, Europe, France, GlobalPost", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f93\"", "article_summary": "Like Valls, Renzi also faces ferocious criticism from a firebrand populist, in the shape of former comedian Beppe Grillo.\nBy bringing together private investors and the state, it symbolizes how many in France believe the economy should be run.\nTo weaken the far right, Valls has called for the left in France and across Europe to embrace reforms needed to regenerate the economy.\nIf Valls loses, France could be forced into snap elections, with the ultra-nationalist National Front riding high in the polls.\nA vote of confidence in the National Assembly next week will be close, with leftist ministers threatening to withdraw support from the prime minister."}
