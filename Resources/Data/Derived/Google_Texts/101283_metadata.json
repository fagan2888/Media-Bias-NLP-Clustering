Instead, the money went to the U.N.\u2019s Green Climate Fund.\n\nIn a floor speech last week, I also shed light on the fact that Congress last December provided the Obama administration with authority to pull money from bilateral economic assistance to foreign countries.\n\nThey can use those funds to combat infectious diseases, if the administration believed there is an infectious disease emergency. In the middle of the Zika epidemic, the administration did use their authority to pull money from foreign aid and spend it, but they didn\u2019t use it for Zika.\n\nYou might ask\u2014so what did the administration spend the infectious disease money on earlier this year?\n\nYou guessed it\u2026 climate change.\n\nIn March, President Obama gave the United Nations $500 million out of an account under bilateral economic assistance to fund the U.N.\u2019s Green Climate Fund.\n\nCongress refused to allocate funding for the U.N. Climate Change Fund last year, so the president used this account designated for international infectious diseases to pay for his priority.\n\nWhile I understand that intelligent people can disagree on the human effects on the global climate, it is hard to imagine a reason why the administration would prioritize the U.N. Green Climate Fund over protecting the American people, especially pregnant women, from the Zika virus.\n\nUnfortunately, it gets worse.\n\nThe U.N. Green Climate Fund is connected to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an affiliated organization of the United Nations.\n\nThe UNFCCC recently accepted the \u201cState of Palestine\u201d as a signatory, which should trigger a U.S. funding prohibition. U.S. law forbids any taxpayer dollars to fund international organizations that recognize \u201cPalestine\u201d as a sovereign state.\n\nSo, the administration found a way to offend our ally Israel, delay the Zika response and, if Congress allows him, add another billion dollars to our national debt. That is a busy month.\n\nThe White House should not throw money at the U.N. while a vaccine for a virus known to cause severe, debilitating neurological birth defects is put on the back burner.\n\nZika is an important international crisis, but every crisis does not demand new \u201cemergency funding\u201d that is all debt. If there is a way to avoid more debt, we should take that option, it is what every family and every business does every day.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2016/05/obama_administration_stole_funds_to_combat_zika_to_pay_for_un_climate_change_fund.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Obama administration stole funds to combat Zika to pay for UN climate change fund"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02a3\"", "article_summary": "In March, President Obama gave the United Nations $500 million out of an account under bilateral economic assistance to fund the U.N.\u2019s Green Climate Fund.\nClimate Change Fund last year, so the president used this account designated for international infectious diseases to pay for his priority.\nThe U.N.
