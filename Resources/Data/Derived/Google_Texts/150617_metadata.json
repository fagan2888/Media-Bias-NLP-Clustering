(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) The Associated Press\n\nSEATTLE (AP) \u2014 The left front axle of the duck boat involved in a deadly Seattle accident was \"sheared off,\" but federal investigators said Saturday they don't know if it was damaged before the collision with a charter bus that killed four international college students.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board Member Earl Weener said the axle will be sent to a federal lab for further examination.\n\nWeener said it's too soon to know how the axle was damaged, or if it happened before the collision.\n\nWitnesses have said they saw the duck boat's left tire \"lock up\" Thursday as it swerved into a charter bus carrying international students over a bridge. Four North Seattle College students from Austria, China, Indonesia and Japan were killed.\n\n\"The left front axle was sheared off \u2014 for what reason yet, we don't know,\" Weener said at a news conference.\n\nInvestigators are also examining the charter bus and two other vehicles involved in the accident \u2014 a pickup truck and an SUV. And Weener said investigators would determine what the drivers of the duck boat and the charter bus were doing for the three days before the crash.\n\nThe federal probe is expected to take months, and Weener said \"it's way too early to say anything about a probable cause.\"\n\nThe investigation is being watched by other operators of the hugely popular duck boat tours.\n\n\"Safety and security are always a concern,\" said Cindy Brown of Boston Duck Tours. \"When anything happens in our industry, we're all acutely aware.\"\n\nBrown said her operation hasn't changed any procedures, but the owners and safety team would evaluate the situation after the federal investigation is complete.\n\nThe amphibious vehicle tours are offered throughout the United States and the world, including in Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale and London.\n\nIt's the first time the NTSB has looked into a land crash of the amphibious vehicles, which critics say are too dangerous for city streets. The federal agency has scrutinized duck tour vehicles several times when they've been in accidents on water.\n\nFederal investigators will spend a week or more on site.\n\nState regulators also have opened an investigation, which entails inspecting all vehicle and driver records.\n\nWashington Utilities and Transportation Commission spokeswoman Amanda Maxwell said the amphibious vehicle involved in the crash \u2014 known as Duck No. 6 \u2014 underwent regular annual examinations by a federally-certified inspector, most recently in 2015 and 2014, and met federal standards.\n\nThe state also reviews the company's fleet every few years, looking for systemic problems, Maxwell said. The last review, in December 2012, focused on a sample of the company's vehicles and did not include Duck No. 6.\n\n\"So far, our investigators are satisfied with the maintenance records\" of the duck tours vehicle, Maxwell said.\n\nMeanwhile, 15 people remain hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center, spokeswoman Susan Greggs said. One person remains in critical condition, eight are in serious condition and six in satisfactory condition, she said.\n\nBarb Graff, Seattle's director of the Office Emergency Management, said a private location has been established for families of the deceased and injured, where city, county and Red Cross workers are offering assistance and mental health counseling. Several hotels in Seattle are making rooms available to the families free of charge, Graff said, and Delta and Alaska airlines are helping with flights.\n\n\"We're doing everything we can to help families make it through the tough time,\" Graff said.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "us/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "Feds: Axle from duck boat in deadly crash 'sheared off'", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Federal investigators say the left front axle of a duck boat involved in a deadly Seattle accident was sheared off, but they don't know if it was damaged before the collision with a charter bus that killed four international college students.", "title": "Federal agency says axle from duck boat in deadly Seattle crash 'sheared off'", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2015/09/26/feds-axle-from-duck-boat-in-deadly-crash-sheared-off", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/48/3ce8be17934c82f6f507fb3adbe979/media:a82b72e7600748b99eb5187fcb918015SeattleTourBusCrash.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Federal investigators say the left front axle of a duck boat involved in a deadly Seattle accident was sheared off, but they don't know if it was damaged before the collision with a charter bus that killed four international college students.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds: Axle from duck boat in deadly crash 'sheared off'"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 26, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: Top News,Collections: US,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Federal investigators say the left front axle of a duck boat involved in a deadly Seattle accident was sheared off, but they don't know if it was damaged before the collision with a charter bus that killed four international college students."}, "article_summary": "And Weener said investigators would determine what the drivers of the duck boat and the charter bus were doing for the three days before the crash.\nWitnesses have said they saw the duck boat's left tire \"lock up\" Thursday as it swerved into a charter bus carrying international students over a bridge.\n\"The left front axle was sheared off \u2014 for what reason yet, we don't know,\" Weener said at a news conference.\nNational Transportation Safety Board Member Earl Weener said the axle will be sent to a federal lab for further examination.\nInvestigators are also examining the charter bus and two other vehicles involved in the accident \u2014 a pickup truck and an SUV."}
