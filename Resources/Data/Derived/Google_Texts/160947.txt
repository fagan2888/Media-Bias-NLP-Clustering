George Quinn, 47, has been appointed chief financial officer of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd., effective May 1, 2014, filling the post left vacant after the suicide of Pierre Wauthier, 53, on Aug. 26.

Quinn will step down on April 30 as CFO for Swiss Reinsurance Co. Ltd., where he has held the post for the last seven years. He joined Swiss Re in 1999 as chief accounting officer, then later served as regional CFO for Swiss Re Americas in New York.

In a statement, Zurich Insurance Group CEO Martin Senn welcomed Quinn to the company. “The wealth of experience he brings makes him a great addition to our group,” said Senn. “With his strong track record as CFO, George is very well positioned to contribute to the delivery on Zurich’s strategy and help take the company to the next level.”

Upon joining Zurich as CFO, Quinn also will become a member of Zurich’s Group Executive Committee.

Within days of Wauthier’s suicide, Zurich insurance chairman Josef Ackermann resigned from his post. Wauthier’s suicide note allegedly mentioned that it was difficult to work with Ackermann, according to press reports, though Ackermann said any such allegations were “unfounded.” Tom de Swaan has since been named chairman of the company.
