After a six-run effort in a loss at Cleveland last week, Morales was told he would be moved to the bullpen, a team source said.\n\nHe was available as a reliever Tuesday against Arizona.\n\nMorales\u2019 next start was scheduled for Friday in Denver against the Dodgers, but that spot will be filled by Butler, a right-hander currently with Double-A Tulsa, according to a major-league source.\n\nButler (4-4, 2.49 ERA with the Drillers) struggled in his last start, pitching 42/3 innings Saturday, allowing seven hits and two earned runs against the Midland (Texas) RockHounds.\n\nBut Rockies manager Walt Weiss recently said Butler was ready for the big leagues.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s not, then he\u2019s real close,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of development left. It\u2019s just the experience of being here. That\u2019s obviously what he lacks. But as far as developing a pitch or more command, I think the development is behind him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to make a black and white statement because he hasn\u2019t pitched at this level. Stuff-wise? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt,\u201d Weiss said of Butler.\n\nButler will be the first Rockies pitcher called up directly from Double-A since Chad Bettis in 2013. Bettis went 0-3 in eight starts after joing the Rockies in August before he joined the bullpen.\n\nJuan Nicasio, too, jumped from Double-A Tulsa to the Rockies in late May of 2011. He went 4-4 in 13 starts that season.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c83\"", "article_summary": "Coveted Rockies pitching prospect Eddie Butler will make his big-league debut Friday, replacing Franklin Morales, who moved to the bullpen Tuesday, a team source said.\nJuan Nicasio, too, jumped from Double-A Tulsa to the Rockies in late May of 2011.\nMorales\u2019 next start was scheduled for Friday in Denver against the Dodgers, but that spot will be filled by Butler, a right-hander currently with Double-A Tulsa, according to a major-league source.\nButler will be the first Rockies pitcher called up directly from Double-A since Chad Bettis in 2013.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of development left."}
