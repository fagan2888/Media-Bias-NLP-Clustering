Thiesfeldt, thank you for having your legislative aid call me yesterday to discuss school funding in Wisconsin. Though we did not reach agreement, I believe through our conversation that it is more apparent than ever that our school finance system needs to be reformed.\n\nFrom the Green Bay Press-Gazette article of Oct. 27, \u201cThe DPI estimates that for the 2015-16 school year, 1,226 new voucher students came from private schools, 308 came from public schools, 69 were not in school, 33 were home schooled and four came from out of state.\u201d These numbers show that no real cost savings will occur from boosting up the number of voucher students. We have only created a choice for 308 public school students; the rest are new costs for the property tax payer.\n\nOur current system is going to force more referendums on the citizens of our state with our current direction of school funding. AB481, a bill placing a restriction on referendums, is not the solution, with failed referendums creating even higher levels of insolvency \u2014 especially among our rural school districts.\n\nThank you for listening. We need to have a real conversation about school funding reform. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue but one that is shared by all the citizens of our great state. I have had similar conversations with representatives of both parties on this issue for the last 10 years. I look forward to continuing this conversation in the near future.\n\nDoug Mering\n\nVice president\n\nBaraboo School Board\n\nRead or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1X8VgnY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Numbers show no real cost savings will occur from boosting the number of voucher students", "og": {"site_name": "Action Reporter Media", "description": "Numbers show no real cost savings will occur from boosting the number of voucher students", "title": "Wisconsin\u2019s school finance system needs reform", "url": "http://www.fdlreporter.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/02/05/wisconsins-school-finance-system-needs-reform/79886200/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/fdlreporter.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Numbers show no real cost savings will occur from boosting the number of voucher students", "creator": "@fdlreporter", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c1d9eb5e26a0dc642ab7045fd62cc1f821b2411f/c=900-0-4376-3476&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/02/WIGroup/Marshfield/635900145743652759-mnh-20160127-byk-stratford-school-referendum-01.jpg", "title": "Wisconsin\u2019s school finance system needs reform", "site": "@fdlreporter", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884281456", "fb": {"app_id": 175275349169565}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "wisconsin schools, school budget cuts, voucher students, school vouchers, wisconsin school vouchers, school funding"}, "article_summary": "We have only created a choice for 308 public school students; the rest are new costs for the property tax payer.\nBuy Photo Stratford High School lockers (Photo: Jacob Byk/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy PhotoRep.
