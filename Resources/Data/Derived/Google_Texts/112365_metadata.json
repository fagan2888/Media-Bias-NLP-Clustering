There aren\u2019t a lot of data yet \u2013 and the facts that do exist are subject to more political spin than usual. Still, two casualty actuaries and a veteran medical malpractice underwriter were able to use demographic and health industry trends to predict how the medical malpractice world could change over the next decade.\n\nThey gave their forecasts at the Casualty Actuarial Society\u2019s Seminar on Reinsurance in New York, in a session titled \u201cThe Impact of the Affordable Care Act on Medical Professional Liability \u2013 an Update.\u201d\n\nThrough early April, seven to eight million people had signed up for healthcare insurance through exchanges, noted Elke Kirsten-Brauer, executive vice president and chief underwriting officer of MGIS, a national insurance program manager for medical professionals. She said about one-fourth did not have insurance before; within a few years, more than 22 million people will gain health insurance.\n\nThe doctor-patient relationship is becoming diluted.\n\nThe mere presence of more insureds will increase the number of medical malpractice claims, Kirsten-Brauer said. Compounding the issue is the fact that they are largely unfamiliar with the healthcare system. \u201cWe need to educate them\u201d on matters that will seem trivial, she said.\n\nAnother important trend: The doctor-patient relationship is becoming diluted. The old model of a single doctor diagnosing a patient\u2019s problem and then participating heavily at every step of treatment is giving way to expanded-care teams.\n\nThis is best seen with a new sort of doctor: the hospitalist. As casualty actuary Kevin Bingham of Deloitte Consulting explained, the term was coined in 1996 and is just now coming into vogue. These are doctors who monitor the hospital stays of patients \u2014 a job that the patients\u2019 physician would have taken on in the past.\n\nThe hospitalist is part of the new paradigm, with some parts looking familiar but others less so. The physician still diagnoses outside the hospital; the surgeon still operates. But nurses are taking on larger roles in the doctor\u2019s office, and the hospitalist picks up medical center duties. The physician re-enters for out-of-hospital follow-up.\n\nUnder this new model, patients are far less likely to be treated by a single professional. The series of professionals they move through is part of an accountable care organization, or ACO.\n\nThanks in large part to the Affordable Care Act, ACOs are growing rapidly. Hospitals are buying small physician practices countrywide, hiring the doctors and nurses, and blending them all into ACOs.\n\nThe new model bears a new set of risks for medical malpractice insurers, Bingham said. There is no continuity of care, as patients are handed off from professional to professional. They lose the personal connection to the medical community. \u201cThat\u2019s how most med mal claims start,\u201d Bingham said, \u201cwith a loss of connection with the patient.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, as hospitals buy up practices, the market for med mal for physicians shrinks. The exposure shifts to the hospitals that employ them.\n\nHospitals, being much larger than a physicians\u2019 practice, will absorb more of that risk, leaving insurers to compete harder for malpractice premiums, said Brian Ingle, an executive vice president at Willis Re and Fellow of the Casualty Actuarial Society.\n\nMeanwhile, the ACO will standardize treatment methods. Usually the standardized method will be sound. Occasionally, Ingle noted, it will not be. Responsibility could trace back to the deep-pocketed hospital. Suddenly, med mal insurers could be facing a mass tort \u2014 at an extreme, the \u201cnext asbestos\u201d the property/casualty industry dreads.\n\nIn response, Ingle said, insurers are considering expanding their medical malpractice coverage to handle exposures usually left to errors and omissions or directors and officers policies.\n\nWhile the ACA plays out, important demographic trends also will affect medical malpractice.\n\nAmericans are aging, and older patients often have more complaints, which translates into more care needs in an already overburdened system and an ever growing provider shortage.\n\nPhysicians are getting older and want to enjoy a better work-life balance, moving from a 60-hour work week to 45 or so.\n\nAmericans are getting heavier, leading to more cases of diabetes and more joint ailments like bad knees and hips.\n\nAll of these trends portend higher med mal exposures, Bingham pointed out.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together like", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together like", "title": "How Healthcare Reform Is Challenging Medical Malpractice", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2511, "identifier": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2014/06/hospital.jpg", "height": 1671}, "updated_time": "2014-06-16T07:57:33-04:00", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/magazines/features/2014/06/16/331904.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on medical malpractice insurance remains a bit of a puzzle, three insurance experts pieced together like", "title": "How Healthcare Reform Is Challenging Medical Malpractice", "image": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2014/06/hospital.jpg", "creator": "@ijournal", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2014-06-16", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "Features", "published_time": "2014-06-16T00:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-16T07:57:33-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c7f\"", "article_summary": "Still, two casualty actuaries and a veteran medical malpractice underwriter were able to use demographic and health industry trends to predict how the medical malpractice world could change over the next decade.\nThe mere presence of more insureds will increase the number of medical malpractice claims, Kirsten-Brauer said.\nThe new model bears a new set of risks for medical malpractice insurers, Bingham said.\nWhile the ACA plays out, important demographic trends also will affect medical malpractice.\nIn response, Ingle said, insurers are considering expanding their medical malpractice coverage to handle exposures usually left to errors and omissions or directors and officers policies."}
