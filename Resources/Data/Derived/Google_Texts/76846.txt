The allegation of a cover up would force a police chief of Greenwood Village to resign and still haunts the case of homicide victim Lawrence Ocrant.

Residents of this upscale Denver community gossiped that the affluent 52-year-old stockbroker had not actually shot himself in the head on May 20, 1984, but that he was murdered.

On that Sunday morning, Sueann “Susie” Ocrant told police that she went into her bedroom to try and wake her husband but she couldn’t.

But there was a gun in his right hand and a bullet hole in his head. A .32-caliber slug was removed from his head during an autopsy.

Police called the death a suicide. Ocrant tested positive for gunpowder residue, and the case was quickly closed.

An old Father’s Day photograph convinced his two grown children that something wasn’t quite right.

Their misgivings would soon blossom into a full-blown murder mystery.

The snapshot showed Ocrant sleeping in the same position as his body was found. His right fist was tucked under his chin and his left arm was stretched out.

It was the clincher, according to an Associated Press account.
