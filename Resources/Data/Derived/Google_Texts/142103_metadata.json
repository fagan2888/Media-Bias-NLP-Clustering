He makes news \u2014 and it\u2019s because he\u2019s representing Colorado at a naval ceremony Saturday in Rhode Island?\n\nA keel laying ceremony marks the official start of construction on a new ship. Williams will be attending the ceremony for the USS Colorado at the Quonset Point Facility in North Kingstown, R.I.\n\nWilliams, the former El Paso County clerk and recorder, took office in January, succeeding fellow Republican Scott Gessler, who regularly made headlines during his tenure. Gessler blamed media bias for some of the unflattering stories.\n\nWilliams laughed when told \u2014 facetiously, of course \u2014 that so far he was a disappointment because he hadn\u2019t created any controversy.\n\nWilliams, a Republican, took office in January after narrowly defeating Democrat Joe Neguse.\n\n\u201cIt is a great honor to represent our state at the keel laying ceremony of the USS Colorado.\u201d Williams said, in a news release. \u201cColoradans are very proud of their state. It\u2019s a place where people act boldly and achieve greatly. It\u2019s exciting to know that Colorado\u2019s name and our values will be carried around the world by such a magnificent submarine.\u201d\n\nWhen complete, the USS Colorado will be a high-tech attack submarine. It is the third Navy ship to bear the name Colorado, according to Williams\u2019 office. The first was an armored cruiser commissioned in 1905. During World War I, the vessel was renamed the Pueblo and used to transport soldiers and materials to England. The second USS Colorado was a battleship that took part in the invasion of Tarawa during World War II.\n\nAs Colorado secretary of state, Williams provided authority for the Navy to use the state seal as part of the keel laying ceremony.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Joe Neguse,keel ceremony,Scott Gessler,USS Colorado,Wayne Williams", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Republican Wayne Williams will represent the state at a \"keel\" ceremony Saturday in Rhode Island involving the USS Colorado.", "title": "Colorado Sec. of State Wayne Williams to attend naval event", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/03/06/secretary-state-wayne-williams-attend-ceremony-uss-colorado/117950/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2011/05/X00119_91-e1305128723433.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Republican Wayne Williams will represent the state at a \"keel\" ceremony Saturday in Rhode Island involving the USS Colorado.", "title": "Anchors A-Wayne!
