Two of our libraries are located on the East Side: Fox Point on the corner of Ives and Wickenden Streets, and Rochambeau on Hope Street near Rochambeau.\n\nIn February, besides holding their regular ongoing programs, each PCL library will host a special party for children during the school vacation week. The party at Fox Point will be on Tuesday, February 18 from 5-7pm. The party at Rochambeau will be on Thursday, February 20 from 2-4pm.\n\nThese parties will feature food, a chance to win an \u201ciPad mini\u201d and a free give-away of books donated by \u201cBooks are Wings\u201d to every child who comes. The Biomes Marine Biology Center will bring marine animals to the Rochambeau party for kids to look at and touch.\n\nSchool vacation week is also Amnesty Week at PCL. If you bring a canned food to your library, PCL will waive all your overdue fines (of course all your overdue library material has to be returned too). All canned food collected by PCL that week will donated to the RI Community Food Bank. (Last year PCL collected 1,700 pounds of food during Amnesty Week.)\n\nThroughout the month, PCL\u2019s ongoing activities are in full swing. At Fox Point the chess club meets every Tuesday from 3-6pm. Players of all ages and levels are welcome and instruction is provided. On Wednesdays from 10:30-11:30am there is \u201cCradle to Crayons\u201d storytelling and play for children 0-3 and their parents/caregivers.\n\nAt Rochambeau \u201cBaby Books,\u201d stories and movement for babies 0-2 years old and their parents/caregivers meets on Tuesdays at 10:30am. \u201cZumba4Toddlers\u201d \u2013 Spanish music, songs and movement for 1-3 year olds and their parents/caregivers \u2013 meets on Tuesdays at 11am. \u201cPreschool Storytime,\u201d stories and movement for 3-5 year old children is on Wednesdays at 10:30am . \u201cLEGO Club\u201d (age 5 and up) meets on Thursday and Fridays from 3-5pm. And on Thursday afternoons from 1:30-4:30pm the computer lab becomes the \u201cGame Club\u201d with Guild Wars, Minecraft, Roblox and Pok\u00e9mon MMO available to players age 9+.\n\nHomework Help for elementary, middle and high school students is available at Rochambeau on Mondays from 6-8pm, Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3-6pm and Fridays from 1-4pm. It is available at Fox Point on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 3-6pm.\n\nAll nine PCL libraries offer such activities and you are invited to come to all of them. To discover their locations and the schedule of their programs, all you have to do is visit the PCL website at www.provcomlib.org. You will discover that some of the libraries feature programs that especially relate to their particular neighborhood interests, such as \u201cLatino Movie Night\u201d on at the South Providence Library (first and third Tuesdays, February-April).\n\nOf course libraries are not just for children. PCL\u2019s trained navigators provide assistance on health insurance enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. At Rochambeau, drop-in hours for assistance is available on Mondays from 1:30-4:30pm.\n\nESL classes at various skill levels are available at Knight Memorial, Mt. Peasant, Olneyville, Smith Hill, South Providence, Wanskuck and Washington Park libraries (check website for levels and hours). Rochambeau features on-going adult study groups and events ranging from concerts to lectures in the evenings.\n\nAre you bored at home, or overrun with children who want something to do? Come to the libraries. They are free and they are yours.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Providence Community Library, community, public library, East Side, Fox Point, Rochambeau, party for children, school vacation activities in Providence, library amnesty week, iPad give-away, book give-away, activities for children in Providence, ESL classes in Providence", "og": {"site_name": "Providence Monthly", "description": "Providence Community Libraries have exciting events planned for February", "title": "What's Happening at Your Community Libraries", "url": "http://providenceonline.com/stories/Providence-Community-Library-Fox-Point-Rochambeau-party-children-East-Side-Monthly,10952", "image": "http://providencemedia.static2.adqic.com/uploads/original/1389730061_77fd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 13809307}, "keywords": "Providence Community Library, community, public library, East Side, Fox Point, Rochambeau, party for children, school vacation activities in Providence, library amnesty week, iPad give-away, book give-away, activities for children in Providence, ESL classes in Providence", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Providence Community Libraries have exciting events planned for February"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe44a0\"", "article_summary": "All nine PCL libraries offer such activities and you are invited to come to all of them.\nFebruary is a particularly lively month at the nine libraries of the Providence Community Library.\nAll canned food collected by PCL that week will donated to the RI Community Food Bank.\nIn February, besides holding their regular ongoing programs, each PCL library will host a special party for children during the school vacation week.\nIf you bring a canned food to your library, PCL will waive all your overdue fines (of course all your overdue library material has to be returned too)."}
