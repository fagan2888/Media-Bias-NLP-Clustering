We didn\u2019t play any defense for the whole game.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets\u2019 (20-35) have lost two straight games after the all-star break and trade of Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee. They\u2019ve also lost eight of their last nine games.\n\nThey get a chance to rebound Monday night at home against the Brooklyn Nets.\n\nOklahoma City (31-25) led by as many as 33 points in the second half and didn\u2019t play most of its main rotation of players in the fourth quarter.\n\nNuggets Mailbag: Pose a question for Christopher Dempsey\n\nThe Thunder played without reigning MVP Kevin Durant after he underwent a second surgery on his right foot Sunday to alleviate increasing soreness stemming from the fracture he suffered in October.\n\nThat didn\u2019t save the Nuggets from all-star Russell Westbrook, who finished just shy of a triple-double with 21 points, 17 assists and eight rebounds. Forward Serge Ibaka and center Enes Kanter each scored 20 points, and the team shot 52.2 percent overall.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t running anything super tricky on us on the offensive end, but they were just doing everything more crisp than we were, and they were going after the balls harder than we were,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said of the Thunder. \u201cThey were just running harder to the other end faster than we were getting back, and that\u2019s a collective effort from everybody that we have to have.\u201d\n\nGallinari, who scored 16 points, said getting better effort has to start with the team coming together.\n\n\u201cThere was no intensity from us tonight,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was from them for sure. They were looking like the team that wants to go to the playoffs.\u201d\n\nA few bright spots for the Nuggets including the return of point guard Ty Lawson from his one-game suspension. He led the team with 17 points.\n\n\u201cWe lost by I don\u2019t know how much, so I\u2019ll be more happy if I play like this and then we win a game,\u201d Gallinari said.\n\nShaw also got a chance to play new guys such as Will Barton and Joffrey Lauvergne, who combined for 16 points and six rebounds.\n\nTheir effort impressed both Shaw and Gallinari. It\u2019s just getting more effort from everybody else that\u2019s the trick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best thing about this, is we get to turn around and try again (Monday) night and try to put this one behind us,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our work cut out for us again. We have to get a win at home and get that good feeling and try to build off that.\u201d\n\nBROOKLYN AT DENVER\n\n\n\n7 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Brook Lopez: In the end, Lopez still toils for the Nets. It wasn\u2019t always supposed to be that way for the veteran center. But the NBA\u2019s trade deadline came and went, and Brooklyn rebuffed all offers \u2014 including the Nuggets\u2019 \u2014 for the offensive-minded 7-footer. There is a chance the Nuggets could make another run at him if they wanted; Lopez has a player option at the end of this season. He can opt out of the last year of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent. Until then, he\u2019s a player the Nuggets must find a way to stop.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Nuggets can\u2019t stay close to short-handed Oklahoma City Thunder", "title": "Denver Nuggets can\u2019t stay close to short-handed Oklahoma City Thunder", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/denver-nuggets-cant-stay-close-to-short-handed-oklahoma-city-thunder/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__nuggets-bartonp1.jpg", "height": 448}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__nuggets-bartonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T19:28:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T21:05:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf877\"", "article_summary": "OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Danilo Gallinari didn\u2019t pull any punches about how the Nuggets played Sunday night.\nOklahoma City (31-25) led by as many as 33 points in the second half and didn\u2019t play most of its main rotation of players in the fourth quarter.\nThe red-hot Thunder controlled nearly every facet of the game in a 119-94 rout of the Nuggets at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\nDenver was overmatched from the start against Oklahoma City, but then its defense fell apart along with its intensity.\nWe didn\u2019t play any defense for the whole game.\u201dThe Nuggets\u2019 (20-35) have lost two straight games after the all-star break and trade of Arron Afflalo and Alonzo Gee."}
