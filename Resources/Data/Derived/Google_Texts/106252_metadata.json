That surge in spending could put our healthcare system on a perilous path, especially given that healthcare utilization is climbing on the tailwind from aging baby boomers and healthcare reform.\n\nBetter drugs equals pricier medicine\n\nThanks to innovative new therapies, people are living longer, but they're doing so at a steep cost.\n\nA decade ago, medicines were primarily small molecule drugs that were easy to manufacture and duplicate. As a result, these drugs were less costly to prescribe and were more quickly challenged by generic alternatives once their patent protection ended.\n\nToday, medicines are increasingly complex biologics. These biologic drugs are medicines that are developed inside living systems such as plant or animal cells. Most biologics are complicated molecules or combination molecules that aren't easily replicated. The complexity of biologics often translates into increased efficacy over prior generation drugs, but it also makes them much more expensive to develop and manufacture. It also makes it incredibly difficult for generic drugmakers to duplicate them once their patents expire.\n\nThe ongoing shift toward these increasingly complex -- and correspondingly more expensive medicines -- has resulted in them accounting for an increasingly larger share of our healthcare dollars.\n\nAccording to Express Scripts, despite specialty drugs like biologics representing just 1% of all annual prescriptions, they accounted for a whopping 31.8% of drug spending last year.\n\nUnsustainable spending?\n\nAcross the tens of millions of health insurance members covered by Express Scripts pharmacy plans, spending on the average member climbed to $668.75 per year for traditional drugs and $311.11 for specialty medicines.\n\nAs you can see in the following table, annual spending per member increased by 6.4% year over year for traditional drugs and by 30.9% for specialty drugs. In both instances, higher drug prices were overwhelmingly behind the increases.\n\nIf left unchecked, drug spending growth of this magnitude could be unsustainable. In 2013, IMS Health reported that U.S. spending on medicine clocked in at about $329 billion.\n\nIf spending increases by 13.1% per year over the next 20 years, the amount spent annually on prescription medicine would surpass $3.8 trillion (yes, with a \"t\").\n\nTaking matters into hand\n\nSuch a surge in drug spending would undeniably put patients at risk. Medical costs are the biggest reason for personal bankruptcy, particularly among patients with diseases like HIV and cancer.\n\nIn an attempt to blunt the risk to the system posed by runaway drug costs, pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, like Express Scripts and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) -- the two largest PBMs -- are rethinking how they pay for drugs.\n\nIn December, Express Scripts negotiated a steep discount to AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) new hepatitis C drug Viekira Pak by offering exclusivity. In January, CVS Health similarly orchestrated a discount for Gilead Sciences' (NASDAQ:GILD) competing hepatitis C drugs, also in exchange for exclusivity. Express Scripts estimates that its deal with AbbVie will save its clients $1 billion annually.\n\nIn addition to more aggressive price contracts with drugmakers, healthcare payers are also developing programs that can increase patient adherence to medicine to lower the risk of costly future healthcare events, as well as programs to increase the use of generic alternatives.\n\nPBM programs that increase the use of lower cost generics could prove to be critical. Despite biologics' difficult-to-copy nature, technology advances are helping generic drugmakers develop biosimilars. While not exact copies, these biosimilars deliver similar efficacy to their brand name counterparts. So far, biosimilars have been a bigger story in Europe than in the U.S.; however, the FDA approved its first biosimilar this month when it gave Novartis' Sandoz unit the go-ahead to begin marketing its biosimilar of the top-selling cancer drug Neupogen. That approval is likely to be the first of many over the coming years.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nThe financial stakes are high for patients and drugmakers. If prices are too low, it could force drug developers to focus only on diseases that offer the biggest payoff. That could derail advances in a range of orphan diseases. However, if prices for medicine continue to grow at this rate, it's unlikely that the system will be able to afford it. Clearly, a middle ground is not only necessary, but in the best interest of everyone. Finding that middle ground, however, may remain difficult.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "13:01", "date": "2015-03-15T17:01:00Z", "description": "Express Scripts reports that spending on medicine surged by 13.1% in 2014.", "ResponsiveALP": "1Ses_2things-v-single_2-things_50", "author": "Todd Campbell", "promo": "Express Scripts reports that spending on medicine surged by 13.1% in 2014.", "twitter": {"description": "Express Scripts reports that spending on medicine surged by 13.1% in 2014.", "site": "@themotleyfool", "title": "Is This Number the Scariest Healthcare Statistic Out There? --  The Motley Fool"}, "headline": "Is This Number the Scariest Healthcare Statistic Out There?", "og": {"site_name": "The Motley Fool", "description": "Express Scripts reports that spending on medicine surged by 13.1% in 2014.", "title": "Is This Number the Scariest Healthcare Statistic Out There? --  The Motley Fool", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/03/15/is-this-number-the-scariest-healthcare-statistic-o.aspx", "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F161647%2Fesrx2.JPG&h=630&w=1200&op=resize", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 50808187550, "page_id": 7240312795, "app_id": 50808187550}, "bureau": "usmf-health-care", "STORY_UID": "b61dd042-c80b-11e4-88a9-0050569d32b9", "pitch": 1486, "msvalidate.01": "8D40D58712924715BAA79D135A6C8DDA", "gsa_date": "2015 03 15", "tickers": "GILD,ESRX,CVS,ABBV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0b94\"", "article_summary": "Express Scripts estimates that its deal with AbbVie will save its clients $1 billion annually.\nTaking matters into handSuch a surge in drug spending would undeniably put patients at risk.\nIn December, Express Scripts negotiated a steep discount to AbbVie's (NYSE:ABBV) new hepatitis C drug Viekira Pak by offering exclusivity.\nIf left unchecked, drug spending growth of this magnitude could be unsustainable.\nThat surge in spending could put our healthcare system on a perilous path, especially given that healthcare utilization is climbing on the tailwind from aging baby boomers and healthcare reform."}
