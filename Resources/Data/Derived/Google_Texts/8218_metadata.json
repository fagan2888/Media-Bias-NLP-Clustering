Although FDA approved Zarxio in March 2015 as the first biosimilar in the US, the product did not actually come to market until September because of a Federal Circuit ruling on a provision in the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), which was signed into law in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe Federal Circuit turned this mere notice provision into a grant of 180 days of additional exclusivity for all biological products beyond the exclusivity period Congress expressly provided\u2014delaying the launch of all future biosimilars by six months,\u201d Sandoz argues.\n\nSandoz, the biosimilar and generic arm of Novartis, claims in its petition that not only did it provide Amgen with more than 180 days\u2019 notice of its intent to market Zarxio, giving Amgen time to bring suit (which it did) and seek a patent-based injunction (which it did not), but Amgen\u2019s exclusivity period for Neupogen had expired, as Amgen \u201calready had enjoyed 24 years of exclusivity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Federal Circuit\u2019s erroneous interpretation will delay the availability of all biosimilars for 180 days more than Congress intended\u2014even if the sponsor has no valid patent claims and even if the sponsor already has had the opportunity to pursue any valid claims,\u201d Sandoz says.\n\nThe Sandoz petition comes as the Federal Circuit in October declined to rehear its decision on the notice provision.\n\nAmgen v. Apotex\n\nAmgen is also dealing with another lawsuit against Apotex, which previously argued that by complying with the manufacturing and patent information exchanges, which are part of the so-called \u201cpatent dance\u201d established by the BPCIA, Apotex was allowed to opt out of providing Amgen with the 180-day notice of marketing.\n\nA little more than a month ago, the Generic Pharmaceutical Association\u2019s Biosimilars Council sided with Apotex, arguing that Congress never meant for the 180-day notice provision to add six months of exclusivity to biologics.\n\nIn its ruling, the Federal Circuit said that the patent dance is optional, though 180-days\u2019 pre-marketing notice can only be applied after a 351(k) application has been approved by FDA.\n\nOn 4 February, Amgen filed its reply brief, which is currently on appeal before the Federal Circuit. In it, Amgen noted that the 180-day period is designed to allow the reference product sponsor that the biosimilar is based on, a discrete period in which to seek preliminary injunctive relief.\n\n\u201cApotex cannot avoid the requirement of a statute by the specifics of this particular case. Sandoz, too, touted the peculiarities of its own position as a reason not to give 180 days\u2019 notice, but the panel majority rejected this: \u2018A statute must be interpreted as it is enacted, not especially in light of particular, untypical facts of a given case,\u2019\u201d Amgen said.\n\n\u201cThe 180-day notice period would apply to Apotex even if it were right that Amgen had no additional patents on which to seek a preliminary injunction. It is, as this Court held in Amgen v. Sandoz, a standalone provision,\u201d Amgen said.\n\nIndustry group BIO also filed an amicus curiae brief Tuesday in support of Amgen, noting: \u201cThe BPCIA\u2019s provision requiring biosimilar applicants to provide notice of commercial marketing following FDA approval is an integral part of the balance achieved by the BPCIA, and it furthers Congress\u2019 goal of ensuring that the parties can resolve any patent disputes prior to the launch of the biosimilar product. The commercial marketing notice provision cannot meaningfully serve its intended function, however, if, as Apotex argues in this case, applicants are in many circumstances free to ignore it.\u201d\n\nNext Steps\n\nAccording to the Big Molecule Watch blog, the Supreme Court is likely to rule on the Sandoz petition before its summer recess, but if it grants the case, it likely won\u2019t hear it until next fall and likely won\u2019t make a decision until 2017.\n\n\u201cUnder the Supreme Court\u2019s rules, it is conceivable that Amgen could file a \u2018conditional cross-petition\u2019 \u2013 a petition asking that, if (and only if) the Court takes up Sandoz\u2019s petition, it also take up the issue on which Sandoz won and Amgen lost in the Federal Circuit: whether the BPCIA\u2019s information disclosure provisions are \u2018mandatory.\u2019 Conditional cross-petitions are rarely granted; if the Court takes such a cross-petition, it generally does to ensure that its review of an issue is not unduly circumscribed by the question as drafted by the petitioner,\u201d the blog noted.\n\nSandoz Petition for a Writ Certiorari", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "FDA, US, News, Submission and registration, Regulatory intelligence, Regulatory strategy, Postmarket surveillance, Government affairs, Compliance, Business Skills, Biologics and biotechnology", "Description": "<p>Sandoz has called on the US Supreme Court to review a lower court ruling that found biosimilar makers must wait an additional six months after US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval before bringing their product to market.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Title": "Sandoz Petitions Supreme Court to Rule on Biosimilars"}, "article_summary": "The Sandoz petition comes as the Federal Circuit in October declined to rehear its decision on the notice provision.\nIt is, as this Court held in Amgen v.
