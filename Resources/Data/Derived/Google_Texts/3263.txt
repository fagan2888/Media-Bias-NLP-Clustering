While it's bitter cold, it will not stop many Connecticut residents from taking part in an ice fishing tournament over the weekend.

When the temperature drops, so do their fishing lines in Wethersfield.

The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection estimates that as many as 20,000 people ice fish in the winter, including Gary Brummett.

"It's alright. The sun's out, you know, if you dress right for it," Brummett, who owns Connecticut Outfitters on the Silas Deane Highway in Wethersfield, said. "I mean, the sun is warming me up nice!"

He's also hosting an ice fishing tournament all day Saturday on Wethersfield Cove and it's open to fishing fanatics such as Adam Grella, who tries to stay warm in his shelter.

"You can catch anything from little blue gills to striped bass, walleye, carp, pike," Grella said.

An obvious concern is how thick is the ice when you're out on the Wethersfield Cove, but experts told Eyewitness News there's absolutely nothing to worry about.

"As you said coming out here, getting over the 'I'm walking on a frozen surface' gets difficult," Grella said.

According to DEEP, 4 inches is generally safe. But this month has been so cold, they estimate most is at least 2 feet thick.

For these fisherman, it doesn't worry them and they're on board, hook, line and sinker.

"I'm an outdoors guy and I just couldn't spend three months inside, it's awful," Brummett said. "It's awful to try and stay inside for that long."

Saturday's event is open to the public and you can't miss them if you head to Wethersfield Cove starting bright and early.

People interested in participating just need a fishing license if you are 16 years old or older.
