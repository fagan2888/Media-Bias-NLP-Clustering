After that, if you haven\u2019t had coverage this year and haven't signed up, you could face a penalty under the federal health law commonly known as Obamacare.\n\nThis Obamacare Q&A includes questions about what to do about that deadline if your coverage is slated to run out later this year, what the government can and can't do to you if you don't get insurance, what the new plans cover, and the possibility that some people might have to repay some or all of the federal funds used to discount their premiums.\n\nIf you have a question about Obamacare, email Mirror Health Reporter Arielle Levin Becker at alevinbecker@ctmirror.org.\n\nQMy family and I are covered by HUSKY (Connecticut\u2019s Medicaid program), but we won\u2019t be eligible after May. After that I may need Obamacare coverage, but everything I\u2019ve read says I need to sign up for it before March 31. So should I sign up now? I don\u2019t want to lose the free prescriptions and doctor visits that HUSKY covers if I don\u2019t have to yet, but can I sign up for Obamacare after March 31?\n\nAMarch 31 is the last date for people who want individual-market insurance in 2014 to sign up for coverage. But there\u2019s an exception: If you find yourself in need of insurance later in the year because of a change in circumstances, such as losing a job, getting divorced or losing eligibility for Medicaid, you\u2019ll be able to request a \u201cspecial enrollment period\u201d and sign up at that time.\n\nSo in your case, there\u2019s no reason to drop your HUSKY coverage now. Instead, you can maintain your current coverage until it ends and request a special enrollment period to get insurance to replace it after May. You\u2019ll have 60 days from the date of the change in circumstances (in your case, the end of your HUSKY eligibility) to sign up for new coverage.\n\nTo learn more about requesting a special enrollment period, click here.\n\nQI'm out of work, signed up for insurance through the exchange and got a government subsidy for my monthly premium payments. If I get a job and switch to my new employer\u2019s health care policy, will I have to pay the subsidy back to the government? And if so, how and when?\n\nAYou might have to repay a portion of the subsidy, but whether you do and how much it would be depends on your total income for 2014.\n\nIf you end up owing money, you\u2019d pay it to the government when you file your taxes next year.\n\nHere\u2019s how this works:\n\nThe subsidies people get to discount their premiums are actually tax credits, paid in advance to your insurance company when your monthly premiums are due. (You can also elect to have some or all of the tax credit paid to you as a lump sum tax refund next year, but that means you\u2019ll get less up-front assistance paying your insurance premiums each month.)\n\nThe amount of the tax credit you get in advance is based on an estimate of what your total income will be this year. The actual amount you\u2019re entitled to won\u2019t be known until the end of the year, when it\u2019s clear how much you actually earned. And if there\u2019s a difference, that will be reconciled through your taxes.\n\nIf your income was lower than estimated when you applied for coverage, you could be entitled to a larger tax credit and get some money back. If your income was higher than estimated when your subsidy was calculated, you could owe money to the government for some or all of the cost of the tax credit you received.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, the amount you have to repay will be based on your income. For people who earn below 400 percent of the poverty level \u2013 that is, people whose income qualifies them for a subsidy \u2013 the amount of repayment will be capped. (At most, a family earning just below 400 percent of the poverty level could have to repay $2,500.)\n\nBut if at the end of the year, it turns out that your income was too high to have received any subsidy, you\u2019ll have to pay back the full amount.\n\nConnecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT, asks people whose incomes change to report it within 30 days. That way, the exchange can adjust their subsidies to match their new income levels and reduce the need to repay any of the tax credit later.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at what the maximum repayment limits are:\n\nMaximum repayment for Obamacare People who receive federal financial assistance to discount their insurance premiums could have to repay some of the money if their incomes turn out to be higher than anticipated when applying for coverage. People whose 2014 income is above 400 percent of the poverty level will have to repay the full amount of federal aid they received to buy insurance. But for people whose incomes were lower, the amount they\u2019d have to pay back will be capped, based on their income and family size. To find the maximum amount you\u2019d have to repay, select your family size and find your income level in the chart below. 1. Family Size \u2192 1 2 3 4 5 6 2. Income Level \u2192 0-200% of poverty level 200-300% of poverty level 300-400% of poverty level 400%+ of poverty level Source: US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of the Treasury\n\nQI\u2019m 28 and don\u2019t have a job or income. I don\u2019t really want health insurance. What do I do about Obamacare? I don\u2019t want to be locked up for not having insurance. How do I avoid it?\n\nAThe government can\u2019t put you in prison for not having health insurance. The penalty for not having insurance is a fine: 1 percent of your income or $95, whichever is higher (the amount will rise next year).\n\nIf you don\u2019t have any income at all, you\u2019re exempt from the mandate for having coverage. People whose income is too low to require them to file a tax return (usually below about $10,000 for a single person) don\u2019t have to pay a penalty for not having coverage.\n\nBut if you live in Connecticut or one of the 25 other states that expanded their Medicaid programs as part of Obamacare, chances are you qualify for health care coverage through that program at little or no cost to you (in Connecticut, Medicaid clients don\u2019t pay anything for coverage).\n\nQI\u2019m 35, single and earn $37,000 per year. Is there a health insurance plan that covers substance abuse treatment?\n\nAYes. In fact, under Obamacare, all health plans sold or renewed starting this year must cover a set of 10 \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d including substance abuse and mental health services.\n\nOther essential benefits that many individual-market plans didn\u2019t previously cover include maternity care and pediatric dental and vision care.\n\nAny health plan you buy through your state\u2019s exchange or outside the exchange will have to cover those benefits. But depending on your plan\u2019s benefit design, you might have to pay a significant amount of money out-of-pocket when you get care. The lowest-priced plans available to most people shopping on Connecticut\u2019s exchange, for example, have deductibles that are $5,000 or higher, meaning that you\u2019d have to spend $5,000 on medical care before the plan begins covering the costs (with the exception of certain preventive services, which your plan must cover at no charge to you). Plans with higher premiums tend to have lower deductibles, so it might be worth considering the higher monthly fee if you know you\u2019re going to need more services.\n\nBecause your income is below 400 percent of the poverty level, you would qualify for a health plan with discounted premiums, as long as you buy your insurance through the exchange. You could still buy a plan outside the exchange, but you wouldn\u2019t get the discount.\n\nPlans that were sold or renewed before Jan. 1 don\u2019t have to cover all the essential health benefits, but those plans can\u2019t be sold to new customers anymore because they don\u2019t meet the health law\u2019s requirements.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/25/obamacare-qa-deadline-scramble-repaying-subsidies-and-what-the-new-plans-cover/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, HUSKY, Medicaid, Obamacare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/25/obamacare-qa-deadline-scramble-repaying-subsidies-and-what-the-new-plans-cover/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "This Obamacare Q&A includes questions about what to do about that deadline if your coverage is slated to run out later this year, what the government can and can't do to you if you don't get insurance, what the new plans cover and the possibility that some people might have to repay some or all of the federal funds used to discount their premiums.", "title": "Obamacare Q&A: Deadline scramble, repaying subsidies and what the new plans cover", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/25/obamacare-qa-deadline-scramble-repaying-subsidies-and-what-the-new-plans-cover/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2014/01/obamacare.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/03/25/obamacare-qa-deadline-scramble-repaying-subsidies-and-what-the-new-plans-cover/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3002\"", "article_summary": "After that I may need Obamacare coverage, but everything I\u2019ve read says I need to sign up for it before March 31.\nNext Monday is the final day to enroll in individual-market health insurance for 2014.\nIncome Level \u2192 0-200% of poverty level 200-300% of poverty level 300-400% of poverty level 400%+ of poverty level Source: US Department of Health and Human Services and Department of the TreasuryQI\u2019m 28 and don\u2019t have a job or income.\nAThe government can\u2019t put you in prison for not having health insurance.\n(At most, a family earning just below 400 percent of the poverty level could have to repay $2,500.)"}
