The path toward approval of the controversial pipeline was cleared a bit last week by a State Department report that found minimal environmental impact in building the pipeline. So Republicans are leaning toward seeking a repeal of so-called risk corridors in the health-reform law instead. The risk corridors reimburse insurers buffeted by fewer healthy people signing up than they had originally expected, acting as a cost buffer during the experimental early years of health care reform.\n\nThe leadership aide described repealing the risk corridors as Republicans\u2019 more likely target. Many Republicans are calling the program a government bailout of insurance companies, including Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, who chairs a coalition of House conservatives. \u201cI think it would be a real tough position to sell to say that when we\u2019re running out of money, when we\u2019re maxing out our credit card, we should also be borrowing money from China to bail out insurance companies,\u201d Scalise told TIME last month.\n\n(MORE: Republicans Offer Little Clarity on Debt-Ceiling Strategy)\n\nUnder the risk corridors, the Department of Health and Human Services would pay insurers to offset risk pools that are too heavy on older, sicker Americans \u2014 unless a surprisingly high number of healthy people sign up. The program will only run through 2016, according to the American Academy of Actuaries, because \u201cas more data becomes available on the health spending patterns of the newly insured, the ability to set premiums accurately should improve, thereby reducing the need for risk corridors.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives Pat Tiberi, Republican of Ohio, and Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, told TIME on Tuesday that they could support the leadership\u2019s strategy on either the risk corridors or the pipeline. But the State Department report easing the way for Keystone might make it less likely that Republicans use the pipeline as a bargaining chip. \u201cKeystone ought to be approved on its own merits; it doesn\u2019t need to be tied to the debt ceiling,\u201d Scalise told the Washington Post.\n\nWhatever the Republican demand is, Kinzinger said it would have to be \u201ca reasonable opening position\u201d that could bring over some Democrats \u2014 a tall order considering that Democrats have been almost entirely unified in insisting that they will only raise the debt ceiling with no strings attached.\n\n\u201cLast thing you want to do is ask for the moon again and then have a divided government,\u201d Kinzinger said.\n\n(MORE: GOP, Dems Set to Collide in \u2018High-Risk Corridor\u2019)\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner has the weaker hand, having already said he won\u2019t force a cataclysmic debt default, so any possible ask will be extremely difficult to deliver. Some Republicans, still smarting from the blame their party took over last year\u2019s government shutdown, want to hold their fire this time. \u201cWe should bring up a clean debt ceiling, let the Democrats pass it, and just move on,\u201d Representative Ra\u00fal R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, told the Post.\n\nBut there are still conservative firebrands in the caucus that want to push for more. \u201cThere are some of us that think the President shouldn\u2019t get any more money until he can explain the issues around Benghazi,\u201d Representative Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, told TIME, referring to the 2012 attack on an American consulate in Libya that has become cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for conservatives.\n\nThe federal government will reach its borrowing limit on Friday, but the Treasury Department can use extraordinary accounting measures to delay the need for a debt-ceiling increase until the end of the month.\n\nMORE: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew Warns Time Is Running Out to Lift Debt Ceiling", "article_metadata": {"description": "With some House Republicans spoiling for another fight over lifting the country's borrowing limit, leadership is eyeing a repeal of an obscure provision in the new health law over approval of the Keystone XL pipeline as its price for cooperation.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Republicans leaning toward repeal of an Obamacare provision as their price, instead of the Keystone XL Pipeline", "title": "House GOP Eyes Debt-Ceiling Fight Prize | TIME.com", "url": "http://swampland.time.com/2014/02/04/debt-ceiling-house-gop-keystone-xl-pipeline-obamacare/", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/adam-kinzinger.jpg?w=753", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "budgets, congress, house, john boehner, budget, congress, debt ceiling, house, keystone pipeline, keystone xl pipeline, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "news_keywords": "budgets, congress, house, john boehner, budget, congress, debt ceiling, house, keystone pipeline, keystone xl pipeline, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceb83\"", "article_summary": "MORE: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew Warns Time Is Running Out to Lift Debt Ceiling\n\u201cKeystone ought to be approved on its own merits; it doesn\u2019t need to be tied to the debt ceiling,\u201d Scalise told the Washington Post.\nSo Republicans are leaning toward seeking a repeal of so-called risk corridors in the health-reform law instead.\nThe leadership aide described repealing the risk corridors as Republicans\u2019 more likely target.\n\u201cWe should bring up a clean debt ceiling, let the Democrats pass it, and just move on,\u201d Representative Ra\u00fal R.
