(John Locher/Associated Press)\n\nThe value of free advice is measured by what you pay for it, and Republicans don\u2019t usually ask me for mine.\n\nNonetheless, the GOP\u2019s presidential race is one of the most fascinating political brawls in years. It\u2019s about to hit full stride, and I can\u2019t resist kibitzing. I know the leading candidates will take my guidance for what it\u2019s worth.\n\nMarco Rubio: You have three related problems. You\u2019re trying to appeal to every wing of the party, which means that none regards you as one of its own. There is no state in the early going that you can consider an obvious bet. And, to put it charitably, you do not look like a person of conviction.\n\nYou were pro-immigration until you weren\u2019t. You optimistically embraced the changing nature of our nation until you ran an ad about \u201call of us who feel out of place in our own country.\u201d You left McCainville to enter Trumpland.\n\nYour supporters see your weaknesses as your strengths: Yes, you might be well-positioned to pull all parts of the party together. But in appeasing everyone, you\u2019re creating the impression, as an Iowa pastor told my Post colleagues Sean Sullivan and David Fahrenthold last month, that you\u2019re a candidate \u201ctalking out of both sides of his mouth.\u201d\n\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump released his first television ad spot on Jan. 4. (Donald Trump)\n\nIf you lose, this will be the principal reason. You need to show some conviction, perhaps by taking at least one inconvenient stand. In primaries especially, winning requires you to decide whose votes you\u2019ll write off. You won\u2019t make it by remaining everyone\u2019s second or third choice. Somebody\u2019s got to trust you deeply.\n\nJeb Bush: For me, you\u2019re the biggest surprise. I really thought you\u2019d be a better candidate. When I saw you speak in early 2014, you were loose and confident, conveying a real sense of optimism about the country. I thought enough voters, even in a gloomy Republican Party, would find this appealing.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t panned out that way. You made a lot of mistakes and seem unhappy in your work. Your name is a problem. Most liberals don\u2019t realize how many conservatives view your brother as a big-government guy. Meanwhile, many in the so-called establishment wing worry that another Bush won\u2019t win.\n\nYou at least found a purpose when you went after Donald Trump in last year\u2019s final debate. The paradox: The only way you\u2019ll have a chance of winning is to forget about winning. Relax. Run as the guy you said you\u2019d be, the upbeat candidate of inclusion. Marry your attacks on Trump to a positive vision of a welcoming GOP. Be the candidate whom Republicans horrified by Trump and Ted Cruz can repair to with pride. It may not work. But it\u2019s the only thing that can, and you might at least start enjoying the campaign.\n\nJohn Kasich: I\u2019ve always had a soft spot for you because, as governor, you supported the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare in Ohio. Alas, most people in your party don\u2019t agree with me. Still, you sound best when you talk like a compassionate conservative because that\u2019s the person you want to be. Why not go for it? If Jeb follows the strategy I just outlined for him, you guys might collide. But you have said your main worry is how St. Peter will judge you at the end. Run a campaign for him.\n\nTed Cruz and Chris Christie: Philosophically, you guys aren\u2019t my cup of tea. But I have to admit: You\u2019re running the campaigns I would run if I were you. Ted, you have the focus Marco doesn\u2019t. You\u2019re trying to pull together all the right-wing groups in the party, and they happen to constitute a huge part of it. Chris, you\u2019re betting it all on New Hampshire. The right move. You\u2019re campaigning up there as if you were running for governor. Also exactly right.\n\nBen Carson: Please go back to neurosurgery or inspirational speaking. You\u2019re gifted at both.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate John Kasich (R-Ohio) released his first television ad in New Hampshire on Jan. 3. (John Kasich)\n\nRand Paul: Stay in for a few more debates to make your libertarian case on foreign policy. You\u2019re sparking a necessary discussion. But you know perfectly well you have to go back to Kentucky soon to protect your Senate seat.\n\nDonald Trump: I have nothing useful to say, and you\u2019d pay no attention anyway. But I do owe you a debt of gratitude. I have a book coming out in a couple of weeks called \u201cWhy the Right Went Wrong.\u201d Because of you, people are especially interested in figuring this out. So, just this once: Thank you.\n\nRead more from E.J.
