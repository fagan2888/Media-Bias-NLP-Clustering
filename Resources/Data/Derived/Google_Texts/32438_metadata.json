So my girlfriend had her physical exam. She\u2019s going again to have a blood & urine test but then the doctors will find out she is pregnant. Can she do anything to avoid so the doctors don\u2019t tell her parents the pregnancy results ? Btw that is part of the physical exam. She is about to turn 17in a month.\n\nHigh Schooler in New Jersey\n\nDear High Schooler,\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \u2014 which governs confidentiality of medical information \u2014 allows the doctor to tell a minor patient\u2019s parent about the pregnancy. Just because the law allows it does not mean that the doctor is required to divulge it however. For example, if the patient\u2019s mother might physically abuse her based upon knowing the information, the doctor can withhold it. See HHS\u2019s summary here.\n\n\n\nNew Jersey law also allows the doctor to keep the test results confidential. Again, it does not require confidentiality. If the doctor felt that the parent should be notified for the patient\u2019s best interests, he or she could do that. See New Jersey\u2019s summary here.\n\n\n\nYour girlfriend should talk with the doctor about whether her parents will be informed. This is of course only a small part of dealing with the pregnancy.\n\nRecommend this article", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "Health Unsurance", "description": "Does my girlfriend's doctor have to tell her mother if she is pregnant?\u00a0 So my girlfriend had her physical exam.\u00a0 She's going again to have a blood & urine test but then the doctors will find o...", "title": "Doctor can tell parent about teen's pregnancy", "url": "http://healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/2014/11/07/children/doctor-can-tell-parent-about-teens-pregnancy/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/files/2013/10/LR_photo_2013-75x75.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@bdnmaineblogs", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-07T15:39:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-07T15:40:22+00:00", "author": "http://healthunsurance.bangordailynews.com/author/lridd2011/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a8c\"", "article_summary": "Can she do anything to avoid so the doctors don\u2019t tell her parents the pregnancy results ?\nHigh Schooler in New JerseyDear High Schooler,The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) \u2014 which governs confidentiality of medical information \u2014 allows the doctor to tell a minor patient\u2019s parent about the pregnancy.\nDoes my girlfriend\u2019s doctor have to tell her mother if she is pregnant?\nNew Jersey law also allows the doctor to keep the test results confidential.\nIf the doctor felt that the parent should be notified for the patient\u2019s best interests, he or she could do that."}
