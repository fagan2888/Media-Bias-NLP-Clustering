Ideally, this would take place when reporters provide a look at reality when politicians lie, despite pressure from the same politicians to not report the truth.\n\nHowever, there is another way to hold a politician accountable: Stop taking the politician seriously by not reporting what he or she said. I propose that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has long passed the point of \u201cunseriousness\u201d to \u201charmful to society,\u201d and this should be reflected in reporters and editors refusing to publish what he says.\n\nConsider just a handful of truly harmful things Reid has done or said in the last few weeks, and one example from 2012:\n\nIn 2012, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) received some level of infamy for claiming that Mitt Romney didn\u2019t pay taxes for a decade. Naturally, the charges were not backed by any evidence, yet the mainstream media treated Reid\u2019s comments as though they had legitimacy. At the time, I asked if Reid had violated Senate Ethics rules by essentially campaigning on the Senate floor.\n\nMore recently, Townhall\u2019s Guy Benson hammered Reid for using his Koch brothers obsession as an excuse to block amendments to the unemployment insurance that is set to pass the Senate on Monday. As Guy put it in his headline: \u201cOld Man Still Muttering Incoherently About Koch Brothers\u201d\n\nMSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough attached Reid\u2019s tactic as \u201cthe stupidest strategy\u201d he has seen, but most mainstream and liberal media outlets have taken Reid seriously. They\u2019ve done this despite the probable abuse of power Reid\u2019s statements are, and Ed\u2019s point that at least one of Reid\u2019s anti-Koch efforts likely violates Senate Ethics rules.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just the Kochs Reid has gone after recently. He\u2019s also gone after the people sharing how the Affordable Care Act is hurting them \u2014 and then denied doing so. If you want to read about how arrogant and abusive of power this is, check out Guy\u2019s excellent takedown of Reid here. Justifiably and rightly, Guy is and was furious, and so should the rest of us be.\n\nReid\u2019s Koch habit \u2014 yes, yes, I used the cliched term; I couldn\u2019t help it \u2014 includes accusing the Koch brothers of associating with companies that circumvent sanctions on Iran. Lachlan Markay of the Washington Free Beacon showed that Reid has taken campaign donations from companies doing the exact same thing.\n\nAnd, finally, Reid recently said the minimum wage Democrats want \u2014 $10.10 per hour \u2014 was not picked arbitrarily, but to bring people out of poverty:\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid reiterated his \u201cno negotiations\u201d stance on the Democratic proposal to boost the minimum-wage to $10.10 per hour, despite calls for a deal from some red-state Democrats up for reelection in 2014. \u201cNo, there are none. Nope,\u201d Reid told reporters following a minimum-wage rally with union members and other Democratic leaders. \u201cThe reason we picked that number, $10.10, gets you out of poverty \u2014 $10 doesn\u2019t. $10.05 doesn\u2019t. We didn\u2019t pick that number just to be fun.\u201d The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.\n\nYou know what would actually help people get out of poverty? Eliminating the minimum wage so low-skilled minorities could work more, or repealing the Affordable Care Act, or tax reform, or cutting the budget, or pretty much anything else that wouldn\u2019t increase the cost of employees for employees. And does anyone believe Reid picked a $10.10 hourly wage because that\u2019s the way to help people out of poverty, rather than reasons of political gamesmanship? Why not go to $20/hour, Senator?\n\nLike the lies of President Obama on pretty much everything \u2014 whether his views on spying on Americans; war without authorization from Congress; fiscal responsibility; and the alleged benefits of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 the media would actually be doing its job to not report on what Reid says. But if it must report, fact-checks should accompany what is said in its articles and editorials, not simply an unchallenged and uncorrected reporting of these lies and other brazen violations of the public trust.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Enough of the lies.", "title": "The media should stop reporting what Harry Reid says", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/04/05/the-media-should-stop-reporting-what-harry-reid-says/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-05T20:01:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-05T13:46:25+00:00"}, "keywords": "Guy Benson, Harry Reid, Mitt Romney,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "The media should stop reporting what Harry Reid saysposted at 4:01 pm on April 5, 2014 by Dustin SigginsOne of the most important jobs of the media is to be the so-called \u201cfourth estate\u201d \u2014 an unofficial fourth branch of government that holds the three official branches accountable.\nNaturally, the charges were not backed by any evidence, yet the mainstream media treated Reid\u2019s comments as though they had legitimacy.\nReid\u2019s Koch habit \u2014 yes, yes, I used the cliched term; I couldn\u2019t help it \u2014 includes accusing the Koch brothers of associating with companies that circumvent sanctions on Iran.\nAt the time, I asked if Reid had violated Senate Ethics rules by essentially campaigning on the Senate floor.\nHowever, there is another way to hold a politician accountable: Stop taking the politician seriously by not reporting what he or she said."}
