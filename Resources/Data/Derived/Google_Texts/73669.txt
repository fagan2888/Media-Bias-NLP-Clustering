These Broncos have little regard for their fans’ health. Seven of their victories have been decided with fourth-quarter comebacks or game-winning drives.

Denver’s top-ranked defense has been relied upon throughout not only to set up game-winning drives but also to create them. But the offense — despite its inconsistency and myriad changes to its linemen and quarterbacks — has played its part in sealing victories late.

“We’ve had all these tight games. It’s time for us to blow out somebody,” said all-pro outside linebacker Von Miller. “I’ve always felt like plays are going to happen. We need to make a play and sometimes it doesn’t. This year, it’s just been happening.”

Here is a look back at those seven thrilling finishes.

Week 2, at Kansas City — Sept. 17, 2015: With the score 24-24 and 35 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Broncos inside linebacker Brandon Marshall punched the ball loose and cornerback Bradley Roby quickly scooped it up, sprinting 21 yards to the end zone for a 31-24 victory.

Week 4, vs. Minnesota — Oct. 4, 2015: The Vikings erased a 10-point deficit in the second half to tie the score at 20. But with about five minutes left in the fourth quarter, Peyton Manning responded by engineering a nine-play, 55-yard drive that ended with a 39-yard field goal. A forced fumble and recovery by Denver sealed a 23-20 win.

Week 6, at Cleveland — Oct. 18, 2015: A highlight-reel, 75-yard touchdown catch by Emmanuel Sanders midway through the fourth quarter was followed by a Cleveland field goal to tie it up. But a 34-yard field goal by Brandon McManus capped 13-play, 72-yard drive in overtime for the 26-23 win.

Week 12, vs. New England — Nov. 29, 2015: With Brock Osweiler steering the ship, the Broncos racked up 433 total yards while holding the Patriots to 39 yards rushing. But it took an extra period and a 48-yard touchdown run up the left sideline by C.J. Anderson for Denver to hand New England its first loss of the season, 30-24.

Week 16, vs. Cincinnati — Dec. 28, 2015: A 39-yard touchdown run by Anderson in the fourth quarter gave the Broncos their first lead, 17-14. But that was followed by a Bengals field goal that sent the game to overtime. McManus’ 37-yard field goal capped a 14-play, 61-yard Denver drive, and DeMarcus Ware followed with a fumble recovery to close out a 20-17 win.

Week 17, vs. San Diego — Jan. 3, 2016: Manning returned from a foot injury in the second half to steady the Broncos’ offense, but San Diego regained control at 20-17 with about 13 minutes left in the fourth quarter. McManus tied it with a field goal, then safety Shiloh Keo intercepted a pass to set up a game-winning, 23-yard touchdown run by Ronnie Hillman. Broncos 27, Chargers 20.

AFC divisional playoff, vs. Pittsburgh — Jan. 17, 2016: The Broncos trailed 13-12 to start the fourth quarter, but a forced fumble by Ware and recovery by Roby set up a go-ahead, 1-yard touchdown run by Anderson with three minutes remaining. McManus sealed Denver’s 23-16 win with a field goal.
