While veterinary groups recommend pain treatment, only about 10 percent of calves are properly medicated, according to Vermont dairy cattle breeder Mark Rodgers.\n\nCertain cows carry a dominant no-horn genetic trait, and are called polled cows. Research has shown it\u2019s cheaper to breed polled cattle than to dehorn cows, but experts say the dairy industry has been slow to expand polled genetics because it\u2019s been focused on boosting milk productivity. Yet, the change may come sooner than producers expected, as some of the nation\u2019s largest food companies, such as General Mills, Nestle and Dunkin\u2019 Brands, are asking dairy suppliers to incorporate polled cattle into their herds.\n\nThe beef industry already has largely adopted polled cattle. Less than 1 percent of the nation\u2019s dairy herds carry the hornless polled gene, but 10 times more polled animals have been registered with breeding programs in the past three years, Rodgers said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an animal well-being issue but it\u2019s also a management issue. It\u2019s a labor-saving issue. Ask anyone working on a dairy farm and they\u2019ll tell you the most disagreeable job on those farms is dehorning calves,\u201d said Rodgers, who belongs to an international group of 46 polled breeders, including farmers in Australia, Canada, England and Germany.\n\nBut Chris Galen, a spokesman for the National Milk Producers Federation, a trade group, said the industry believes removing horn buds at a very young age is safe and \u201cminimally disruptive, uncomfortable process.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and Purdue University research has shown it\u2019s more expensive for farms to dehorn cows than it is to use polled genetics, something Galen says there is \u201cmerit in exploring,\u201d but added, \u201cit\u2019s a very limited gene pool in dairy breeds right now and that won\u2019t change for many years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dairy farms asked to consider breeding no-horn cows", "title": "Dairy farms asked to consider breeding no-horn cows", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Dairy farms asked to consider breeding no-horn cows", "title": "Dairy farms asked to consider breeding no-horn cows", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/28/dairy_farms_asked_to_consider_breeding_no_horn_cows/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/food-and-farm-dehorning-cows.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dairy farms asked to consider breeding no-horn cows", "title": "Dairy farms asked to consider breeding no-horn cows", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/food-and-farm-dehorning-cows.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Pitt", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd80c\"", "article_summary": "Certain cows carry a dominant no-horn genetic trait, and are called polled cows.\nWhile veterinary groups recommend pain treatment, only about 10 percent of calves are properly medicated, according to Vermont dairy cattle breeder Mark Rodgers.\nIt\u2019s routine to remove the horn tissue from young calves before it attaches to the skull, either by burning it out with heat or chemicals or digging it out with sharp instruments.\nResearch has shown it\u2019s cheaper to breed polled cattle than to dehorn cows, but experts say the dairy industry has been slow to expand polled genetics because it\u2019s been focused on boosting milk productivity.\nThe beef industry already has largely adopted polled cattle."}
