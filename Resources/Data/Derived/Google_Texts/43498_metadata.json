House of Cards joins other television shows, across networks, in its near obsessive focus of reminding viewers how apparently necessary or even pleasant the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain is. The information spouted is both false and misleading.\n\nClaire Underwood, the wife of main character, Frank Underwood, brings up an idea in Episode 1. She wants to have Planned Parenthood get involved in the breast cancer screenings at a VA hospital to be opened to the public in Texas. Vulture.com, in their recap, mentions Claire\u2019s entire idea as being \u201cparticularly improbable.\u201d\n\nVulture.com is merely providing a recap. But the point is a true one: Underwood\u2019s idea is indeed \u201cimprobable.\u201d First of all, Planned Parenthood only offers referrals to breast cancer screenings. Despite president Cecile Richard\u2019s lie to the contrary, Planned Parenthood has not and does not perform mammograms \u2013 the best type of breast cancer screening available to women.\n\nIt is also unthinkable to muddle up services for veterans by bringing Planned Parenthood to a VA hospital, when the group continues as the nation\u2019s largest abortion chain and often takes offensive political positions.\n\nEpisode 2 wades deeper into the falsehoods when it comes to Planned Parenthood\u2019s non-existent mammogram services\u2014 because that\u2019s what its supporters need to do to sell how wonderful it is(n\u2019t). House of Cards even has Frank Underwood, President of the United States, spouting the deception. House of Cards attempts to present this deceit as truth to viewers.\n\nDuring a State of the Union address, Frank also discusses this breast cancer clinic, calling it a \u201cbold plan,\u201d which a congresswoman has been \u201cfighting for for the past decade.\u201d Frank touts this plan as one which will \u201csignificantly increase successful diagnoses, treatment through education, screenings, and affordable care.\u201d\n\nThe line is met with much applause. Frank then criticizes those who \u201cdon\u2019t want to see government funds going to Planned Parenthood.\u201d Frank promises to work on its opening, claiming it \u201cwill save lives.\u201d The audience stands and cheers, as Frank claims \u201cthat is the sort of leadership the American people want.\u201d\n\nAgain, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammogram services or screenings; it merely refers them to other centers \u2013 surely one of which could be chosen instead of PP to operate alongside the VA hospital.\n\nClaire\u2019s engagement in the political ploy about Planned Parenthood is hardly shocking. This is a character who\u2019s had two abortions, one at 16 weeks, just because she didn\u2019t wish to be pregnant. This is a character who also thought about getting pregnant to blackmail a pregnant employee, whom she felt was a threat and an opponent. On national television, she deflected from her abortion by changing the subject and going into detail about a rape she had experienced, which did not cause the pregnancy.\n\nAnd yet all this is considered part of the political process on the show. People do dirty things to get ahead. Now, I know politics isn\u2019t pretty. Even though it\u2019s a world I myself may hope to get involved in, I understand how some people feel like writing the political process off completely. Instead, I wrote off House of Cards completely.\n\nI can\u2019t stand by and watch a show which praises not only lies and backstabbing, but also excuses abortion in every way possible. I gave up on the show back in Season 2. From the lies that continue to be propagated, it sounds like I made the right choice back then. I can only handle pro-abortion propaganda so long, even in a critically acclaimed television show.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House of Cards joins other shows with an obsessive focus of telling viewers how apparently necessary or even pleasant the largest U.S. abortion provider is.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "House of Cards joins other shows with an obsessive focus of telling viewers how apparently necessary or even pleasant the largest U.S. abortion provider is.", "title": "'House of Cards' furthers pro-abortion propaganda, praises Planned Parenthood", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/house-of-cards.jpg", "height": 350}, "updated_time": "2016-03-12T23:32:23-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/house-of-cards-furthers-pro-abortion-propaganda-praises-planned-parenthood/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House of Cards joins other shows with an obsessive focus of telling viewers how apparently necessary or even pleasant the largest U.S. abortion provider is.", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/house-of-cards.jpg", "title": "'House of Cards' furthers pro-abortion propaganda, praises Planned Parenthood", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "published_time": "2016-03-12T14:36:13-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rebecca.rose.downs", "section": "Media", "modified_time": "2016-03-12T23:32:23-04:00", "tag": "Planned Parenthood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "This season \u2013 specifically within the first few episodes \u2013 has gone out of its way to praise Planned Parenthood.\nBut the point is a true one: Underwood\u2019s idea is indeed \u201cimprobable.\u201d First of all, Planned Parenthood only offers referrals to breast cancer screenings.\nShe wants to have Planned Parenthood get involved in the breast cancer screenings at a VA hospital to be opened to the public in Texas.\nThe hit Netflix series House of Cards is continuing its pro-abortion propaganda in its recently released fourth season.\nDespite president Cecile Richard\u2019s lie to the contrary, Planned Parenthood has not and does not perform mammograms \u2013 the best type of breast cancer screening available to women."}
