We all know that presidential candidate Ted Cruz is a bit of a nutjob, prone to breaking out in Princess Bride recitations and Simpsons impressions, but his recent holiday-themed ad has everyone scratching their head and wondering: Is this guy for real?

The commercial features his wife and children listening intently to Cruz reading made-up children’s stories like “Rudolph the Underemployed Reindeer,” “The Grinch Who Lost Her Emails,” “How Obamacare Stole Christmas,” and more. The ad plays just like an infomercial, even featuring a scrolling list of other politically themed Christmas books.

Watch.
