(AP) - Mary and Genevieve Shimek are elementary school students who anticipate what\u2019s on their lunch bags more than what\u2019s in them.\n\nMost school days since kindergarten, the 8-year-old twin sisters walk across West Sixth Street, which separates their Millcreek Township home and the Tracy Elementary School, with their afternoon meals in traditional brown paper bags.\n\nHowever, they rarely do so before their mother uses them as 4-by-8-inch canvases.\n\nMelissa Shimek, 44, normally brainstorms her artistic subjects the night before. Come morning, the Villa Maria Academy graduate goes about creating her latest works alongside a cup of coffee and a bowl of granola while employing one of her numerous black Sharpies.\n\n\u201cThe bag themes revolve around the girls\u2019 interests and life experiences,\u201d Shimek said. \u201cThey often reflect their recent trips, books, school lessons or conversations.\u201d\n\nShimek, whose bag collection numbers well into the hundreds, isn\u2019t restrictive when it comes to her caricatures.\n\nA casual browse through several stacks of past drawings revealed depictions that ranged from historical (a 1920s flapper and John F. Kennedy) to pop cultural (Pee-wee Herman and the Muppets).\n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t say too much about them,\u201d Mary Shimek said of the bags, \u201cbut my teachers will say, \u2018Your mom is very talented.\u2019\u201d\n\nGenevieve Shimek has heard feedback about them from her peers.\n\n\u201cSome of my friends say, \u2018You\u2019re a great drawer,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll say, \u2018No, that\u2019s my mom\u2019s drawing.\u2019 That feels good.\u201d\n\nThe public can view the work that Shimek\u2019s daughters and her husband, Matthew, are familiar with, come August. That\u2019s when her illustrated bags will be displayed at Blasco Memorial Library as part of its \u201cBack to School\u201d exhibit.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried to incorporate what they\u2019re learning (into the drawings) as a way of encouragement,\u201d said Melissa Shimek, whose father, Patrick Sullivan, was a graphic artist at Kim Kraft Inc. \u201cOne day it could be (an astronomy theme), the next day chemistry and the next day reading. It\u2019s just something to keep them motivated.\u201d\n\nShimek\u2019s talent has rubbed off on her daughters. Each draws on her own and both are already competent in the basics of animation on their home computer.\n\nAfter attending Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, Shimek earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in liberal arts from Pennsylvania State University in 1994. But it wasn\u2019t until after graduation that her prowess with pens and markers truly emerged.\n\nShimek moved to Chicago and worked at Dusty Groove, a store recognized for its collection of rare and obscure albums. While there, she freelanced as an animator and illustrator for an alternative magazine in Chicago, plus U.S. Rocker, a Cleveland-based music publication.\n\nIt\u2019s something Shimek continues to do for local and national musical acts since she moved back to Erie in 2001.\n\nShimek said her favorite artists are pen-and-ink illustrator Edward Gorey, and cult cartoonists Robert Crumb and Harvey Pekar. However, many of her bag drawings share traits with the Japanese anim\u00e9 called kawaii (\u201ccute\u201d).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the influence my daughters seem to enjoy,\u201d Shimek said.\n\nShimek knows Mary and Genevieve will outgrow such lunch bags and her unique hobby will likely cease.\n\nWhen that happens, she plans to have a California friend archive and bind her collective work.\n\nThere have been suggestions that Shimek market her drawings, but she remains uncomfortable with that notion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had friends say they\u2019d buy (copies) of these to pack their own kids\u2019 lunches,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been apprehensive about that because I\u2019m not doing this for profit. I\u2019m doing this for my daughters. I\u2019d like to think, \u2018Draw something yourself on a brown paper bag.\u2019 If you want to share something like this with your child, here\u2019s a Sharpie.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1DHhVwG\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Erie Times-News, http://www.goerie.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Mary and Genevieve Shimek are elementary school students who anticipate what's on their lunch bags more than what's in them.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Mary and Genevieve Shimek are elementary school students who anticipate what\u2019s on their lunch bags more than what\u2019s in them.", "title": "Mother turns daughters\u2019 lunch bags into works of art", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/2/mother-turns-daughters-lunch-bags-into-works-of-ar/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/30/67482fca541c2b13750f6a70670070b0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/30/67482fca541c2b13750f6a70670070b0.jpg", "description": "Mary and Genevieve Shimek are elementary school students who anticipate what's on their lunch bags more than what's in them.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mother turns daughters\u2019 lunch bags into works of art"}, "Author": "MIKE COPPER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fd9\"", "article_summary": "However, many of her bag drawings share traits with the Japanese anim\u00e9 called kawaii (\u201ccute\u201d).\nERIE, Pa.
