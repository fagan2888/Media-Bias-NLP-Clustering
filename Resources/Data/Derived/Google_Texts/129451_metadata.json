In Asia Pacific, the bank had 272 billion francs.\n\nStott did not give a growth target for the European business but said UBS expects to grow \"at a multiple of the market\".\n\nBREXIT OR NO BREXIT\n\nStott also said Britain would remain an important market for UBS regardless of the outcome of a referendum in June on the country's membership of the European Union.\n\n\"We can have a great business there irrespective of Brexit,\" Stott said. \"There's still a substantial asset pool there and a substantial number of wealthy clients who need access to wealth management services.\"\n\nCloser to home Stott sees signs of a recovery in its private banking operations for European clients in Switzerland, a business that has been overshadowed by an international clamp-down on tax avoidance that chipped away at Switzerland's bank secrecy rules.\n\n\"We are now at or close to an inflection point,\" Stott said, \"where you start seeing some potential revenue growth and asset growth again.\"\n\n($1 = 0.9190 euros)\n\n($1 = 0.9978 Swiss francs)\n\n(Editing by Jane Merriman)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS may consider making acquisitions to boost its European wealth m", "title": "UBS considers acquisitions to expand wealth management in Europe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/02/UBS-considers-acquisitions-expand-wealth-management-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ubs-group-results_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/02/UBS-considers-acquisitions-expand-wealth-management-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ubs-group-results_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS may consider making acquisitions to boost its European wealth m", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd48ad\"", "article_summary": "ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS may consider making acquisitions to boost its European wealth management business to take market share from rivals, its private banking head for Europe told Reuters.\nAt the end of 2015, UBS had 343 billion Swiss francs ($343.8 billion) in invested assets in Europe, excluding Switzerland.\nUBS, the world's biggest private bank, sees growth potential in Europe because the wealth management market is still very fragmented with the biggest banks rarely holding more than a 7 percent share in a particular country.\nStott did not give a growth target for the European business but said UBS expects to grow \"at a multiple of the market\".\n\"There are certain markets that we focus on, certain markets where we're prepared to think about inorganic growth,\" Jakob Stott, the head of UBS's wealth management businesses in Europe, said in an interview."}
