While lawmakers in Tallahassee and Washington D.C. are talking about policies to make health care companies report prices, this is the first project that puts the consumers in charge.\n\n\u201cPeople should know what things cost in health care,\u201d said Jeanne Pinder, a veteran health care journalist and founder of ClearHealthCosts.com. \u201cWe\u2019ll use the power of our communities to reveal the secrets of the marketplace, and join hands to make this opaque system more transparent.\u201d\n\nOur reporters at WUSF in Tampa and WLRN in Miami will break down the complicated nuances of insurance paperwork, and bring you stories of consumers navigating these bills.\n\nMost importantly, we will show you how to use the PriceCheck database to see prices on procedures from MRIs to sleep studies, and how to safely share the costs of your health care.\n\nWe\u2019ll be sharing a lot more about PriceCheck in the coming months. So stay tuned and be sure to follow us on Facebook and Twitter - @HealthNewsFL.\n\nMary Shedden reports for WUSF in Tampa.
