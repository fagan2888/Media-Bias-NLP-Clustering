Ellen DeGeneres and Steve Harvey will co-executive produce, and Harvey will host, an hour-long kid comedy/variety series on NBC next season. NBC has committed to “Little Big Shots” for an eight-episode order.

Picture adorable little musical prodigies and “pint-size breakdancers,” per the NBC release, chatting with Harvey in a throwback to Art Linkletter-style variety.

“In “Little Big Shots,”” NBC says, “Harvey will showcase young musicians, singers, dancers and every form of wunderkind in the country, and go toe to toe with them in conversations and interviews, with hilarious results…From pint-size break-dancers to five-year-old piano virtuosos (sic), these gifted performers will awe the nation with their talents, slay us with their cuteness and wow us with their accomplishments.”

The move reflects NBC’s push into live variety entertainment shows along with live theatrical productions. The series will join another variety series on NBC, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, to debut this fall.
