Rick Perry reviewed his 14-year tenure as the state\u2019s executive at the AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center, discussing health care, education and the Texas economy.\n\nIn an interview with Evan Smith, Texas Tribune CEO and editor-in-chief, Perry repeatedly refused to answer any questions about his Travis County grand jury indictment. When Smith jokingly threatened to stop asking questions and sit in silence, Perry said he was fine with that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a long hour,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI had a date like that one time.\u201d\n\nPublic education has been adequately funded by the state legislature, according to Perry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t judge progress by how many dollars we spend,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI think it\u2019s simplistic to say you\u2019re not spending enough money. I suggest the result is hard to argue when you look at the number of kids going to college today and when they got a job out of school.\u201d\n\nPerry also said he still supports providing in-state tuition for undocumented students, and it should be no issue for the Texas Legislature to aid students in earning a higher education degree.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for young people to move up, get that certificate or diploma,\u201d Perry said.\n\nPerry defended his stance against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked Washington multiple times for more flexibility to deal with the issue of health care and how we could receive the money from D.C. and restructure these programs so more people could have access,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIn 2009, President Obama said Medicaid was broken, and I agree with him. So why would we want to expand a broken system?\u201d\n\nThe Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country exemplify the future of government-run health care, according to Perry.\n\n\u201cThe VA is a debacle,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI think one of the ways you fix health care is [to] get Washington out of the regulatory side of it and to allow the state to run it. Just like expansion of federally funded health clinics. Making access to health care is the real challenge here, not government-forced insurance.\u201d\n\nAlthough he is largely satisfied with his 14-year run as governor, Perry said he regrets his handling of his 2007 vaccine mandate for HPV.\n\n\u201cI would have done it differently,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI would have engaged the public more. I thought the public understood this from the standpoint of a cancer. The execution was wrong. I was thinking out my heart instead of my head, and I want to make the people of Texas be more engaged. We\u2019re not executive order types.\u201d\n\nCiting his run in the 2012 presidential election, Perry said he has not yet decided about another presidential run.\n\n\u201cI went through a very humbling and frustrating process in 2011 and 2012,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI was not prepared. It was obvious. I may or may not run for presidency, but, in order to give myself that option, you have do the work that is required.\u201d\n\nPerry reiterated his support for UT System Regent Wallace Hall and said the legislature should allow the Board of Regents to conduct its business unimpeded. He also defended his signing of House Bill 2.\n\nDisplaying a chart showing job growth in Texas, Perry also spoke about how the Texas Enterprise Fund \u2014 an incentive program that encourages businesses to come to Texas \u2014 has aided economic growth for the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe became very good at economic development,\u201d Perry said. \u201cIt took a while \u2014 [when] Boeing deciding in 2001 to move their corporate headquarters they chose Chicago instead of Dallas, they didn\u2019t think the cultural arts were as expansive in Dallas as in Chicago.\u201d\n\nSince then, Perry said, cultural arts have exploded in the state\u2019s major cities. Perry said, although the program has benefited Texas, it is up to the legislature to discuss the lifespan of the incentive bill and see whether it should continue.\n\n\u201cI think if they want to change them, if they want to unilaterally get out of the economic development business, that\u2019s their call,\u201d Perry said. \u201cBut, I would suggest over the last decade, we have been successful in large projects and small projects.\u201d\n\nUndeclared sophomore Lauren Hodges said she appreciated Perry\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cThere were parts where he was being humble, and he\u2019s not known for being humble,\u201d Hodges said. \u201cBut when he dodged the whole hypocrisy question, I thought that was kind of pathetic.\u201d\n\nSmith said he thought Perry interviewed especially well Sunday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve interviewed him many times over the past years, and I thought this was the most relaxed I\u2019ve seen him,\u201d Smith said after the interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some contentious interviews over the years. I would have liked to talk more about the indictments, but I understand he was constrained by the legal process.\u201d\n\nCheck out more photos from The 2014 Texas Tribune Festival in the slideshow below ~", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gov.
