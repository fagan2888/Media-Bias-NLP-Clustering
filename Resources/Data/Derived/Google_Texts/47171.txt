JUSTIN FANTL FOR TIME

Sixty percent of Americans say that if given the chance, they would vote out every single member of Congress, including their own representative, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll.

The number of people willing to fire their elected representatives is the highest in the history of the survey, according to NBC News. Only 35% of those surveyed said they would keep their representative.

The NBC poll also shows how damaging the shutdown has become for the GOP – 55% of those surveyed blame Republicans for the shutdown, while 31% point the finger at President Obama. That 22-point margin is even wider than the one Republicans received in the 1995-96 shutdown. And in even worse news for the GOP, while Obamacare still isn’t popular, it’s becoming less unpopular over time. Last month, only 31% of the public thought the Affordable Care Act was a good idea; that number has now climbed to 38%.

The poll comes on the heels of an AP-GfK survey that showed Americans find little to like in either political party. In that poll, 4 of 5 people surveyed described Republicans as unlikeable and not inspiring or innovative, but President Obama didn’t fare much better. Together, the two recent surveys suggest that the 2014 midterm elections may be shaping up to resemble 2006 and 2010, when large numbers of incumbent lawmakers lost reelection bids.
