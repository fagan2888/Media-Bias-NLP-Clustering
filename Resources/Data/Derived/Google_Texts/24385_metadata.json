In the Supreme Court, that is. How do I know this? OK, let\u2019s back up.\n\nIn the biggest decision of its 2013-2014 term, the Supreme Court decided 5-4 that a for-profit corporation that objects to provisions of a federal law as impairing its religious freedom is entitled to an accommodation under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The case at hand involved the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that employee health insurance plans provide women with free contraceptive care.\n\nUnder rules developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, strictly religious organizations such as churches were exempted from the mandate. The idea was that women who worked for such organizations were likely to belong to the religious body in question and in any event could be expected to embrace or at least conform to its beliefs and practices.\n\nBy contrast, religiously affiliated nonprofits such as the University of Notre Dame and the Little Sisters of the Poor (an order of nuns that runs a couple of dozen nursing homes) received an accommodation, under which they are supposed to fill out a form for the government stating that they object to the contraception mandate. The government will then tell their insurance company to provide their women employees with the free coverage at the company\u2019s expense. The idea is that employees of such nonprofits cannot be expected to hew to the religious principles of the religious body with which they are affiliated.\n\nIn the Hobby Lobby case, the court told the Obama administration to give a \u201cclosely held\u201d for-profit that demonstrates a bona fide religious commitment the same accommodation the government provides to a religious nonprofit. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito left open the question of whether the accommodation was itself sufficient. Faced with a difference of opinion at the appellate level, the court last Friday (Nov. 6) agreed to take up that question.\n\nThe Little Sisters, Notre Dame, et al. claim that filling out the government waiver makes them responsible for \u2014 or as Aristotle and Aquinas would have said, the final cause of \u2014 practices they find religiously intolerable. What they want is the complete exemption afforded to churches. They won\u2019t get it.\n\nThe Religious Freedom Restoration Act says that religious objections to a federal law can be overturned only if the government has a compelling interest in doing so. In the Hobby Lobby case, Justice Anthony Kennedy became the majority\u2019s crucial fifth vote with the help of a concurrence declaring that indeed to be the case. \u201cThere are many medical conditions for which pregnancy is contraindicated,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cIt is important to confirm that a premise of the Court\u2019s opinion is its assumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in the health of female employees.\u201d\n\nAnd the Kennedy concurrence finds the accommodation for religious nonprofits to be a valid means of reconciling that compelling interest with religious liberty: \u201cIn these cases the means to reconcile those two priorities are at hand in the existing accommodation the Government has designed, identified, and used for circumstances closely parallel to those presented here.\u201d\n\nJust as Kennedy stuck with his earlier positions on gay rights and voted in favor of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage last June, so he will stick with these dicta and provide the crucial fifth vote to uphold the Obama administration\u2019s non- (and for-) profit accommodation of the contraception mandate.\n\nMark Silk is Professor of Religion in Public Life at Trinity College and director of the college\u2019s Leonard E.
