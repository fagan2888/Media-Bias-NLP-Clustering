Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood have made a name for themselves as the dynamic duo of country music hosting gigs over the last seven years. Their friendship is evident in their genuine chemistry on stage hosting Country Music’s Biggest Night, the CMA Awards, showing off their goofy sides with topical jokes and song parodies alongside sincere odes to accomplished artists.

Oh yes, the song parodies …

Each year, Paisley and Underwood pull off some pretty hilarious roasts, covering timely topics from swine flu to Obamacare — and truth be told, the duo’s banter is part of the reason so many fans tune in to the CMAs. Taste of Country has selected the Top 5 song parodies Paisley and Underwood have collaborated on over the years, and let’s just say there are some doozies. One even resulted in the reconciliation of a feud between a couple of big-name country stars!

Relive the hosts’ best parodies, and be sure to subscribe to Taste of Country to see more highlight reels and behind-the-scenes interviews.

The 2015 CMA Awards take place Nov. 4 and will mark Underwood and Paisley’s eighth time hosting. There’s certainly no shortage of material to work with this year (Paisley notes the Ashley Madison scandal didn’t hurt), and with such a long resume of experience under their belts, the parodies are sure to be better than ever.
