Trump stays vague as Cruz accuses him of pushing 'socialized medicine'

Despite being asked multiple times, Donald Trump refused to say directly whether his vision for changing the nation's healthcare system would be government funded or not.

Trump, in a back and forth with Sen. Ted Cruz, was pressed on whether his plan would be boosted by federal funding. It was part of an ongoing Cruz attack that Trump supported socialized medicine, a position Cruz said put him closer to "socialized medicine."

Trump didn't answer directly, instead just saying that "we're going to have private healthcare."

"I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and streets of our country," Trump said, adding "we're going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced."

It's a repeat of an argument Trump has said before. He's vowed to replace Obamacare with something better, but he hasn't gone into detailed specifics about his replacement. But, Trump earlier in the debate did say he's against Obamacare.

"I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him Obamacare it's going to be a disaster for the economy," Trump said.
