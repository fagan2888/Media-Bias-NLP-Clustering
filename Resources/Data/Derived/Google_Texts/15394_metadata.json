That's how much the typical American sleeps, according to the most recent Gallup Survey.\n\nEight hours and 42 minutes. That's how much the typical American sleeps, according to the most recent U.S Department of Labor's American Time Use Survey.\n\nHow are American estimates of our own sleep times off by more than 13 hours per week?\n\nCatherine Rampell wonders if Americans are providing two accurate answers to two separate questions: How much time do you spend in bed vs. how much time do you spend asleep? Perhaps. But even if it's old-fashioned self-reporting error, this isn't the only life category where Americans dramatically miscalculate their own lives. In work-hour surveys, she writes, people who claim to work 40 hours per week actually work an average of 37. People who claim a usual week of 75 hours really work 50.\n\nAnd sleep time is a little trickier to accurately estimate than work hours on account of your being entirely unconscious. In Elizabeth Kolbert's New Yorker essay on the science of sleep, she visits a clinic to monitor her own rest and restlessness and comes away with a big surprise...\n\nThe first table showed that I\u2019d spent six hours and forty-two minutes in bed, of which I had slept for four hours and two minutes. But I hadn\u2019t lain awake for nearly three hours and then dropped off, as I\u2019d imagined. A graph, known as a hypnogram, traced how I\u2019d cycled from wakefulness through each of the sleep stages\u20141, 2, 3, and REM. A good sleeper\u2019s hypnogram looks like sets of facing staircases. It traces a steady descent from wakefulness to REM sleep, then an ascent to a lighter sleep stage, then another steady descent, a pattern that gets repeated three or four times in a night. My hypnogram looked like the Manhattan skyline. It turned out that I\u2019d fallen asleep within about ten minutes of getting into bed. But, after only a minute or so, I\u2019d woken up for about fifteen minutes. I fell asleep again and woke up, fell asleep again and woke up, fell asleep a fourth time and then remained awake for nearly an hour. Even when I\u2019d felt that I\u2019d finally conked out, I had kept waking up, for a mind-boggling total of a hundred and forty-one times. Most of these awakenings\u2014a hundred and eleven\u2014were brief, under fifteen seconds. The tables also showed that I\u2019d stopped breathing eight times, which, Palat assured me, was not unusual, and had experienced seventeen \u201cperiodic limb movements,\u201d also not uncommon. In his comments, Palat had written that my \u201csleep architecture\u201d suggested \u201cdifficulty with sleep maintenance.\u201d He advised me not to go to bed until I was sure I was tired; not to stay in bed when I couldn\u2019t sleep but to go read in another room; and to eliminate alcohol.\n\nTo sum up, she was in bed for seven hours, fell asleep 141 times, woke up 141 times, and actually slept for four hours. If the Labor Department had asked her how many hours she slept, Kolbert would have said three. If Gallup had asked her hour many hours she spent in bed, she might had said seven. The actual sleeping time, however, was neither.\n\nAmericans aren't sleeping any more than we were in 1990, according to Gallup (even if the self-reported sleep survey is wrong, I'm going to assume it's equally wrong each year and therefore comparable over time). In that time, the number of U.S. insomnia diagnoses has gone from less than one million to more than five million. The medical dose has quintupled, but the sleep times haven't budged.\n\nResearch shows that insomnia drugs\u2014for all their quirky risks and drowsy side-effects\u2014add no more than 20 minutes in total sleep time, on average. That's 80 percent less than the gap in sleep-time between Gallup and the Labor Department. Maybe Americans need better data to go along with better drugs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "But we spend billions of dollars on insomnia drugs, anyway.", "author": "Derek Thompson", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "But we spend billions of dollars on insomnia drugs, anyway.", "title": "How Much Do We Sleep?
