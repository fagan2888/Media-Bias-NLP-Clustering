Geiger said her son, a junior at BCHS, told her about it Sunday night.\n\n\n\nAccording to her son, an online conversation a BCHS student had with friends \u201cturned into, they had guns and they were going to kill all the N-words and all the N-word lovers,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nThe Bryan County News has not been able to independently verify that any social-media post had that specific wording. A screen shot provided by the Georgia NAACP showed someone suggesting he would \u201cpop a cap in a (N-word), show them I don\u2019t play,\u201d but it does not specifically reference Bryan County High School.\n\n\n\nBrooksher confirmed the student\u2019s post was \u201cracially charged\u201d and \u201cvery inflammatory.\u201d However, a law-enforcement investigation determined \u201cthere was no credible threat at Bryan County High School,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the school system feels there\u2019s a safety concern or threat, we would notify parents immediately,\u201d Brooksher said. \u201cBut it was an isolated incident and it was handled immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrooksher confirmed that the student behind the inflammatory post is \u201cno longer at Bryan County High School.\u201d He did not elaborate, citing student confidentiality.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the local rumor mill began to buzz. By Monday, Brooksher said, the rumor on campus had escalated to three guns having been found at BCHS and three people having been arrested.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we had three guns at our high school, we\u2019d be on CNN,\u201d Brooksher said.\n\n\n\nPembroke Police Chief Randy Alexander said that \u201cabsolutely no arrests were made, and no weapons were found.\u201d The Pembroke Police Department and Bryan County Sheriff\u2019s Office have a mutual-aid agreement to provide security for Bryan County High School.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe went through all the vehicles looking for weapons and didn\u2019t find any,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cEverything is fine. The incident did happen on Friday. The guy was expelled, and it\u2019s done with.\u201d\n\n\n\nNonetheless, Geiger feels school officials should have made parents aware of the threat. She said she emailed BCHS Principal Crystal Morales on Sunday night with her concerns and was told she \u201ccould feel free to sit in the classroom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat didn\u2019t address the issue,\u201d Geiger said. \u201cIf someone brings a gun to school and starts shooting and I\u2019m in the classroom, they\u2019re going to kill me, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer son returned to school on Tuesday. The main reason, Geiger said, was because the school registered his absence Monday as unexcused.\n\n\n\n\u201cI found out they weren\u2019t going to let the students who \u2013 quote \u2013 skipped make up their work,\u201d Geiger said. \u201cMy son takes AP (Advanced Placement) classes.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn a news release issued Monday, the Georgia NAACP also questioned the response by school officials and law enforcement to the threat.\n\n\n\n\u201cRacism and xenophobia have no place in modern society,\u201d said Francys Johnson, the state NAACP president and a Statesboro attorney.\n\n\n\nBrooksher encourages parents to contact their child\u2019s school or the school-system central office if they have any concerns about safety. He said he met with several parents on Monday and \u201cit went well.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe also urges parents to monitor students\u2019 social-media activity and reach out to school officials immediately if they have a concern.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is unfortunate that social-media outlets provide a platform for students, and even adults, to say and do things they generally would not do face-to-face,\u201d Brooksher said. \u201cIt is extraordinarily sad when the bad behaviors and poor decisions of one on social media disrupts the learning environment for every other student.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bryancountynews.com/archives/39083/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/bryancountynews/article/2015/09/01/Bryan_County_Schools.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Zambia Geiger kept her son home from school Monday after learning of a racially charged threat a Bryan County High School student had posted online.", "title": "BCHS student expelled after posting racially charged threat"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "BCHS student expelled after posting racially charged threat"}, "article_summary": "Pembroke Police Chief Randy Alexander said that \u201cabsolutely no arrests were made, and no weapons were found.\u201d The Pembroke Police Department and Bryan County Sheriff\u2019s Office have a mutual-aid agreement to provide security for Bryan County High School.\nThe Bryan County News has not been able to independently verify that any social-media post had that specific wording.\nZambia Geiger kept her son home from school Monday after learning of a racially charged threat a Bryan County High School student had posted online.\nA screen shot provided by the Georgia NAACP showed someone suggesting he would \u201cpop a cap in a (N-word), show them I don\u2019t play,\u201d but it does not specifically reference Bryan County High School.\nBrooksher confirmed the student\u2019s post was \u201cracially charged\u201d and \u201cvery inflammatory.\u201d However, a law-enforcement investigation determined \u201cthere was no credible threat at Bryan County High School,\u201d he said."}
