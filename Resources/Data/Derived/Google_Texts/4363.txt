Federal health officials have sent the state of Florida an additional 950 kits to test for viral antibodies in people who have shown Zika symptoms after traveling to affected countries.

Gov. Rick Scottâ€™s office released a statement Tuesday saying none of the 16 Zika cases confirmed in Florida were contracted in the state, and none involve pregnant women.

Scott said Florida now has 1,425 of the antibody test kits from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Scott also has asked the CDC to schedule more training for Florida hospital workers to identify Zika symptoms.

The governor said state officials are doing all they can to ensure that Florida is prepared for a possible Zika outbreak. The virus can be spread by bites from mosquitoes that are common in Florida.
