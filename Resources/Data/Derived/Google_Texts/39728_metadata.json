If you\u2019re a woman who chooses a profile photo that looks dramatically different than your actual appearance, then you have about a pretty high chance of your date leaving before you even have time to order a drink.\n\nSimple Pickup is a team of bloggers who give men advice on how to woo women. The group decided to conduct a social experiment to see what happens when someone blatantly lies in their Tinder profile photo. The premise is simple enough: Get an adorable, fit, blonde girl to attract a few men to go on a date with her and see how they react when she ends up being dramatically heavier than her photos suggested.\n\nThe results were a sad reflection of the typical male Tinder user. Of the woman\u2019s five dates, four left before the couple even had time to order a beverage. \u201cI really don\u2019t appreciate people lying to me,\u201d explained one man before walking away. Others were less harsh with their excuse to leave, with one explaining that he was \u201cactually married,\u201d while another never returned after using the bathroom.\n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s really not the guys\u2019 fault. No one likes to be lied to. Still, how the majority of men in the \u201cexperiment\u201d behaved is quite appalling, especially when compared to their female counterparts, none of which left after finding their male date to be significantly larger than his profile picture. Hopefully, we can all walk away with an important lesson after watching these videos: If you\u2019re looking for love on the Internet, try to be as honest as possible to avoid shallow jerks.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "simple, pickups, tinder, social, experiment, shows, how, different, sexes, react, misleading", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Simple Pickup's social experiment revealed just how shallow the typical male Tinder user really is.", "title": "Don't Use Too Many Filters On Your Photos...
