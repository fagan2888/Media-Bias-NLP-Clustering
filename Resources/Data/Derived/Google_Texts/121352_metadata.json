But in an interview with Slate, the comedian and podcaster said it would have been \u201cunderstandable\u201d if the president had cancelled the interview.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWhen we were preparing to have him come over, I got home on Wednesday night, after the shooting in Charleston happened. And I thought, \u2018I guess this isn\u2019t gonna happen anymore,\u2019 and that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Maron told Slate. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if it was gonna happen or not. We waited. We watched his statement the next day, and it seemed like they were still coming out here.\u201d\n\nMaron said he spoke with the president about the Charleston shooting, gun violence, racism, comedy and other topics during the hour-long interview, which will be released on the Internet on Monday.\n\nMaron told Slate that it \u201cdidn\u2019t make him uncomfortable\u201d to discuss the Charleston shooting with Obama.\n\n\u201cI thought of it as respectful,\u201d Maron said. \u201cI think he showed up here expecting a certain tone, and I think the array of tones we were able to engage in, emotional, political and personal was pretty varied. Talking about the shooting got us to guns and race and all sorts of other stuff.\u201d\n\nThe moment that changed how I felt about the guy happened immediately. Because he\u2019s the president, and no matter how cynical I may have gotten in my life, or how disengaged I am with politics, as an American, you know the opportunity to meet the president period is insanely big. No matter how jaded you are and no matter what party you\u2019re from. So right when he showed up, all I wanted was to feel that he was a man, a human guy, that he was real. And right away, not only was he real, but he was disarming. I was stressed out! And he made me feel better.\n\nMaron also revealed to Slate that Obama told him why he came on the \u2018WTF\u2019 podcast in the first place.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I want to try to talk people into engaging in politics.\u2019 I mean, the code there could\u2019ve been that he is a Democrat, he is out here raising money for the Democratic Party, we know who the Democratic candidate is \u2013 but he didn\u2019t say that to me,\u201d Maron explained. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want people to engage in the political process. I want people to get involved.\u2019 That\u2019s why he said he was using my show.\u201d\n\nMaron described Obama as being \u201cvery intense, earnest, focused,\u201d and \u201cpassionate about making people\u2019s lives better and making the country better.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the way he negotiates that and keeps going at it every day with seemingly no bitterness or sense of disappointment or anger that he would allow anyone to see. He struck me as a very responsible man,\u201d Maron said. \u201cHe walks the walk.\u201d\n\nMaron also discussed how the interview was set up, what the Secret Service did to prepare his house for the meeting and revealed the president\u2019s favorite comedians in the Slate interview.
