Zurich Insurance Group’s top executives had their 2015 pay slashed by more than half after the company failed to meet major performance targets, according to the company’s annual report, which was released Friday.

The 13 members of the Swiss insurer’s top management team were paid $22.6 million for 2015, down significantly from the $55.4 million received by 12 executives in 2014.

Former CEO Martin Senn, who left the company suddenly in December, was paid $2.52 million for 2015, less that one-third of the $8.5 million he got in comspensation for 2014.

Senn was reportedly pressured to resign following Zurich’s failed takeover bid for Britain’s RSA Insurance Group, and the weak performance of its general insurance business.

Zurich’s shares fell 17% last year, the stock’s worst performance since 2008, also due to poor performance of its flagship general insurance business.

In its annual report, Zurich said that the key metric in connection with the managers’ pay was net income attributable to shareholders, which fell 53% in 2015.
