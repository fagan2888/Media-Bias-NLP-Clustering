You have options.\n\nGym chain Gold\u2019s Gym, begun in Venice, California, in 1965, has partnered with well-known British chef Robert Irvine to create the first-ever \u201cGolden Plate Awards,\u201d which selects the 10 healthiest dishes from fast food and casual dining restaurants across the country.\n\nSlideshow: The 10 Healthiest Fast Food Meals\n\nThe selection is based on hundreds of nominations from Gold\u2019s Gym members and consumers, as well as on input from nutrition experts and Irvine himself. The criteria include how healthy as well as how tasty the dishes are.\n\nAn American adult consumes a meal or snack bought from a restaurant 5.8 times a week on average, according to the National Restaurant Association. Now that we\u2019re dining out more than any other time in history, it\u2019s increasingly important to make wise choices when we order.\n\n\u201cThe 10 Golden Plate Award winners provide a plethora of options for enjoying a delicious meal without the guilt you can experience when you cheat on your diet,\u201d said Irvine. \u201cIt\u2019s all about making healthy choices, and knowing what works for your individual health and fitness goals.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hula Hoop Is New Exercise Fad\n\nThe winners include dishes from Applebee\u2019s Neighborhood Grill & Bar, Olive Garden, California Pizza Kitchen and Chipotle Mexican Grill.\n\nWhile most of the dishes are relatively low in calories, there are important caveats to keep in mind. Eating out almost always increases your sodium intake, for example, compared to eating meals prepared at home \u2013 and some of the winners selected by Irvine contain levels of sodium higher than the 1,500 milligrams a day recommended by the American Heart Association.\n\nAlso, many of these selections may not be suitable for those who follow a gluten-free diet or have gluten sensitivities. Checking the items carefully for their nutritional information is of course critical. Many restaurant websites have more information.\n\nClick here for The 10 Healthiest Fast Food Meals\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you want to avoid the fattiest fast food in America but can\u2019t quite give up your favorite chain restaurant, you have options.", "title": "The 10 Healthiest Fast Food Meals", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/26/10-Healthiest-Fast-Food-Meals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/cpk-quinoa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/26/10-Healthiest-Fast-Food-Meals", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/cpk-quinoa.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you want to avoid the fattiest fast food in America but can\u2019t quite give up your favorite chain restaurant, you have options.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Click here for The 10 Healthiest Fast Food MealsTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\nSlideshow: The 10 Healthiest Fast Food MealsThe selection is based on hundreds of nominations from Gold\u2019s Gym members and consumers, as well as on input from nutrition experts and Irvine himself.\nWant to avoid the \u2018fattiest\u2019 fast food in America but can\u2019t quite give up your favorite chain restaurant?\nGym chain Gold\u2019s Gym, begun in Venice, California, in 1965, has partnered with well-known British chef Robert Irvine to create the first-ever \u201cGolden Plate Awards,\u201d which selects the 10 healthiest dishes from fast food and casual dining restaurants across the country.\nAn American adult consumes a meal or snack bought from a restaurant 5.8 times a week on average, according to the National Restaurant Association."}
