One-third of these mothers return to work within three months after birth and two-thirds are back within six months.\n\nMany of those new moms breastfeed their babies.\n\nDo you have a place where an employee can pump breast milk?\n\nBy law, you need one, and it can\u2019t be a rest room.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act of 2010 amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and requires employers to provide \u201ca place, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public, which may be used by an employee to express breast milk.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a spare room or want to dodge the renovation costs of creating such a room, there is an alternative: a movable breast-pumping pod known as the Mamava Lactation Station.\n\nThe free-standing pod, invented by two moms, Christine Dodson and Sascha Mayer, of Burlington, Vt., features a fold-down Corian table and Corian seating for easy cleaning, a power outlet and plenty of quiet space.\n\nWhen the unit is not needed, it can be rolled into storage until there is another employee who wants to use it. An employer is not obligated to maintain a permanent, dedicated space for nursing mothers.\n\nMayer said the units can be installed in about an hour and a half, and can be skinned with sponsorship branding and/or changeable advertising graphics.\n\nThe Mamava Lactation Station debuted at the Burlington International Airport and there are others set up at a number of college campuses as well as a Veterans Affairs facility in Tucson, Ariz.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________\n\nMamava Lactation Station\n\n\u2022 Cost: $11,250\n\n\u2022 Shipping and installation: $500 to $1,500, depending on the location.
