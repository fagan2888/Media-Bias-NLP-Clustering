Kevin Vickerson, a starting Broncos’ defensive tackle since the start of the 2010 season until he was released Saturday, visited the Cincinnati Bengals on Tuesday and took a physical.

The Bengals, however, will not sign Vickerson this week, according to an NFL source. Possibly next week. Any vested veteran (four years or more of NFL service time) who is on a team’s season-opening roster automatically has his full-season salary guaranteed.

Vickerson is 31 and coming off a dislocated hip injury, which presents enough question mark for a team to minimize its risk.

But I would say this to the Bengals: Before he got hurt in game 11 last season at New England, Vickerson was the Broncos’ best defensive lineman. Tackle, end, nose guard or otherwise. For a playoff contender, Vickerson is worth waiting on to see if he can regain form.
