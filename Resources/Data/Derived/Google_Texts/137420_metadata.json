Dianne Feinstein stepped to the well of the Senate to deliver a speech exposing in stark terms a struggle between congressional investigators and their oversight subject: the Central Intelligence Agency. Feinstein was an unlikely critic of the practices of the intelligence community. The wife of investment banker Richard C. Blum, who managed enormous capital investments in corporations serving the American defense and intelligence communities, Feinstein had distinguished herself among Senate Democrats as a staunch CIA defender. In her long service on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she had chaired since 2009, Feinstein established close personal ties with key senior agency figures\u2014championing the candidacy of former deputy director Stephen Kappes to head the agency after Barack Obama was elected.\n\nPatiently and meticulously, Feinstein unfolded the string of events that led her committee to launch the most exhaustive congressional probe of a single CIA program in the nation\u2019s history. \u201cOn December 6, 2007, a New York Times article revealed the troubling fact that the CIA had destroyed video tapes of some of the CIA\u2019s first interrogations using so-called enhanced techniques,\u201d she stated.\n\nCIA director Michael Hayden had assured congressional overseers that they had no reason to be concerned: routine written field reports, what Hayden called CIA operational cables, had been retained. These documents, Hayden said, described \u201cthe detention conditions\u201d of prisoners held by the CIA before it decided to shut down the program as well as the \u201cday-to-day CIA interrogations.\u201d Hayden offered the senators access to these cables to prove to them that the destruction of the tapes was not a serious issue. Moreover, he reminded them that the CIA program was a historical relic: in the fall of 2006 the Bush administration ended the CIA\u2019s role as a jailer and sharply curtailed its program of \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d (EITs)\u2014specifically eliminating techniques that most of the international community, including the United States in the period before and after the Bush presidency, had viewed as torture, such as waterboarding.\n\nNevertheless, the Senate committee had never looked deeply into this program, and Hayden\u2019s decision to offer access to the cables opened the door to a careful study, which was accepted by then-chair Jay Rockefeller. Early in 2007, two Senate staffers spent many months reading the cables. By the time they had finished in early 2009, Feinstein had replaced Rockefeller as committee chair, and Barack Obama had replaced George W. Bush as president. Feinstein received the first staff report. It was \u201cchilling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the CIA detention sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the CIA had described them to us.\u201d\n\nThis first exploration of the dark side of CIA prisons and torture led committee members to recognize a serious failure in its oversight responsibilities. The committee resolved with near-unanimity (on a 14\u20131 vote) to launch a comprehensive investigation of the CIA program involving black sites and torture.\n\nBut the CIA was not simply going to acquiesce to a congressional probe into the single darkest and most controversial program in the organization\u2019s history. Since it could not openly do battle with its congressional overseers, the agency turned to a series of tactics that it had honed over the difficult decades following the Church Committee inquiries of the mid-1970s. Throughout the subsequent decades, the CIA complained loudly about the burdens of oversight and accountability\u2014while almost always getting its way.\n\nIndeed, the dynamics had changed dramatically after the coordinated terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. In the ensuing years, the CIA\u2019s budget ballooned to more than double its pre-2001 numbers. Moreover, it got the go-ahead to launch programs previously denied or sidetracked, and clearance to encroach on the Pentagon\u2019s turf through extensive operations using armed predator drones. Washington, it seemed, had forgotten how to say no to Langley. Still, the operation of the black site and EIT program involves a strikingly different dynamic\u2014because the spring that fed it came not out of Langley but from the office of Vice President Dick Cheney, inside the White House.\n\nSenior figures in the CIA, including the agency\u2019s senior career lawyer, John Rizzo, fully appreciated that the black sites and the EITs presented particularly dangerous territory. Exposure of these programs could damage some of the agency\u2019s tightest points of collaboration with foreign intelligence services\u2014authoritarian regimes such as Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Thailand, and Yemen, as well as among new democracies of Eastern Europe, like Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. British intelligence had been deeply involved and feared exposure, considering the domestic political opposition and the rigorous attitude of British courts.\n\nCIA leadership was also focused on the high likelihood that the program, once exposed, would lead to a press for criminal prosecutions under various statutes, including the anti-torture act. It therefore moved preemptively, seeking assurances and an opinion from the Justice Department that would serve as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card for agents involved in the program. But when those opinions were disclosed, starting hard on the heels of photographic evidence of abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq\u2014much of it eerily similar to techniques discussed in the Justice Department opinions\u2014a political firestorm erupted around the world. The Justice Department was forced to withdraw most of the opinions even before George W. Bush left Washington.\n\nLeon Panetta, arriving at the CIA in 2009, found top management preoccupied with concerns about fallout from this program.\n\nThe CIA chose to react to plans for a congressional probe cautiously, with a series of tactical maneuvers and skirmishes. Its strategy was apparent from the beginning: slow the review down while hoping for a change in the political winds that might end it. And from the outset it made use of one essential weapon against its congressional overseers\u2014secrecy. For the agency, secrecy was not just a way of life; it was also a path to power. It wielded secrecy as a shield against embarrassing disclosures and as a sword to silence and threaten adversaries. It was an all-purpose tool.\n\n*\n\nThe agency\u2019s first line of defense was to insist on what at first blush were minor inconveniences: congressional staff could not sit in their offices on Capitol Hill\u2014not even if secured and cleared for the examination of classified materials. Instead, they had to travel to a CIA-leased facility in suburban Virginia to do so. Moreover, the investigators could not use congressional staff computers for these purposes. Materials were to be installed on \u201ca stand-alone computer system\u201d furnished by the CIA but with its own \u201cnetwork drive segregated from CIA networks\u201d and under the control of the Senate. These requests seemed innocuous, and consequently Feinstein and her vice chair, Missouri Sen. Kit Bond, agreed to them. Later these measures would provide cover for more devious antics.\n\nBefore any materials could be turned over, the CIA insisted on its own review to be certain that the documents were relevant to the committee\u2019s request and were not subject to a claim of executive privilege. As it turns out, more than 6 million pages of documents were covered by the Senate request. It would take many months to review them all\u2014and that of course meant a delay of many months before the Senate researchers could do so. The CIA, guided by its lawyers, thus assumed a posture that was common for American corporate lawyers engaged in high-stakes commercial litigation\u2014\u201cdiscovery warfare.\u201d\n\nThe adversary\u2019s requests for documents could not be denied but could be slowed down, complicated, and subjected to privilege claims. But this was not a billion-dollar battle between corporate giants with comparable legal rights. It was an exercise of democratic process in which the Senate was discharging its constitutional duty of oversight over an organ of the executive branch, the CIA. The agency\u2019s right to assert claims of privilege was at best legally doubtful, and its insistence on the need to test the materials for relevance was still thinner gruel. Even if irrelevant, the CIA would have no right to withhold the documents from the investigators. Moreover, the Senate, and not the CIA, was the ultimate judge of relevance for these purposes.\n\nEven more absurd, in order to avoid wasting valuable man-hours of CIA agents on this review process, the CIA proposed bringing in outside contractors\u2014not government employees\u2014to complete it. In order to filter submissions to its congressional overseers, the CIA decided to let another team of persons, who otherwise would not have reviewed these documents, read and evaluate all of them. As they did so, the review team simply dumped the documents (which ultimately would amount to 6.2 million pages) on the committee, without offering them any index, organization, or structure. Delay was clearly the principal operating motivation for the CIA.\n\nFurthermore, the CIA soon turned its skills of spycraft against its congressional overseers. \u201cIn May of 2010, the committee staff noted that documents that had been provided for the committee\u2019s review were no longer accessible,\u201d Feinstein noted in her speech. When confronted about this, the committee\u2019s CIA interlocutors responded with a series of lies. First they denied that the documents had been removed, then that it was a problem for personnel servicing the computers. Finally they asserted that the \u201cremoval of the documents was ordered by the White House.\u201d But the White House denied this and provided further assurance that the CIA would stop accessing the committee\u2019s computers and removing documents.\n\nThat same year, committee investigators made another curious discovery. As the Senate committee was reviewing the documents, some CIA staffers were doing the same and were preparing an internal memorandum that summarized them, apparently intended as a document to brief Director Panetta. This document was also delivered to the committee and reviewed by its investigators. It would play a critical role after December 2012, when the committee delivered a 6,300-page study with a 480-page executive summary from its report to the White House and CIA for review and comment.\n\nTrue to its slow-walking strategy, the CIA took more than six months\u2014until June 27, 2013\u2014to respond. When it did so, the earlier confidential response was backed by the curiously coordinated crossfire of an assortment of actors\u2014former CIA directors and senior officials, disgraced former CIA agents whose involvement in the torture program was documented in the report, and media figures, often with close ties to the Bush administration authors of the program.\n\nTheir message was simple: waterboarding has produced major breakthroughs and disrupted actual terrorist plots, ultimately putting American Special Forces in a position to kill Osama bin Laden in the Abbottabad raid of May 2, 2011. However, the CIA\u2019s own records furnished no support for these claims.\n\nThis unofficial CIA response was driven heavily by apparent leaks from within the agency, and the hand of Director John O. Brennan was later revealed in the process. While the agency\u2019s defenders concentrated their fire on specific facts found and conclusions drawn by the report, it would turn out that the CIA\u2019s own internal review had come to most of the same conclusions. This was hardly surprising, since both the committee and the CIA were summarizing the same documents.\n\nBoth the internal Panetta report and the Senate committee report scrutinized the documents and evidence and found nothing to support claims that torture, particularly waterboarding, produced anything that materially advanced the search for terrorist leaders or planned strikes; both apparently concluded that these claims were unfounded. That produced intense embarrassment for the CIA and exposed the CIA\u2019s criticism of the Senate report as disingenuous\u2014as Feinstein noted, it stood \u201cfactually in conflict with its own internal review.\u201d\n\nEven more worryingly, while the Senate report was for the moment holding back from policy recommendations and other action, it set the stage for a high-stakes game on accountability for torture, including unexplained homicides involving prisoners.\n\nThe CIA had thus far escaped meaningful accountability through a combination of internal reviews and an independent examination of these questions through a special prosecutor appointed by the Bush administration Justice Department. In the end, the special prosecutor,\n\nJohn Durham, focused on a handful of cases involving homicide. He did not exonerate those involved but opted not to file charges on the basis of prosecutorial discretion. Durham had apparently concluded that the prosecution would inevitably involve the disclosure of highly classified information\u2014including the Justice Department\u2019s authorization of torture and the CIA\u2019s use of it\u2014that would harm the interests of the United States (or, more particularly, the Justice Department and CIA). He therefore dropped the investigation, even though the evidence collected had already proven sufficient in some instances for successful prosecutions in the military justice system.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The inside, untold story of CIA's efforts to mislead Congress -- and the people -- about torture will horrify you", "title": "How the CIA gets away with it: Our democracy is their real enemy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The inside, untold story of CIA's efforts to mislead Congress -- and the people -- about torture will horrify you", "title": "How the CIA gets away with it: Our democracy is their real enemy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/21/how_the_cia_gets_away_with_it_our_democracy_is_their_real_enemy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/jason_bourne.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The inside, untold story of CIA's efforts to mislead Congress -- and the people -- about torture will horrify you", "title": "How the CIA gets away with it: Our democracy is their real enemy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/jason_bourne.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Horton", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abu Ghraib, Books, CIA, Dianne Feinstein, Editor's Picks, excerpts, John Brennan, Leon Panetta, Torture", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The committee resolved with near-unanimity (on a 14\u20131 vote) to launch a comprehensive investigation of the CIA program involving black sites and torture.\nThis was hardly surprising, since both the committee and the CIA were summarizing the same documents.\nThroughout the subsequent decades, the CIA complained loudly about the burdens of oversight and accountability\u2014while almost always getting its way.\nEven more absurd, in order to avoid wasting valuable man-hours of CIA agents on this review process, the CIA proposed bringing in outside contractors\u2014not government employees\u2014to complete it.\nThe CIA chose to react to plans for a congressional probe cautiously, with a series of tactical maneuvers and skirmishes."}
