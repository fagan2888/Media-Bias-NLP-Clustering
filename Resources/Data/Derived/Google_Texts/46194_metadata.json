You don\u2019t know the half of it.\n\nWe\u2019re all painfully aware of what the government confiscates from our paychecks. And the annual frustration of tax season is all too familiar to us. But if we assume that\u2019s the extent of what government costs us, we\u2019re sadly mistaken.\n\nThe only thing worse than the bill you know you\u2019re paying is the one you don\u2019t know you\u2019re paying. I\u2019m referring to what some economists call \u201cthe hidden tax\u201d: regulations. With good reason are they often labeled \u201cred tape,\u201d as in something that binds us, or holds us back.\n\nA new report from the Heritage Foundation shows just how expensive these regulations can be. \u201cMore than $22 billion per year in new regulatory costs were imposed on Americans last year, pushing the total burden for the Obama years to exceed $100 billion annually,\u201d James L. Gattuso and Diane Katz write. \u201cThat\u2019s a dollar for every star in the galaxy, or one for every second in 32 years.\u201d\n\nBut wait, some may say. These costs are imposed on businesses, therefore they are the ones to pay it. Wrong. They pass the bill on to the consumer, of course. They may not label them on an itemized invoice as \u201cregulatory costs,\u201d but these costs are there \u2014 quietly rolled in, silently pulling dollars from your wallet.\n\nThese costs can manifest themselves in ways you might not expect. You might see them in restricted access to credit, brought on by the hundreds of new rules that have cropped up under the DoddFrank financial regulation statute. Or it might mean fewer health care choices and higher medical costs from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHow about business innovations that go unrealized? That\u2019s another often-overlooked cost of regulation. How about the reduced Internet investment we all get under the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s \u201cnetwork neutrality\u201d rules?\n\nThese examples are just a few of the 2,353 regulations of 2015, and the 20,642 that have come into effect since President Obama took office in 2009. (The onus isn\u2019t all on him, by the way; his predecessor, President George W. Bush, issued quite a few regulations during his second term.)\n\nSome don\u2019t even accomplish what they set out to do. Consider what Mr. Gattuso and Ms. Katz call \u201cthe worst of last year\u2019s wave\u201d: the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan. The rule \u201crepresents the first direct regulation of so-called greenhouse-gas emissions from power plants, at a cost of $7.2 billion a year (and far more according to critics),\u201d they write. And yet \u201cdespite the huge costs, the plan will do nothing to mitigate global warming.\u201d\n\nThat $100 billion price tag, by the way, doesn\u2019t even come close to summing up the full regulatory reach from Washington. Because it\u2019s for \u201cmajor rules,\u201d or ones that are expected to cost the economy $100 million or more annually. Many other rules fall below that threshold, of course, but they cost the economy quite a bit too when added up.\n\nTo make matters worse, other proposed or final rules are in the pipeline \u2014 more than 2,000, in fact, including 144 major rules. You can expect to pay more via additional \u201cenergy efficient\u201d mandates for home and commercial appliances, for example, as well as additional food-labeling requirements, more limits on credit, and stricter fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks.\n\nThe need for reform in the post-Obama era should be obvious. Mr. Gattuso and Ms. Katz recommend that legislation be required to go through an \u201cimpact analysis\u201d before a floor vote in Congress. It would also help if every major regulation had to get congressional approval before taking effect. \u201cSunset\u201d rules are needed as well to ensure that outdated regulations don\u2019t stay on the books indefinitely.\n\nNone of this will happen without congressional action, and that means Americans have to demand action. Are we willing to keep paying an ever-rising \u201chidden tax,\u201d or will we speak up?\n\n\u2022 Ed Feulner is the founder of the Heritage Foundation (heritage.org).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Think you pay a lot in taxes?
