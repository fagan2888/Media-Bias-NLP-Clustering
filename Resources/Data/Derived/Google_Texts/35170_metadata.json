Messages repeatedly left with the hotel's management for comment were not returned.\n\nThe 21-year-old mother worked at the hotel for two years before going on maternity leave in May. She was scheduled to return to work on Aug. 24. First, she sat down with the general and assistant managers of her hotel to discuss how her work schedule would change now that she was a mom.\n\n\n\nWhen she asked to have two 15-minute breaks per day to pump milk for her daughter, she claims the general manager told her no breaks were allowed. She had to stay at the front desk for eight hours straight.\n\n\u201cI told him how important these breaks are; going eight hours without pumping can lead to mastitis and clogged ducts and eventually drying up,\u201d wrote Gossard.\n\nHowever, her boss told her that he would need to put two people on every shift to cover her desk if she took breaks. She offered to take morning shift so that a manager could cover her desk during the breaks, and the general manager said he would speak with the owner of the hotel about that.\n\nA week later, she received a text: \u201cI got the reply that there are no positions available that meet the requirements that I need. I then asked so I can't work at all, all because I want my legal breaks and I was told, sorry, there are no positions available,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cHow unfair is that? I bring a beautiful baby into this world, want to feed her the best way I can and in return get fired from my job!\u201d\n\nIronically, Gossard was fired during World Breastfeeding Week. She has shared her story on social media in an effort to bring attention to an action she sees as not just unjust, but illegal.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires businesses to provide breaks and a private room for mothers to pump breast milk. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees are exempt, but only if providing the accommodation would \u201cimpose an undue hardship.\u201d\n\n\"It seems like a blatant violation of that law,\" said Richard Schall, a Moorestown attorney who specializes in employment law. He is unaffiliated with the case.\n\n\"Any employer, even a small employer, is going to have an extraordinarily hard time saying that giving an employee a 15 minute break in the morning and a 15 minute break in the afternoon is an undue hardship,\" he said.\n\nHe explained: \"The key word is 'undue.' Yeah, it might be a hardship, it might be an inconvenience, but that's what the law requires.\"\n\nIt is not clear how many employees the Hampton Inn has, but Gossard says she was not asking for a burdensome accommodation.\n\n\"It's the manager's job to cover shifts when needed and for 15 minutes, they could've done that,\" she told NJ.com. \"They could've worked with me. They didn't even try to accommodate me any bit, move me to a new position, nothing.\"\n\nIn fact, Gossard pointed out that another Hampton Inn in Indianapolis was actually featured on WomensHealth.gov, which is run by the federal government\u2019s Office on Women\u2019s Health, as an exemplary workplace for nursing mothers.\n\n\u201cWe provide lactation support for our mothers here at the hotel should they need,\u201d said Lisa Wiggers, general manager of the Indiana hotel, in a video on the website.\n\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t a business do this?\u201d Wiggers added. \u201cIt seems just to be common sense that you would care and support for your staff, staff that come to work faithfully every day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/static/global/config/browserconfig.xml", "description": "A single mom in Burlington County says that she was fired for needing to take breaks to pump breast milk.", "p": {"domain_verify": "eecb67825f8dac79c48fd3fd2c5a2a10"}, "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"description": "21-year-old single mother worked at Hampton Inn in Bordentown, Burlington County", "title": "NJ mom says she was fired for needing to pump breast milk", "url": "http://www.phillyvoice.com/nj-mom-says-she-was-fired-needing-breaks/", "image": {"src": "http://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/Ariana_Gossard_Facebook.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg"}, "site": "@thephillyvoice", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#603cba", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://www.phillyvoice.com/nj-mom-says-she-was-fired-needing-breaks/", "image": "http://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/Ariana_Gossard_Facebook.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "site_name": "PhillyVoice", "description": "21-year-old single mother worked at Hampton Inn in Bordentown, Burlington County", "title": "NJ mom says she was fired for needing to pump breast milk"}, "msvalidate.01": "4D5580B7E87BE36A95828119B7AB1BE3", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/global/images/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "philadelphia, news, breastfeeding, jobs, new jersey, business, bordentown, hampton inn", "google-site-verification": "eWg_5HU7qyxLIjJ6ohS8pXIxrquJK4ZaWrLrk50o0Ss", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/global/images/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbf8a\"", "article_summary": "When she asked to have two 15-minute breaks per day to pump milk for her daughter, she claims the general manager told her no breaks were allowed.\nA Pemberton Township mom claims she was fired from her job at the Hampton Inn in Bordentown, New Jersey, because she needed to take breaks to pump breast milk for her newborn daughter.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires businesses to provide breaks and a private room for mothers to pump breast milk.\nA \"nurse-in\" protest is being planned at the hotel this Sunday, Gossard told PhillyVoice.\n\u201cWe provide lactation support for our mothers here at the hotel should they need,\u201d said Lisa Wiggers, general manager of the Indiana hotel, in a video on the website."}
