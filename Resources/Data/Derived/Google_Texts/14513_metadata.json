The bill is purely symbolic as there is not enough support to override President Barack Obama's awaiting veto. (AP file)\n\nWASHINGTON (MEDIA GENERAL) \u2013 A bill the President definitely will not let be law, a new special committee, and a lot fewer days on Capitol Hill for Congress.\n\nHere\u2019s your Capitol Edge:\n\nSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) promises the first week of 2016 also will be the first time Congress sends a bill to President Obama repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll finally get a bill to his desk to veto,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nIt will all be symbolic. They do not have enough Republicans in Congress to overpower the President\u2019s expected veto.\n\nThe President will be giving his final State of the Union speech earlier than normal \u2014 January 12th. After that, he will spend a large amount of his presidency traveling the globe trying to cement his legacy before someone new comes into office.\n\nIn 2016, we may also learn the findings from the Select Committee investigating Benghazi. But we will definitely hear more about a new committee set to look into abortion practices across the United States.\n\n\u201cIt is the abortion industry at large, it is not specific to Planned Parenthood,\u201d Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said.\n\nCongress will not be spending much time on Capitol Hill this election year. The House will only be in session 110 days, while the Senate will not be in session two months of the summer and all of October.\n\nCongressional leaders have said their biggest goal is to fix the budget process. Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have said they want to pass 12 separate appropriations bills. For years, Congress has passed large, last-minute budget bills ahead of shutdown deadlines.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) promises the first week of 2016 also will be the first time Congress sends a bill to President Obama\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) promises the first week of 2016 also will be the first time Congress sends a bill to President Obama repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.", "title": "Capitol Edge: Republicans pushing symbolic bill to defund Obamacare, PP", "url": "http://wivb.com/2016/01/01/capitol-edge-republicans-pushing-symbolic-bill-to-defund-obamacare-pp/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ryan.jpg", "height": 370}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) promises the first week of 2016 also will be the first time Congress sends a bill to President Obama repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.", "title": "Capitol Edge: Republicans pushing symbolic bill to defund Obamacare, PP", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/ryan.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@news4buffalo", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "wivb.com", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2016-01-01T23:32:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-01T23:32:26+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16"}, "article_summary": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and his fellow Republicans plan to start 2016 by approving a bill to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe bill is purely symbolic as there is not enough support to override President Barack Obama's awaiting veto.\n(AP file)WASHINGTON (MEDIA GENERAL) \u2013 A bill the President definitely will not let be law, a new special committee, and a lot fewer days on Capitol Hill for Congress.\nHere\u2019s your Capitol Edge:Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) promises the first week of 2016 also will be the first time Congress sends a bill to President Obama repealing Obamacare and defunding Planned Parenthood.\nSpeaker Ryan and Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have said they want to pass 12 separate appropriations bills."}
