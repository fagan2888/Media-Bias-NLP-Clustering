Chris Christie hosts a town hall meeting at Shooters Sports Pub in Exeter, N.H. on Friday, April 17. Tyson Trish/The Record of Bergen County/Associated Press\n\nGov. Chris Christie will travel to Missouri for a fundraiser held by financiers, speak before a Washington D.C. summit of dignitaries on foreign policy and host a benefit for the New Jersey GOP this week.\n\nThe events contrast where the potential 2016 presidential candidate ended his week last Friday: at a Shooters Sports Pub in New Hampshire.\n\nAs part of his foray into the first-in-the-nation primary state last week, Mr. Christie brought one of his signature town hall meetings to a local bar in Exeter, N.H. The roughly 100 attendees\u2014some who sat at tables with shots and beers\u2014shouted questions and comments at Mr. Christie as he stood in the middle of a circle of chairs crammed between a pool table and a wooden bar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to call them out. That\u2019s what they are here for,\u201d said George Zeiter, a 62-year-old local resident at Shooters, who birddogged Mr. Christie with his opinions during the 70-minute forum and plans to do the same with other 2016 contenders.\n\nMr. Christie is balancing business back home in New Jersey with a growing amount of national travel to support a potential presidential bid.\n\nOn Monday, he attends a meet-and-greet lunch in Springfield, Mo., co-hosted by St. Louis financier Jeff Fox, GOP donor Rex Sinquefield and August Busch, the former chairman of Anheuser-Busch and a lifelong Republican, according to a copy of the invitation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Christie will address the 45th annual Conference on the Americas in Washington in his capacity as governor. Honduras President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez and senior Obama administration officials\u2014including Secretary of State John Kerry\u2014will also speak at the event.\n\nLater Tuesday, Mr. Christie will appear at a private fundraiser for the New Jersey State Republican Committee. Jerry Langer, a trucking magnate who is finance committee member for Mr. Christie\u2019s political-action committee, is holding the fundraiser which is expected to raise more than $200,000 for the state party.\n\n\u201cThe response has been tremendous,\u201d said Mr. Langer, adding he had expanded the guest list slots at his home given the response. Fillet mignon and fish will be served.\n\nThe menu at Shooters featured pepperoni pizza, barbecue-flavored chips and beer. During the town hall meeting, attendees asked Mr. Christie about his plan to means-test Social Security benefits, welfare spending and immigration policy.\n\nMr. Christie\u2019s views against gay marriage got rounds of applause, and attendees said they generally liked his style.\n\nEric McGlashing, a local business owner, said he liked Mr. Christie\u2019s straight talk, but wanted him to provide more detail in response to a question his wife posed on tax policy toward small business owners. He also wondered why Mr. Christie hadn\u2019t declared he was running yet.\n\n\u201cThe non-committal element is a big question for me,\u201d said Mr. McGlashing, of Brentwood, N.H.\n\nWhile Mr. Christie set rules for his New Jersey town halls and typically doesn\u2019t tolerate outbursts, he allowed for several back and forth exchanges Friday.\n\n\u201cSocial Security is not an entitlement governor,\u201d Mr. Zeiter shouted out in response to Mr. Christie\u2019s policy to raise the retirement age and reduce entitlement benefits for wealthy seniors.\n\n\u201cIt is an entitlement sir,\u201d Mr. Christie responded.\n\n\u201cNo it is not. We\u2019ve paid for that,\u201d Mr. Zeiter shouted back.\n\nMr. Christie was feisty but never lost his temper throughout the evening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I need a better answer, you just want me to have your answer,\u201d he said in response to one attendee who criticized his earlier comments on climate change. \u201cI\u2019m happy to listen to you.\u201d\n\nMr. Christie fielded two questions on climate change, a sticky issue for Republicans. The governor said he believes in climate change, but doesn\u2019t support taxing carbon emissions. Alternative energy and negotiations with other countries to reduce pollutants should be encouraged instead, Mr. Christie said.\n\n\u201cI believe climate change is real. The question is how you address it,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the night\u2019s end, Mr. Christie said he enjoyed the \u201cspirited interaction with folks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo a town hall at a pub worked out generally OK,\u201d Mr. Christie said. \u201cNobody walked out. Nobody threw a beer at me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Gov.
