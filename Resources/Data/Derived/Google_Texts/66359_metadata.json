In a News & Observer report by Mandy Locke, a clear pattern emerges: Berry doesn\u2019t see her mission as protecting workers; she sees it as protecting business, even when workers are getting shortchanged. Time and again, her department has fallen short on investigations of unpaid wages\u2026.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing complicated about what\u2019s going on here. Berry, whose image is on every elevator in North Carolina (her department has oversight of inspections), has gained a certain amount of name recognition over the years. She has kept winning office. But the public, except for those workers whose problems have been ignored, doesn\u2019t pay much attention to whether Berry is doing her job.\n\nShe\u2019s not. And now, with Republicans in charge of the governor\u2019s office and the General Assembly, where there is virtually no interest on the part of the majority in workers\u2019 rights, Berry is able to simply sit tight\u2026.\n\nWith Berry, the problems go from workers not being paid for work performed to a commissioner being paid for duties unfulfilled. Both problems need to stop being tolerated and start being fixed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "But the public, except for those workers whose problems have been ignored, doesn\u2019t pay much attention to whether Berry is doing her job.\nWith Berry, the problems go from workers not being paid for work performed to a commissioner being paid for duties unfulfilled.\nIn a News & Observer report by Mandy Locke, a clear pattern emerges: Berry doesn\u2019t see her mission as protecting workers; she sees it as protecting business, even when workers are getting shortchanged.\nThe lead editorial in this morning\u2019s edition of Raleigh\u2019s News & Observer puts it succinctly as it comments on the ongoing N&O series by reporter Mandy Locke on Labor Commissioner Cherie Berry:\u201cShe wasn\u2019t doing her job when Democrats were in power, and she\u2019s not doing it now.\nBerry, whose image is on every elevator in North Carolina (her department has oversight of inspections), has gained a certain amount of name recognition over the years."}
