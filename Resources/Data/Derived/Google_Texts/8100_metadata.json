Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAs baby boomers with Alzheimer's live longer, they will begin to develop more severe forms of the disease and the cost of caring for them will go through the roof, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association.\n\n\"During the time they are living, they continue to degenerate,\" Fargo said. \"Many people end up in long-term care or nursing homes, and require around-the-clock care for many years. This isn't like you get a heart attack and you pass away. You get this degenerative disease and it requires that you get care for many years.\"", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "baby boomers, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimer's cases, Alzheimer's cases increasing, Alzheimer's rates going up", "og": {"site_name": "WebMD", "description": "By 2050, half of that generation's survivors will have the mind-wasting disease, study predicts", "title": "As Baby Boomers Age, Alzheimer's Rates Will Soar", "url": "http://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/20150720/as-baby-boomers-age-alzheimers-rates-will-soar", "image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/news/healthday/2013/09/alzheimer9181.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 11736558481, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "description": "By 2050, half of that generation's survivors will have the mind-wasting disease, study predicts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}}, "article_summary": "More than 28 million baby boomers will develop Alzheimer's disease during the course of their lifetimes, the researchers estimated.\nThat means that by 2040, more than twice as many baby boomers will have Alzheimer's disease (10.3 million) compared with the equivalent age group in 2015 (4.7 million), the researchers said.\nImprovements in medical science are allowing people to live longer, but a long life is the main risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease, she said.\nThat's up from an estimated 1.2 percent prevalence of Alzheimer's among boomers in 2020, when most boomers will be in their 60s and early 70s, Alecxih said.\nThe cost of caring for more than 10 million Alzheimer's patients will consume nearly 25 percent of Medicare spending in 2040, the study predicted."}
