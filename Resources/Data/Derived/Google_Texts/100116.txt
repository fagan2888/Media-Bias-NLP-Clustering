HUNTINGTON, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- You've seen them a lot lately during commercial breaks on TV, and Tuesday night you could see them on the same stage.

Election Day is three weeks away. One of the hotly contested races in our region is the 3rd District Congressional race in West Virginia between Democratic incumbent Nick Rahall, seeking his 20th term, and Republican State Sen. Evan Jenkins.

The two participated in a debate at the Pullman Plaza Hotel. The discussion covered a variety of issues including coal mining, healthcare and foreign affairs.

Both accused each other of not being truly supportive of the coal industry.

"You can not be pro coal and vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker six times who wants to kill coal,” Jenkins said. “These policies are devastating to our coal industry."

"Look who the big backers of his campaign are,” Rahall said. “Don Blankenship, the Koch brothers, each one and their wives have personally maxed out to him. Follow the money. That will tell you what side he's on.”

Jenkins criticized Rahall for his support of the Affordable Care Act.

"Our healthcare system is broken,” Jenkins said. “We need a true healthcare system that actually does promote access. (Obamacare) has raised prices on small businesses. It has caused coverage to decrease.”

Rahall defended elements of the Affordable Care Act, but also said he’s voted to change parts of it.

"I've voted numerous times to tweak it and make the amendments necessary,” Rahall said. “It's time we put politics aside on this and make it work for the American people."
