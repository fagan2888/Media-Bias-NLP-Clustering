After becoming pregnant out of wedlock in Ireland in 1951, a teenage Lee was disowned by her father and sent to live and work in a convent alongside other unmarried mothers. When her son Anthony was three years old, the convent\u2019s nuns, in exchange for a generous donation, gave him up for adoption to Americans, who were told he was an orphan. A distraught Lee watched from an upstairs window as strangers drove off with her child. For the next 50 years, Lee told nobody about Anthony. That\u2019s just how life went for sinners in the Catholic Church, she thought. But one day, she told her secret to her daughter, Jane Libberton, who quickly began the search for Lee\u2019s long-lost child. It wasn't easy: Irish law makes it extremely difficult for adopted children to learn about their parents and birth records, and the nuns at the convent where Lee lived stonewalled her requests for information. Eventually, Libberton pieced together the identity of Anthony: Renamed Michael Hess by his American parents, he\u2019d grown up to be a top attorney for the Republican National Committee.\n\nRelated Story The Best Movies of 2013 By the time Lee and Libberton solved the mystery, however, they were too late: Hess had died of AIDS in 1995. His ashes had been buried at the the convent at Hess\u2019s request\u2014he hoped that his mother would return and find him. Just as the nuns wouldn't give Lee and Libberton any answers about what happened to Anthony, Hess himself had journeyed to Ireland to ask about his mother\u2014with no luck. Acclaim and Oscar nominations for Philomena, based off journalist Martin Sixsmith's book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, have brought international attention to the stories of Lee and the thousands of women just like her. Last month, Lee partnered with the Adoption Rights Alliance to launch The Philomena Project, which will advocate for changes to Ireland's adoption-records policies and help connect mothers and children separated by the country's history of forced adoptions. In late January, Lee, Libberton, and Mari Steed, U.S. coordinator of the ARA, traveled to Washington D.C. to meet with senators and diplomats about the project, and they spoke to The Atlantic about the film, faith, and forgiveness. This interview has been condensed and edited. When you started your journey a decade ago, did you ever think it would bring you to Washington? Philomena: No way whatsoever. Jane: When mom first met Martin, she didn\u2019t even really want it to be a book, did you? You didn\u2019t really want the story. Philomena: Oh no. When I told my daughter after 50 years, I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d Because I kept it a secret so long. No way. So then I just decided, well, look, if it can help a lot of mothers my age, I\u2019m nearly 80\u2014 Jane: You are 80! Philomena: We were ostracized in them days because we had babies out of wedlock, because that was a very awful thing to do. Women my age kept it a secret and wouldn\u2019t tell their families. A lot of the babies born, their offspring, they\u2019re now looking for them. A lot of ladies my age still haven\u2019t come out to say it. So many people responded to the film, and a lot of them actually were women like me coming out. People like Mari and her colleagues have been trying for years to get the government in Ireland to give people rights to their records.\n\nIs the project more about helping adopted children here connect with parents in Ireland, or about putting pressure on Ireland to change its policies? Mari: Both. Some of the senators and congressmen we met are from the states where a lot of the babies were placed to\u2014in Anthony\u2019s case, Missouri\u2014so we met with Senators Roy Blunt and Claire McCaskill. Somebody might go to their local representatives and say, \u201cI was born in Ireland and am a citizen here, what do I do?\u201d Likewise, we met the Irish ambassador [Anne Anderson] and it\u2019s the same thing. \u201cIf one of our citizens should happen to come to the Irish Embassy or call one of the consulates, would you be able to give them these resources and point us in the right direction?\u201d We don\u2019t want to do any hard-hitting political lobbying, but we would like them to lend their voices and their support if at all possible. I think the response was very positive. Jane: It was very positive! Obviously my mom and I have no experience of being here in Washington and meeting senators, that\u2019s like\u2014 Philomena: Wow-wee! Jane: We had no idea what to expect. Each and every one was different, but very positive. We felt like we were following in Anthony\u2019s footsteps because he worked in these buildings. That must have been special. Philomena: Very much so. This was his world. Activists have said you'd need to drag Ireland to the United Nations to see these changes happen. Have you had more success going the political route than through the Church? \"We\u2019re just telling the truth of what happened. It was never, ever from the start meant to be an attack on the Church.\" Mari: Absolutely. With the Church, you really will get nowhere. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a negative or a positive. That\u2019s simply what it is. They\u2019re not going to change their mind or suddenly change their policies. And not only that, but all of the records, as of this year, have finally been transferred out from under the ownership of Church agents and are now under the government\u2019s Health Service Executive in Ireland, so we\u2019ve almost removed the Church from the picture, at least as far as the records are concerned. But I think eventually it may take a UN case similar to the Magdalenes cause in Ireland. We\u2019ve got the right players, we\u2019ve got people affiliated with the project. If we have to go that route, we will. Have the ways the Catholic Church has changed in the past several decades made it any easier?\n\nMari: Yeah, not really. Their attitudes really haven\u2019t changed. Jane: In Ireland. Mari: Yeah, absolutely not in Ireland. Here in the States, we tend to get a lot more encouragement and sympathy. In Ireland, it\u2019s still this stubborn willfulness. They\u2019d rather stay silent and take the bad press than issue apologies, because they know that will open them up to legal liabilities. Jane: My mom still very much has her faith and is still quite protective of the Church, so you find it a bit awkward sometimes. Philomena: Sometimes. You just believed everything you were told. You didn\u2019t query it, you just didn\u2019t query it. People would say, \u201cAre you against the Catholic Church?\u201d No, I\u2019m not. At the time they did it, they took me in, they gave me a home for my baby. They gave us a home. It was the Church that caused all the problems because the Church made a baby out of wedlock a mortal sin. So we firmly believed we were sinners. That\u2019s the teaching of the Church. Were you worried people would take an anti-Catholic message away from the movie? Jane: I don\u2019t think we even thought about the Catholic stance at all, this is just my mom\u2019s story and what happened to her. Obviously people have come out and said, \u201cThis is an anti-Catholic film.\u201d It was never intended to be. This is what happened. \"People can\u2019t understand how I could have been so forgiving.\" Philomena: No! It\u2019s my story. Jane: There are other Catholic groups that are in support of it, [saying] that it isn\u2019t an anti-Catholic film because she retains her faith all the way through it. We\u2019re just telling the truth of what happened. It was never, ever from the start meant to be an attack on the Church. Steve Coogan [who plays Martin Sixsmith] says the same thing. He\u2019s from an Irish-Catholic family. He spent a lot of time with women my mom\u2019s age when he was a child. He never set out at all to make an anti-Catholic film. It\u2019s just different people who have different views. As mom said, yes, they did take her in. Where else would she have gone? But they kind of caused the problem in the first place. They were part of the solution, but they were part of the problem.\n\nDid you feel surprised that so many people found your commitment to your faith inspiring? Philomena: We did, actually. People can\u2019t understand how I could have been so forgiving. But I mean, Anthony would have been 61 last year. When he was adopted and taken away, I went to Liverpool, two years I stayed there, and then I went down and did psychiatric nursing for 30 years. Now, you don\u2019t work in a psychiatric hospital and not see some awful, sad faces. You see so much hurt and pain caused by anger. I was angry in the beginning, and I used to think, why did this happen to me? And then nursing the patients, sitting down and talking with them, helping them with their problems\u2014it made my own slide into the background. I\u2019ve seen so much hurt caused through anger. And I thought, \u201cI couldn\u2019t go through my whole life being angry.\u201d It\u2019s just not in my nature to be angry. I was upset and very sad and very hurt. But I just went on with life and got married and had children. Working with psychiatric patients, it helped me to heal a lot of the pain I had. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is the moment of forgiveness near the end. Steve Coogan, as Martin, seems confused by it, asking, \u201cJust like that?\u201d But Judi Dench, as you, says it actually takes everything inside you to forgive. Philomena: When my daughter first found out about this story, she was very angry, and I think Steve Coogan took on her anger. Jane: Martin was a political journalist, and he wasn\u2019t particularly angry. He\u2019s seen all sort of things in his career. Steve asked a particular question of whether you forgive the nuns, and you did. I said, \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d so he took the anger and put it in his character. Martin wasn\u2019t an angry character, he was a journalist. Were the nuns as big of an obstacle in learning about Anthony as they appeared in the movie? Jane: When we went the first time, they didn\u2019t help. They were very pleasant very nice. Philomena: Lovely. Jane: We sat down to tea like this. We knew Anthony\u2019s grave was there. But they didn\u2019t give us any information about the American side of things. When we went back the second year, I\u2019d said we found Anthony\u2019s partner and we found Mary, who was adopted with Anthony, and then they went to the cupboard and gave me papers they could have given me before. Without those papers, there never would have been a book. They just weren\u2019t helpful. \"We were ostracized so much. We had to lose our identities. I wasn\u2019t Philomena Lee anymore. I got a name called Marcella. For three and a half years, I was Marcella.\" Did they not fully understand? Jane: Oh, they understood. [The character] Sister Margaret was [based off] the present-day nun we met with Martin. She was delightful. She\u2019s English like I am, so she knew where I was coming from, because in the United Kingdom, at 18 years old, you can find out your history if you\u2019re adopted. In Ireland, you can\u2019t. I didn\u2019t get angry with her. I was angry, but I didn\u2019t shout out her like Steve Coogan shouts at Sister Hildegard [in the movie]. She knew exactly what I meant when I said, \u201cTo me, what you\u2019re doing is completely wrong.\u201d She did sit there kind of stony-faced. She was in the position where she felt she couldn\u2019t give me the information because that\u2019s what she\u2019d been taught by the Church. And we\u2019re only talking about seven years ago. It wasn\u2019t a long time ago. The Weinstein Company Did you have a sense of how widespread this was?\n\nPhilomena: You mean everybody having babies? Women having babies? The forced adoptions across the country, I mean. Philomena: I was a teenager at the time. I didn\u2019t know anything about that. I didn\u2019t know about babies being gone abroad and getting donations for them. I didn\u2019t know the first thing about that. How would we know? The nuns wouldn\u2019t tell you. We were Catholic, we went to church, we went to mass, that\u2019s all we did. I worked in the laundry for three and a half years. Mari: There were many Irish families who might have had a mother and baby home just up the road and didn\u2019t even know it. They just knew it was the nuns who ran their business. Nobody really knew what went on behind the walls or dared ask. I think they had an inkling, it just wasn\u2019t discussed. Philomena: And often the mother\u2019s parents were glad to get rid of you, because it was such a shame on them. We were ostracized so much. We had to lose our identities. I wasn\u2019t Philomena Lee anymore. I got a name called Marcella. For three and a half years, I was Marcella. Some of the women now come forward and say, \u201cDid you remember me when I was there?\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have remembered them because they\u2019d have another name. From the day I went in till the day I came out I was Marcella, not Philomena Lee. \"And the whole of my life, all I wanted was to find him. Finding out he was dead was very hard, but at least I found him.\" Tell me about the first time you told Jane about Anthony. Philomena: I go home to Ireland every year. I call it home still even though I\u2019ve lived 56 years in England. My brother, he was a young lad. He was 18 months older than me when I went to the home. He drove me when they discovered I was pregnant. He bounced him on his knees and hugged him and loved him. My father was out signing papers with the nuns\u2014in them days you didn\u2019t query what they were doing\u2014and my brother was out with me in the halls. For years he felt so guilty. \u201cI should have run away with him.\u201d But with the police, the guards, we call them guards in Ireland, [he] wouldn\u2019t have gotten away with it. I went home in 2003, was it? He said, \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, go back home and tell them.\u201d My son is older than Jane. I went home and sat them down and told them.\n\nJane: Well, you told me. You came out to see me. I\u2019d just moved house and renovated it. And my mom, you\u2019d [just] been to Ireland, and you said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll pop around and see you.\u201d It was slightly unusual because we normally meet in the day, and you were feigning interest in my decor. I just had some new light switches. I remember it very clearly. You looked at them said, \u201cThey\u2019re very nice.\u201d You\u2019re not really into that kind of thing. Philomena: Not decorating, no. Jane: So she sat down, and we did open a bottle of wine, and she just came out with it. \u201cI had a baby in Ireland,\u201d I think is what you said. But immediately I knew who this child was because we always had his photograph in with all the other family photos. He always looked like he was in an odd place because he\u2019s got nuns with him, or he looks like he\u2019s in a hospital. I had asked you once when I was a child, and you said it was a cousin\u2019s son, and I didn\u2019t think anything more of that. But I felt immediately sorry for her, because I\u2019ve got children, and he was three and a half when he was adopted. I couldn\u2019t imagine having to give a child away at that age. It would just be awful. Philomena: Awful, awful. Jane: Clearly you would have bonded with him because they\u2019re little people at that age. Philomena: He was a lovely, lovely little boy. What was it like seeing the movie for the first time? Philomena: We didn\u2019t know what to make of it, did we? We saw it together. Jane: It was very hard to judge whether it was good or not because we\u2019d been so involved in it. We met the next day at lunch and I said, \u201cI think it\u2019s okay? I think we\u2019ll be alright with this film.\u201d But we couldn\u2019t tell. People asked me if it was good and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t tell you if it was good.\u201d Philomena: We couldn\u2019t! Jane: It took a couple viewings. Then it went to the Venice Film Festival and received such fantastic reviews. I started reading the reviews to mom, and we could see why people liked it. But it took other people to point us in the right direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forced to give up her child for adoption as a teenager, the woman who inspired the Oscar-nominated film starring Judi Dench talks about forgiveness and keeping her faith.", "author": "Nolan Feeney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Forced to give up her child for adoption as a teenager, the woman who inspired the Oscar-nominated film starring Judi Dench talks about forgiveness and keeping her faith.", "title": "The Real-Life Philomena: 'You See So Much Hurt Caused by Anger'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/philomena/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/02/the-real-life-em-philomena-em-you-see-so-much-hurt-caused-by-anger/283629/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3b3\"", "article_summary": "For decades, Philomena Lee didn\u2019t think there was anything interesting about her life story.\nAcclaim and Oscar nominations for Philomena, based off journalist Martin Sixsmith's book, The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, have brought international attention to the stories of Lee and the thousands of women just like her.\nFrom the day I went in till the day I came out I was Marcella, not Philomena Lee.\nI wasn\u2019t Philomena Lee anymore.\nI had asked you once when I was a child, and you said it was a cousin\u2019s son, and I didn\u2019t think anything more of that."}
