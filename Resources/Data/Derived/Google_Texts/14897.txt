There are plans to build the country's largest single family residence in northeast Edmond.

There are plans to build the country's largest single family residence in northeast Edmond.

Last year, the Edmond Planning Commission was asked to give approval to a mega mansion on the northwest corner of Sorghum Mill Road and Westminster Road.

"It's truly a castle," says Bob Schiermeyer, who saw the first renderings late last year and tells News 9 the plans call for a draw bridge and spires that reach 90 feet.

Schiermeyer says original plans called for a home that was around 75,000 square feet, but the home's architect says the home has now grown to 92,650 square feet. That architect says, if completed, the castle home will be the largest single family residence in the U.S.

The City of Edmond says the home is the idea of David Frayer, the owner of the Key Auto Group.

"He's hired an architect to make sure this is going to work. He's done quite a bit of research for a number of years to do this," says Schiermeyer.

"I think it's a just a family dream," says Schiermeyer about Frayer's motivation.

City records show that Frayer told planning commissioners that he and his family have visited castles in Europe while researching for the home. Frayer has purchased 140 acres at Sorghum Mill Road and Westminster Road.

The architect would not get into the cost of the home, but tells News 9 he hopes to begin construction in two months.

News 9 reached out to David Frayer, he declined our request for an interview.
