Parilla was arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder.\n\nThe shooting did not appear to have any connection to the ambush killings of two New York police officers a day earlier.\n\nAuthorities said Kondek responded to a noise call around 2 a.m. at an apartment complex. Parilla was pounding on doors, looking for a neighbor who \u201cdimed him out\u201d to police, authorities said. When Parilla saw Kondek, he fired multiple rounds at the officer, striking him once above his bullet-proof vest.\n\n\u201cWe know we have the right guy in custody,\u201d Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said. \u201cThis guy knew what he was doing, he killed a cop and he needs to be held accountable for that.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Florida Department of Corrections, Parilla served more than two years in prison for several offenses, including drug charges, and was released in March. He was listed as a fugitive for violating his probation. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what the violation was.\n\nThe sheriff said Parilla told investigators that when he saw the officer he \u201cfelt like a caged rat\u201d and didn\u2019t want to return to prison.\n\n\u201cI apologize to the family\u201d of the officer, Parilla told media outlets while being escorted to jail. \u201cThat was not my intention.\u201d\n\nKondek, 45, had been with the local force for 17 years.
