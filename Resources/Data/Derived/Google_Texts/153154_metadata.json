These include \u201cpayments for treatments or services that were not covered by the program, that were not medically necessary or that were billed for but never provided.\u201d\n\nMore than $508 billion was spent on Medicaid in 2014, with an estimated $17.5 billion of that funding improper payments. Expenditures are expected to increase to $529 billion this year.\n\nThere were around 72 million participants in 2013 \u2013 \u201croughly one-fifth of the U.S. population,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cIn 2003, GAO designated Medicaid as a high-risk program due to its size, growth, diversity of programs and concerns about gaps in oversight \u2013 and more than a decade later, those factors remain,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that this is a critical program for low-income individuals,\u201d said the report\u2019s co-author, GAO Health Care Director Carolyn Yocom, in a podcast released in connection with the report.\n\n\u201cHowever, it is also a big part of federal and state budgets, and we have a responsibility to ensure that the money goes to where it\u2019s most needed. We need better data and better information in order to accomplish that,\u201d Yocom said.\n\nMedicaid \u2013 which turned 50 July 30 \u2013 operates through a partnership between the federal and state governments. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid issues regulations and manages the programs, enforces oversight and provides more than half of the program\u2019s funding through reimbursements, while state governments handle administration.\n\n\u201cThere is an inherent tension between states\u2019 efforts to design programs that best meet their local needs and federal efforts to oversee the states\u2019 programs,\u201d the report said. \u201cAttention to the issues facing Medicaid and the effectiveness of its federal-state partnership will be important for ensuring that Medicaid is both effective for the enrollees who rely on it and accountable to the taxpayers.\u201d\n\nThe task is particularly challenging, as CMS must coordinate oversight with unique Medicaid programs for each state and Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cResponsibility for program integrity activities is spread across multiple state and federal entities, resulting in fragmented efforts, creating the potential for unnecessary duplication \u2026 as well as program areas not being covered,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn other words, the state and federal entities\u2019 fraud-prevention efforts will be redundant in some areas and nonexistent in others, leaving gaps in oversight.\n\n\u201cThe combined federal and state efforts have recovered only a small portion of the estimated improper payments in Medicaid, and the Medicaid improper payment rate has recently increased,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdditionally, Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and the increasing population of seniors \u201care likely to exacerbate the challenges in federal oversight,\u201d the report said.\n\nAs Medicaid spending and enrollees grow, so does the likelihood of improper payments, according to the GAO.\n\nExpenditures are expected to increase to around $700 billion by 2020 with 10 million additional enrollees.\n\nFollow Ethan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
