The four businesses, all part of owner Josh Loeb and Zoe Nathan's Rustic Canyon family, made the announcement in a newsletter to customers Friday.\n\nA 3% surcharge will appear on all guest checks beginning Sept. 1. All employees who work 30 or more hours a week will be given a fully covered HMO plan with a carrier, or the opportunity to contribute to a PPO plan. The restaurants have also pledged to add work hours for those who want benefits but don't meet the minimum 30 hours a week.\n\nThe newsletter insists the move was not motivated by the Affordable Care Act, which requires businesses to provide health benefits to employees. Restaurants with more than 100 full-time employees need to comply by 2015, while those with 50 to 100 employees have until 2016.\n\n\"As a community of independent and family run restaurants we want to provide the best work environment we can so that we can provide long term jobs and careers for our staff instead of the usual transient employment that is associated with the restaurant business,\" reads the newsletter. \"Offering health care is something we\u2019ve always wanted to do, but for a long time felt it was financially unrealistic.\"\n\nThe Rustic Canyon team worked with Suzanne Goin and Carolyn Styne (Lucques, AOC, Tavern, etc.), David Lentz (the Hungry Cats), Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo (Animal, Son of a Gun, Trois Mec, etc.) and Josiah Citrin (Melisse) to come up with a viable plan. The newsletter also mentions Walter Manzke and Bill Chait's decision to implement a surcharge at Republique.\n\n\"The cost of offering these benefits is significant and the reality is that restaurants, particularly smaller restaurants like the ones many of us own, have a very high ratio of staff members to revenue and run on very slim profit margins,\" reads the newsletter. \"We\u2019ve discussed simply raising menu prices, but ultimately food prices are tied in many ways to the ingredients we purchase. Those ingredient costs have increased astronomically recently so we\u2019re already struggling with working creatively to keep menu prices down.\"\n\nCustomers will be given the option to adjust their gratuity minus the 3% or they can ask to have the charge removed from the bill. Rustic Canyon will post how much it receives from the surcharge and how the money is spent on its website at the end of the first quarter of each year.\n\nGuests are encouraged to voice their questions or concerns regarding the surcharge with the restaurant staff on their next visit.\n\nRustic Canyon, 1119 Wilshire Blvd, Santa Monica, (310) 393-7050, www.rusticcanyonwinebar.com/.\n\nMore restaurant news?
