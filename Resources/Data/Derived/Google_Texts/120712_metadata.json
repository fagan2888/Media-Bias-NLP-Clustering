Distemper isn\u2019t as bad as rabies, but is something to be aware of when coming in contact with wild animals, especially foxes and raccoons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a virus similar to what humans get as the measles. It attacks the spinal cord and the brain of the fox,\u201d Brian McCary with Meridian Animal Control says.\n\nWorkers with Animal Control say they haven\u2019t seen distemper until recently. It\u2019s in raccoons and foxes. Police have come in contact with a few and had to euthanize them.\n\n\u201cLast week we came in contact with a fox at Merrehope off of 8th street,\u201d McCary explains. \u201cWe were able to walk right up to the fox so the fox was obviously disoriented, was just sitting there, very heavy saliva coming out of the foxes mouth and coughing, that\u2019s another side effect.\u201d\n\nA fox displaying symptoms of distemper was seen in the Papa John\u2019s parking lot on North Hills Street Saturday night. People trying to care for the fox said they thought it was hit by a car. Regardless of the situation McCary warns people to use caution if they see a fox or any other animal like this.\n\n\u201cWe ask that you do not walk right up to them because there has been instances where people have been bit. This disease can also be spread to your domesticated animals, your dogs can get it,\u201d McCary says.\n\nAlthough animal control has seen cases locally, McCary says it\u2019s widespread.\n\n\u201cTo my understanding we\u2019re not the only county that\u2019s had problems with this. There\u2019s other counties around the state of Mississippi and into Louisiana and Alabama that are having problems with this issue right now,\u201d McCary says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A rise of distemper among foxes has animal control warning the public about staying away from wildlife.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "A rise of distemper among foxes has animal control warning the public about staying away from wildlife.", "title": "A Distemper Outbreak in Wildlife has Authorities on Alert", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/A-Distemper-Outbreak-in-Wildlife-has-Authorities-on-Alert-289735561.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/468/A88/468A887C738F431AA480E23FD2AE3272", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/326/D8B/326D8BAD19584843A319D19FC8844368.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A rise of distemper among foxes has animal control warning the public about staying away from wildlife.", "title": "A Distemper Outbreak in Wildlife has Authorities on Alert", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/A-Distemper-Outbreak-in-Wildlife-has-Authorities-on-Alert-289735561.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Distempered+Fox.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "A Distemper Outbreak in Wildlife has Authorities on Alert", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "A Distemper Outbreak in Wildlife"}, "article_summary": "Workers with Animal Control say they haven\u2019t seen distemper until recently.\n\u201cWe ask that you do not walk right up to them because there has been instances where people have been bit.\nIt attacks the spinal cord and the brain of the fox,\u201d Brian McCary with Meridian Animal Control says.\nDistemper isn\u2019t as bad as rabies, but is something to be aware of when coming in contact with wild animals, especially foxes and raccoons.\nAlthough animal control has seen cases locally, McCary says it\u2019s widespread."}
