He also promised, \u201cWe will make America great again.\u201d\n\nThe businessman from New York made a stop in Oklahoma City after being in Texas with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie earlier in the day.\n\nGov. Christie introduced him at the rally and asked supporters for a \u201cTrump-sized win\u201d in Oklahoma. The former GOP presidential candidate endorsed the Republican front-runner on Friday, as reported by Breitbart News.\n\nTrump hit third-place contender Marco Rubio hard but called Ted Cruz \u201ca smarter guy\u201d and was much easier on him.\n\nTrump attacked \u201cLittle Rubio\u201d for buying a $179,000 house and selling it to a lobbyist for over $300,000. He also called the Florida senator a \u201cno-show\u201d professor who is paid for that position, and charged that Rubio\u2019s wife serves on a board but does no work and cashes in. Trump said he is up 20 percentage points in the Sunshine State.\n\nAlthough he called Texas Senator Cruz \u201ca smarter guy,\u201d he asked, but how do you defeat a sitting senator in Texas? He answered his own question claiming, \u201cThey are going to have a very embarrassing time.\u201d\n\nWhile the New Yorker strongly inferred that he was going to win in Cruz\u2019 home state, polls conducted in Texas when averaged, show that Cruz has a 34.0 percent of voters in Texas compared to Trump\u2019s 26.8 percent, as reported by Breitbart Texas. The Monmouth poll has Cruz far ahead at 38 percent. In that poll, Trump and Rubio are battling it out for second place at 23 and 21 percent.\n\nTrump went on to attack the trade deficits with China, Mexico, and Japan adding, the \u201cgreatest theft\u201d has been by China and cited $500 billion a year.\n\nTrump said that instead of \u201cpolitical hacks\u201d negotiating for the country, he will have businessmen who look out for America. He promised that the nation would have even better relationships with these countries.\n\nHe told the audience these countries have no respect for us now because we are not free-traders, we are \u201cstupid traders.\u201d Trump explained these \u201cone-sided\u201d deals are \u201cdestroying our country.\u201d He pointed at other countries who are stealing millions of jobs from Americans and said the 25 percent unemployment rate was a \u201cphony number.\u201d\n\nTrump said he is #1 in the polls, and has won all but one primary election but has spent the least amount of money.\n\nHe said he would have a bidding process for military purchases, and for purchases of drugs and other medical needs.\n\nTrump called Cruz and Rubio \u201cpoliticians\u201d and claimed he was the strongest on immigration, the border, and amnesty. He charged that Rubio \u201cis weak on amnesty,\u201d and while \u201cTed is a little stronger \u2026 he is a little weak.\u201d The presidential front runner claimed, \u201cIf I had not brought it up, it would not even be a subject right now.\u201d He said he began talking about immigration and \u201call of a sudden, it became a mainstay [of the GOP presidential primary].\u201d\n\nTrump told the crowd that he has been endorsed by Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and added, \u201cand that means that I have a very strong plan.\u201d He promised, \u201cWe are going to build the wall, and Mexico is going to pay.\u201d\n\nHe said people can come into the country, but stressed, \u201cthey have to come in the country legally, legally.\u201d He pointed to \u201ccertain politicians\u201d saying they wanted to bring thousands of folks in.\n\nThe GOP presidential candidate warned about what is happening with immigrants in Sweden, Germany, Brussels, and America. He reminded the crowd about \u201cKate who was killed in San Francisco.\u201d The crowd interrupted him again cheering, \u201cUSA, USA, USA!\u201d\n\nProtesters were removed twice during his speech but Trump took the opportunity to say there was a time when officers \u201cacted more quickly.\u201d He added they are \u201cafraid to move\u201d but understood because they are afraid to lose their pensions. He said he supports police officers but continued, \u201cWe really are becoming a frightened country.\u201d\n\nTrump said Cruz asked him about waterboarding, and told the rowdy crowd, \u201cI think it is just fine.\u201d He said they are beheading people and burning people in cages, and added, \u201cand it is okay if you take it a few steps above. It is tough stuff.\u201d\n\nHe said the nation has a weakened military, and we have to take care of our veterans. He said we have \u201cto knock out ISIS soundly and fast.\u201d\n\nTrump promised to get rid of Common Core, and added, we are #1 in cost per pupil but are #30 in the world in education.\n\nHe promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, and said \u201cit will happen quickly.\u201d When he said \u201cWe will protect the Second Amendment,\u201d the crowd again chanted \u201cUSA, USA, USA!\u201d He quipped, \u201cYou people, you do like your guns.\u201d\n\nAs to his supporters Trump said, \u201cthey don\u2019t leave me.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the rally he promised them, \u201cI am going to be the greatest president that God every created.\u201d\n\nLana Shadwick is a writer and legal analyst for Breitbart Texas.
