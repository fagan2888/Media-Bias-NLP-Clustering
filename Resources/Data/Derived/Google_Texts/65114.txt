NORTHGLENN — A man was shot multiple times by a Northglenn police officer Monday when he refused to drop a knife after an alleged attempted house burglary.

Police received a call from a woman at 12:47 p.m. reporting a man was trying to break into her home in the 11400 block of Fowler Drive, said Beth Carmosino, Northglenn police spokeswoman.

Police arrived shortly after the initial call and found the suspect near the side of the home, Carmosino said.

The man was armed with a knife, which he was ordered to drop multiple times by the first responding officer, according to Carmosino.

The officer reported to dispatch that the suspect told him he was not going to jail.

When the man did not drop the knife, the officer shot the suspect multiple times, Carmosino said.

It was not clear if the man was moving toward the officer while he was being given orders to drop the weapon.

White evidence markers were scattered on the lawn to the side of the house where the man was shot.

“This is something that we don’t like to have happen, especially around a holiday,” Carmosino said.

The suspect was taken to Denver Health Medical Center, and, around 3 p.m., was still in surgery for multiple gunshot wounds, Carmosino said.

The woman told police she did not know the man, Carmosino said.

It was unclear how old the man was or how large the knife was.

The officer who shot the suspect will be put on paid leave while the incident is under investigation, as per protocol.
