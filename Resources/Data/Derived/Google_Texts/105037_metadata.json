It would be his last easy shot of the night.\n\nThe Virginia Cavaliers boarded up Louisville\u2019s offense Saturday night. The Cardinals, desperate to run and create chaos, scored 13 first-half points. They shot 19 percent. It appeared ninth-ranked Louisville had a better chance of being hit by a halftime lightning strike or blessed with a lottery win than it did to make a basket. Harrell dunked with 10:33 to play in the half. Louisville would not have another field goal before going to the locker room.\n\nTo Virginia coach Tony Bennett, such a half is wondrous. Much of Saturday night\u2019s 52-47 win against Louisville in a full and loud John Paul Jones Arena are what Bennett family dreams are made of. Tony\u2019s father, Dick, scribbled down the nuances of the staunch defense during stops at Wisconsin-Green Bay, Wisconsin and Washington State. It\u2019s ingrained in Tony, and it\u2019s coursing through this current crop of Cavaliers.\n\nSEE ALSO: Virginia\u2019s Justin Anderson breaks finger, out at least a month\n\nIt also caught the attention of Louisville coach Rick Pitino. Already in the Basketball Hall of Fame, Pitino made his first career stop in Charlottesville on Saturday. He was the last coach to walk onto the floor. Flanked by security, he strutted out with his typical cock-of-the-walk stride. Bennett had already walked onto the floor to a huge roar. He waited at his bench, done glad-handing with Louisville\u2019s assistants, to shake Pitino\u2019s hand upon entrance.\n\nAfterward, Pitino praised the Virginia defense while lambasting his team\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d offense. The stature of more than 600 career wins, two NCAA tournament titles and 62 years on the planet allow Pitino to praise and explain an opponent the way younger coaches would or could not.\n\n\u201cBasically what they\u2019re doing, and what separates them, is that they have five guys who are alert to the ball,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cSome programs teach \u2018play your man, see the ball.\u2019 They play the ball. It\u2019s truly unique because they\u2019ll give up some threes sometimes and if you make it you\u2019ll stay in the game, like against Duke.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just well drilled and schooled at what they do. It\u2019s brilliant. I love what they do and I was trying to teach my freshmen six weeks ago to look at how this team plays as one. They\u2019re on a string moving with the ball. If they give up anything its going to be a late three or, if you create so much movement, you\u2019ll do what Chris Jones did in the second half and get to the rim. Unfortunately, we waited until the second half to do that.\u201d\n\nBennett is so adamant about those principles he pulled center Mike Tobey, among the few on the floor to put a ball through the rim in the first half, because of his first foul. With 4:44 to play in the first, Tobey banged into a driving Cardinals guard. Both hands out, he began to plead with his bench. Bennett turned and sent Anthony Gill into the game. He crouched next to Tobey on the bench to re-explain the defensive coverage he had told him earlier. Subbing him out despite Tobey scoring nine of Virginia\u2019s 24 first-half points confirmed prior threats.\n\n\u201cI was helping too much on the back,\u201d Tobey said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t getting up on the ball screens enough. On this team, you have to be able to play defense, otherwise you\u2019re not going to play. He\u2019s very strict about that.\u201d\n\nThey flashed double-teams into the post at Harrell leaving him confused. He was just 1-for-4 in the first half, before bullying his way to a more on-point second half. Virginia\u2019s blitzing traps of the post mixed with guards scraping down at him.\n\n\u201cThey have post traps coming out of nowhere for no rhyme or reason,\u201d Harrell said.\n\nSlowly, Louisville found cracks. As much as the Cardinals choked and stalled in the first half, Virginia wasn\u2019t much better. Bennett mentioned his admiration for the Cardinals\u2019 defense earlier in the week. His praise was validated when Virginia shot 33.3 percent Saturday.\n\nThe small Cardinals guards opted for straight-line drives in the second half. They were no longer going left and right, finding no space and no viable shots. Though, their press was ineffective throughout \u2014 Virginia turned the ball over only twice \u2014 forcing the Cardinals to find a way late in halfcourt sets.\n\nHarrell bulldozed through the traps. Louisville guards Terry Rozier and Chris Jones kept coming. Virginia\u2019s lead sagged to four points with 1:22 to play. A week after Duke provided Virgina its lone loss of the season after a late 3-point-based rally, flashbacks were occurring.\n\n\u201cI was sitting there, just like, \u2018Not again!\u2019\u201d Tobey said. \u201c\u2018C\u2019mon!\u2019\u201d\n\nBy then, the clock was teamed with Virginia. Louisville could not create enough seconds to finish the comeback. Cavaliers point guard Malcolm Brogdon made enough free throws to do so.\n\nThe win was another dynamite blow for Bennett to a coaching Mt. Rushmore. He\u2019s the only active coach to have a win over all five active Hall of Fame coaches: Syracuse\u2019s Jim Boeheim, SMU\u2019s Larry Brown, Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski, North Carolina\u2019s Roy Williams and Pitino.\n\n\u201cEvery coach talks about a fist, of having all the guys playing together,\u201d Pitino said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a great fist.\u201d\n\nVirginia\u2019s defense smacked Louisville in the chops with it Saturday night.
