An early morning fire destroyed a motor home early today in Broomfield, displacing a homeless man who was given use of the vehicle because he had nowhere else to go.

Sara Farris, spokeswoman for the North Metro Fire District, said firefighters responded to 12171 Sheridan Blvd. near the Home Depot store at 8:32 a.m. today, after receiving calls about the fire.

Farris said the man, who appeared to be about 60 years old, had been staying in the vehicle, had been homeless and had been permitted to stay in it on a temporary basis. That man was not injured in the blaze, which destroyed the motor home. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined.

"So he is once again homeless, as well as his dog,' Farris said. "We have called the Red Cross, and so they are on their way out here, to put him up for a couple of nights.

Broomfield resident Tim Seibert happened upon the blaze before the first fire truck, when only one police unit had arrived.

He saw a woman comforting a man seated in the grass nearby, a dog at his side.

"He looked to be fine," Seibert said. "I thought, I bet he was living in the thing. And, sure enough."

Farris said, "The community is really trying to support this guy, and help get him back on his feet and back under a shelter again. Right now, we're all trying to figure out how we can help this person."

In addition to the American Red Cross Mile High Chapter -- which provided lodging, clothing, food and comfort kit through a Disaster Action Team, -- Farris said the Knights of Columbus is also helping the man displaced by today's fire.

"The community has chipped in several hundred dollars. Just, people passing by have given him money," she said. "It's a remarkable story, about how quickly people can come around to help people who need it."
