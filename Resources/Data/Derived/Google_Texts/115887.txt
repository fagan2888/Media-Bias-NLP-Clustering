Tom Paul: The other thing that's transformed is, in the past, consumers mainly engaged on health when they were faced with a situation. Now, it's moving way up front. Most people are tracking their activities, they're monitoring their activities through digital and through technology, and all of that continues to generate data.

The important part of all that data is to really take it and harness it in such a way that it becomes intuitive for a consumer, and it actually becomes supportive to their decision-making process. It's taking the data, organizing it and simplifying it, and then giving it back to the consumer and their health care provider -- their doctor or their nurse -- in order for them to make better health outcome decisions.
