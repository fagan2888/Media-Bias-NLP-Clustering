Three Co-defendants are being held pending a hearing on Tuesday to determine their flight risk. Ideastream\u2019s Mark Urycki has details..\n\nThe FBI raided council woman Tamela Lee\u2019s home over a year ago. Now her indictment reads like a small time version of the corruption case of former Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora. Both were charged with bribery \u2013 or as the feds put it- accepting things of value in return for official acts. That\u2019s a violation of the Hobbes Act \u2013 which covers public corruption and places a case under federal jurisdiction.\n\nProsecutors say Lee accepted cash and home improvements from a North Canton man Omar Abdelqader, the owner of Akron area convenience stores. Lee allegedly contacted a judge who was hearing a criminal case involving Abdelqader\u2019s nephew Samir Abdelqader, who was also indicted along with Omar\u2019s brother Abdelrahman Abdelqader. The FBI quotes an apparent phone tap of Omar telling an acquaintance \u201c I am keeping her because we need her, \u201d \u201cShe is better than an attorney to us!\u201d\n\nJudge Nancy Vecchiarelli at the federal court house in Cleveland released Lee on the condition that she immediately go on unpaid leave from her position on council. She is also banned from having any contact with county employees, other than family members.\n\nThe first African-American woman on the county council is also a vice president of the Summit County Democratic Party. The acting chair of the party, Sandra Kurt, issued a statement saying \u201cthe alleged behavior has absolutely no place in our Party. The allegations are only allegations at this point, however, and Ms Lee must be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "Summit County Councilwoman Tamela (TAM uh luh)\u00a0 Lee is free on bond after pleading not guilty to six counts of federal violations including accepting bribes.\u00a0 Three Co-defendants are being held pending a hearing on Tuesday to determine their flight risk.\u00a0 Ideastream\u2019s Mark Urycki has details..", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "ideastream", "description": "Summit County Councilwoman Tamela (TAM uh luh)\u00a0 Lee is free on bond after pleading not guilty to six counts of federal violations including accepting bribes.\u00a0 Three Co-defendants are being held pending a hearing on Tuesday to determine their flight risk.\u00a0 Ideastream\u2019s Mark Urycki has details..", "title": "Summit County Councilwoman Indicted", "url": "http://www.ideastream.org/news/summit-county-councilwoman-indicted", "image": {"secure_url": "https://ideastream-production.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/2015/12/Lee_Tamela%20M_F.jpg", "identifier": "http://ideastream-production.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news/2015/12/Lee_Tamela%20M_F.jpg"}, "updated_time": "2015-12-10T18:53:25-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-10T11:47:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-10T18:53:25-05:00"}, "keywords": "ideastream, wcpn, wviz, 90.3, cleveland public radio, channel 25, wviz/pbs, 90.3 wcpn, cleveland public media, wviz/pbs ideastream, 90.3 wcpn ideastream, wcpn ideastream, wviz ideastream, cleveland, ohio, 104.9 FM, WCLV, WCLV 104.9", "google-site-verification": "YaOLAImmbo8IrZtjGAAHQYvbhtD-xUhGeJ1QDi4beRI"}, "article_summary": "The first African-American woman on the county council is also a vice president of the Summit County Democratic Party.\nSummit County Councilwoman Tamela (TAM uh luh) Lee is free on bond after pleading not guilty to six counts of federal violations including accepting bribes.\nThe FBI raided council woman Tamela Lee\u2019s home over a year ago.\nNow her indictment reads like a small time version of the corruption case of former Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora.\nLee allegedly contacted a judge who was hearing a criminal case involving Abdelqader\u2019s nephew Samir Abdelqader, who was also indicted along with Omar\u2019s brother Abdelrahman Abdelqader."}
