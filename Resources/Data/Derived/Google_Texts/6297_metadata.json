The security breach was discovered and deleted from Koester\u2019s computer with the help of a state technology expert. The expert helped the insurance agent \u201cnavigate\u201d the MNsure system in a much different way than first anticipated.\n\n\u201cThe more I thought about it, the more troubled I was,\u201d Koester told the newspaper. \u201cWhat if this had fallen into the wrong hands? It\u2019s scary. If this is happening now, how can clients of MNsure be confident their data is safe?\u201d\n\nMNsure staff took steps to assure the public the breach was found and fixed and that the insurance brokers whose private information was disseminated would be quickly notified.\n\n\u201cMNsure takes this incident extremely seriously. While it appears that this incident was accidental, MNsure will conduct a thorough investigation to fully understand the nature of the incident,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s statement. \u201cMNsure has a data privacy policy in place, and this employee\u2019s action was a violation of this policy. MNsure is evaluating whether any additional policies and procedures can be implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.\u201d\n\nThe security violation provides a window into the scramble to meet the fast-approaching Oct. 1 deadline to get the first phase of health insurance exchanges up and running online.\n\nA University of Minnesota expert this week warned the U.S. House Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies of the dangers involved in \u201cthe largest personal data integration government project in the history of the Republic, with up to 300 million American citizen records needing to be combined from five federal agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one has said how the data hub will actually operate to ensure no privacy breaches as well as safeguard against identity fraud,\u201d Stephen Parente, Minnesota Insurance Industry Chair of Health Finance in the Carlson School of Management told the subcommittee. \u201cGreater transparency is needed, as well as a frank acknowledgement that the ACA\u2019s posted deadlines should take second place to reasonable data concerns.\u201d\n\nContact Tom Steward at tom@watchdogminnesota.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Maybe they should re-brand the MNsure online health care exchange MN-UNsure, given the embarrassing blunders revealed in the rush to implement the Affordable Care Act and provide medical coverage for Minnesotans.", "title": "Security breach rattles MN health-care exchange - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Paul-Bunyan-MnSure-458x327.png", "updated_time": "2013-09-13T11:30:31+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/105760/security-breach-rattles-mn-health-care-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "ACA,Affordable Care Act,MNsure,Paul Bunyan,Social Security", "published_time": "2013-09-13T10:57:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T11:30:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Maybe they should re-brand the MNsure online health care exchange MN-UNsure, given the embarrassing blunders revealed in the rush to implement the Affordable Care Act and provide medical coverage for Minnesotans.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Paul-Bunyan-MnSure-458x327.png"}, "title": "Security breach rattles MN health-care exchange - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9885\"", "article_summary": "The recipient, Jim Koester of Apple Valley, was stunned to open an attachment with hundreds of Social Security numbers, names, license information and businesses.\n\u201cThe collection of social security numbers is standard practice in order to enable the recording of continuing education (CE) credits,\u201d MNsure said in a statement.\nThe security breach was discovered and deleted from Koester\u2019s computer with the help of a state technology expert.\nBy Tom Steward \u2502Watchdog Minnesota BureauST.PAUL \u2014 Maybe someone should think about re-branding the MNsure online health-care exchange MN-UNsure, given the embarrassing blunders revealed in the rush to implement the Affordable Care Act and provide medical coverage for Minnesotans.\n\u201cMNsure has a data privacy policy in place, and this employee\u2019s action was a violation of this policy."}
