The site promotes conservative opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but Ellis is a self-described progressive. A three-time Democratic congressional candidate funds the site.\n\nEllis on Monday criticized Republican TPP supporters for violating Americans for Tax Reform\u2019s no-tax pledge due to a provision that raises penalties for businesses that fail to file 1099 tax forms from $30 to $50.\n\n\u201cThis is clearly a tax increase\u2014and it\u2019s a violation of [ATR president] Grover Norquist\u2019s no tax increase pledge that most of these Congressmen signed,\u201d Ellis said.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) later cited that analysis as a reason that Republicans should oppose protections for American workers seen as crucial to TPP\u2019s eventual passage.\n\nHouse Republican leaders are hoping to use the 1099 provision to help offset the cost of Trade Adjustment Assistance, as the protections are known. The House voted down a TAA measure on Friday, but congressional Republicans are looking to reconsider the measure.\n\nEllis and other TPP critics say the 1099 provision is a de facto tax increase and therefore a violation of ATR\u2019s pledge, a claim ATR disputes.\n\n\u201cThis assertion is factually inaccurate,\u201d according to Ryan Ellis (no relation to Curtis), the group\u2019s tax policy director. \u201cThis is a fine for failing to comply with tax law, not a tax increase.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe claim that increasing penalties for not complying with tax law is a tax increase doesn\u2019t hold water,\u201d Ellis wrote in a Monday blog post. \u201cTax increases happen when tax law itself changes to result in higher taxes being owed by families and businesses.\u201d\n\nSen. Paul and Rep. Ken Buck (R., Colo.), a TPP opponent, compare TAA\u2019s 1099 language to a since-repealed provision in Obamacare that dramatically expanded the number of transactions that businesses had to report on 1099 forms.\n\n\u201cThis is similar to the fines they wanted to do in Obamacare with 1099s and there was such an outcry it\u2019s the only part of Obamacare we ever repealed,\u201d Paul told Breitbart News.\n\nATR\u2019s Ellis says the two provisions are categorically different. Increasing penalties for violations of federal tax laws is not the same as increasing the number of businesses or transactions that are subject to those laws, he says.\n\nThe TPP language \u201cis intended to police bad actors in tax compliance, not ordinary businesses. There are already provisions in the penalty for holding small firms harmless, and this is not changed by this language.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe paid consultant putting this out is a lifetime liberal/progressive who is pretending to be a conservative for the purposes of scuttling free trade,\u201d Ellis wrote.\n\nCurtis Ellis was described as \u201ca conservative activist and not a liberal Democrat\u201d in the Monday article.\n\nHowever, Ellis has described himself as a progressive Democrat. He has written for liberal sites such as Talking Points Memo and the Huffington Post. He previously hosted a radio show on the Progressive Radio Network branded as a project of the American Jobs Alliance, the group that publishes ObamaTrade.com.\n\nHe also worked as communications director for former Rep. Steve Kagen (D., Wis.), a critic of ATR\u2019s tax pledge. Ellis has called efforts to reduce corporate tax burdens \u201csociopathic behavior,\u201d and participated in numerous meetings and events organized by the left-wing Occupy Wall Street movement, which generally favored large corporate tax hikes.\n\n\u201cThe source is not legitimate,\u201d Ryan Ellis said of Curtis Ellis\u2019 tax analysis. \u201cConservatives should not have any tax-based objections to this package of trade legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe objections raised by people here have nothing to do with [TAA\u2019s] specifics and everything to do with simply being anti-free trade,\u201d he charged. \u201cThey just back-rationalize their position on a daily basis.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans for Tax Reform disputes Democratic operative\u2019s claim trade bill violates anti-tax pledge", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A career Democratic operative is pushing GOP lawmakers to oppose a pending trade bill on the grounds that it violates a pledge to oppose tax increases, but the group behind the pledge says it does no", "title": "Influential Anti-Tax Group Okays Key Trade Measure", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/influential-anti-tax-group-okays-key-trade-measure/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-Capitol-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A career Democratic operative is pushing GOP lawmakers to oppose a pending trade bill on the grounds", "creator": "@lachlan", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/US-Capitol-150x150.jpg", "title": "Influential Anti-Tax Group Okays Key Trade Measure", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe source is not legitimate,\u201d Ryan Ellis said of Curtis Ellis\u2019 tax analysis.\nHe also worked as communications director for former Rep.
