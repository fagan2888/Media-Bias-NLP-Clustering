If you subsidize unemployment\u2026\n\nposted at 2:01 pm on January 7, 2014 by Erika Johnsen\n\nIt seems to be a truth only very selectively acknowledged that, when you tax something, you\u2019ll end up with less of it (the corollary being that, if you subsidize something, you\u2019ll get more of it). Progressives seem perfectly capable of recognizing this truth in the context of sin taxes and green-energy subsidies, yet when it comes to things like the extension of unemployment benefits that is making its way through the Senate at the moment, they seem to think that such policies are immune from the most basic of economics. That\u2019s the point that Charles Krauthammer made last night, pointing out that the White House and the Democrats are touting the full-blown awesomeness of their ongoing economic \u201crecovery\u201d and the accompanying job creation out of one side of their mouths while grandstanding about the need for further unemployment benefits out of the other \u2014 but the reality is that today\u2019s unemployment rate of around seven percent actually looks a lot more like eleven percent if you use the same labor force participation rate of just a few years ago, and the Democrats keep approaching the systemic problem with the same old-and-tired non-solutions that are practically good for little else than browbeating Republicans. Via RCP:\n\nThe core issue is creating an entitlement. This has never been considered an entitlement. And you go down this road, Sperling says now is not the time. Four and a half years into a recovery, at least as defined by the administration itself, is not the time? If not now, then when? I mean, what we\u2019re going to end up with is an European level of unemployment, chronic unemployment subsidized. And the fact is, if you subsidize apples, you get more apples; if you subsidize unemployment, you get more of it. And that\u2019s what the economics study shows. It\u2019s not that people are lazy. It shows that if you have unemployment insurance, then you can make choices which would allow you to turn down a job that perhaps isn\u2019t exactly what you want. The vast majority of the unemployed want a job, and the problem is the state of the economy.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Logically speaking\u2026", "title": "Krauthammer: If you subsidize apples, you get more apples.
