I mean, completely.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe \u201cit\u201d to which Sanford referred is her starring role as an ObamaCare success story, cited by President Barack Obama himself \u2014 a role she will no longer be able to play as a result of bureaucratic bungling and the inherent unaffordability of health insurance under the misnamed Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\n\nSanford, 48, has a 14-year-old son with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who \u201crequires a special prescription medication that must be compounded,\u201d according to Washington State Wire\u2019s Erik Smith. Because of this, prior to ObamaCare, health insurance would have cost Sanford at least $500 a month, which she couldn\u2019t afford on her $50,000-a-year income as a freelance court reporter, especially since her son\u2019s \u201cfather doesn\u2019t pay child support,\u201d reported Smith.\n\n\n\nSanford was therefore eager to sign up for insurance under the ACA and did so as soon as Washington\u2019s exchange, which had its own share of day-one problems, was functioning properly \u2014 or so it seemed. Because of taxpayer subsidies, Sanford was able to obtain a \u201cgold\u201d insurance policy \u2014 the second-best, after platinum and ahead of silver and bronze \u2014 for just $198 a month, according to CNN. (Initially she enrolled in a $169-a-month plan but then switched to the slightly more expensive one.)\n\n\n\nShe was so ecstatic over this turn of events that she wrote Obama to thank him for his signature law. With her permission, the president then read from her letter during his October 21 speech:\n\nI am a single mom, no child support, self-employed, and I haven\u2019t had health insurance for 15 years because it is too expensive. My son has ADHD and requires regular doctor visits, and his meds alone cost $250 a month. I have had an ongoing tendinitis problem due to my line of work that I haven\u2019t had treated. Now, finally, we get to have coverage because of the ACA for $169 a month. I was crying the other day when I signed up. So much stress lifted.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d Obama asserted, \u201cis what the Affordable Care Act is all about.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanford told Smith \u201cit was one of the proudest moments of her life.\u201d But it\u2019s been all downhill ever since.\n\n\n\n\u201cFour days after President Obama made his address,\u201d wrote Smith, \u201cthe state health exchange publicly revealed a grevious [sic] error \u2014 its tax-credit calculations were all wrong. The state had been submitting monthly income information to the federal data hub, but the federal computers were expecting an annual figure\u2026. Brokers say they caught the mistake right off the bat and tried flagging it to the state\u2019s attention, but for some reason it took the state three weeks to acknowledge it.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Washingtonians kept signing up for insurance, thinking they were in line for big subsidies. When the state finally owned up to the problem, Sanford found that three-fourths of her subsidy had vanished, leaving her no choice but to opt for a cheaper, \u201csilver\u201d plan that still ended up costing her more than she had thought the gold plan would cost. But at least she had insurance \u2014 or did she?\n\n\n\nLast week she received another letter from the state exchange. She cried again, but this time the tears were not shed for joy. The exchange informed her that it had made yet another error in calculating subsidies. Sanford\u2019s subsidy was now completely wiped out \u2014 the result of signing her son up for Medicaid coverage, at the exchange\u2019s urging, thereby causing her to be treated as a single person with an income of $50,000, which is too high to qualify for a subsidy. (One insurance broker told Smith that even this may be wrong: \u201cSanford\u2019s son should never have been enrolled in Medicaid in the first place,\u201d he argued, but the exchange website makes it easy to enroll kids who don\u2019t qualify, doesn\u2019t explain the subsidy consequences to their parents, and \u201cdoesn\u2019t allow customers to change their minds.\u201d) This made even the cheapest \u201cbronze\u201d plan too expensive for Sanford, so she is going to continue doing without health insurance \u2014 and, to add insult to injury, will be forced to pay a penalty for violating the ACA\u2019s individual mandate.\n\n\n\n\u201cWow. You guys really screwed me over,\u201d Sanford wrote on the exchange\u2019s Facebook page last week. \u201cNow I have been priced out and will not be able to afford the plans you offer. But, I get to pay $95 and up for not having health insurance. I am so incredibly disappointed and saddened. You majorly screwed up.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that insurance premiums have increased dramatically under ObamaCare. The law establishes \u201cessential health benefits\u201d that must be covered under all insurance policies and requires insurers to cover all applicants at roughly the same rates regardless of pre-existing conditions. Those mandates were bound to drive up the cost of insurance. ObamaCare supporters, however, argued that while rates might rise, the law\u2019s subsidies would easily offset most of the increased cost. But what of those who don\u2019t qualify for a subsidy?\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trouble is that the insurance policies that are available under ObamaCare when you don\u2019t have the tax credit, they are simply too expensive,\u201d Smith told Fox News\u2019 Greta Van Susteren. \u201cIt raises the question: How affordable is the Affordable Healthcare Act in the first place?\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the manifest failure of ObamaCare to bring down insurance rates and the numerous issues with her state\u2019s exchange website, Sanford remains unstinting in her support of both Obama, for whom she twice voted, and his healthcare law.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this to be a political thing,\u201d she told Smith. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be bashing the president. I don\u2019t want to be bashing the ACA. I don\u2019t want to come across as saying that. I am a big Obama fan.\u201d\n\n\n\nSanford, in fact, places all the blame for her troubles on the state. Yet if a single state cannot build a website that gets things right, how can the even more lumbering federal government be expected not just to build a functioning website but somehow to micromanage the entire nation\u2019s healthcare system?\n\n\n\nAnd if the ACA has not managed to make healthcare more affordable for a single mother of relatively modest means \u2014 which it clearly has not \u2014 then what success, exactly, can it be expected to achieve?", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "ObamaCare, Jessica Sanford, insurance exchange, subsidies, Washington State", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/16989-woman-cited-by-president-as-obamacare-success-story-can-t-afford-insurance", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/7744e22c3c54d371aa083cc14b8f108e_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Washington State woman cited by President Obama as an example of ObamaCare's success now finds that she cannot afford insurance under the law.
