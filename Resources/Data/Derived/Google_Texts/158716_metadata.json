It\u2019s going to increase physicians. But I keep telling people \u2018No one\u2019s talking about how we\u2019re going to handle the need for more nurses,\u2019\u201d Mosley said. \u201cDoctors are in your room five or 10 minutes, but it\u2019s the nurses that are in that hospital providing the care 24 hours a day.\u201d\n\nThe Fort Smith Regional Healthcare Foundation unveiled plans in February to build a medical college on 200 acres of donated land at Chaffee Crossing, with an opening date of fall 2017. Since then, the college hired Dr. Kenneth A. Heiles, D.O., as dean.\n\nIn 2012 there were 2.75 million registered nurses in the United States, according to the BLS data. The projected employment for registered nurses in 2022 is more than 3.23 million. The BLS projects a 11 percent increase in all occupations in the U.S. economy by that time.\n\n\u201cUAFS has focused its attention on the bachelor of science in nursing program, and has eliminated the associate degree and increased class sizes, to do everything we cannot only to increase the number of qualified nurses in the area but increase the training of qualified nurses as well,\u201d UAFS Chancellor Paul Beran stated.\n\nThe UAFS College of Health Sciences has always been the largest part of the university, even when it was Westark Community College. Within the next two years, Mosley said a \u201crole of scope change\u201d is in order to begin offering a master\u2019s degree in nursing education and in turn further increase the number of slots in the bachelor\u2019s nursing program.\n\nWith only 60 spots available each semester, a bachelor\u2019s in nursing track seat at UAFS is a highly prized one. For the past six semesters, UAFS has seen between 551 and 707 students pick nursing as a major. Of the latest pack of nursing majors, 180 students were qualified to apply for one of those 60 spots. They had an average grade point average of 3.5, Mosley said. The minimum GPA required is 2.5.\n\nThe base salary in Arkansas for a registered nurse is about $54,000, with differential pay given to those who work nights and weekends, the dean adds.\n\n\u201cWe started out initially with the BSN program just doing 20 a year,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cWe soon found out that was not going to do the job.\u201d\n\nJust within the past academic year has UAFS been able to accept 60 students in the program, thanks to endowments that allow for three additional professorships.\n\n\u201cThere is a need out there. Our nursing majors outnumber some of the other total numbers in some of the other colleges,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cWe have the interest that is there.\u201d\n\nGraduates of the nursing program at UAFS have reported acceptance of a job several months before actually graduating, she said. Demand is both local and national. Mosley said she gets messages regularly from recruiters looking for nurses to apply to a \u201ctraveling nurse\u201d program.\n\nRecruitment of physicians, nurses and nursing instructors to Fort Smith has been a challenge because of the high demand nationally. Having a master\u2019s degree in nursing education program at UAFS would help grow the program on a grassroots level, Mosley said, by hiring professors who already have a strong network in the Fort Smith area.\n\nDemand for health care services will increase because of the aging population, the Bureau of Labor statistics states. Nurses will be needed to educate and to care for patients with various chronic conditions, such as arthritis, dementia, diabetes and obesity.\n\n\u201cThe financial pressure on hospitals to discharge patients as soon as possible may result in more people admitted to long-term care facilities, outpatient care centers, and greater need for home health care,\u201d the BLS report states.\n\nJob growth is expected in facilities that provide long-term rehabilitation for stroke and head injury patients, as well as facilities that treat people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And since many older people prefer to be treated at home or in residential care facilities, registered nurses will be in demand in those settings, as well the report adds.\n\nGrowth is also expected to be faster than average in outpatient care centers, such as those that provide same-day chemotherapy, rehabilitation, and surgery. An increased number of procedures, as well as more sophisticated procedures previously done only in hospitals, are performed in ambulatory care settings and physicians\u2019 offices.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With an expected 19 percent jump in demand over the next eight years, the largest job increase of any occupation in the United States will be in nursing, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lovett Times Record &#8226; jlovett@swtimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "Times Record", "description": "With an expected 19 percent jump in demand over the next eight years, the largest job increase of any occupation in the United States will be in nursing, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.", "title": "Labor Stats Show Registered Nursing Largest Occupation Increase", "url": "http://swtimes.com/business/labor-stats-show-registered-nursing-largest-occupation-increase", "image": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_Carolyn-Mosley_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://swtimes.com/business/labor-stats-show-registered-nursing-largest-occupation-increase", "image": {"src": "http://swtimes.com/sites/swtimes.com/files/field/media/web1_Carolyn-Mosley_0.jpg"}, "creator": "@timesrecord", "description": "With an expected 19 percent jump in demand over the next eight years, the largest job increase of any occupation in the United States will be in nursing, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.", "title": "Labor Stats Show Registered Nursing Largest Occupation Increase"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1062178", "app_name": "swtimes", "package": "com.stephensmedia.timesrecord"}, "ios": {"url": "swtimes://?eid=1062178", "app_store_id": 964468128, "app_name": "swtimes"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964468128", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.timesrecord", "keywords": "Business,,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-08T04:45:15-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b5d\"", "article_summary": "The UAFS College of Health Sciences has always been the largest part of the university, even when it was Westark Community College.\nBut I keep telling people \u2018No one\u2019s talking about how we\u2019re going to handle the need for more nurses,\u2019\u201d Mosley said.\n\u201cWe have the interest that is there.\u201dGraduates of the nursing program at UAFS have reported acceptance of a job several months before actually graduating, she said.\nDemand for health care services will increase because of the aging population, the Bureau of Labor statistics states.\nWith an expected 19 percent jump in demand over the next eight years, the largest job increase of any occupation in the United States will be in nursing, according to the U.S. Department of Labor."}
