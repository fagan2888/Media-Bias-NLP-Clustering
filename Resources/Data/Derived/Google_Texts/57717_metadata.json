Last week, the House passed a measure that would ban premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions (subsidies) until HHS certifies that both income and \u201ccoverage\u201d requirements for eligibility are being \u201csuccessfully and consistently\u201d verified.\n\nSome worry that, without the new employer reports, consumers who fail to meet such coverage requirements and fraudulently claim subsidies could escape detection. These worries are exaggerated.\n\nLegal background. To qualify for subsidies through new health insurance marketplaces (HIMs), or exchanges, one must be a citizen or lawfully present immigrant. In a state that expands Medicaid, income must generally fall between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. In addition, consumers must not be offered employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) that the ACA classifies as\n\n.\n\n\u201caffordable,\u201d which means that worker-only coverage costs no more than 9.5 percent of family income, and\n\noffering \u201cminimum value,\u201d which means the plan pays at least 60 percent of the cost of services within categories covered by the employer.\n\nEmployer reporting was intended to verify these coverage requirements. Someone who falsely claims subsidies is liable for up to $250,000 in federal penalties. Like federal income tax returns, consumer attestations about ESI will be checked via audits, as has been proposed since April 2012.\n\nFacts shown by research. In December 2012, the Urban Institute released a report for the California HealthCare Foundation that used the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Insurance Policy Simulation Model to analyze the characteristics of consumers who will qualify for subsidies, assuming that states expand Medicaid. Among such consumers who are now uninsured or receive individual coverage:\n\n.\n\nAt least 76 percent neither work nor have an immediate family member who works for a company that sponsors ESI for any of its employees ; and\n\n; and At least 98.9 percent are not offered ESI, either directly or through a family member. In other words, no more than 1.1 percent are offered ESI that the ACA deems unaffordable.\n\nA few ESI recipients between 138 and 400 percent FPL\u2014between 0.2 and 2.2 percent\u2014have unaffordable insurance, as defined by the ACA. If each of them dropped their employer coverage to qualify for subsidies, the basic story would remain unchanged: at least 71.4 percent of all subsidy-eligible consumers would neither work nor have a spouse who works for a company that sponsors ESI for any of its employees; and 93.0 percent or more would qualify because they are not offered ESI.\n\nThe report also concluded that almost any firm offering insurance can meet the ACA\u2019s \u201cminimum value\u201d requirement by redefining covered benefits to meet the 60 percent threshold.\n\nImplications for verification. By far the most important fact for HIMs to establish is that neither the subsidy recipient nor the recipient\u2019s spouse works for a firm that sponsors ESI. That simple point will verify eligibility for more than 7 in 10 subsidy-eligible consumers. Audits can then focus exclusively on subsidy recipients who work for companies that offer ESI.\n\nMedicaid\u2019s third-party liability system and Medicare\u2019s coordination-of-benefits mechanisms already collect information showing which companies offer and which employees and dependents receive ESI. These systems cannot verify every aspect of ESI-related subsidy eligibility, but they can show which firms offer ESI. They may even show whether particular subsidy recipients previously obtained ESI from their current employers, making them especially good candidates for audits. The ACA gives HHS considerable authority to access data necessary to verify eligibility, which may allow HIMs to tap these information sources.\n\nGiven everything else facing HIMs, figuring out how to verify the affordability or minimum value of ESI offers should not be on anyone\u2019s short-term to-do list. Our findings show that what matters most is whether consumers are offered ESI at all. And the government already has the information it needs to do two things: (1) identify the vast majority of eligible consumers who are not offered ESI; and (2) target audits at those subsidy recipients who are most likely to be ineligible because their employers offer them health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2013/09/16/verifying-eligibility-for-affordable-care-act-subsidies-access-to-employer-sponsored-insurance/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Verifying Eligibility For Affordable Care Act Subsidies: Access To Employer-Sponsored Insurance"}, "description": "Verifying Eligibility For Affordable Care Act Subsidies: Access To Employer-Sponsored Insurance | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdca18\"", "article_summary": "In addition, consumers must not be offered employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) that the ACA classifies as.\nOur findings show that what matters most is whether consumers are offered ESI at all.\nA few ESI recipients between 138 and 400 percent FPL\u2014between 0.2 and 2.2 percent\u2014have unaffordable insurance, as defined by the ACA.\nTo qualify for subsidies through new health insurance marketplaces (HIMs), or exchanges, one must be a citizen or lawfully present immigrant.\nThey may even show whether particular subsidy recipients previously obtained ESI from their current employers, making them especially good candidates for audits."}
