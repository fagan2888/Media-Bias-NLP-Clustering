The push comes amid soaring immigration rates in recent years from Asian countries to the U.S. But the ongoing efforts to sell health insurance to Asians have been impeded by many obstacles, including the lack of understanding about why health insurance is so important, concerns about whether the cost of coverage is worth it and the various misconceptions about how the federal health care law works.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started, we realized even before we can start doing ACA outreach, we have to do health education first,\u201d Regina Lee, chief development officer at Charles B. Wang Community Health Center in New York City, said. The clinic serves mainly Asians, and roughly 26 percent of its clients in 2014, or about 12,000 patients, did not have health insurance. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t understand the U.S. health system,\u201d Lee said.\n\nChinese Immigrants And Health Insurance Coverage\n\nNonwhites make up roughly 40 percent of the United States\u2019 population, of which Asians comprise 5 percent. But minority groups collectively account for more than half the country\u2019s uninsured. Health care activists have launched similar efforts to recruit Hispanics, blacks, low-income mothers and other groups to sign up for the federal health care law. But in many ways, Asian immigrants represent a unique challenge. Many have a poor proficiency in English or don't speak or understand the language at all. They can also be unfamiliar with Western customs, including how the U.S. government works.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAsian-Americans include many different ethnic groups. Of the 16 million Asians living in the United States in 2013, according to Census estimates, 3.6 million were Chinese. Approximately 12 million Asians were foreign-born. They are mostly legal immigrants.\n\nImmigration from China remains strong, with those immigrants recently surpassing Hispanic arrivals in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. That puts Chinese immigrants as the second-largest immigrant group after Mexicans at 11.6 million. Immigrants from India, with 2 million people, were previously in second place.\n\nAbout 41 million individuals were uninsured prior to the start of the ACA in 2013, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care foundation. The number of uninsured Asian-Americans stands at 15 percent, just slightly below the national average of 16 percent. As of Jan. 16, 7.1 million people have signed up on the federal marketplace HealthCare.gov, and another 2.4 million were estimated to have obtained health insurance through the 14 states that have established their own marketplace, according to Obamacarefact.com. An ethnic breakdown of the numbers was not available.\n\nLarge U.S. metropolitan cities such as New York City and San Francisco tend to have the highest concentration of Asians. San Francisco\u2019s population is 33 percent Asian, and New York City's is about 13 percent. Most Chinese immigrants in New York City and San Francisco are legal immigrants who qualify for private insurance.\n\nFlora Ferng, director of programs at Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE), said that 60 percent of AAFE\u2019s clients, of which over 56 percent are Mandarin-speaking and 24 percent Cantonese-speaking, are premium-paying, and 36 percent are on Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants do not qualify for state-assisted health insurance, but San Francisco and New York City have systems that provide health care for those without insurance, with some clinics charging these immigrants based on their ability to pay.\n\nClosing The Coverage Gap\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has recognized the coverage gap among ethnic minorities. \u201cThe health care law is working to address long standing disparities in access to health care that have affected minority communities,\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, HHS secretary, said in a press release, adding that 1.9 million uninsured Asian-Americans, or eight in every 10 Asian-Americans, now have new options for quality health care under Obamacare. About 68,000 New Yorkers who speak Chinese, Korean and Hindi will gain health insurance coverage upon full implementation of the ACA, according to a 2013 report from the Urban Institute, a D.C.-based think tank that evaluates economic and social policies.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, commonly known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d was passed by Congress and then signed into law by Obama in 2010. Under the ACA, states can set up a health insurance exchange, or marketplace, where people can shop and compare plans. People with existing health conditions can no longer be denied health care coverage. All of the insurance plans in the exchange had to fulfill certain requirements.\n\nBut many Asians don't see the appeal of the health care law. \u201cI give you money, and what do I get in return? Nothing,\u201d Youngsoo Cho, marketing director for San Francisco-based insurance provider Chinese Community Health Plan (CCHP), said, of how some Asian clients perceive health care insurance. \u201cThen there are some who see it through the lens of auto insurance: If I have an accident, I\u2019m covered. But that\u2019s not exactly how insurance works.\u201d\n\nHigh Costs\n\nA lot of Chinese immigrants have also been reluctant to buy insurance because it\u2019s expensive, said Lee from Charles B. Wang. \u201cBut we have to convince them, \u2018No, it is to protect your health and also to protect your financial security,\u2019\u201d Lee said.\n\nMany Asians in New York or San Francisco are either self-employed or working in small businesses that are not likely to offer health benefits, according to the Coalition for Asian-American Children and Families (CACF). Many of them work in cash-based industries for low pay, and some 28 percent reported a time last year when they skipped seeking medical attention because they could not afford it, according to the CACF.\n\n\u201cIf I fall sick, I\u2019ll just go to the pharmacy and get over-the-counter medication,\u201d said one roadside florist in her 40s who only gave her last name as Tan. She said she was from the Fujian province in China and had been working in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, for \u201cmany years.\u201d When asked what would happen if she were to fall gravely ill, she said that had never happened before and she didn\u2019t see the need to apply for health insurance.\n\nEven those who can afford it are not necessarily pleased with the costs. \u201cI have insurance, but every time I go to see a doctor, I have to make a co-pay of $70 on top of my premiums,\u201d said the owner of a hair salon in Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown who only gave her last name, Yu. \u201cFor those who are uninsured, the clinics only charge them $50. It\u2019s so unfair! The way I see it, it\u2019s better to be uninsured.\u201d\n\nFerng, from AAFE, said that such claims were common misconceptions among the Chinese community.\n\nSelling Obamacare To Asians\n\nMany Asians are also unsure about how to apply for and use Obamacare. \u201cWhen I heard about Obamacare, my insurance provider was telling me that it will be more expensive,\u201d said Yu, the salon owner who had insurance for many years. When asked if she had looked on the state\u2019s marketplace to see if it would be cheaper, she said she hadn\u2019t. \u201cBut, if it\u2019s cheaper, I'll definitely switch for sure!\u201d she said. She wasn't aware of Sunday's deadline.\n\nConfusing media reports can scare off prospective health insurance consumers, Ferng said. \u201cWhen you open a big newspaper, the first thing you see is \u2018ACA could be very expensive\u2019 or \u2018ACA could be gone,\u2019\u201d she said. Those kind of reports can shake clients\u2019 confidence in the federally designed program.\n\nHealth care activists said they have spent years trying to convince Asians that the federal care law could help improve their access to health care. Enrollment centers where people can ask questions in person have helped such efforts. \u201cA physical location where Chinese folks can walk up helps a lot,\u201d Cho, from the CCHP, said. \u201cThis is helpful when you\u2019re more accustomed to dealing with someone of your own ethnicity.\u201d\n\nTie-ins with ethnic media have also been very important. \u201cWhen ACA first rolled out, local papers realized their importance in spreading the word,\u201d said Lee from Charles B. Wang. \u201cWe did a special insert with the Sing Tao Daily to promote the ACA. We also participated in a forum sponsored by [Chinese daily] World Journal.\u201d Lee said that of its 47,000 patients and 258,000 visits last year, about 90 percent of patients were served in a language other than English, and 86 percent have incomes below 200 percent of the poverty level, or about $40,000 yearly household income in a family of four.\n\n\u201cI heard about AAFE and Obamacare from an event that was held at the Fei Long Supermarket\" in Brooklyn, said Hua, 37, a Fuzhou native who has been in the United States for more than 10 years and has applied for insurance through AAFE. She had sporadic insurance coverage for the past three years, only occasionally renewing it, but has decided to settle on a stable plan now. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I will be covered now, because even though I\u2019m still relatively young and healthy, you never know when accidents will happen,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare, obamacare deadline, obamacare open enrollment, obamacare open enrollment asians, obamacare asian, asian health insurance coverage, uninsured asian health insurance, obamacare uninsured asians open enrollment", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "Convincing about 68,000 New Yorkers who speak Chinese, Korean and Hindi to enroll for Obamacare is no easy task.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Deadline: Some Asian-Americans Suspicious Of Obamacare Law, Health Care Insurance", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/affordable-care-act-deadline-some-asian-americans-suspicious-obamacare-law-health-1811882", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/10/nyhealthfair.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Convincing about 68,000 New Yorkers who speak Chinese, Korean and Hindi to enroll for Obamacare is no easy task.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Deadline: Some Asian-Americans Suspicious Of Obamacare Law, Health Care Insurance", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/affordable-care-act-deadline-some-asian-americans-suspicious-obamacare-law-health-1811882", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/10/nyhealthfair.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/10/nyhealthfair.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-02-13T13:56:21-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-13T23:47:06-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Convincing about 68,000 New Yorkers who speak Chinese, Korean and Hindi to enroll for Obamacare is no easy task."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2f1\"", "article_summary": "Health care activists have launched similar efforts to recruit Hispanics, blacks, low-income mothers and other groups to sign up for the federal health care law.\nHealth care activists said they have spent years trying to convince Asians that the federal care law could help improve their access to health care.\nNothing,\u201d Youngsoo Cho, marketing director for San Francisco-based insurance provider Chinese Community Health Plan (CCHP), said, of how some Asian clients perceive health care insurance.\n\u201cThe health care law is working to address long standing disparities in access to health care that have affected minority communities,\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, HHS secretary, said in a press release, adding that 1.9 million uninsured Asian-Americans, or eight in every 10 Asian-Americans, now have new options for quality health care under Obamacare.\nPeople with existing health conditions can no longer be denied health care coverage."}
