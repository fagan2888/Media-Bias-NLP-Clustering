We have 30 days left of open enrollment,\u201d said Erin Knott, Michigan director of Get Covered America.\n\nIn the first year of enrollment, the uninsured rate in Kent County dropped from 16 percent to 10 percent, Knott said. Health care agencies are holding enrollment events and providing application assistance in an effort to reach those who remain uninsured.\n\nKnott spoke at an event Friday, Jan. 16, at the Grand Rapids Public Schools Administration Building that included Grand Rapids Mayor George Heartwell and Kathleen Falk, Region V director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFalk talked about improvements in the online health insurance marketplace, healthcare.gov, that make it an \u201ceasier, simpler application process.\u201d\n\n\"From what was about 76 screens that you would scroll through to enroll last year, it\u2019s now down to about 16 screens, so it\u2019s a whole lot easier,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can even apply on your smartphone.\u201d\n\nThose who are re-enrolling this year will find most of their information is already in the system, she added.\n\nFalk also spoke about the subsidies available, based on income, to help pay health insurance premiums.\n\n\u201cEight out of 10 nationwide can buy this very high quality insurance for $100 or less a month,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know right here in Michigan 89 percent can get financial assistance when they buy this health insurance.\u201d\n\nHeartwell said 272,000 people in Michigan obtained health insurance last year through the online marketplace, including 15,000 in Kent County.\n\n\u201cThere is a true hunger among consumers for the insurance options that are available,\u201d he said. \u201cThey no longer have to worry about being one broken bone or one emergency room visit away from bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nHeartwell also pointed out that, under the Affordable Care Act, the plans must cover doctor\u2019s visits, hospital visits, maternity care and prescriptions and that coverage can\u2019t be denied because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nState Rep. Winnie Brinks, D-Grand Rapids, said the Affordable Care Act provides equal access to women to affordable care \u201cfor the first time in history.\u201d\n\nConsumer protections under the law mean insurers can\u2019t require women to pay out of pocket for preventive care such as mammograms and screenings for cancer and diabetes, she said.\n\n\u201cIn the past, women could be denied coverage or charged more than men simply because they were pregnant,\u201d she added. \u201cUnder the old system, women could even lose coverage if their children became sick.\n\nOf those who enrolled or re-enrolled in marketplace plans through Dec. 15, 56 percent are women, Brinks added.\n\nDavid Wenzel, a writer who runs his own business, RobinHood Ink, spoke about his experience seeking health insurance while battling a brain tumor. Under the Affordable Care Act, he was able to get an affordable insurance plan, he said.\n\nTo research and enroll in a plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace, go to healthcare.gov.\n\nAssistance is available form health care navigators through Cherry Health.
