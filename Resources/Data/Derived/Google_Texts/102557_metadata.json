John Hickenlooper and state authorities, who contend locals lack the power to regulate oil and gas.\n\nLongmont leaders in 2012 imposed rules for oil and gas activity. Colorado\u2019s attorney general at the time, John Suthers, sued the city. Longmont voters responded by banning fracking.\n\nThe Colorado Oil and Gas Association and state have been fighting the ban and moratorium. COGA and state attorneys argue both are illegal because case law and regulations give only the state the right to regulate fracking.\n\nLower courts in Boulder and Larimer counties overturned the ban and moratorium. Longmont and Fort Collins pushed their cases to the Colorado Court of Appeals, asking to have the ban and moratorium restored. In August, the appeals court asked the high court to rule.\n\nJustices peppered attorneys on both sides with questions Wednesday. And whether their ruling is narrow or broad \u2014 there\u2019s no deadline for delivery of that written decision \u2014 attorneys anticipated greater legal clarity on a vexing issue spurred by the domestic drilling boom.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not saying local governments don\u2019t have some authority to regulate land use impacts of oil and gas activity,\u201d COGA attorney Mark Mathews said after making arguments. \u201cThey do have some authority. But they cannot ban what state law expressly authorizes.\u201d\n\nFort Collins attorney Barbara Green pressed the case that the city\u2019s moratorium on fracking \u2014 short for the hydraulic fracturing method of injecting chemicals, sand and water at high pressure to coax oil and gas out of shale \u2014 doesn\u2019t \u201cmaterially impede\u201d industry in the city.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the act that says you have to be able to frack anywhere as fast as you can,\u201d Green said after court was adjourned.\n\nLongmont attorneys argued companies produced oil and gas for more than 100 years in Colorado without fracking and that, therefore, banning fracking doesn\u2019t prevent production. They pointed to alternative methods companies use to produce oil and gas without fracking in New York under a statewide ban.\n\nState lawmakers have granted the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, not cities or counties, authority over industry operations. They\u2019ve tasked COGCC with ensuring orderly development.\n\nFacing questions from justices, Mathews challenged use of a legal test that a ban must \u201cmaterially impede\u201d industry operations to be illegal. Mathews also argued Fort Collins\u2019 moratorium amounts to a ban, though with a time limit.\n\n\u201cThe use of hydraulic fracturing is pervasive,\u201d Mathews said, calling the separation of fracking from production in general meaningless.\n\nAssistant attorney general Jake Matter, representing the COGCC, emphasized \u201cthe state has a significant interest in oil and gas production,\u201d citing the 1992 Voss case, where the high court ruled Colorado\u2019s interest in oil and gas development was sufficient to override a ban in Greeley.\n\n\u201cThese bans negate the commission\u2019s authority to regulate the chemical shooting and treatment of wells,\u201d Matter said.\n\nThe justices noted changes in law and industry technology since that case. They asked whether Colorado\u2019s interest is \u201csufficiently dominating\u201d and what test they should use to decide.\n\nMatter conceded the Voss decision didn\u2019t totally pre-empt what locals can do without impeding state interests.\n\nThere are more than 51,000 active oil and gas wells in Colorado.\n\nAbout 100 activists opposed to fracking in cities gathered at the courthouse. City and industry officials packed the room.\n\n\u201cHydraulic fracturing is a heavy industrial process that poses serious risks to children and public health. Cities and towns have a right to protect people when companies want to do that,\u201d Earthjustice attorney Mike Freeman said.\n\nCOGA president Dan Haley issued a prepared statement saying members \u201care confident that the Supreme Court will agree that the ban implemented in Longmont and the Fort Collins moratorium are illegal and pre-empted by current law. We are confident that the Supreme Court will provide further clarity regarding the primacy of the state in oil and gas regulation.\u201d\n\nBruce Finley: 303-954-1700, bfinley@denverpost.com or @finleybruce", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado high court hears cases on city oil and gas fracking bans", "title": "Colorado high court hears cases on city oil and gas fracking bans", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/09/colorado-high-court-hears-cases-on-city-oil-and-gas-fracking-bans/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151209__fracking_protest_120815p1.jpg", "height": 405}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151209__fracking_protest_120815p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-09T09:28:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:49:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b41\"", "article_summary": "Longmont and Fort Collins pushed their cases to the Colorado Court of Appeals, asking to have the ban and moratorium restored.\nState lawmakers have granted the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, not cities or counties, authority over industry operations.\nThe Colorado Oil and Gas Association and state have been fighting the ban and moratorium.\nJohn Hickenlooper and state authorities, who contend locals lack the power to regulate oil and gas.\nLongmont attorneys argued companies produced oil and gas for more than 100 years in Colorado without fracking and that, therefore, banning fracking doesn\u2019t prevent production."}
