It\u2019s become something of a clich\u00e9, in fact, with an annual flurry of tongue-in-cheek articles in newspapers and oth er publications giving advice on how to handle that obnoxious uncle\u2019s unpopular opinions at the Thanksgiving dinner table.\n\nAnd yes, these articles are usually aimed at liberals trying to deal with that drunken Limbaugh-listening relative who insists on baiting everyone at the table by going on about the pet right-wing outrage of the moment and passing on talk radio propaganda as if it had been delivered directly from God. These stories are so ubiquitous that it\u2019s fair to assume this must be a fairly common experience.\n\nIt\u2019s undoubtedly also true that conservative families often have to deal with the college kid who\u2019s home for Thanksgiving break and decides to regale the table with her newfound knowledge that everything they believe in is the result of corporate brainwashing and that Ayn Rand turns out to be a fraud. These days there will likely be a lot of talk at those tables about trigger warnings, cultural appropriation and safe spaces, all things that will sound to the drunken uncles as if they are being discussed in a foreign language. (National Review would-be humorist Charles C.W. Cooke tried to tackle this last year with mixed results.)\n\nThe difference between these two phenomena is best illustrated by the massive whining and tantrums that result from any joking around about it. And no, I\u2019m not talking about the college kids. Yes, they might get frustrated and call their parents \u201chaters\u201d and flounce off to their rooms, but they are, after all, still kids. No, the people who are hysterical over this are conservatives who have worked themselves up into a full-blown hysterical meltdown over it.\n\nThis year, the Democratic National Committee put together a funny little website called \u201cYour Republican Uncle\u201d in which they use this annual holiday trope as a way to explain some of the issues important to Democrats in a mildly amusing format. Evidently, the right has been unaware up until now that Democrats don\u2019t agree with them, because this clearly hit a very sensitive nerve. Even as they dismiss it all as inane folly, they went to incredible lengths to angrily debunk the \u201ctalking points\u201d in lengthy blog posts on such major websites as Hot-Air, where chief writer Allaahpundit was spitting mad:\n\nThe takeaway from these sites is that liberals are so cloistered from interaction with conservatives and so insecure in their own basic political beliefs that they actually need to be prepped before the most basic social engagement with the enemy. If you think that\u2019s a good look for your movement, you do you.\n\nI\u2019m fairly sure that he\u2019s taking this a lot more seriously than any liberal takes it. But he wasn\u2019t alone on his righteous indignation. Conservative blogger Ace of Spades wrote an entire treatise on how to deal with the miscreant liberals in your family when they use any of these \u201cVox explainer\u201d talking points. It\u2019s very elaborate and very, very serious:\n\nI herewith humbly submit these first sketches of a new branch of Lifemanship I call \u201cThankgivingmanship,\u201d which I define as the gentle art of insulting the stupid without alerting them to the fact that they\u2019ve been insulted at all. It is the goal of the dedicated Thanksgivingman, then, to achieve the sublime art of giving offense without offense being taken. My basic strategy is thus: It would be as rude of you as it is rude of your cretinous grownchildren kin to allow a Thanksgiving dinner into a stupid game of Rachel Maddow Talking Points and their rebuttals. So, rather than confront the unemployed idiots who will be assailing you, I propose instead to superficially avoid conflict and engagement on their dummy mouthflappings, and appear instead to agree with them. But \u2014 and here is the point \u2014 a skilled Thanksgivingman will only appear to agree with the grownchildren to feeble intellects, such as those possessed by the grownchildren themselves. Instead of disagreeing with them \u2014 which will cause argument and anger \u2014 you will instead claim to agree with them, while in fact contradicting them, subverting them, of baffling them with statements that nearly, but do not quite, make sense.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Every year, a flurry of articles about \"winning dinner table debates\" go out.
