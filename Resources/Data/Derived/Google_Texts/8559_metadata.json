What I was able to do in a day or two as an academic administrator takes weeks or months in the federal government \u2026 The academic literature over the last twenty-five years on successful organizations highlights several characteristics: transparency, power-sharing or shared decision-making and accountability. If you invert these principles, you have an organization \u2026 which is secretive, autocratic and unaccountable \u2026\n\nThis is not some functionary position. As director of the research integrity office, Wright was responsible for monitoring research funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Public Health Services \u2013 which dole out millions of taxpayer dollars. Instead, he wrote, his job mainly consisted of \u201cnavigating the remarkably dysfunctional HHS bureaucracy\u201d and getting permission from \u201cpoorly informed\u201d administrators to actually do it.\n\nWe spend exorbitant amounts of time in meetings and in generating repetitive and often meaningless data and reports to make our precinct of the bureaucracy look productive.\n\nAnybody who works in a large organization (or just reads \u201cDilbert\u201d) knows what that looks like. And there was a time, in the days before Obamacare, when the resignation letter of a frustrated bureaucrat wouldn\u2019t have been worthy of mention. But in the Kafkaesque, socialist world Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid and their Democrat henchmen have foisted on the United States, this actually matters. And, unlike \u201cDilbert,\u201d it\u2019s not a laughing matter.\n\nUnder the Obamacare administrative state, the HHS and Internal Revenue Service have assumed an unprecedented power over the lives of individual Americans. Wright\u2019s letter lifts up the rock of the HHS to show that underneath it is a crawling pile of petty , maliciously inefficient world where appearances \u2013 or \u201coptics\u201d \u2013 mean much more than actual results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m offended as an American taxpayer that the federal bureaucracy \u2014 at least the part I\u2019ve labored in \u2014 is so profoundly dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nIn short, it\u2019s about what you\u2019d have expected in the Obama Era.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A key official in the Department of Health and Human Services has stepped down, with a scathing letter of resignation that gives a sobering insider\u2019s look at the department\u2019s \u201csecretive, autocratic and unaccountable\u201d culture.
