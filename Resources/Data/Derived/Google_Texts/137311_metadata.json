At the same time, they refused to expand Medicaid or work with the federal government to offer subsidized insurance plans. Six months after the launch of the state\u2019s effort, called Florida Health Choices, just 30 people have signed up.\n\nThat\u2019s not a typo. We\u2019re not talking about 30% of the population; we\u2019re talking about literally just 30 individuals.\n\nCharles Gaba crunched the numbers to find the costs per enrollee and found that Florida Health Choices is vastly more expensive than, say, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s healthcare.gov, while offering much less.\n\nIndeed, Florida Health Choices is not an exchange marketplace, where private insurers compete for consumers\u2019 business. It\u2019s not. In fact, it doesn\u2019t sell actual health insurance at all. Rather, Florida spent $900,000 on an online project that lists \u201climited benefit options and discount plans for items like dental visits, prescription drugs and eyeglasses.\u201d\n\nAnd a whopping 30 people took advantage of these amazing opportunities.\n\nFlorida Health Choices administrators \u201cacknowledge they are off to a slow start,\u201d but still hope to appeal to more customers, possibly by adding insurance options for pets.\n\nWhose bright idea was Florida Health Choices in the first place? That would be Marco Rubio.\n\nAs a U.S. senator, the Florida Republican has had very little success in sponsoring legislation that became law, but let\u2019s not forget that before going to Capitol Hill, Rubio was the Speaker of the Florida House. In 2008, two years before his successful Senate campaign, the conservative lawmaker championed the Florida Health Choices project.\n\nOf course, it\u2019d be more of a feather in Rubio\u2019s cap if the project was actually reaching a large number of Floridians.\n\nAsked if the senator still supports the concept of Florida Health Choices in light of its poor results, Rubio\u2019s office told Dylan Scott, \u201c Yeah, we have nothing against free market exchanges,\u201d Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said in an email.\n\nBut if Rubio\u2019s vision was for a website in which Florida consumers could purchase health care benefits, and Republicans continue to support such an approach, why doesn\u2019t Florida simply create an exchange marketplace through the Affordable Care Act, as many other states have done?\n\nApparently, the GOP-led state government just doesn\u2019t want to. As a consequence, nearly 1 million Floridians went to healthcare.gov to get actual, subsidized health care coverage, largely ignoring Florida Health Choices\u2019 discount plans for items like dental visits.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Florida Health Choices, a project Rubio championed in 2008, managed to enroll just 30 people.
