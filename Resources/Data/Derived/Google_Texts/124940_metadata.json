UNH, -0.33% The drug is made by France\u2019s Sanofi S.A. SAN, +0.00% and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. SAN, +0.00% REGN, -0.24%\n\nBut while all men may be created equal, not everyone with high-cholesterol\u2014or their insurance plan -- is. Below, a breakdown of what it means for you, especially given the December 15 deadline to enroll or re-enroll in Obamacare plans for next year.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got high cholesterol, but haven\u2019t tried statins or lifestyle changes: Praluent might be an option for you, but a doctor would propose statins, diet and exercise before the pricey prescription. Praluent and competitor Repatha are intended for people whose levels of so-called bad cholesterol haven\u2019t been adequately reduced by aggressive lifestyle changes or statins on their own. As far as your insurance company is concerned, the drugs are hardly the first line of cholesterol reduction.\n\nBut there\u2019s a debate brewing on this: some cardiologists think they could\u2014and should\u2014be used more broadly, to proactively prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes. Price tags in the thousands of dollars might not seem so high when compared with the significant economic costs of those medical emergencies, said Elliott Antman, immediate past president of the American Heart Association and a professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n\u201cThis is where we\u2019re at now, but let\u2019s keep our eyes open to a broader perspective,\u201d he said.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got high cholesterol and diet, exercise and statins haven\u2019t worked: Praluent and Repatha could help reduce bad cholesterol levels by about the same amount as statins and in the same amount of time, 50% or 60% in about a month, said Kim Birtcher, a pharmacist who co-chairs the American College of Cardiology\u2019s LDL: Address the Risk Workgroup.\n\nStanding to benefit in particular from the two cholesterol-controlling drugs\u2014part of a class called PCSK9 inhibitors\u2014are those with a rare inherited genetic condition called heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia affecting 1 in 200 people, and those with a history of cardiovascular problems like heart attacks, cardiac bypass surgery, or who\u2019ve had stents placed.\n\nUnlike statins, Praluent\u2019s ability to prevent cardiovascular events like heart attacks hasn\u2019t been monitored in the long-term, Birtcher cautioned. Current studies are ongoing, and their results won\u2019t be known for a number of years.\n\nIf you have group insurance: Out-of-pocket costs should be lower in the group space, said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealthInsurance, an online marketplace for individual health insurance policies. Here, even if a drug is covered, finding out how it\u2019s covered is key, since cost-sharing measures like co-pays can get expensive for more unusual, specialty drugs. For a person who was taking another, non-approved cholesterol-controlling drug and wanted to stick with it, Praluent\u2019s approval by UnitedHealth could make that other drug more expensive, especially the smaller their insurance group.\n\nIf you have individual insurance: The jury\u2019s still out on this, according to Purpura. But, because of its high cost, he believes Praluent likely won\u2019t be the preferred brand for people buying their own health insurance. Individual health care plans must cover a FDA-approved treatment for every diagnosis, which means they\u2019ll often cover the lower-cost drugs. Even if individual plans do end up covering Praluent, high deductibles means you shouldn\u2019t expect much of a price-tag reduction, Purpura said: \u201cIn a marketplace like that, even if a plan covers your drugs, you\u2019re going to pay a lot out of pocket.\u201d\n\nTo find out if Praluent is on your insurance plan\u2019s list of covered drugs, call an agent licensed to sell insurance plans in your state and be sure to ask not only if it\u2019s covered but also if it\u2019s covered before or after the deductible. If before the deductible, you may end up paying the full price or the price negotiated by your insurance company. \u201cJust because a drug is covered doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be covered at a price you can afford,\u201d Purpura said. And as a recently-approved drug, Praluent likely won\u2019t have a generic version released for about six years.\n\nIf you\u2019ve purchased insurance through Obamacare, or are considering it: These plans will closely resemble those offered through individual insurance. Those who are enrolled\u2014or considering enrolling by Dec. 15 for January coverage -- should ask the same kinds of questions when making their decision: Is the drug covered? How much is covered? And how is it covered\u2014pre- or post-deductible?\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "Five things to know about Praluent, the cholesterol drug that was approved by the FDA this summer.", "creator": "@emmarcourt", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EB198_Merkel_ZG_20151214151746.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Emma Court", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "Five things to know about Praluent, the cholesterol drug that was approved by the FDA this summer.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/latest-cholesterol-drug-comes-with-a-14600-a-year-price-tag-2015-12-14", "author": "Emma Court", "parsely-title": "Latest cholesterol drug comes with a $14,600-a-year price tag", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-14T15:25:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "Five things to know about Praluent, the cholesterol drug that was approved by the FDA this summer.", "title": "Latest cholesterol drug comes with a $14,600-a-year price tag", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/latest-cholesterol-drug-comes-with-a-14600-a-year-price-tag-2015-12-14", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EB198_Merkel_ZG_20151214151746.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-EB198_Merkel_ZG_20151214151746.jpg"}, "article.id": "929FF044-A29B-11E5-A5F5-58CA03FA40BD", "position": 1}, "article_summary": "And as a recently-approved drug, Praluent likely won\u2019t have a generic version released for about six years.\nThose who are enrolled\u2014or considering enrolling by Dec. 15 for January coverage -- should ask the same kinds of questions when making their decision: Is the drug covered?\n\u201cJust because a drug is covered doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be covered at a price you can afford,\u201d Purpura said.\nIf you\u2019ve purchased insurance through Obamacare, or are considering it: These plans will closely resemble those offered through individual insurance.\nIf you have individual insurance: The jury\u2019s still out on this, according to Purpura."}
