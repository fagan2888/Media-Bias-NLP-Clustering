Now that the race is closer to fruition, this is obviously not the case. Popular favorites have emerged, political outsiders like Bernie and Trump, whose exciting rallies and revolutionary agendas are attracting hordes of previously apathetic voters. The Bush family has sheepishly retreated from the political scene. Hillary\u2019s campaign scrambles to tap into why The Bern has impassioned so many faithful Democrats. This election\u2014vocal, angry, and splintered\u2014is unlike any election in recent memory. Or, for that matter, it\u2019s unlike anything in distant memory. Both parties are wildly fractured. And, of course, the host of The Celebrity Apprentice is leading in Republican delegates.\n\nSummed up, this presidential campaign is full of idols and villains. If ___ wins, I\u2019m moving to Canada. Bernie or Bust. Hillary or Bust. Cruz or Bust. (I\u2019ve never heard that last one, but who\u2019s to say it\u2019s impossible?) One voter\u2019s idol is another\u2019s Hitler. With such extreme positions\u2014Cruz is widely viewed as the most Conservative member of the Senate, and Sanders is perhaps the most liberal\u2014there probably is no American right now who isn\u2019t terrified that their personal villain, whichever candidate that may be, could someday have the nuclear launch codes. Of course, anger will flare during any election year, when sensitive issues that inflame passions seem to hang in the balance. No doubt: advocates of universal healthcare were very angry in 2012, when Mitt Romney proposed to eliminate Obamacare. Conservatives, on the other hand, firmly believed that Obamacare was a useless financial blunder. But Mitt Romney was never anyone\u2019s villain, nor was Obama. No one was going to Canada (except Ted Cruz, probably, to visit his hometown). So why 2016? I think the internet is largely to blame.\n\nI\u2019ve recently wondered why this particular election has generated such a culture of extremes\u2014extreme stances, and extreme personalities. Certainly, America\u2019s current sociocultural climate is a contributing factor. When a national security threat like ISIS instills fear into the population, strong reactions and staunch populism will emerge. But, in the grand scheme of things, 2016 is an odd year for such a People\u2019s Choice Election. If war is the impetus for political fracture, why didn\u2019t Americans choose divisive hardliners in 2004, when many of us were thoroughly dissatisfied with the Iraq War? Instead of choosing the Anti-Bush, Democrats ultimately stood behind an establishment centrist. If economic strife is the impetus for an election of extremes, why didn\u2019t this happen in 2008, at the height of the Great Recession? Barack Obama was a radical change from Bush, of course, but he was a classic moderate compared to some of today\u2019s candidates. Today\u2019s extreme candidates are not solely the products of extreme sociocultural conditions, then, but rather the byproduct of a larger, internet-driven phenomenon.\n\nSocial media was prominent in the 2012 and 2008 elections, so I do not suppose that our use of social media is a major factor in making 2016 the year of heroes vs. villains. However, the way we use social media has undergone a major evolution: journalism is condensed into action-packed microsummaries, clickbait, that appear enticingly on our Facebook or Twitter feeds. Sites like The Daily Beast provide news articles that are userfriendly, exciting, and very quick reads. Most significantly, much of today\u2019s popular internet news caters to a particular political orientation. The goal is to generate the largest number of readers, so articles\u2019 titles compete to be the most attractive.\n\nI view this clickbait phenomenon, perhaps somewhat cynically, as a natural progression of journalism\u2019s becoming a capitalistic industry. Before the advent of the TV, when there was one (at most two or three) different newspapers distributed in a given city, the news had to uphold a certain standard of objectivity in its coverage. Once the news no longer held a monopoly over local markets\u2014that is, when TV news emerged\u2014there was more room for options. With several TV news channels from which to choose, news sources now had to distinguish themselves so that the public would prefer their product above others. The News had entered a free market. As a result, America witnessed the emergence of politically-motivated news channels. Fox News is often seen as unfairly conservative, and many consider MSNBC unabashedly liberal. By pandering to viewers\u2019 biases, these channels can successfully attract consumers. We\u2019re all more comfortable listening to someone who shares our opinions. When news entered the internet age, there is no reason to think the phenomenon wouldn\u2019t continue.\n\nNow there are hundreds of homegrown news sites, which compete for the most shares, for the most likes. To achieve this goal, they must say something that you really agree with, or really disagree with, to coax you into clicking the bait. While Fox News has often been discounted by liberals as unfairly biased, even Fox News has now been accused of being a phony mouthpiece for the political establishment by Donald Trump supporters. The sheer number of internet news sites allows them to be highly diverse. Some are very liberal, some are very conservative, and most are just trying to find a faithful audience. Scrolling down my Facebook feed just now, I immediately glimpse an article from a far-left site called RAWSTORY.com (which I imagine to be headquartered in a dimly lit SoCal basement). Rawstory.com\u2019s current homepage uses inflammatory vocabulary like \u201cludicrous\u201d to describe Sarah Palin. A go-to conservative equivalent, thenewrevere.com (which I imagine to have been created in a dimly lit Iowa doomsday bunker), is displaying an article about the \u201cGlobal Warming Hoax\u201d. Using words like \u201cludicrous\u201d and \u201choax\u201d in reference to today\u2019s current events is not productive; it is pandering.\n\nThe political climate is, of course, sharply divisive, regardless of whether we choose inflammatory news sources. But we need to collectively be a bit more responsible in the links we share, in the journalism we read. Let\u2019s take some time to consider whether RAWSTORY.com is fairly contributing to the political discussion, if it is an example of balanced critique and thorough factual investigation. If we all were a bit less self-serving in what we choose to read, America might still find itself with the fractured same set of presidential candidates. But I\u2019m certain that, if we limit our intake to balanced and credible reporting in spite of the exciting amount of pandering available online, we will be better off. The candidates may remain the same, but they will have to moderate their views to suit a better informed public. If everyone agreed to read a column written by someone with whom we disagree, instead of clicking on a stimulating title that satisfies our preexisting views, the inflammatory slogans of 2016\u2019s candidates could fade away.
