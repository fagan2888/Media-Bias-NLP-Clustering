Standing next to him as he made his announcement was a list of the 10 issues he said he\u2019d focus on throughout his campaign.\n\nProtecting food, fiber and fuel was at the top, both because of the area\u2019s richness but also because he said our national security is at risk if we continue to increase dependence on foreign nations.\n\nOther key points were border security, enforcing immigration laws, repealing the Affordable Care Act, ceding more rights to the states and protecting the \u201csanctity of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the son of an Air Force veteran father and a schoolteacher mother,\u201d Robertson said during his campaign announcement. \u201cThey taught me the value of hard work, a strong sense of duty, self-reliance, faith in God, and a love for Texas and our great country.\u201d\n\nEight months\u2019 time and Robertson has stayed true to his beliefs, which will carry him to the runoff election where he faces Jodey Arrington for the Republican bid for the area\u2019s U.S. House Representative.\n\nRobertson gained the most votes in the general primaries, with 26.7 percent of the votes in the nine-candidate race. He finished the night first in 16 of the 29 counties in the district, including Lubbock. Just in Lubbock County, Robertson received 12,520 of the 41,000 votes cast. This was about 300 more votes than Arrington, who finished second.\n\nRobertson said agriculture has been attacked, and it begins with the farm bill and trade policy. He said immediate fixes to the farm bill need to be naming cottonseed as another crop seed oil, which he said will help bridge the gap for the next few years. He\u2019d also support the cotton gin assistance program.\n\n\u201cThese are short term fixes just to get through this terrible farm bill that we\u2019re under,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency is also holding back farmers, said Robertson, as it continues to rule on the selective herbicide Dicamba, which he said needs a ruling now so cotton farmers can decide what seed to plant. He said the EPA as a whole has gotten out of hand and Congress needs to start actually regulating their actions and limit funding.\n\nRobertson said he\u2019d like to see some type of long-term plan, like 15 to 20 years, that reduces the farming subsidies, but something like that can\u2019t be considered until the high tax policy is fixed, overreaching regulations are limited and trade policy gets back to a level playing field.\n\nRobertson is in favor of renewable energy and thinks West Texas can be a big player in wind production, but wants decreasing subsidies and wants to limit (and potentially abolish) the oversight of the federal government\u2019s Department of Energy. He said individual states are the best suited to regulate their businesses.\n\nHe said what Abilene\u2019s Dyess Air Force Base needs is what all military needs, which is more funding. He said investing in the military is the most economical and the cheapest way to prevent future conflict.\n\nRobertson is a Lubbock businessman and was first elected as Lubbock\u2019s mayor in May 2012. He was then re-elected in 2014. He sat on the Cooper and Southland ISD school boards, the Garza County Tax Appraisal Board, the Ransom Canyon City Council and Lubbock\u2019s Zoning Board of Adjustments prior to becoming mayor.\n\nRobertson said Trump wasn\u2019t his top choice for the Republican\u2019s presidential bid, but said it frustrates him that party leaders aren\u2019t getting behind him because their job isn\u2019t to choose the candidate; that\u2019s the job of the voters.\n\nmatt.dotray@lubbockonline.com \u2022 766-8744\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mdotrayAJ", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Election, Local News, MATT DOTRAY", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Lubbock Mayor Glen Robertson entered the congressional race with a focus on the issues that impact voters of West Texas.
