An Iraqi oil official told state newspaper Al-Sabah on Wednesday that the world's biggest oil exporters both in and outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plan to meet in Moscow on March 20 to discuss an output freeze.

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said last week that a meeting between the OPEC group and other leading oil producers about freezing oil output levels could take place between March 20 and April 1, either in Russia, or Vienna or Doha.
