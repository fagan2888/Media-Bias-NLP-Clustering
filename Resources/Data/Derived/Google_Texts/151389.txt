ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Dwight Howard showed some love for the alma mater of Houston Rockets teammate Chandler Parsons.

Howard was shown on the big video board doing the “Gator chomp” in the Florida student section during the second half of the Gators’ game against Connecticut at the Final Four. Parsons was with him.

Howard, who went straight to the NBA from Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy, also could be seen singing a Florida school song. Howard signed with the Rockets in the offseason.

Parsons played all four years at Florida and was a second-round pick by Houston in 2011. He was a freshman with the Gators the year after the second of back-to-back titles in 2006 and 2007.
