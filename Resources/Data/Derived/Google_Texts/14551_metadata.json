I\u2019ve got arrhythmic heart failure, got asthma,\u201d says Powell, who runs a rooming house in Portland, Oregon. \u201cI was in and out of the hospital all the time, it would be a month, a whole month, I\u2019d be in the hospital three or four times.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s the kind of patient who gets labeled a \u201cfrequent flier\u201d by healthcare providers. It\u2019s a pejorative label, and from a distance it\u2019s certainly easy to judge Powell: she struggled to keep track of her medication. She ate lousy food. She kept smoking.\n\nPhysician assistant Cassie Ryan-Mapolski sees plenty of patients like Powell at her Portland clinic. Sooner or later, she says, you end up stuck.\n\n\u201cThere can be those moments where you\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t know what else to do for you. Why are you here? What do you want? What do you want me to do? I have no way to help you, I have no way to help you help yourself,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nIn virtually every city and town in America there are men and women who can\u2019t keep up with chronic illnesses like diabetes and congestive heart failure. In virtually every city and town in America there are doctors and nurses who believe poverty, mental illness and addiction are at the root of the problem.\n\nThese are among the most expensive patients in the health care system, and their ranks are growing. Under the Affordable Care Act, more people at the margins are getting insurance through Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIf you were homeless and had a lot of health care needs, in the past you often couldn\u2019t access health care, you would get sicker and you would often die,\u201d says Harvard\u2019s Dr. Ashish Jha. \u201cToday we have a lot more people coming into the health care system, insurance expansion has meant a lot of these people thankfully can get health care.\u201d\n\nAnd that means the cost to taxpayers for prescriptions, ambulance rides and week-long hospital stays just keeps climbing.\n\nBut unlike costs for people at the end of life, or even those battling cancer, these costs \u2013 at least on paper \u2013 could be reduced or avoided if people got better care. The consulting firm Oliver Wyman says delivering proper care to these patients nationwide could save $300 billion a year. The question, of course, is what proper care looks like.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on a recent afternoon at the Dishman Community Center in Portland may be part of the answer. Social worker Lisa Pearlstein leads her patient-client Tony Horst toward the pool. He\u2019s a little nervous. He hasn\u2019t gone swimming in 15 years.\n\n\u201cIt might be hard on me, it might be not hard,\u201d he says. \u201cHope I don\u2019t have chest pains in the swimming pool.\u201d\n\nHorst has a heart problem, for which he has to lug around an oxygen tank. He also has a lot of anxiety. The fact that he showed up at all \u2013 after getting lost on his way here \u2013 is because of the relationship he\u2019s built with Pearlstein.\n\nHorst is part of the Health Resilience Program run by CareOregon, an insurance company covering Medicaid patients. Under the program, people like Pearlstein seek out the whole picture of a person. She asks about their priorities, their worries and their pain. As that relationship develops, it helps her more clearly see the medical and the social roadblocks. That\u2019s crucial to building the kind of trust Pearlstein\u2019s built with Horst.\n\n\u201cThis population of people has been affected by so much hell,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming sometimes.\u201d\n\nIt may be overwhelming, and time consuming, but CareOregon believes getting to know patients so intimately lets them do a better job. The company also collects a lot of data, which has helped emphasize that not all poor patients with chronic illnesses are the same. Some are able to manage their disease and don\u2019t cycle in and out of the hospital. Those who do find themselves at the hospital frequently are often socially isolated \u2014 patients like Joannie McVae. She\u2019s married, but her husband is gone a lot, and she\u2019s really sick. Her illnesses include diabetes, OCD, PTSD, panic and anxiety attacks, asthma, sleep apnea and plantar fasciitis. CareOregon tackles isolation by pairing patients with a social worker and a peer who has similar lived experiences. One day earlier this year, McVae remembers her feet and knee were driving her nuts.\n\n\u201cI was really frustrated,\u201d she says, \u201cand I was really in pain.\u201d\n\nShe couldn\u2019t make headway with the doctor, and she felt her anxiety spooling up inside.\n\n\u201cI was emotionally feeling like I wanted to get to the hospital. I wanted to take pills. I was crying. It set my bipolar in. I wanted to throw things,\u201d she recalls.\n\nShe almost called the ambulance, but instead she started scrolling through her phone, eventually texting Sam Osborne, her peer support who also has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\n\n\u201cI remember she came and sat on my couch,\u201d McVae says. \u201cAnd we just had this amazing, connecting talk.\u201d\n\nCatastrophe averted. No 911 call, no ambulance, no ER admission. Administrators there say they know CareOregon needs better data to prove the concept works, but this approach \u2013 with its focus on relationships and reaching the socially isolated \u2013 seems to be paying off. Two and a half years since the program launched, the company says it's cut hospital and emergency room admissions by 35 percent.\n\nPart of that is because people like McVae \u2013 and like Evelyn Powell, the \u201cfrequent flier\u201d from earlier in our story, have never wanted to spend so much time in the hospital or ER. And now they don\u2019t have to. In Powell\u2019s case, working with CareOregon has helped her avoid trips to the ER for the last year. She\u2019s only had one hospitalization of any kind in 2015, and she quit smoking this spring.\n\nDoctors love the program. They says it\u2019s easier to make progress with these patients. Even the bean counters seem happy; CareOregon estimates that next year it will save at least double what it costs to run the program.\n\nImproving health and saving money is the only measure of success for many in the industry. Some like CareOregon\u2019s Lisa Pearlstein wonder if that bar is too high.\n\n\u201cWe could do everything and still people are going to struggle,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just poverty is so profound. Trauma is so profound.\u201d\n\nPearlstein talks about Bop, a 50-something woman addicted to heroin for more than 30 years, in and out of an abusive relationship, in chronic pain.\n\n\u201cWe had a standing appointment,\u201d Pearlstein says. \u201cShe would show up on Monday morning at 9:30. I could see her get off the bus, and I could be able to tell if she was high or not.\u201d\n\nPearlstein says while they worked together for a couple of years, Bop kept going to the hospital and the ER about the same as always. She was on the street until Pearlstein helped get her into hospice.\n\n\u201cShe died in her sister\u2019s home, in a bed, with treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in pain. She died with dignity. She didn\u2019t just fall down, face down, in the street in the gutter and get picked up and taken to the emergency room where nobody knew her,\u201d Pearlstein says.\n\nNo one ever saved any money on Bop, but she died the way she wanted, and maybe that was enough.\n\nClick the media player below to hear more about the kinds of high-intensity interventions that make a difference in the lives of complicated patients.\n\nThis story was reported with the support of the Dennis A.
