Carolyn Quinn has these tips to shrink your piles of stuff:\n\nSeparate items into three piles: Keep, recycle or donate, and trash. Quinn said organizing things into what you need versus what is cluttering your home can help.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure if you want to keep a certain item or not, have a friend or family member take it for a week. Quinn said if you can live without it for a week, it can leave the home.\n\nHave a buddy. Quinn said she encourages members of the group to touch base with each other on occasion, in case someone misses a workshop or generally needs a friend.\n\nIt all starts with one room. Quinn said some of the members of the \u201cBuried in Treasures\u201d group tackle one room or area of the home. For some, it\u2019s the bedroom. For others, it\u2019s the hallway or another point of access. Concentrating on one area can make the decluttering process more manageable.\n\nDon\u2019t be discouraged by slow progress, particularly if you have a lot to declutter. Quinn said one group member said she tackles her clutter \u201cone yard at a time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Press of Atlantic City", "description": "Looking back on it, Deana Maloney thinks her hoarding started in her childhood, when she saved greeting cards she received from family and friends.", "title": "Atlantic County mental health group demystifying hoarding", "url": "http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/life/atlantic-county-mental-health-group-demystifying-hoarding/article_0ac8a06a-f851-11e5-8fc9-9f4286824d10.html", "image": {"width": 842, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pressofatlanticcity.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/e8/0e8aee19-7011-5b81-a6d7-67351a7d1e52/56fd90dc47fb0.image.jpg?resize=842%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ThePressofAC", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ACPress_Tracey"}, "description": "Looking back on it, Deana Maloney thinks her hoarding started in her childhood, when she saved greeting cards she received from family and friends.", "fb": {"app_id": 113308822051293}, "google-site-verification": "4pDcpXY1Fa3tpsDgibWYD5HyiEs_Q0obYDA86qmB1Uk", "keywords": "hoarding,hoarders,finder keeper,mental health association,buried in treasures,new jersey,atlantic county,randy frost,life,breaking,monday_health,news,top_three,spotlight", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PressofAC", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/542939055"}, "news_keywords": "hoarding,hoarders,finder keeper,mental health association,buried in treasures,new jersey,atlantic county,randy frost,life,breaking,monday_health,news,top_three,spotlight"}, "article_summary": "Quinn said one group member said she tackles her clutter \u201cone yard at a time.\u201d\nQuinn said some of the members of the \u201cBuried in Treasures\u201d group tackle one room or area of the home.\nCarolyn Quinn has these tips to shrink your piles of stuff:Separate items into three piles: Keep, recycle or donate, and trash.\nTIPS ON DECLUTTERINGEven if you\u2019re not a hoarder or finder-keeper, it can be challenging to declutter.\nQuinn said she encourages members of the group to touch base with each other on occasion, in case someone misses a workshop or generally needs a friend."}
