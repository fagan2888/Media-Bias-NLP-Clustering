Most recently, she headed the Wal-Mart Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.\n\nShe replaces Kathleen Sebelius, who has led the health agency since 2009. The former Kansas governor is credited with steering implementation of the health law through unprecedented partisan opposition, but also failing to adequately prepare for the rollout of the online HealthCare.gov marketplace last fall.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Senate confirms Obama pick Sylvia Mathews Burwell to head HHS", "date": "2014-06-05", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell sailed to confirmation Thursday as President Obama\u2019s next Secretary of Health and Human Services, picking up bipartisan support in the Senate despite Republicans\u2019 ongoing opposition to the Affordable Care Act .", "title": "Senate confirms Obama pick Sylvia Mathews Burwell to head HHS", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-hhs-confirmation-20140605-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5390c118/turbine/la-na-nn-hhs-confirmation-20140605", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, hhs, healthcare, health, burwell, obama", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/80416619", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, hhs, healthcare, health, burwell, obama", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Sylvia Mathews Burwell sailed to confirmation Thursday as President Obama\u2019s next Secretary of Health and Human Services, picking up bipartisan support in the Senate despite Republicans\u2019 ongoing opposition to the Affordable Care Act.
