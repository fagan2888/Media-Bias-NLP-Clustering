Six Groups of Americans And How They Are Faring

Each symbol = one million people

Enrollments Participation in Obamacare

Good riddance Estimated drops in inferior plans and the uninsured because of Obamacare

Other insurance plans

1. A HUGE DROP IN THE UNINSURED

At least 13.4 million Americans — more than the population of Illinois — have been added to the insurance rolls. Before the law, 42 million were uninsured; that number has fallen by almost 30 percent.

No longer uninsured: 13.4 MILLION

Still uninsured: 28.9 MILLION

2. MILLIONS USED THE EXCHANGES

11.4 million people have signed up — stragglers will increase the final tally — to buy insurance on the exchanges. Perhaps 12 percent will drop out by not paying the first premium, so the ultimate number should be at least 10 million.

NEW: 10 MILLION

3. MILLIONS MORE BOUGHT DIRECTLY

Better insurance: The law requires all plans to meet minimum standards of coverage. Eight million Americans, signing up outside of the exchanges, will benefit in 2015 from upgraded plans.

NEW: 8 MILLION

Previous: 0.5 million

Inferior plans: Most went away. After being told by the president that “if you like the plan you have, you can keep it,” approximately 7.5 million people left substandard plans, many of them involuntarily.

People whose inferior plans ended: 7.5 MILLION

People in inferior plans that must end by 2017: 3 MILLION

4. HELP FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

A Medicaid expansion to raise the income threshold (up to $33,465 for a family of four) greatly reduced the number of uninsured. 22 predominantly Republican states have declined this expansion, so participation is below initial forecasts. But the number of states holding out has been dropping because of public pressure.

NEW: 13.4 MILLION

EXPANSION: 9.1

“WOODWORKERS”: 3.3 MILLION (People who were already eligible for Medicaid and came out of the “woodwork” because of the law.)

BULK TRANSFERS: 1

Previous: 56 MILLION

5. MEDICARE ENROLLMENTS UNTOUCHED

50 million elderly Americans are covered by Medicare, so the law has no meaningful impact on those enrollments. A small increase stems from an aging population.

Previous: 49 MILLION

New: 1 MILLION

6. A CHIP OFF EMPLOYER PLANS

The creation of the exchanges provides some encouragement for employers to drop coverage, particularly if their plans do not meet the tougher new standards. Over the next three years, that fall off is expected to grow to nine million, still small in relation to the 39 million projected to be added under the law.

People whose employer plans ended: 1.5 MILLION

Previous: 150 MILLION
