Instead, the PAC will solely focus on the ground game, organizing and mobilizing grassroots networks, especially of women, that can help Republicans win the messaging battle woman-to-woman and neighbor-to-neighbor.\n\n\u201cWe need to name and shame Democrats who play the \u2018war on women\u2019 game,\u201d Fiorina told Breitbart News. \u201cToo often, Republicans have allowed the label to stick because of a misguided theory that by ignoring a charge it just goes away\u2026We need to organize strong conservative activists, especially women, and energize them to take action on behalf of our conservative principles. Women make up half this country. The UP Project is no longer going to allow Democrats to pretend we are single-issue voters.\u201d\n\nThe UP Project will hit the ground running Monday in six key swing states \u2014 Colorado, Michigan, Iowa, North Carolina, Virginia, and New Hampshire \u2014 that will help determine which party controls the Senate. The super PAC, which expects to have raised over $1 million by July 15th, will also recruit and develop field staff, build lists, and launch its rapid response operation this week.\n\nFiorina, who is now the Chairwoman of the American Conservative Union (ACU) Foundation and an ACU board member, pointed out that during the 2010 midterm elections, the Tea Party refused to let Democrats define and take advantage of conservatives, especially on women\u2019s issues. Fiorina said her PAC is \u201cdrawing a tremendous amount of inspiration from\u201d from the Tea Party movement in 2010, which was fueled largely by women at the grassroots level, that gave the House GOP back its power.\n\nFormer Alaska Governor Sarah Palin and her \u201cMama Grizzlies\u201d galvanized the Tea Party movement in 2010, and it also helped Republicans at the state level as well. South Carolina\u2019s Nikki Haley and New Mexico\u2019s Susana Martinez, for instance, would not be in office without Palin\u2019s endorsement. Palin also endorsed Fiorina, which helped her win the Senate primary in California before she lost to incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA). During that campaign, Boxer and her allies, in a race that may have previewed the \u201cwar on women\u201d rhetoric that the Obama campaign would relentlessly exploit two years later, hammered Fiorina, a cancer survivor, as someone who would be \u201cbad for women.\u201d\n\nIn battleground Congressional districts, recent polling has shown that \u201conly 25% of women in these districts believe the country is headed in the right direction, while 67% say it\u2019s on the wrong track.\u201d In addition, a majority (53%) of women disapprove of Obama\u2019s job performance and 55% of women oppose Obamacare.\n\nFiorina says women voters have more complicated priorities than the volatile debates over abortion and rape attest. \u201cWhat women care most about are jobs and a lack of opportunity for themselves and for their families,\u201d she said. As she has traveled the country, women have have told her, \u201cWe are half the country\u201d and, \u201cWe care about more than what Democrats derisively call \u2018women\u2019s issues.'\u201d\n\nBut her unsuccessful campaign against Boxer made her realize how tough it was for more broader issues to stick when a candidate has to spend a lot of her time routinely fending off \u201cinsulting charges that Republicans were engaged\u201d in the so-called \u201cwar on women.\u201d Bernie Quigley referred to as Fiorina as a \u201ctrue west conservative\u201d for being pro-life, for the Second Amendment, and against blanket amnesty for illegal immigrants, and those types of conservative women face even more heat from the left and a mainstream media that often helps Democrats amplify their attacks.\n\n\u201cI realized a crucial need for an apparatus to push back against this absurdity, and to defend our conservative principles when they are under attack,\u201d Fiorina said, emphasizing that \u201cliberals and Democrats fear nothing more than mobilized, articulate conservative women.\u201d\n\nIn key states like Ohio, Virginia, and Colorado, Republicans lacked such an apparatus in 2012, and Democrats and the Obama campaign ran circles around Republicans on the ground, despite vast amounts of money spent. Karl Rove\u2019s American Crossroads, for instance, spent over $100 million in the 2012 cycle but candidates in Wisconsin, Virginia and other states faltered.\n\nWith the \u201cwar on women\u201d attack playing a key role in Democrat gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe victory in Virginia in 2013, Democrats are likely to keep returning to the tactic in 2014 and beyond.\n\nFiorina hopes that the UP Project can challenge Democrats in six states this year by building \u201ca strong network of engaged women who will stand up for conservative solutions and say, \u2018we\u2019re tired of Liberal Democrats insulting us by thinking we\u2019re single issue voters, and that all we care about are reproductive rights.'\u201d\n\nIn North Carolina (Thom Tillis vs. Sen. Kay Hagan) and New Hampshire (Scott Brown vs. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen), GOP men are challenging two incumbent Democrat women.\n\nIn Colorado (Rep. Cory Gardner vs. Sen. Mark Udall) and Virginia (Ed Gillespie vs. Sen. Mark Warner), two Republican men are challenging incumbent Democrat men in states in which national Democrats have vigorously played the \u201cwar on women\u201d card in the past.\n\nAnd in Michigan and Iowa, two Republican women are facing off against Democrat men for open seats. In Michigan, Rep. Gary Peters (D-MI) faces Terri Lynn Land. And in what may be one of the marquee races of this cycle, Republican Joni Ernst, the Iraq War veteran who grew up on a farm castrating hogs, faces Rep. Bruce Braley (D-IA) in Iowa. Ernst received the support of Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney, with Palin specifically mentioning that Democrats would not be able to play the \u201cwar on women\u201d card on Ernst in the general election.\n\nThe UP Project, as Fiorina says, hopes to ultimately organize \u201ca network of conservative activists at the grassroots level with an aim toward developing a bigger, broader base of support for Republican nominees.\u201d But it also seeks to put forth new messengers who can have those \u201creal conversations\u201d with women who may have become disillusioned with more establishment organizations while also convincing nonpartisan women to vote for Republican candidates.\n\nIn that sense, the PAC will compliment the work of campaigns and the other super PACs that will saturate the airwaves.\n\n\u201cSometimes as conservatives we speak about high level principles and policies. We need to connect these in very personal terms to women\u2019s lives,\u201d Fiorina said. \u201cOrganization matters. People matter. Too many consultant-driven Republican organizations forget that.\u201d\n\nIf successful, the PAC\u2019s work can have a spillover effect for down-ballot candidates and be a lightbulb moment for big-time GOP donors, who may be convinced to invest in long-term strategies that build networks of voters instead of just solely in splashy television commercials. More patience will be required on the front end, but investing in the ground game could pay more dividends down the line, especially if it makes it easier for Republicans to combat the \u201cwar on women\u201d rhetoric and make Democrats think twice before going back to something that has been played out.\n\nAnd if more women are convincingly speaking to others, as Fiorina says, in \u201cpersonal terms about why conservative principles work,\u201d perhaps the groundwork could be put in place for Fiorina to even benefit down the line.\n\n\u201cI try to never close the door on anything in life,\u201d she said when asked if she would ever run for office again. But she noted that at the current time her focus, with the UP Project, is on \u201csharing our conservative vision with women in key states, and to putting an end to the era of Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the 2012 election cycle, Democrats rallied around a Republican", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "In the 2012 election cycle, Democrats rallied around a Republican", "title": "Carly Fiorina Goes Head-to-Head With Dems' 'War On Women' Attack With New PAC - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/29/Carly-Fiorina-APjpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/29/carly-fiorina-goes-head-to-head-with-dems-war-on-women-attack-with-new-pac/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In the 2012 election cycle, Democrats rallied around a Republican", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/06/29/Carly-Fiorina-APjpg.jpg", "title": "Carly Fiorina Goes Head-to-Head With Dems' 'War On Women' Attack With New PAC - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Sarah Palin, Senate, War on Women,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "War on Women", "published_time": "2014-06-29T19:39:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "And in Michigan and Iowa, two Republican women are facing off against Democrat men for open seats.\n\u201cWe need to name and shame Democrats who play the \u2018war on women\u2019 game,\u201d Fiorina told Breitbart News.\nFiorina says women voters have more complicated priorities than the volatile debates over abortion and rape attest.\nThe UP Project, which stands for \u201cUnlocking Potential,\u201d will seek to help Republicans win back the Senate by directly confronting Democrats and their \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative.\n\u201cWhat women care most about are jobs and a lack of opportunity for themselves and for their families,\u201d she said."}
