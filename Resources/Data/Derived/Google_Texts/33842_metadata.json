Focusing on uninsured rates is not the only parameter,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., said.\n\nDemocrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which held Tuesday\u2019s hearing, defended the performance of the exchanges, saying they dramatically cut the number of uninsured and improved medical coverage.\n\n\u201cI hope we are not hoping that the state exchanges fail,\u201d said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Col.\n\nThe hearing, which was originally scheduled for July and postponed until Tuesday, was held as House Republicans plan a new assault on the ACA. It comes as the state exchanges gear up for the Nov. 1 start of the open enrollment period to sign up for insurance.\n\nHouse leaders said this week they hope to gut the health care law through a procedural move called budget reconciliation -- a measure that bars the Senate from using a filibuster to block legislation and that was used to pass the ACA. The legislation would repeal the ACA\u2019s requirements that most individuals have health insurance and that larger companies cover their workers. It would also repeal the \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on expensive, comprehensive plans and medical devices.\n\n\u201cWithout these parts of the law \u2014 particularly the individual and employer mandates\u2014 Obamacare could not stand,\u201d said a statement released Tuesday by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nPresident Obama is expected to veto the bill if it reaches his desk.\n\nMeanwhile, Wadleigh, who testified with exchange chiefs from Oregon, Massachusetts, Hawaii, California and Minnesota, said Access Health CT has helped cut the number of uninsured in Connecticut in half, from 8 percent to less than 4 percent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked with Connecticut\u2019s insurance commissioner to keep costs down,\u201d Wadleigh said.\n\nWadleigh also said Access Health CT, which received $176 million from the federal government to set up operations, has \u201cbecome a self-sustaining exchange \u2013 well ahead of next year\u2019s deadline.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe no longer use state or federal funding for our operating costs,\u201d he said.\n\nWadleigh said Connecticut\u2019s exchange is a model for other states, and cited a Forbes columnist who wrote \u201cConnecticut isn\u2019t just ahead of every other state; it\u2019s in its own league entirely.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., said only about half of those enrolled in health coverage through Access Health CT were previously uninsured.\n\nMurphy said there were expensive glitches that have prompted some states \u2013including Hawaii -- to abandon attempts to run their own exchanges and switch to a federally run marketplace, but to hear the exchange chief\u2019s testimony \u201cit would appear everything is rainbows and unicorns.\u201d\n\nUnder questioning by the panel\u2019s Republican members, Wadleigh testified Access Health CT cost $28 million to run this year. But he said he did not know the cost of enrolling each individual who has received coverage through Access Heath CT.\n\nWadleigh also said the state had to increase a fee on the state\u2019s insurers by 22 percent to cover Access Health CT\u2019s operating costs, a cost that has been passed on to policyholders.\n\nRep. Morgan Griffith, R-Va., questioned Wadleigh\u2019s testimony that the cost of \u201cthe most affordable [health] plans had remained flat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat raises in my mind\u2026if your most affordable plans remain flat, you don\u2019t tell me about the others. Does that mean everyone else is getting an increase?\u201d Griffith asked.\n\nWadleigh stumbled a little in his reply.\n\n\u201cThere are always going to be plans \u2026that are much richer,\u201d he finally conceded.\n\nThis is video of the entire proceeding:", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/29/house-panel-grills-access-health-ceo-other-exchange-chiefs/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Politics, Washington, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, budget reconciliation, Congress, House Energy and Commerce Committee, investigation, James Wadleigh", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/29/house-panel-grills-access-health-ceo-other-exchange-chiefs/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 As part of a renewed attack on the Affordable Care Act, House Republicans grilled Access Health CEO James Wadleigh and the heads of other state marketplaces on Tuesday, saying they had wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on an effort that has raised health insurance deductibles and premiums.", "title": "House panel grills Access Health CEO, other exchange chiefs", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/29/house-panel-grills-access-health-ceo-other-exchange-chiefs/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/09/James-Wadleigh-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@radelat"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/29/house-panel-grills-access-health-ceo-other-exchange-chiefs/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda66a\"", "article_summary": "The legislation would repeal the ACA\u2019s requirements that most individuals have health insurance and that larger companies cover their workers.\n\u201cI hope we are not hoping that the state exchanges fail,\u201d said Rep.
