The terms and conditions of its privacy policy are further explained below.\n\n\n\nInformation Collection\n\nWe will collect personally identifiable information from you only on a voluntary basis. Such information would be gathered by having you fill out and submit a form on this site. If you elect to provide this information we may ask you to provide us personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, daytime phone number and credit card information if you are making a donation or are purchasing event tickets. We may also ask for a user name and password for certain online activities. Collection of this information is intended to serve visitors with the most complete and expeditious information for each user as well as to provide a way for users to submit information and orders, and to receive requested information from us.\n\n\n\nInformation Protection\n\nWe stay abreast of the industry\u2019s standards and protocols to protect personal information from unauthorized use. Several security measures are employed. Secured networks are used to contain a user\u2019s personal information. Access to this information is restricted to a limited number of employees who possess special access rights. When orders are placed or when you access personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. To protect the security of sensitive data such as credit card information, they are transmitted using Secure Socket Layer or SSL technology and then encrypted into databases that can only be accessed under strict conditions mentioned above.\n\n\n\nUse of \u201cCookies\u201d\n\nThe use of \u201ccookies,\u201d tiny bits of electronic information that a Web site puts on your computer\u2019s hard drive so that the site can remember your preferences or pages that you have visited on the site, helps us provide you with a better experience on our site. These cookies, which are standard on the Internet and used by most Web sites, cannot read any other files on your computer or damage your computer. We use them to better customize your visits to your preferences. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to refuse cookies or to notify you when cookies are being sent.\n\n\n\nTransfer of Information\n\nWe will not sell or rent to others personal identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide to Pacific Legal Foundation. However, occasionally we will exchange postal mailing lists, but only with other like-minded, conservative organizations whose products or programs align with our core mission and goals. We will carefully screen potential list exchange partners to ensure they meet our criteria. When we perform a list exchange, we will ensure that the list is only for one-time use, and the information we provide will be the member\u2019s name and mailing address. No email or telephone information will ever be shared. Anyone who objects to the use of their information in such exchanges can simply opt out by contacting us through the means provided below.\n\n\n\nThe information you voluntarily provide is used to tailor our services, to enhance the offerings and features of our site, to support any transactions you make on the site, and to strengthen our outreach to the public.\n\n\n\nAny ordering transaction will require your credit card information to be released to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our site, and we may, in some instances, have to provide information to third parties to help provide the highest level of customer service for you. Information about third party service providers is available by contacting us. You should note, however, that the use of your personal identifiable information by our service partners is governed by their privacy policies, and is not subject to our control.\n\n\n\nIn rare circumstances, we may be contacted and required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personal identifiable information to the appropriate government authorities.\n\n\n\nWe will disclose personal identifiable information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, and to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement in identifying those who use our services for fraudulent or illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful or criminal.\n\n\n\nAcceptance and Consent of Privacy Terms & Conditions\n\nUse of this site signifies your agreement to the terms and conditions of Pacific Legal Foundation\u2019s Privacy Policy. Changes to this policy will be posted on this page to provide full disclosure about the information we collect, its use, and under what circumstances and conditions it will be disclosed.\n\n\n\nTerms of Use\n\nWeb site usage information may or may not be used to generate statistics and measure the site\u2019s activity for the purpose of enhancing its usefulness and navigation ease to our visitors. Occasionally we and third party companies may note or track usage data for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics.\n\n\n\nWhen registering on this site, visitors have the option to be placed on our list to receive communications from us, including news and information, donor appeals and other printed or electronic correspondence. Only agents authorized to work on our behalf and under confidentiality agreements will send direct mailings, and only if you have consented to receiving these offers.
