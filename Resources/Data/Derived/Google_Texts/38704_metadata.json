Either by measuring increases in total healthcare spending, measuring the cost of providing health insurance, or calculating the rise in prices charged for actual medical care.\n\nAll three measures are rising, and all three are, of course, interrelated.\n\nYet on a relative basis, the increases in actual medical charges seem to be growing more quickly than the cost of insurance, or measures of total health spending. This suggests that the real underlying inflation in healthcare has yet to be fully felt.\n\nOn the issue of total healthcare spending, it appears that the slowing in total healthcare outlays was short lived, and probably a consequence of temporary factors.\n\nFor one thing, a slack economy that left consumers with less disposable income also discouraged many people from seeking medical care.\n\nMore important were sweeping changes in the structure of health insurance. The widespread and rapid adoption of high-deductible health plans, which had high out-of-pocket limits, discouraged people from seeing their doctors. These high-deductible plans were around before the ACA. But Obamacare made these very skinny kinds of health plans politically fashionable, and as a consequence, far more prevalent. Insurance constructs that started in the Obamacare exchanges have rapidly diffused across the commercial market as carriers standardized around these new schemes.\n\nContinue Reading\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Galen Institute", "description": "By Scott Gottlieb Forbes, August 6, 2015 In the real economy, medical costs are on a sharp upswing.
