Last month the prime minister claimed victory: Mr Abbott boasted that his conservative Liberal-National government had notched up six months without one \u201cpeople-smuggling venture\u201d landing on Australian shores. It has done so mainly by using the navy to push boats back to Indonesia, from where most asylum-seekers set out.\n\nDays after his declaration, Australia seized 157 Sri Lankan Tamil asylum-seekers from a boat near Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean. The government has since held them on a customs vessel at sea, though it will not say where. The boat people\u2019s fate has now moved to Australia\u2019s High Court, where refugee advocates say the government is acting illegally. The case could affect the policy of turning back the boats.\n\nWhen reports of the boat\u2019s seizure first surfaced, Scott Morrison, the immigration minister, refused even to acknowledge the interception. The government calls \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders\u201d against boats a \u201cmilitary-led\u201d affair, and has shrouded it in secrecy. It then emerged that Australia had intercepted another vessel, carrying 41 Sri Lankan asylum-seekers, both Tamil and Sinhalese. It handed these people over to a Sri Lankan naval vessel off the coast of Sri Lanka in early July.\n\nThat prompted lawyers, backed by the Human Rights Law Centre in Melbourne, to go to the High Court. On July 7th a judge issued a temporary injunction stopping the larger group of boat people from being delivered to Sri Lanka, too. In preliminary hearings since, some details have come out. The 157 Sri Lankans had left for Christmas Island from southern India. Since their interception, they have been allowed out of their cabins on the Australian vessel for meals and three hours of daylight a day. Family members, among them three dozen children, have been split up.\n\nAccording to court documents, the cabinet\u2019s national-security committee, which Mr Abbott chairs, ruled two days after the Sri Lankans\u2019 interception on June 29th that they be taken to \u201ca place other than Australia\u201d. A destination has not been spelled out. But the government has undertaken to the court that it will not send them to Sri Lanka without notice. Mr Morrison\u2019s visit to Delhi on July 22nd sparked speculation that Australia hoped to send the asylum-seekers to India instead.\n\nThe government says the Sri Lankans were intercepted in a \u201ccontiguous zone\u201d just outside Australia\u2019s territorial waters around Christmas Island. It argues this makes them ineligible to claim asylum in Australia, and that the country\u2019s Maritime Powers Act allows it to transfer them elsewhere. The boat people\u2019s lawyers contend that Australia\u2019s obligations under international and human-rights laws apply as much as Australian law on the high seas. They say this means Australia should give the boat people a fair hearing and not send them to a country such as Sri Lanka, where some may fear for their safety.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that the 41 people from the earlier boat were given a rather compressed form of screening before being handed over to Sri Lanka. Australia has used a blunt process of shortened questioning, often without access to lawyers, since 2012\u2014mainly with boat people from Sri Lanka. Many have been returned there as a result. The UN refugee agency has condemned the practice. On July 7th some 53 legal scholars from 17 Australian universities declared jointly that Australia\u2019s \u201creported conduct under Operation Sovereign Borders clearly violates international law\u201d.\n\nSome critics worry about other cosy aspects of Australia\u2019s relations with Sri Lanka. Two months after its election last year, the Abbott government gave Sri Lanka two patrol boats to help it stop asylum-seekers from leaving the country. Gillian Triggs, head of Australia\u2019s human-rights commission, speaks of a \u201cdangerous environment\u201d after Sri Lanka\u2019s bitter civil war ended in 2009 with the government\u2019s crushing victory. But Mr Abbott sounds sanguine. Sri Lanka, he says, \u201cis not everyone\u2019s idea of the ideal society, but it is at peace\u201d.\n\nThe High Court is due to hear the Tamils\u2019 challenge on August 5th. Meanwhile, about 2,300 asylum-seekers intercepted at sea in recent years are waiting to have their claims processed in two detention camps, one on the tiny island-state of Nauru and the other on Manus Island, in Papua New Guinea. David Manne, a lawyer for refugees, says that if the court ruling went against the government, it would force a profound change in how Australia treats them and other asylum-seekers at sea.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140726_ASP003_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Australia and asylum-seekers", "description": "A court challenges a hardline policy towards boat people", "pubdate": 20140726, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "A court challenges a hardline policy towards boat people", "title": "At sea", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21608798-court-challenges-hardline-policy-towards-boat-people-sea", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_ASP003_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "A court challenges a hardline policy towards boat people", "sailthru.date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_ASP003_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_ASP003_0.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Asia", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20140726_ASP003_0.jpg", "articleid": 21608798, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20140726_ASP003_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Australia and asylum-seekers", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-07-26 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Australia and asylum-seekers"}, "article_summary": "It handed these people over to a Sri Lankan naval vessel off the coast of Sri Lanka in early July.\nSri Lanka, he says, \u201cis not everyone\u2019s idea of the ideal society, but it is at peace\u201d.\nBut the government has undertaken to the court that it will not send them to Sri Lanka without notice.\nOn July 7th a judge issued a temporary injunction stopping the larger group of boat people from being delivered to Sri Lanka, too.\nThe boat people\u2019s fate has now moved to Australia\u2019s High Court, where refugee advocates say the government is acting illegally."}
