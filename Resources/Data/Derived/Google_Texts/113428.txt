New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie’s recent trips to the United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada cost taxpayers in the state nearly $124,000.

That figure, released by Mr. Christie’s office Friday, covers security and security related transportation expenses for each trip and expenses incurred by Mr. Christie’s official photographer, an NBC affiliate in New York reported Saturday.

The trips were reported as trade missions to encourage investment in the state, but also served as a chance for the 2016 presidential hopeful to gain some much needed foreign policy experience.

The trips included meetings and photo ops with leaders and several speeches.

The most expensive of the three trips was Mr. Christie’s three-day trip to the United Kingdom, which cost New Jersey taxpayers $63,653.19, NBC reported.

A trip to Canada in December 2014 cost taxpayers $29,800 and the Mexico trip in September cost $21,822.06.

Other travel expenses were paid for by Choose New Jersey, a non-profit state economic development group funded by corporate donations, which aims to promote job creation in the state, NBC reported.

Mr. Christie has not yet announced whether or not he will seek the GOP nomination in 2016 but has said he will make a decision sometime later this month.
