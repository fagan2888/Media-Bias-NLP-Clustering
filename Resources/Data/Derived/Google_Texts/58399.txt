A Frontier Airlines flight was diverted to Salt Lake City Friday night after the airplane was hit by lightning.

The lightning damaged the airplaneâ€™s weather radar, said Tyri Squyres, a Frontier spokeswoman. Because of bad weather in Denver, it was not safe to return to its starting point without the radar system, she said.

The plane was traveling to Seattle when lightning hit around 6:50 p.m. It made a U-turn to get to Salt Lake, Squyres said. None of the 168 passengers were injured, and no other damage was caused to the airplane.

The flight was delayed in Salt Lake for several hours while repairs were made. The plane was expected to arrive in Seattle late Friday night or early Saturday morning.
