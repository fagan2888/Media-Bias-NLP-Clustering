Every time the economy seems ready to pull out of its 2% growth rut and shift into a higher gear, the engine stalls. It\u2019s happening again in 2015.\n\nEmployers added a flimsy 126,000 jobs in March \u2014 and with downward revisions from previous months, the job gains were half that high. The latest estimate for first-quarter GDP is below 1%, with one Federal Reserve Bank predicting closer to zero.\n\nBusinesses aren\u2019t buying into the robust expansion story that President Obama has been peddling in his \u201cmission accomplished\u201d victory tour across the country \u2014 and neither are Americans on Main Street.\n\nThe March job gains were way down from 18 months prior, when the economy had been averaging more than 200,000 a month. Wages crept up a bit (0.3%), but hours worked fell back slightly.\n\nThe now-meaningless headline unemployment rate of 5.5% remains low only because of the still historically low 62.7% labor force participation rate. Working-age Americans aren\u2019t working, and an additional 100,000 dropped out in March.\n\nThe all-inclusive unemployment rate, which includes those who have stopped looking for a job plus those who can\u2019t find full-time work, is closer to 11%.\n\nOnce again, supporters of the administration\u2019s policies have blamed the lousy numbers on the weather. But that doesn\u2019t explain the big downward revisions in previous months.\n\nIt seems that every winter, we get poor jobs numbers that Obama apologists blame on the weather \u2014 as if we\u2019ve never experienced snowstorms in January, February and March. And this is the president who says that we have to fear global warming.\n\nDrawing conclusions from one discouraging jobs report or one bad quarter of growth is a fool\u2019s errand. But the five-year trend on jobs tells us a lot.\n\nThis is a pitiful economic recovery, and the underperformance didn\u2019t happen by accident. The chart above shows the difference in job growth under President Reagan (whose policies underscored his philosophy that government was \u201cthe problem, not the solution\u201d) vs. Obama. We are some 6.5 million jobs short of where we should be. That can\u2019t be blamed on the weather.\n\nThe policy takeaway? Obamanomics is a grand failure. We\u2019ve spent and borrowed $7 trillion in six years. The Fed has printed and expanded its balance sheet by over $3 trillion and pursued near-zero interest-rate policies.\n\nFiscal stimulus, tax hikes on the rich, ObamaCare, cash for clunkers, minimum-wage increases, housing bailouts \u2014 none of it has returned the economy to anything near the prosperity we saw in the 1980s and \u201990s.\n\nThe president should stop trying to spin Americans on how well things are going when they aren\u2019t seeing it at the kitchen table. Instead, he can sign the Keystone pipeline, reverse recent EPA regulations that are strangling oil and gas producers and utilities, and suspend the 50-worker and 30-hour-a-week rules that trigger ObamaCare mandates and regulations.\n\nThen he can strike a deal with congressional Republicans to cut the corporate tax rate to bring money back to the United States. If creating jobs is Job One for this president, he should do each of these things tomorrow.\n\nBut we\u2019re not holding our breath.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Employment: How many times have we seen this?
