The Status of Women\u2019s Reproductive Rights in the United States.\u201d\n\nOrdinarily by this time NARAL Pro-Choice would have produced what will be its 25th edition of how its annual evaluation of the state of the abortion landscape. But as far as I can tell, NARAL hasn\u2019t cranked out \u201cWho Decides,\u201d or at least has not publicized it.\n\nWhich brings us to the pro-abortion Population Institute\u2019s \u201cA 50-State Report Card.\u201d You can read its analysis at populationinstitute.org.\n\nAnything interesting? Three conclusions are worth addressing.\n\n#1. I hadn\u2019t taken the time to read any prior Population Institute report cards. So I was stunned to learn that for 2014 it gave the United States as a whole a \u201cC.\u201d Pro-abortionists never give higher than a \u201cD.\u201d\n\n#2. Which is what PI gave the nation for 2015\u2013more specifically, a \u201cD+\u201d And given its grading assessments, we were lucky to get that. According to the report, \u201cFour states received an A (California, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington), but 19 states received a failing grade.\u201d I know the specifics of a few states myself and suffice it to say, even from a rigidly pro-abortion position, the state did not merit an \u201cF.\u201d\n\n#3. \u201cLast year was a terrible one for reproductive health and rights in the U.S., but 2016 could be even worse,\u201d was the conclusion drawn by Ms. Magazine\u2019s Jennie Wetter. For example, Wetter notes that 2016 kicked off with a vote in the House of Representatives that (in my words) would have re-directed most of the federal dollars from PPFA to community health centers and repealed many parts of Obamacare, including the program that provides tax-based subsidies for about 1,000 health plans that cover elective abortions.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s vetoed H.R. 3762 \u2013\u201cThe Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act\u201d\u2013which only underscores both Wetter\u2019s summary and the implication of the Population Institute\u2019s report card: they are counting on electing another pro-abortion President.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.nationalrighttolifenews.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/popinstitutemapre-300x185.jpg"}, "bitly-verification": "3d313669c834"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd31\"", "article_summary": "Which brings us to the pro-abortion Population Institute\u2019s \u201cA 50-State Report Card.\u201d You can read its analysis at populationinstitute.org.\nSo I was stunned to learn that for 2014 it gave the United States as a whole a \u201cC.\u201d Pro-abortionists never give higher than a \u201cD.\u201d#2.\nI hadn\u2019t taken the time to read any prior Population Institute report cards.\n\u201cLast year was a terrible one for reproductive health and rights in the U.S., but 2016 could be even worse,\u201d was the conclusion drawn by Ms. Magazine\u2019s Jennie Wetter.\n3762 \u2013\u201cThe Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act\u201d\u2013which only underscores both Wetter\u2019s summary and the implication of the Population Institute\u2019s report card: they are counting on electing another pro-abortion President."}
