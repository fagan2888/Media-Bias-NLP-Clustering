Bachelor ski area Saturday for the final race of the Oregon School Ski Association season, no one could say whether Bend or Summit would claim the combined team title.\n\nAfter the first day of the OSSA final on Friday, the Lava Bears and Storm were locked at 154 points apiece, with the Bend girls and Summit boys each leading their respective season standings by 10 points.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of exciting, coming into the final day not knowing and having everything on the line going into the final race,\u201d Summit coach Dave McKae said.\n\nAfter two tightly contested slalom runs, the title picture was not much clearer. The final results \u2014 tabulated after everyone had packed up and driven down from Mount Bachelor \u2014 showed the Lava Bears girls easily won Saturday\u2019s slalom with a combined time of 5 minutes, 57.56 seconds, extending their total lead to 12 points as they clinched their fourth straight OSSA title. Summit\u2019s top three skiers finished in 6:09.59, good for second place on the day and for the season.\n\nThe Bend boys knew it would be difficult to catch Summit in the points standings, Bend coach Greg Timm said, but the Lava Bears smashed the competition Saturday as their top three skiers completed their two runs in a combined time of 5:31.25, more than 15 seconds faster than the Storm.\n\nAlthough Summit still won the boys title, the Bend boys had narrowed the lead to eight points, clinching the overall combined boys and girls title for the Lava Bears.\n\n\u201cThey were going at it, and they\u2019ve gone at it all season,\u201d Timm said. \u201cMy boys \u2014 and the girls \u2014 stepped up. They made a focused, concentrated effort to ski for each other as a team. There was some really solid team skiing today.\u201d\n\nShelby Cutter, a senior at Bend, dominated the slalom in her last high school ski competition, completing her two runs in a time of 1 minute and 51.93 seconds, more than four seconds ahead of second-place finisher Paget Rathbun of Summit. Kiersten Rowles and Shannon Brennan, both of Bend, finished third and fourth.\n\n\u201cIt was very warm, and that affected the snow,\u201d Cutter said. \u201cMy first run definitely felt better, faster. The second run had way more turns and I was late a lot, but it was a good day.\u201d\n\nAt the OSSA banquet, hosted at Bend High on Saturday evening, Cutter was named the overall girls champion, with 1,460 points from eight events contested during the season. She also won the individual slalom and giant slalom titles. Rowles was second overall with 808 points, while Rathbun was close behind with 780.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice, for four years I\u2019ve been here, we\u2019ve had awesome competition and the team has been so good,\u201d Cutter said. \u201cIt\u2019s been nice to have the girls win all four years, and it\u2019s really nice to win the individual title.\u201d\n\nSummit\u2019s Thomas Wimberly rebounded from a crash in Friday\u2019s giant slalom to win Saturday\u2019s slalom in a time of 1:46.21. Sam Nelson and Brody Swisher, both of Bend, finished second and third, respectively.\n\n\u201cI felt pretty iffy (today), but I kept it together,\u201d Wimberly said. \u201cBy the time the girls went, the snow was pretty much down to a hard surface. The top (of the course) was definitely softer, which made it harder.\u201d\n\nWimberly earned 200 points for posting the fastest time in both runs on Saturday, giving him 1,230 points for the season and the overall boys title. Swisher finished second with 1,010. Jonathan Wimberly, also of Summit, did not finish either run Saturday but still finished third in the season standings with 745 points.\n\nThomas Wimberly also finished atop the slalom and giant slalom standings.\n\n\u2014 Reporter: 541-385-0305; vjacobsen@bendbulletin.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "MOUNT BACHELOR \u2014 When skiers and coaches arrived at the Cliffhanger run at Mt.
