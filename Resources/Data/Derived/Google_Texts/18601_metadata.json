The overuse and misuse of these critical drugs enables some of the bacteria to become resistant, proliferate and spread.\u201d\n\nThe groups said antibiotics should only be used for a genuine therapeutic need, such as a diagnosed illness or a documented outbreak of disease.\n\n\u201cThey should never be administered routinely for purposes such as growth promotion or disease prevention,\u201d they said.\n\nThe letter goes on to ask restaurant chains and their CEOs to publicly adopt antibiotic stewardship policies that prohibit the use of antibiotics or routine use of antibiotics for growth promotion, and to let their suppliers know they expect poultry and other meats to meet this standard.\n\nThe push follows a report from Friends of the Earth, ConsumersUnion, the Center for Food Safety, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Keep Antibiotics Working and the Food Animal Concerns Trust that found that most meat served in fast food chains comes from animals raised in industrial facilities that routinely use antibiotics.\n\nThe report, \u201cChain Reaction: How Top Restaurants Rate on Reducing Use of Antibiotics in Their Meat Supply,\u201d found that only five of the 25 chains had adopted publicly available policies that meaningfully limit routine antibiotics use: Chipotle Mexican Grill, Panera Bread, Chick-fil-A, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and McDonald\u2019s. The policies ranged from strict prohibitions on any antibiotics use, like Chick-fil-A's, to policies that prohibit using antibiotics important to human medicine on chickens, like at McDonald\u2019s.\n\nRep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) hailed the release of the report on Tuesday.\n\n\"More and more Americans are realizing that the misuse of antibiotics in corporate agriculture is having a direct impact on their own health,\" she said in a statement. \"Antibiotic-resistant infections are on the rise and the usefulness of one of our most precious medical resources is on the decline.\u201d\n\nSlaughter, the only microbiologist in Congress, has been a leading advocate for ending the widespread use of antibiotics in agriculture.\n\n\u201cThe companies that have failed to change their practices should examine this report and immediately make the change that the American public is demanding,\u201d she said. \u201cLives literally depend on it.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Of 25 restaurant chains reviewed, five had policies to limit the use of antibiotics.", "description": "Of 25 restaurant chains reviewed, five had policies to limit the use of antibiotics.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Of 25 restaurant chains reviewed, five had policies to limit the use of antibiotics.", "title": "Groups call on restaurant chains to serve antibiotic-free meat", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/253676-groups-call-on-fast-food-chains-to-serve-only-antibiotic-free-meat", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/butchermmmgood05072015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/253676-groups-call-on-fast-food-chains-to-serve-only-antibiotic-free-meat", "dcterms.date": "2015-09-15T12:09-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Antibiotics, Health, Biology, Meat industry, Antibiotic misuse, Pharmaceuticals policy, Veterinary medicine, Medicine, Evolutionary biology,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T12:09:48-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/253676-groups-call-on-fast-food-chains-to-serve-only-antibiotic-free-meat", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Of 25 restaurant chains reviewed, five had policies to limit the use of antibiotics.", "card": "summary", "title": "Groups call on restaurant chains to serve antibiotic-free meat"}, "dcterms.title": "Groups call on restaurant chains to serve antibiotic-free meat"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f82\"", "article_summary": "Consumer, food and health groups are calling on the CEOs of the nation\u2019s top 25 restaurant chains to only serve meat and poultry that\u2019s free of antibiotics.\n\u201cThey should never be administered routinely for purposes such as growth promotion or disease prevention,\u201d they said.\nThe policies ranged from strict prohibitions on any antibiotics use, like Chick-fil-A's, to policies that prohibit using antibiotics important to human medicine on chickens, like at McDonald\u2019s.\n\u201cThe companies that have failed to change their practices should examine this report and immediately make the change that the American public is demanding,\u201d she said.\nRep.
