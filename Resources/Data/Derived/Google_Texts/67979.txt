Some states are still reviewing 2016 rate filings.

The issuer of a typical individual or small-group major medical plan that's going through a Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) rate review process may be asking for a rate increase of about 15 percent to 20 percent for 2016.

About half of the hundreds of 2016 PPACA-compliant plans in the RateReview.HealthCare.gov health rate filing database around 3 p.m. on Monday, June 1, were asking for a bigger increase, and about half were asking for smaller increases.
