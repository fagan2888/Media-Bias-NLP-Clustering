No one. Not even Moses himself should be in Congress for four decades.\u201d\n\nWolf, like Liz Cheney in her Wyoming bid against Senator Mike Enzi, is pushing the argument that it is not enough to have a GOP senator who votes correctly most of the time: Instead, Republican voters must demand politicians who will actively and publicly promote their beliefs. \u201cWe need more senators like Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee,\u201d Wolf declared, depicting himself as a similar figure.\n\nWolf isn\u2019t the first to make this argument: Cruz himself made it in his own primary against the Texas establishment\u2019s favorite, Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst. Few doubted that Dewhurst would vote as a conservative on most issues. But since\n\nCruz took office, he has proven his point: It is inconceivable that Dewhurst would have spent his August recess pushing to tie the defunding of Obamacare to the continuing resolution, or would have stirred up the kind of ire that has caused Cruz to encounter questions such as \u201cWhat\u2019s it\u2019s like to be the most hated man in America?\u201d as Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked him earlier this week.\n\nWolf has already proven his bona fides as an outspoken conservative: He has made appearances on Fox News, among other outlets, and is a columnist and blogger. In his announcement, he railed against the same targets that Sarah Palin and other top conservative activists have taken on: He attacked \u201ccareer politicians\u201d and poked fun at \u201chigh-priced Washington consultants,\u201d saying, \u201cI thank the consultants for their advice, but I\u2019m still the same guy I was growing up in Lyons [Kan.]: I don\u2019t beat around the bush; I don\u2019t ask for A to get to B, and I don\u2019t apologize for telling the truth.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019s record in Congress is fairly conservative, according to the relevant scorecards: He has an 89 percent rating from Heritage Action (the average for a Republican senator is 67 percent), and the American Conservative Union gave him a 72 percent rating in 2012. The fiscally oriented Club for Growth, however, ranked Roberts in 36th place in 2012, putting him behind such senators as John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.).\n\nRoberts came under fire from Wolf in his announcement for endorsing and voting to confirm former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius as secretary of Health and Human Services. Wolf also criticized Roberts for voting for the 2012 fiscal-cliff tax deal, which preserved the Bush tax cuts for the middle class but ended them for the more affluent, and for his eleven votes to hike the debt ceiling. \u201cWhen Democrats are in control and they need Republican votes to pass their big-government agenda, they know they can count on Pat Roberts,\u201d Wolf declared.\n\nBut Wolf has an uphill climb. \u201cHe\u2019d have to raise probably at least $4 million to be viable,\u201d says one well-connected Kansas Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t think he can raise that money.\u201d Besides, the GOP source went on, \u201cPat Roberts is probably the most popular elected official in the state.\u201d\n\nNor does Roberts have any intention of ignoring Wolf\u2019s challenge. \u201cPat Roberts has always said he\u2019s going to run like he\u2019s 20 points behind,\u201d says David Kensinger, a longtime Kansas Republican strategist, who served as campaign manager for Roberts in his 2008 senate bid. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty legendary for his 105-county tours across the state, he has tremendous energy, and he is very good on the stump.\u201d\n\nWhat Wolf needs is a significant financial boost from one or more outside groups in order to get traction. So far, none of them have committed to supporting him. \u201cWe\u2019re watching the race,\u201d says Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller.\n\nThe Madison Project, which endorsed Ted Cruz early on and is now actively supporting Senator Mitch McConnell\u2019s challenger, Matt Bevin, is interested, but not committed. The group \u201cmet with Dr. Wolf several months ago, and we were very impressed by his knowledge of the issues and passion for committed conservatism,\u201d says its policy director, Daniel Horowitz. \u201cWe\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on this race to see if the grassroots conservatives in the state mobilize behind Dr. Wolf.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, the Senate Conservatives Fund (founded by Jim DeMint), which has been especially active in the movement to defund Obamacare, is keeping an eye on Wolf\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions about this race, but we\u2019re glad Republican voters in Kansas will have a choice,\u201d says Matt Hoskins, SCF executive director. \u201cWe will be watching the race closely to see if Milton Wolf is someone we can endorse.\u201d\n\nNow, Wolf is looking forward.
