But unless you\u2019re receiving a giant subsidy from the government for your insurance, you\u2019re not paying less in premiums, in fact, for employer sponsored plans, premiums have risen nearly $5,000 since Obama promised to cut them. What about deductibles? They haven\u2019t decreased either. But don\u2019t just take my word for it.\n\nA new survey finds that in 2015 deductibles on employer-provided health plans actually rose by almost nine percent.\n\nAccording to a new report by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust, the increase brings the average deductible that workers must pay for their health insurance plans to $1,077; more than triple what it was a decade ago. As reported in the L.A. Times, \u201cThat is seven times faster than wages have risen in the same period.\u201d\n\nKaiser Family Foundation president Drew Altman said, \u201cIt\u2019s a quiet revolution. When deductibles are rising seven times faster than wages \u2026 it means that people can\u2019t pay their rent. \u2026 They can\u2019t buy their gas. They can\u2019t eat.\u201d\n\nAs a comparison, \u201cworkers\u2019 wages increased 1.9% between April 2014 and April 2015, according to federal data analyzed by the report\u2019s authors.\u201d\n\nThe news is also bad for family plans as, the \u201caverage family plan cost workers $4,955, up 3% from last year.\u201d\n\nThis is a significant problem for families trying to make ends meet.\n\nEmployers\u2019 rising health costs are often singled out as a cause for stagnant wage growth in recent years, as businesses have put money into health benefits that might otherwise have gone to workers\u2019 paychecks. There is also growing evidence that the steep rise in deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses such as co-pays are preventing workers from benefiting from the overall slowdown in healthcare cost growth.\n\nEven the left acknowledges that workers are getting the short end of the stick, saying that workers are having the higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs passed on to them from their employers.\n\nUnaffordable deductibles are also emerging as a major issue for health plans being sold on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. The marketplaces, now in their second year, were designed to help people who don\u2019t get health plans through an employer. Most of the nearly 10 million people in marketplace plans qualify for subsidies to offset their premiums, but deductibles in many plans are thousands of dollars.\n\nPeter Lee, executive director of Covered California, the largest state marketplace in the country told the L.A. Times that \u201cDeductibles are a big problem for consumers.\u201d He\u2019s right. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, \u201cThe average deductible for a silver plan on marketplaces nationwide this year is more than $2,500.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re already paying a couple of hundred dollars a month for your mandated health insurance and have a large deductible, you could be out nearly $5,000 before your insurance even kicks in. If you couldn\u2019t afford insurance before ObamaCare, this likely isn\u2019t affordable either. At least before ObamaCare, high deductible policies had low monthly costs, and a wise consumer could save the money they weren\u2019t spending on high premiums. But those plans aren\u2019t ACA compliant and are no longer available.\n\nWith many companies subject to the upcoming \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d in 2018, the health care costs for American workers are likely to continue rising. The promised $2,500 savings is nowhere in sight and this latest survey once again shows that the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d has made health insurance more unaffordable than before.\n\n________________________\n\nKristina Ribali is the Senior Coalitions Director for The Foundation for Government Accountability.
