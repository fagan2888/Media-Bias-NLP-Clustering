Balukoff came out swinging against incumbent GOP Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter on Friday during the first debate between the two candidates.\n\nBalukoff attacked the two-term incumbent for leading Idaho to a low-wage economy, with low educational attainment and numerous government scandals. Otter defended his record, painting a sunnier picture of the state\u2019s economy.\n\nFriday\u2019s debate at the Coeur d\u2019Alene downtown library also featured Libertarian candidate John Bujak and an independent candidate whose legal name is Pro-Life.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve heard Gov. Otter tell us everything is awesome,\u201d said Balukoff, a Boise businessman and chairman of the Boise School District. \u201cHe\u2019s out of touch with regular people.\u201d\n\nBalukoff highlighted statistics that showed that Idaho under Otter had fallen at or near the bottom of all states in average wages, percent of people working for minimum wage, and in the low percentage of students going to college.\n\nBalukoff also said that Otter\u2019s administration had been involved in a series of scandals involving a private prison, the Idaho Transportation Department and an education contract to bring broadband Internet service to Idaho schools. \u201cHis scandals have cost us millions of dollars,\u201d Balukoff said.\n\nBut Otter, a former congressman who has been in elective office since the 1970s, pointed to other studies showing Idaho had low unemployment, a fast-growing number of jobs and decent average household pay. \u201cWe are an independent and self-reliant people,\u201d Otter said, who said he seeks smaller government and maintains a positive attitude about the future.\n\nOtter said he is focused on bringing higher-paying jobs to Idaho, pointing to recent education reforms that will pour more money into elementary and secondary education. \u201cIn the last year, Idaho (jobs) grew faster than all but four states,\u201d Otter said. \u201cWe do a good job of creating an environment for business to thrive.\u201d\n\nPro-Life spent most of his time complaining that a \u201csocialist\u201d government had hijacked the nation and created many of the problems we face. He said reducing the size of government and ending abortions were the keys to prosperity.\n\n\u201cAbortion is murder,\u201d the strawberry farmer said. \u201cPublic education is communism. That\u2019s why our society is messed up.\u201d\n\nBujak, a former Canyon County prosecutor, offered himself as a conservative alternative to Otter.\n\nHe called the governor \u201cBenedict Otter\u201d and accused him of cronyism and corruption in the various scandals. But Bujak said electing a Democrat like Balukoff would just produce four years of gridlock with the GOP-dominated Legislature.\n\n\u201cI am the one conservative candidate who can change the direction for Idaho,\u201d Bujak said.\n\nAsked how he would convince CEOs to move their companies to Idaho, Otter pointed to the state\u2019s strong job growth and said it was already happening.\n\n\u201cWe need a better marketing campaign than tax breaks and we work cheap,\u201d Balukoff replied.\n\nOtter also defending the creation of a state insurance exchange under the Affordable Care Act, saying that at least gave the state control over the market because the Affordable Care Act was the law of the land.\n\nBalukoff agreed creating the insurance exchange was the right move, and he said Idaho should also expand Medicaid coverage to cover 70,000 to 100,000 more low-income people.\n\nAsked why Idaho residents should not be alarmed at low per-pupil spending in public schools, Otter acknowledged that Idaho ranked 49th among the states in that category. But he said Idaho was fourth in the percentage of money from its general fund spent on education, and he pointed to the state\u2019s relatively high scores on standardized tests to show that results were good.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how you spend the money,\u201d Otter said.\n\nBalukoff said the state was near the bottom in the rate of high school graduates who went on to college. That will hurt efforts to create better-paying jobs, he said.\n\n\u201cWe do need to improve our education system,\u201d Balukoff said. The money Otter parked in a rainy day fund and earmarked for tax breaks would have been better spent on schools, he said.\n\nWhile Idaho\u2019s unemployment rate of 4.7 percent in August sounded good, Balukoff said too many of the jobs do not pay a living wage. \u201cWe are No. 1 in the percentage of minimum wage jobs in the United States,\u201d he said.\n\nThree of the candidates said they were not in favor of legalizing marijuana, as neighboring Washington has done. Bujak said he would sign a bill to legalize the drug if passed by the Legislature.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic governor candidate A.J.
