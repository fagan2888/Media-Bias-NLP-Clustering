While she has attended other constitutional law and history seminars in the past, she said she is learning more practical teaching techniques rather than theory.\n\n\u201cThis (conference) has been very beneficial so far regarding the ability to have a big impact with the students,\u201d she said.\n\nAnne Woods, public services manager for the Kansas Bar Association, said the KBA\u2019s Law Related Education Committee chose Sittenauer to attend the conference, saying she is the \u201cperfect example of a teacher who has gone above and beyond to find and use the best resources for her students,\u201d adding that Sittenauer also has been an \u201cinvaluable resource\u201d for KBA\u2019s Law Day and Celebrate Freedom Week.\n\nSittenauer\u2019s conference fees and travel expenses for the summer institute were paid for through a grant from the Kansas Bar Foundation.\n\n\u201cWe are very proud that she was selected and hope her experience provides her and the KBA with new resources and ideas,\u201d Woods said in an email.\n\nIn addition to getting a more behind-the-scenes tour of the U.S. Supreme Court building, Sittenauer said she and her fellow conference attendees have listened to and have been able to ask questions of a solicitor general who has argued 17 cases in front of the Supreme Court justices, a counsel to President Barack Obama, a counsel to a Republican U.S. senator and a deputy clerk of the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nSittenauer said they also will be in the U.S. Supreme Court chamber on Monday for \u201cdecision day.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour decisions will be announced,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one knows (the decisions) in advance. Nobody knows except the justices.\u201d\n\nThe high court on Monday could announce decisions by the justices regarding the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and gay marriage.\n\nAn in-depth exploration of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment \u2014 citizenship rights and equal protection of law \u2014 also is part of the institute\u2019s agenda, Sittenauer said, a topic she enjoys teaching because of new court cases to examine.\n\n\u201cYou try to make it applicable to the students\u2019 lives or it\u2019s hard for them to relate to it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou try to bring in situations that related to constitutional situations in order to bring it alive. I love teaching it because it\u2019s different every semester. With new cases coming out, it just makes it so interesting. Change is good. It keeps you good as a teacher and as a student.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Education, Local, Angela Deines", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The word \"retirement\" isn't in Susan Sittenauer's vocabulary.", "title": "Longtime Seaman educator will be on hand for possible decisions on Obamacare, gay marriage", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2015-06-21/longtime-seaman-educator-will-be-hand-possible-decisions-obamacare-gay-marriage", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/lead_photo/new062215Supremes.JPG", "type": "article"}, "description": "The word \u201cretirement\u201d isn\u2019t in Susan Sittenauer\u2019s vocabulary.After 30 years of teaching history and civil and criminal law at Seaman High School, Sittenauer said she is a lifelong learner and doesn\u2019t plan to leave her chosen profession any time in the near future.Beginning last week and until Tuesday, Sittenauer is attending the Supreme Court Summer Institute for Teachers at the Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C., a program sponsored by Street Law, Inc., a nonprofit organization founded in 1972."}, "article_summary": "Sittenauer said they also will be in the U.S. Supreme Court chamber on Monday for \u201cdecision day.\u201d\u201cFour decisions will be announced,\u201d she said.\nNobody knows except the justices.\u201dThe high court on Monday could announce decisions by the justices regarding the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, and gay marriage.\n\u201cThis (conference) has been very beneficial so far regarding the ability to have a big impact with the students,\u201d she said.\nSittenauer\u2019s conference fees and travel expenses for the summer institute were paid for through a grant from the Kansas Bar Foundation.\n\u201cYou try to make it applicable to the students\u2019 lives or it\u2019s hard for them to relate to it,\u201d she said."}
