Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., voicing their support for the USA Freedom Act, which would end the automatic bulk collection of phone records by the National Security Agency. The letter, which says the bill \u201cpreserves essential intelligence community capabilities,\u201d may help Leahy and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner \u2013 the Wisconsin Republican who drafted the House version of the measure \u2013 navigate the proposal past critics who say it may weaken spying efforts.\n\nSensenbrenner compromised some privacy protections to secure the bill\u2019s passage in the House, where those critics are more numerous.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence support your bill and believe that it is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil liberties and increases transparency,\" Holder and Clapper wrote in the letter.\n\nThe letter also indicates that telecom companies might not have to retain data for a longer period so it can be accessed by the government, which the Obama administration has considered as an option to replace metadata collection by the NSA.\n\n\u201cBased on communications providers\u2019 existing practices in retaining metadata, the bill will retain the essential operational capabilities of the existing bulk telephone metadata program while eliminating bulk collection,\u201d the two officials wrote.\n\n[ALSO: NSA Restrictions Pass House by Large Margin]\n\nThe Freedom Act\u2019s chief obstacle to passage remains in the House, even though the bill passed the chamber in May by a vote of 302-121. If the Senate bill passes, some House members may be reluctant to support a version that has stronger privacy and transparency rules than they originally approved.\n\nThe Senate version of the Freedom Act has been praised by privacy advocates such as the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the White House has urged the Senate to pass the bill.\n\nSensenbrenner has warned Congress may let Section 215 of the Patriot Act expire if the Freedom Act does not become law, which could undercut the NSA\u2019s legal authority to conduct its phone record collection.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Eric Holder, James Clapper Express Support for USA Freedom Act", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The USA Freedom Act gains key supporters as time runs short for its passage.", "title": "Holder, Clapper Back Bill Curbing NSA Surveillance", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/04/eric-holder-james-clapper-express-support-for-usa-freedom-act", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/7f/99/cdfe710541f58e90f0e18c0ddec8/140904-clapper-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The USA Freedom Act gains key supporters as time runs short for its passage.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Eric Holder, James Clapper Express Support for USA Freedom Act"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 4, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Risen,Pulse,picks,Sensenbrenner, Jim,Leahy, Pat,NSA,Obama, Barack,politics,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The USA Freedom Act gains key supporters as time runs short for its passage."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce371\"", "article_summary": "[READ: Privacy-Boosted Freedom Act Introduced in Senate]The two Obama administration officials sent a letter this week to Sen.
