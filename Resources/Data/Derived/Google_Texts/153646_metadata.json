Or like almost no one predicted.\n\nIn a way, it\u2019s a perfect summation of the year to date in ACC play. It\u2019s been fun, crazy, head-scratching, maddening, even facepalm-inducing at times \u2013 but it\u2019s been fun, and one of the best years in the league in recent memory. So just soak it in and enjoy it tonight, no matter what happens, as it ends.\n\nAs we say goodbye to Greensboro for awhile, I give you all\u2026.this, from the special, unique soul of my hometown:\n\nThey say the best part\u2026is in the middle. See you on the flip side, 336.\n\nNO. 3 NOTRE DAME (28-6) VS. NO. 5 NORTH CAROLINA (24-10)\n\nTime: 8:30 p.m.\n\nTV: WRAL/ESPN\n\nRadio: Buzz Sports Radio\n\nTHE BASICS\n\nThis is a game that will probably come down to UNC\u2019s bigs, as it did the first time around. Carolina didn\u2019t shoot well back in that one-point January loss, but they rebounded over half of their misses. Still, Kennedy Meeks and Brice Johnson were a combined 6-of-19 from the field in 44 minutes and had nine rebounds between them.\n\nMeeks fouled out in 17 minutes and Johnson had a lot of trouble guarding Notre Dame\u2019s Pat Connaughton. That will be the matchup to watch, probably: Connaughton had 16 points in the first meeting on 5-of-11 shooting (4-of-7 from three) and nine rebounds, doing what he does as an undersized four and giving opponents fits, while Zach Auguste \u2013 the true big \u2013 had 18 points. Those two shot 11-of-21 and had 15 rebounds. If UNC\u2019s bigs are outplayed by those two yet again \u2013 plus the newly-developed freshman Bonzie Colson \u2013 Notre Dame should win this one going away.\n\nBut a healthier Marcus Paige should help, too \u2013 he led the Tar Heels in scoring in the first meeting, but was just 6-of-17 shooting. Justin Jackson was a non-factor in the first meeting, too, and obviously he\u2019s come a long way. North Carolina is going to have to find some energy reserves from somewhere for their fourth game in four days, and even though Notre Dame had one extra day, the Irish are a bit thinner and have lost two pretty big leads and had to hang on.\n\nThat can be mentally exhausting. As can North Carolina\u2019s end to the last two games, by the way. But still. Both teams have played improved defense in this event, and that, plus how each team exploits its mismatches, will be big keys in this one.\n\nNARRATIVES\n\nNotre Dame Win: Oh wait! We weren\u2019t supposed to win because this is in Greensboro or something. LOL.\n\nHellllloooooooo beautiful! Show me this new world where you are a postseason clutch team.\n\nNotre Dame Loss: Well, um\u2026.you got past the semifinals of a conference tournament. So that\u2019s\u2026something. I guess.\n\nYou wound us, Notre Dame. We thought you were different. We thought you were special.\n\nNorth Carolina Win: What\u2019s that you called North Carolina? Was the word soft or disappointing or what was it weird? I don\u2019t think they can hear you anymore.\n\nYou know what North Carolina, I didn\u2019t even see you there for awhile, but oh my you\u2019re starting to look prett-ay good.\n\nNorth Carolina Loss: Guess it\u2019s back to 'fire Roy,' amirite?\n\n\u200b\n\nThis is also applicable because why would you even and yet you attempted to even\n\nPREDICTION\n\nNorth Carolina, 79-72. Neither result would surprise me, by the way. Just feels like the Tar Heels have found\u2026.something. Which probably means they\u2019ll lose, because any time we think we know an ACC team, they do something weird. Either way, hope it\u2019s a final that lives up to the week that was in the Greensboro finale.\n\nLast week: 10-4 (10-4 ACC)\n\nOverall: 96-44 (95-44 ACC) (8-4 Postseason)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/rss/625&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-03-14 12:28:00", "description": "In a way, Saturday's title game a perfect summation of the year to date in ACC play.
