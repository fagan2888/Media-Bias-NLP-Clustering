This puts us in a strong position for future growth.\"\n\nIn the US the company secured a number of new contracts in the quarter, including a partnership with eHealth Technologies to enable North Dakota Health Information Network to provide medical images to healthcare providers as a part of the state's Health Information Exchange.\n\nOrion continued work with California health information exchange Cal INDEX, providing further software and agreeing an on-boarding program for new health insurance and provider groups.\n\nIn Australia, the Federal Government announced A$485 million of additional funding for the personal My Health Record, which uses Orion software.
