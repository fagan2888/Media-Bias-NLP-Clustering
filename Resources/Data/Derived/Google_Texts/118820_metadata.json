Companies are trying to make smart watches more fashionable like traditional high-end watches, so Motorola aimed for a classy design and partnered with Chicago tannery Horween Leather Company to design the leather wristband.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, is going all out by debuting its new MICA smart bracelet during a fashion show on Sunday organized by Opening Ceremony \u2013 which partnered with the tech giant to create the device. The MICA bracelet \u2013 short for \u201cMy Intelligent Communication Accessory\u201d \u2013 keeps users connected to SMS messages, personal alerts for meetings and other notifications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a statement piece; it\u2019s not so much a piece of technology as it is a beautiful accessory with the added benefit of technology,\u201d says Intel spokeswoman Ellen Healy. \u201cSome of the apps available are still being determined with third parties, so we will announce those before early November.\u201d\n\nIntel debuted its MICA smartwatch at a fashion show on Aug. 31. Courtesy of Collier Schoor\n\nIntel arrived late to the tablet and mobile revolutions that made fortunes for younger rivals Google and Apple, but Intel\u2018s CEO Brian Krzanich has been determined to seize the opportunity of the wearables market. Intel founded its New Devices Group last September, and announced the MICA bracelet at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, where it showcased some of its other prototypes like smart earbuds that track a user\u2019s heart rate.\n\n\"We are entering a new era of computing,\" Krzanich said during the show in January. \"Wearables need to solve problems.\u201d\n\nBut consumers mostly don\u2019t see wearables solving problems that a smartphone doesn't already, says Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, a market analysis group.\n\n\u201cI still think we are very early in the market and wearables will remain niche for the next 12 months at least,\u201d Milanesi says.\n\nThe Intel MICA may change people\u2019s minds about the way wearables could become a part of everyday life the way cell phones have, says Brian Blau, research director at Gartner, a market analysis group.\n\n\u201cIt will help open consumers\u2019 eyes that having a digital capability in items such as jewelry or clothing isn\u2019t so far-fetched or exotic, and one day these types of devices will be commonplace,\u201d Blau says. \u201cOne of the biggest questions today is what will we do with these devices, will they focus on communication, shopping, family or even entertainment, and how will users value them.\u201d\n\nApple\u2019s expected smart watch \u2013 dubbed the \u201ciTime\u201d according to a patent granted to the tech giant \u2013 will likely make use of the new HealthKit mobile health and HomeKit smart home platforms debuted in June.\n\nPatent drawings filed to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office of a potential Apple smartwatch.\n\nCourtesy of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\n\nApple is also trying to make its technology more fashionable following its recent hiring of Angela Ahrendts \u2013 the former chief executive officer of Burberry \u2013 as senior vice president in charge of strategy for retail and online stores. The Intel watch design is targeted more toward women than the Apple watch is like to be, Milanesi says.\n\n\u201cAlthough we have no details on the Apple device I would expect a classy design that appeals both to men and women with a good deal of focus on user experience,\u201d Milanesi says. \u201cIt makes sense to diversify diversify? YES\u200b but price will remain crucial.\u201d\n\nPrice is among the biggest factors for customers when buying a new device, so the cost of Apple\u2019s watch may determine the sales appeal. Samsung sells the Galaxy Gear watch for prices starting at $299, which include a camera on the watch. The Motorola 360 price of $249 may have better luck because it has a more fashion-conscious design and the backing of the Android Wear operating system.\n\nApple may be a late comer to the wearable market, but that may be due to its culture of design perfection that add new kinds of features beyond the status quo, Jonathan Gaw, a research manager at market analysis firm International Data Corporation told U.S. News in a previous interview.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "picks", "title": "Intel, Motorola Watches May Rival Apple's iTime", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A smart watch battle bubbles on the horizon.", "title": "Intel, Motorola Watches May Rival Apple's iTime", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/05/intel-motorola-watches-may-rival-apples-itime", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/98/73/2d47100d42958160be39613aebae/140905-apple-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A smart watch battle bubbles on the horizon.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Intel, Motorola Watches May Rival Apple's iTime"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Sept. 5, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Risen,Pulse,picks", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A smart watch battle bubbles on the horizon."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe214e\"", "article_summary": "The Intel watch design is targeted more toward women than the Apple watch is like to be, Milanesi says.\nCompanies are trying to make smart watches more fashionable like traditional high-end watches, so Motorola aimed for a classy design and partnered with Chicago tannery Horween Leather Company to design the leather wristband.\nIntel, meanwhile, is going all out by debuting its new MICA smart bracelet during a fashion show on Sunday organized by Opening Ceremony \u2013 which partnered with the tech giant to create the device.\nApple may unveil a smart watch next Tuesday \u2013 but competing smart watch makers Intel and Motorola are taking a head start by launching devices crafted by fashion companies that could make consumers begin to see wearables as a must-buy accessory.\nThe Motorola 360 price of $249 may have better luck because it has a more fashion-conscious design and the backing of the Android Wear operating system."}
