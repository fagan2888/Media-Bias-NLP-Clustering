Bobby Jindal issued an executive order that would protect government employees who do not support same-sex marriage.\n\nJindal issued the directive after the state legislature punted on the Louisiana Marriage and Conscience Act, under which state agencies wouldn\u2019t be able to interfere with people who refuse to recognize same-sex marriage due to their religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe idea being that if you have a traditional view of marriage being between a man and a woman, the government cannot sanction you for that,\u201d Jindal tells The Daily Signal. \u201cThe idea being that if you\u2019re a government employee, if you\u2019re a florist, if you\u2019re a retailer, or whatever, that you shouldn\u2019t be punished for believing like I do that marriage is between a man and a woman.\u201d\n\nIn the case of Davis, Jindal\u2019s executive order in Louisiana would have protected her from jail time and the controversy.\n\nJindal admits, however, that what is really needed is action by state legislatures, not just an executive order.\n\n\u201cThe reason I say you need legislation is that as governor, sometimes those executive orders don\u2019t reach into the judiciary. It depends on how the clerks are organized.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Davis wanted Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear to call a special session of the state legislature or issue an executive order that would allow marriage licenses to be issued by the Commonwealth of Kentucky rather than the local clerk\u2019s office. He refused to do either.\n\nAt this point, without an accommodation, Davis is back at work. She\u2019s not issuing licenses herself. Instead, her deputies are doing them, and the actual license itself says \u201cpursuant to federal court order\u201d on it. Davis\u2019 name is not on it, and neither is \u201cRowan County, Kentucky.\u201d The licenses say \u201ccity of Morehead,\u201d the county seat.\n\nJindal says the whole travesty is extremely troubling. \u201cToday, apparently, if you mishandle classified information like Hillary Clinton did, you can run for president. If you don\u2019t believe in marriage you go to jail.
