A legal assistant in the narcotics division of a South Florida prosecutor’s office lost her job after a tip to the Broward County State Attorney’s office that she might be involved in “illegal drug activity.”

A subsequent investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement neither confirmed the tip nor exonerated Ginger Downs. But in an April 2016 interview with a prosecutor, after an immunity grant, the 49-year-old implicated herself.

Downs was fired after 20 years at the prosecutor’s office. “And while information Downs provided cannot be used against her in a criminal case, it can be used to pursue other potential suspects,” assistant state attorney Tim Donnelly said.

The transcript of the interview says Downs admitted to being present with her 53-year-old boyfriend, a convicted drug dealer, during hundreds of transactions he was involved in over the five years of their relationship.

Donnelly asked her, “Why had she done it?” Downs stated that she was intimidated by her boyfriend, and he wanted her to accompany him.

Downs said she never gave any confidential information to him or anyone else. But Downs did admit that she did not tell supervisors at work where wanted drug-dealing suspects could be found.

An investigation by the Broward sheriff’s department is now ongoing.

The state attorney’s office made the firing of Downs public after defense attorney Bill Gelin posted on his JAAB Blog last week about “a rumored scandal concerning the Drug Trafficking Unit, a long time employee, and possibly the handling of search warrants.”

Attorney Eric Schwartzreich represents Downs. He was traveling out of state when asked for a comment.
