Whereas a regular Venezuelan has to line up for hours to get basic goods (when they are available), officers enjoy privileged access to fully stocked supermarkets, new cars, housing, and many other benefits.\n\nThe obvious strategy of the Venezuelan government is to keep the armed forces happy in case it needs them to hold on to power. But the reality is far worse. In fact, Venezuela is now a military regime. Even though President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is a civilian, he is surrounded by people who have donned a uniform: according to Bloomberg, \u201cA third of Venezuela\u2019s 28 ministers and half the state governors are now active or retired officers.\u201d\n\nThe rise in prices is not the only kind of inflation affecting Venezuela. Bloomberg reports that \u201cits military now has between 4,000 and 5,000 generals\u201d for a ratio of one general for every 34 servicemen (in the United States the ratio is one general per 1,490 servicemen). As expected, generals enjoy higher salaries and many other benefits. Moreover, the intelligence community believes that high-ranking army officers control most illegal activities in Venezuela, from smuggling to drug trafficking. In other words, military men are profiteering from the status quo.\n\nAll this points to an unlikely scenario where the armed forces would threaten the continuity of chavismo in power. Just the opposite, the army will be a key actor in propping up the regime, even if Venezuelans decide otherwise in the polls.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Venezuela is now a military regime.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Venezuela is now a military regime.", "title": "Venezuela: A Military Regime", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/venezuela-military-regime", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/venezuela-military-regime", "creator": "@CatoInstitute", "description": "Venezuela is now a military regime.", "card": "summary", "title": "Venezuela: A Military Regime"}, "site": "Cato Institute", "robots": "noodp", "node_creation_date": "2014/9/29", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2014/9/29", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-29T15:30:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf37a\"", "article_summary": "In fact, Venezuela is now a military regime.\nMoreover, the intelligence community believes that high-ranking army officers control most illegal activities in Venezuela, from smuggling to drug trafficking.\nBloomberg has a story today on the many perks that the Venezuelan army enjoys vis-\u00e0-vis the downtrodden civilian population.\nJust the opposite, the army will be a key actor in propping up the regime, even if Venezuelans decide otherwise in the polls.\nIn other words, military men are profiteering from the status quo."}
