I mean really, what else could be the theme for this week’s photo/cartoon roundup? This week’s beatdown of the Democratic Party was the most epic since . . . 2010, or 1994, or 1980, or 1966, or 1946, or 1938, etc. I have a field theory that swing voters fall for the blandishments of liberalism, until they see the results, at which point they reverse course and yell “Stop!” Republicans have really bad elections from time to time (2006, 1974), but they are usually tied to specific events.
