REUTERS/Joshua Roberts\n\n4627378\n\nDo you feel like America has gone crazy?\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s outrageous decisions in the Obamacare and same-sex marriage cases, in which the Court simply ignored the plain meanings of words and the Constitution, and thumbed its nose at the most basic facts of life, are only the latest examples of our nation turning its back on truth and common sense.\n\nUnder the influence of \u201cprogressive\u201d fanatics, we\u2019re suffering from a progressive pathology that\u2019s tearing our nation apart.\n\nIn their quest to redefine \u201cnormal,\u201d they are tearing up America\u2019s morality by the roots. They\u2019re forcing America to abandon God\u2019s standards of right and wrong, and in consequence our society is becoming increasingly unmoored from reality.\n\nThe progressive war on truth\n\n\n\nWhen did lying become accepted practice in public life? Not too long after kids started coming home from college \u2014 and high school \u2014 prattling about \u201cmy truth\u201d and \u201cyour truth.\u201d\n\nTruth is, by definition, objective and universal. Rejecting this fundamental principle leads people to do \u201cwhat is right in their own eyes,\u201d as the Bible puts it, and enables them to play fast and loose with the rules.\n\nCraig Livingstone, keeper of the illegally obtained FBI files during the Clinton administration, reportedly told a colleague, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? Truth is whatever you want it to be.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons didn\u2019t invent political lying, but they surely brought it to new lows. Nevertheless, there was still some expectation back in the 90s that politicians ought to tell the truth.\n\nNot so much nowadays. The nation placidly goes about its business as revelations emerge about the Obama administration lying continuously, almost compulsively, about virtually anything, in pursuit of political advantage. Here is a handful of examples that represent the Obama administration\u2019s line on many of the leading public policy issues:\n\nThe Benghazi massacre was a spontaneous event triggered by an obscure video, not a carefully planned Muslim terrorist attack of which we had advance warning.\n\nIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.\n\n\u201cUnder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions, and federal conscience laws will remain in place.\u201d\n\nThe fence between the U.S. and Mexico is \u201cpractically complete.\u201d\n\nCommon sense voter ID laws constitute \u201csuppression\u201d of minority voters.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the present administration views lying as an essential hammer in their political tool chest.\n\nThe progressive war on reality\n\nThe war on truth is rapidly devolving into a war on reality itself. Perhaps it\u2019s inevitable that when you abandon the plain black and white of truth and falsehood, you lose the ability to discern what is real and what is not. Never have I seen an administration pursue so many policies that fly in the face of common sense, and even demand that we deny reality that\u2019s as plain as the nose on your face:\n\nThe Fort Hood massacre was \u201cworkplace violence,\u201d not Muslim terrorism.\n\nWe offend our allies deliberately, and kowtow to enemies who intend to destroy us.President Obama just announced that families of hostages will no longer be prosecuted for paying ransom, increasing the odds that more Americans will be kidnapped by terrorists.\n\nWe help Iran obtain nuclear weapons, putting Israel and the rest of the world at risk.\n\nWe withdraw prematurely from Iran and Afghanistan, effectively giving those countries back to the Muslim jihadists.\n\nWe protect Muslims around the world, while allowing Muslims to slaughter Christians throughout the Islamic world.\n\nAt home, police are vilified, and criminals are exalted.\n\nThe government spending spree continues, even as our towering debt promises to deliver us into fiscal Armageddon.Social Security Disability is about to go broke, and Medicare and Social Security are not far behind.\n\nWe pander to troubled people trying to change their sex through hormones and mutilating surgery.In reality, transgender \u201cwomen\u201d are still men, and \u201cmen\u201d are still women. At best, sex reassignment surgery turns men into eunuchs, and women into God knows what. Facebook now recognizes more than 50 \u201cgenders,\u201d as if people can declare their sex to be whatever they imagine.\n\nWe virtually eliminate our southern border, handcuff our border agents, and actively foster illegal immigration, when the nation is facing suffocating unemployment.Illegals have become a de facto protected class.\n\nAnd we lie about unemployment statistics, concealing half or more of the actual unemployment.\n\nThe progressive war on resisters\n\nYou\u2019d better think twice before you tell the truth about the emperor\u2019s new clothes. Progressives are using the power of government to force society to go along with the insanity.\n\nThis goes on wherever progressives hold power. Politically correct speech codes have been enforced on American college campuses for decades, where conservative and Christian students and faculty are routinely discriminated against and decried as \u201chaters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ken Blackwell", "description": "The war on truth is rapidly devolving into a war on reality itself.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Do you feel like America has gone crazy?
