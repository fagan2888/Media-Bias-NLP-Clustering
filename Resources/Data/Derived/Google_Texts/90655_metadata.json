It will be difficult to defeat ISIL without military strikes from someone like Turkey,\" he said.\n\nAbu Khaled al-Walid, an activist speaking from the border area, said many fighters from Ahrar al-Sham, one of the most powerful Islamist groups, chose not to confront ISIL because the combatants were local people with little enmity for each other.\n\n\"Many did not see a point in fighting their own relatives. ISIL is now in control of 95 percent of Raqqa and its rural environs. Tel Abyad is also back with it,\" he said.\n\n\"NUCLEUS OF THE CALIPHATE\"\n\nRaqqa, on the Euphrates River 385 km (240 miles) northeast of Damascus, is the most significant city to have fallen completely to Assad's opponents since the revolt against his family's four-decade rule broke out in March 2011.\n\nAn ISIL statement called on Raqqa tribes to pull out their members from anti-ISIL rebel units and said the attacks against the group were designed to \"destroy the nucleus of the caliphate\" and promote a \"heathen\" alternative.\n\nISIL pulled out of Raqqa and other towns in northern Syria this month after an Islamist rebel alliance attacked its strongholds, taking advantage of growing popular resentment of the group's foreign commanders, their killing of other rebels and a drive to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nBut ISIL has regrouped in the last few days, using snipers, truck-mounted commando units and suicide bombers.\n\nOpposition sources said the expertise of its foreign commanders, including a senior figure known as Omar al-Shishani, had been crucial to its advance.\n\nIn the province of Aleppo west of Raqqa, activists said ISIL had regained several rural towns, including Hreitan and Basraton, where ISIL killed a senior commander in the Nour al-Din Zanki brigades, a key unit in the newly-formed Mujahideen Army, which has been fighting ISIL in Aleppo.\n\nFighting also raged on Sunday between Western-backed Free Syrian Army units around the town of Retayan near Aleppo and in Urum to the east, as rebel infighting made the city vulnerable to advances by Assad's forces, the sources said.\n\nAbdallah al-Sheikh, an activist in northern Syria, said Assad's forces had began bombarding areas from which ISIL had withdrawn, such as the town of Maarat Misreen and parts of Aleppo city.\n\n\"ISIL have been doing Assad a huge favor by killing many of the formidable rebel commanders and the regime has chosen to help it by not touching many of the areas it had taken. As soon as it withdrew, the bombing resumed,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Alexander Dziadosz; editing by Andrew Roche)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Khaled Yacoub Oweis", "Author": "Khaled Yacoub Oweis", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "A group linked to al Qaeda recaptured much of its stronghold in the northeast Syrian city of Raqqa on Sunday, activists said, dealing a blow to rival rebel groups backed by Gulf Arab and Western states.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "Group linked to al Qaeda regains ground in northeast Syria", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
