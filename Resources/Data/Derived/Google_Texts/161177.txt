Well, I can finally make my big announcement. It’s been over a year since I’ve been on the radio. And I have been put down, I’ve been ripped off, I have been cut open, and now I am unleashed!

And nobody’s going to stop me, because I’m taking my show off of terrestrial radio and onto the digital domain.

Introducing … Rusty Humphries’ Rebellion Radio, brought to you by The Washington Times. New episodes each Thursday!
