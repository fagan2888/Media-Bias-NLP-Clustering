CC By 2.0\n\nA Texas Congressman this week attacked Obamacare in what appeared to be a trifecta of libertarian fears and passions, including socialized medicine, funding for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and a vague suspicion of an emerging \"armed\" health force deployable for international emergencies.\n\nAmong those skeptical of claims made Tuesday by Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Republican, would be left-wing journalists and the Blue State \u201csheeple\u201d under their hypnotic spell, some conservatives say. Speaking to a wide conservative audience, Gohmert appeared on Janet Mefferd\u2019s Christian radio program retweeted by InfoWars.com, one of the world\u2019s top 1,000 websites with more than 2.6 million monthly U.S. visitors.\n\nIn the attack on Obamacare, Gohmert parsed language from the Affordable Care Act, whose text includes 234,812 words, in addition to more than 20,000 pages of administrative regulation. Referring to language discussing \u201cthe president\u2019s own commissioned and noncommissioned officer corps,\u201d Gohmert warned that the new law gives the federal government greater powers to declare a form of medical martial law in the event of a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d\n\nUnder the new law, the U.S. Public Health Service\u2019s Ready Reserve Corps is directed to \u201cassist full-time Commissioned Corps personnel to meet both routine public health and emergency response missions.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gohmert took issue with the apparent exclusion of one word among those 234,812 words in the original law.\n\n\u201cIt says it is for international health crises, but then it doesn\u2019t include the word \u2018health\u2019 when it talks about national emergencies,\u201d Gohmert said. \u201cI\u2019ve asked, what kind of training are they getting\u2026 I want to know are they using weapons to train, or are they being taught to use syringes and health care items?\u201d\n\nGohmert added that he\u2019s received \u201cno clear answers\u201d yet regarding his suspicions about Obamacare. The congressman linked his concerns about possible medical martial law with a recent federal contract from Homeland Security to buy 750 million rounds of bullets, a procurement the government says is intended for more than 90 law enforcement agencies over a period of five years.\n\n\u201cSome kind of secret security force is something the United States is never supposed to have\u2026 but until we get enough members of Congress stirred up over the things I\u2019ve been preaching about then we\u2019re not likely to get answers,\u201d Gohmert said.\n\nHowever, the U.S. Public Health Service might appear a bit less sinister on closer examination, according to FactCheck.org.\n\nThe new law merely hires more doctors and other health professionals to serve the country in the event of a public health crisis, such as the devastation wreaked by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which killed more than 1,800 Americans. In that crisis response, the U.S. depended partially upon personnel from Mexico's military for help in the American Southwest. Prior to passage of Obamacare, the public health service employed around 2,800 full-time doctors, nurses, scientists, and other professionals, with a reserve force similar to the U.S. Army National Guard. Now, the service will gain more full-time, uniformed employees.\n\nThe uniformed health service will also likely gain a new leader in the coming week when President Barack Obama nominates Vivek Hallegere Murthy, a 36-year-old attending physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, to succeed acting surgeon general Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak, NBC News reported Thursday. Murthy, also affiliated with Harvard Medical School, is co-founder and president of Doctors for America, a Washington-based group of 16,000 doctors and medical students advocating for affordable health care.\n\nBelow is an audio recording of the interview with Rep. Gohmert, uploaded Tuesday to YouTube:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "obamacare martial law, medical martial law, medical conspiracy theories, u.s. ready reserve, dhs martial law", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Obamacare authorizes the U.S. Public Health Service to hire more full-time doctors, nurses, researchers, and other medical professionals.
