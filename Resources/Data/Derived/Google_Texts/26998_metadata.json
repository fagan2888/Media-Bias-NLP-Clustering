Scott Walker backed away from his proposal to eliminate language that is basic to the longstanding \u201cWisconsin Idea.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Wisconsin State Journal, the Republican governor\u2013recently talked about as a popular potential 2016 presidential candidate\u2013had proposed striking the words \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201chuman condition\u201d from the longstanding Wisconsin Idea. The utopian principle, developed in 1904, asserts the state\u2019s public universities should exist to serve all the people of the state and to seek the truth. Instead, Walker wants the university system to focus on workforce development, a concept that has grown more popular among establishment Republicans such as Jeb Bush and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, and is an idea reinforced by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWorkforce development or \u201cSchool-to-Work\u201d (STW) is closely linked, as well, to the Common Core standards, which experts have said have \u201cdumbed down\u201d expectations with regards to English literature and advanced math\u2013both considered unnecessary for basic workforce development.\n\nThough on Wednesday Walker\u2019s spokeswoman, Laurel Patrick, reportedly blamed the inclusion of the language changes in the proposed state budget on a \u201cdrafting error,\u201d earlier the same day, Walker said he would change the \u201cfocus\u201d of the University of Wisconsin System.\n\n\u201cThe focus would be honed in, in particular to look at making sure that we prepare individuals in this state\u2013be they fresh out of high school or coming back later in life\u2013for the jobs and opportunities that are available in the state,\u201d Governor Walker said.\n\nThe Journal observes:\n\nThe changes Walker had quietly proposed\u2013he didn\u2019t mention them in his budget address--would have gutted a mission formed more than a century earlier. It\u2019s just one paragraph deep in state law but has proudly defined Wisconsin universities as anchored to the communities they serve statewide and has distinguished the University of Wisconsin System from competitors nationally. Walker\u2019s proposed changes to the Wisconsin Idea would have struck passages about state outreach, improving the human condition and pursuing truth, in favor of more narrowly defining state campuses as agents of workforce development.\n\nWalker would have replaced longstanding language in the Wisconsin Idea with an addition to the opening sentence that identified the university\u2019s responsibility to serve as drivers of the economy. He would have added the phrase \u201cto meet the state\u2019s workforce needs\u201d to a sentence regarding the development of human resources.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Walker said the notion of replacing existing language in the Wisconsin Idea was a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d between his office and the budget staff.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, when my office told the budget staff to keep it simple, they took that to mean that we only wanted workforce readiness language in the mission when we really wanted the language added to the existing mission statement,\u201d Walker said in the statement. \u201cThey also responded to UW staff that this change was not open for discussion because they were told to keep it simple and only add in workforce readiness language.\u201d\n\nWisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) said\u2013prior to Walker\u2019s decision to retreat from the changes\u2013he would not have supported them.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s going to be a rewrite of the mission statement of the University of Wisconsin, there must be a robust public discussion before any changes are made,\u201d Vos said.\n\nSimilarly, Rep. Dave Murphy (R) said the University of Wisconsin System \u201cis meant to train thinkers, not only workers. I do not support changing a long-held tradition such as the Wisconsin Idea without substantial public input and discourse.\u201d\n\nWith the creation of the highly unpopular Common Core standards, Americans are now faced with a choice between schools and universities essentially run by progressive teachers\u2019 unions and faculty, and infected with curricula reflecting leftist ideology, versus schools run by the Big Business model of \u201cworkforce development.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Pence testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee, during which he touted that his state \u201coffer[s] new pathways to success for all of Indiana\u2019s students through enhanced career and technical education opportunities.\u201d\n\nThough Pence states that \u201cat its heart, education in this country is, and should be, primarily a state and local function,\u201d he also admits \u201cIndiana is using federal, as well as state, resources in this endeavor, and we are grateful for the flexibilities provided in the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act that became law last year.\u201d\n\nKirsten Lombard, editor of Common Ground on Common Core: Voices from across the Political Spectrum Expose the Realities of the Common Core State Standards (available at resoundingbooks.org), said Pence\u2019s \u201cnew pathways\u201d to restore career technical education are not \u201cnew\u201d at all, but have been around since the passage of the federal School-to-Work (STW) Opportunities Act of 1994.\n\n\u201cWhere the true customers for education should be the parent and the child, STW programs have replaced them with government and business, increasingly making of the classroom a career-tracking and a labor-fulfillment center,\u201d Lombard told Breitbart News. \u201cAs a result, where we used to talk about equipping children to determine their own futures through real and solid education, we now talk almost exclusively about strengthening the workforce through education and ensuring that our classrooms are producing students ready to work.\u201d\n\nLombard explained that elected officials are often careful today to refer to job training in classroom settings as \u201ceducation,\u201d so as not to \u201cruffle the feathers of citizens who object to business using government schools to deliver future workers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that, in a truly free society, business takes care of itself,\u201d Lombard said. \u201cNeither the state nor the federal government has any legitimate role in either facilitating or managing the job training of private enterprise.\u201d\n\n\u201cGov. Pence says the role of the federal government should be limited,\u201d she stated, adding:\n\nThis from a man who pulled a bait-and-switch by handing the people of his state what amounts to a \u201crebrand\u201d of the deeply coercive Common Core standards. It strikes me that the governor has a fundamental lack of understanding about how to keep government out of the lives of individuals.\n\nLombard observed Americans often allow themselves to be fooled by \u201cworkforce development\u201d and \u201cschool-to-work\u201d language because it has the sound of the private sector and business.\n\n\u201cThe American people need to stop buying the rhetoric that such STW initiatives are free-market solutions,\u201d she said. \u201cThey belong firmly in the realm of planned economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUntil we as a people firmly reject the premise that government has a role in assisting business with the acquisition of workers, we will continue to be entrenched in policies and programs that unethically predetermine the pathways that will be open to our children,\u201d Lombard added. \u201cDon\u2019t children have the right to choose their own unique course in life by making what they will of a full range of opportunities\u2013not just the ones that suit Big Government and Big Business?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Wednesday, Wisconsin Gov.
