That seat is currently held by Collene Lamonte, D-Montague, who has been challenged by Holly Hughes, the Republican who Lamonte ousted in 2012.\n\nJager, 55, is married to Holton Township trustee Tammy Jager. He is a co-owner of Press's Demolition. Jager currently sits on the board of the Holton Community Center, he said. He ran as a Republican for the Muskegon Commission in 2010 and won, but lost the seat two years later to another sitting county commissioner, Democrat Jim Derezinski, when they were pitted against each other by redistricting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in it to win it,\u201d he said of his upcoming run for the House of Representatives. \u201cWhether I win or not, I want to put my name out there.\u201d\n\nJager said he has a goal of eventually running for governor. In that vein, he had been planning the run for the House of Representatives for at least a year and had previously considered running against Holly Hughes in the Republican Primary. His divergent opinions \u2013 for gay marriage, against the affordable health care act, for marijuana legalization, for gun rights \u2013 were ripe for a run as independent, though.\n\nMichigan Republicans have been a turn-off, he said.\n\n\u201cI think Goeff Hansen\u2019s vote on (Medicaid expansion) finished it off for me,\u201d Jager said. \u201cDave Agema doesn\u2019t help me, either, with his stance on gay marriage.\u201d\n\nHis run as an independent won\u2019t be looked on with much favor by Republican party leaders. An independent candidate who drew part of the Republican vote is part of the reason Hughes narrowly lost to Lamonte in the last race, Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics has said.\n\n\u201cI have friends that are not happy, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Jager said. \u201cThey see that Holly could possibly win it.\u201d\n\nHe said his candidacy is not just about torpedoing the Republican candidate. He also thinks he can draw the votes of some Democrats, some of whom may want a leaner government.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of them that are tired of the fees,\u201d said Jager, who also is planning to push for gay marriage and legalization of marijuana.\n\nJager has put up a Facebook page for campaign work, and is now concentrating on getting enough signatures to put his name on the ballot next to Hughes and Lamonte.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no difference to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care which one\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\nStephen Kloosterman covers local government, employment and the outdoors for MLive Muskegon Chronicle.
