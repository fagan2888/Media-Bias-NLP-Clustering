Three members of the Colorado State football staff, wide receivers coach Alvis Whitted, special-teams coach Jeff Hammerschmidt and football operations director Tom Ehlers, have been retained by newly hired CSU coach Mike Bobo, the Mountain West school announced Friday.

Also, Bobo announced that he hired Ronnie Letson to be the CSU quarterbacks coach.

Letson had served as Georgia’s director of player personnel since June. He was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Jacksonville (Ala.) State from 2004-12.

Bobo was a longtime offensive coordinator at Georgia before being named CSU head coach Dec. 22. Bobo was a record-setting quarterback for Georgia in the 1990s.

“I am excited to bring Ronnie and his family to Colorado State,” Bobo said in a CSU news release. “He did a great job in his time at Georgia, and he brings experience and an outstanding offensive mind to our staff.”

Whitted was the coach for Rashard Higgins, who was a consensus All-American and a Biletnikoff Award finalist. Higgins set single-season CSU records for receptions (96), receiving yards (1,750) and receiving touchdowns (17).

Hammerschmidt was hired by then-CSU coach Jim McElwain in 2012 after coaching four seasons at Arizona as the Wildcats’ special-teams coordinator and defensive ends coach.

Ehlers, a CSU lineman during his playing days, is in his 11th year as director of operations for his alma mater. He was a CSU assistant coach from 1989-2004 prior to becoming director of operations.

Previously, Bobo announced that CSU defensive coach Marty English would be retained.
