He said he was not at his residence and declined to disclose his whereabouts.\n\nSam-Sumana was expelled from the ruling All People\u2019s Congress political party last week, accused of \u201corchestrating political violence\u201d and trying to form a new party in his home district of Kono, located in the country\u2019s Eastern Province.\n\nPHOTOS: What are the chances?\n\nUpon hearing that soldiers were heading to his home Saturday morning, Sam-Sumana said he tried and failed to contact President Ernest Bai Koroma. Instead, he said he reached top officials at the presidential guard who informed him his security team was being disarmed on orders from the president.\n\nSam-Sumana said he then called U.S. Ambassador John Hoover and requested asylum. \u201cThey\u2019re having a meeting and they will get back to me,\u201d the vice president said.\n\nU.S. embassy spokeswoman Hollyn Green said Saturday that embassy officials, including Hoover, had \u201cseen the news\u201d but could not provide any reaction.\n\n\u201cThere is no comment at the moment and there is no action on our part,\u201d Green said.\n\nGreen confirmed Saturday afternoon that Sam-Sumana was not in the U.S. embassy in Freetown.\n\nA government spokesman said he could not immediately comment on the situation.\n\nAt the time of Sam-Sumana\u2019s expulsion from the ruling party, an announcement read out on state media accused him of \u201charboring a group of thugs\u201d while preparing to foment unrest. \u201cThe decision was taken to preserve the integrity of the party and discourage political violence in the country,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSam-Sumana is currently under Ebola quarantine after a member of his security team died of the disease, which has ravaged Sierra Leone.\n\nDespite his expulsion from the party and his quarantine, he officially remained vice president, meaning responsibility for running the country falls to him if Koroma travels abroad.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sierra Leone's vice president sought asylum from the United States on Saturday, saying he no longer felt safe in the country after soldiers disarmed the security team at his residence.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Sierra Leone\u2019s vice president sought asylum from the United States on Saturday, saying he no longer felt safe in the country after soldiers disarmed the security team at his residence.", "title": "Samuel Sam-Sumana, Sierra Leone\u2019s vice president, asks U.S. for asylum: \u2018I don\u2019t feel safe\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/14/samuel-sam-sumana-sierra-leones-vice-president-ask/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/14/Sierra_Leone_Vice_President.JPEG-0a81f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/03/14/Sierra_Leone_Vice_President.JPEG-0a81f.jpg", "description": "Sierra Leone's vice president sought asylum from the United States on Saturday, saying he no longer felt safe in the country after soldiers disarmed the security team at his residence.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Samuel Sam-Sumana, Sierra Leone\u2019s vice president, asks U.S. for"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Samuel Sam Sumana, Ernest Bai Koroma, Sierra Leone, Freetown"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde90\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe this morning as vice president,\u201d Samuel Sam-Sumana told The Associated Press by phone.\nFREETOWN, Sierra Leone \u2014 Sierra Leone\u2019s vice president sought asylum from the United States on Saturday, saying he no longer felt safe in the country after soldiers disarmed the security team at his residence.\n\u201cThey\u2019re having a meeting and they will get back to me,\u201d the vice president said.\nSam-Sumana is currently under Ebola quarantine after a member of his security team died of the disease, which has ravaged Sierra Leone.\nInstead, he said he reached top officials at the presidential guard who informed him his security team was being disarmed on orders from the president."}
