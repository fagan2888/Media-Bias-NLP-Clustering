But as Renee Montagne explains, the idea that lemmings commit mass suicide is a myth.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nAnd now we have this note as we continue America's most comprehensive coverage of the government shutdown. We have this morning, a scientific clarification about lemmings. Last week, you may recall a Republican lawmaker called his colleagues lemmings. He meant his fellow Republicans were following Senator Ted Cruz on a disastrous mission that led to the government shutdown.\n\nLemmings supposedly follow each other over a cliff. But we have learned - NPR has learned - that lemming mass suicide is a myth.\n\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\n\nScientists say that while lemmings will sometimes jump into a body of water as a traveling pack, and some will perish, those deaths are accidental - lemmings can swim. The notion of the furry, little rodents following each other mindlessly off a cliff, to certain death, was popularized by 1958 Oscar-winning Disney documentary called \"White Wilderness.\"\n\nINSKEEP: An investigation years later, showed that the lemming suicide scene in that movie was faked. Disney faking something? Anyway, they were herded by the filmmakers off a cliff. We are now told that most lemmings survived.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF A SONG)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Singing) I am a lemming and I've got some advice...\n\nINSKEEP: It's NPR News.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2013 NPR.
