Sunny Pine, 13-year-old eighth-grader at Boulder's Manhattan Middle School

Sunny exemplifies a great Manhattan student. She's a student mentor who helps the sixth-graders through the school's 360 leadership program. She's kind to others and a great friend. She's someone kids can trust. She's a great leader.

What are you most looking forward to about eighth-grade?

We have more freedom in the school. We know how to get around and we have more connections. We're competent.

Why did you want to be a mentor to younger students?

I get to look after younger students and help them out. I want to be a good role model and build leadership skills.

What advice would you give sixth-graders?

Really be yourself. Middle school is a good place to express yourself and figure out who you are. Be open to making new friends and be flexible.

What should they not do?

Don't do something that you know is wrong or that you're uncomfortable with.

What do you like about Manhattan?

There are good teachers here. I'm not doing it, but the school has an arts focus. They're setting up kids for what they want to do later in life. They can build on their talents.

What would you change?

For kids who don't focus on the arts, they could have more elective options.

What's your favorite subject?

I really like Spanish and math.

What makes a good teacher?

Humor and friendliness. Having your own opinions, but letting students have their own opinions, too.

What do you like to do outside school?

I play soccer for FC Boulder. I started playing soccer when I was really little. It's my passion and what I'm good at.
