When the merger is completed, the investor will exchange the stock of the company being acquired for the deal consideration.\n\nIn the case of the Cigna\u2013Anthem merger, Anthem (ANTM) is buying Cigna (CI) for a headline amount of $188 a share, comprised of 0.5152 shares of Anthem and $103.40 in cash. Due to the serious antitrust risks involved, the deal will take a long time to complete. It will probably close around the end of 2016.\n\nBased on prices as of the close on Monday, July 27, the spread is trading at $35.55 or about 24% gross. The annualized return is almost 16%. This means that if an investor bought Cigna and shorted Anthem at the correct ratio and waited for the deal to close, they would make 16.5%, assuming the deal closes at the end of 2016. This spread indicates a deal with substantial risks.\n\nNote the dividend treatment is unusual in this transaction. Cigna pays a 4 cent per share annual dividend, and Anthem pays 62.5 cents quarterly. The agreement allows for Cigna to match Anthem\u2019s dividend to its own shareholders. This means the negative dividend carry is eliminated.\n\nObamacare changed the game\n\nGiven that Obamacare limits profits on individual plans, the way for health insurers to increase profitability is to cut administrative costs. The easiest way to do that is by combining or reducing duplicate or redundant administrative and corporate functions.\n\nLarger insurers also have more negotiating leverage with hospitals and other health care providers. And finally, to enhance profitability, these companies should diversify their operations, as we know the government will be parsimonious with rate increases.\n\nThis deal is about scale, synergies, and diversification.\n\nOther merger arbitrage resources\n\nOther important deals include the Humana (HUM)\u2013Aetna (AET) transaction, which is slated to close in late 2016.
