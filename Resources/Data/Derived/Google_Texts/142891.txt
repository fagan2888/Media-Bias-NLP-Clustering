EDITOR: I met Mike Lukas under the most tragic circumstances. He became the lead detective investigating my husband Pat Zemke's murder. When Mike took over the case, it was three years after the murder, and at the time there was little hope that my husband's tragic death would ever have the justice that deserved.

When Mike first came to see the family, he assured my daughter, Heather, that he would do whatever he could in his power to find her father's killer. Mike worked tirelessly on the case until the day came when in his heart, he knew who was responsible for Pat's murder. I believe that without Mike's hard work and dedication to the case, it would not have been solved and we never would have brought the family and my husband justice.

With Mike Lukas as sheriff, Portage County would not only have the person best qualified but would also have the most caring and dedicated sheriff they would ever need or want.

Anna Zemke,
