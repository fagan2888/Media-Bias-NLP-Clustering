Elliott Elementary in Irving, Texas. \u201cThe reality is that any citizen that disagrees with your administration is targeted and ridiculed.\u201d\n\nRitter added that he was afraid to write the president in the first place because he believed he could face \u201cretribution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched you make fun of tea baggers and your press secretary make fun of Ms. [Sarah] Palin which was especially beneath the dignity of the White House,\u201d Ritter closed. \u201cDo the right thing not the political thing. Suggest a bill that Americans can support.\u201d\n\nThe president replied to Ritter on official White House stationary by saying that he appreciated his \u201cconcern about the toxic political environment right now.\n\n\u201cI do have to challenge you, though, on the notion that any citizen that disagrees with me has been \u2018targeted and ridiculed\u2019 or that I have \u2018made fun\u2019 of tea baggers,\u201d the president replied, echoing Ritter\u2019s use of the derogatory term applied to conservatives who identify with the tea party.\n\n\u201c[I] defend strongly the right of everyone to speak their mind \u2014 including those who call me \u2018socialist\u2019 or worse,\u201d Obama continued.\n\nRitter put the letter up for sale on MomentsInTime.com and told the Post that he is doing so because he is disappointed with the president and the ACA. \u201cThe president told me what he thought I wanted to hear,\u201d Ritter told Post reporters. \u201cThe letter is just words on a paper. It doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because Obama doesn\u2019t mean any of it.\u201d\n\nThe Blaze was told that the letter is \u201cabsolutely\u201d real when they contacted MomentsInTime.com to verify its authenticity.\n\n[h/t The Blaze]\n\n[Featured image via FoxNews.com]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n> >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to a report in The New York Post, President Barack Obama responded to a letter he received from a Texas school teacher who was concerned about the", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obama3.jpg", "title": "Obama Allegedly Wrote \u2018Tea Baggers\u2019 in Handwritten Letter"}, "twitter": {"description": "According to a report in The New York Post, President Barack Obama responded to a letter he received from a Texas school teacher who was concerned about the negative impact the Affordable Care Act may have on the president\u2019s political position by referring to conservative Americans as \u201ctea baggers.\u201d", "title": "Obama Allegedly Wrote 'Tea Baggers' in Handwritten Letter", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obama3.jpg", "creator": "@noahcrothman@twitter.com", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2013-11-27T11:30:59+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe president told me what he thought I wanted to hear,\u201d Ritter told Post reporters.\n\u201c[I] defend strongly the right of everyone to speak their mind \u2014 including those who call me \u2018socialist\u2019 or worse,\u201d Obama continued.\nIt doesn\u2019t mean anything to me because Obama doesn\u2019t mean any of it.\u201dThe Blaze was told that the letter is \u201cabsolutely\u201d real when they contacted MomentsInTime.com to verify its authenticity.\nRitter put the letter up for sale on MomentsInTime.com and told the Post that he is doing so because he is disappointed with the president and the ACA.\n\u201cDo the right thing not the political thing."}
