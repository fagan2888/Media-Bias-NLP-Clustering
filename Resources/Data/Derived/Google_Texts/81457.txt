The world-renowned Rust College A'Cappella Choir put on a stunning program to help one local church Sunday afternoon.

Rust College's Choir is respected world-wide for its musical talent, and the singers today were introduced by former choir member, Newscenter 11's own John Johnson. The Wesley Chapel United Methodist Church brought the choir to Meridian as part of a fundraising program.

"Wesley Chapel used this as a fundraiser, but at the same time, we are here already and learning, and we are so in awe of their performance here today," Gloria McAlpine from Wesley Chapel United Methodist says.

All the money raised will benefit the church's reconstruction efforts.
