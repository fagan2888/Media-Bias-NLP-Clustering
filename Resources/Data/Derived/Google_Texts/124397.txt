Aberdeen, SD

Construction is right on track at a cancer center in Aberdeen that will be named for legendary college basketball coach Don Meyer and his wife.



Construction for the $13.5 million Don and Carmen Meyer Center of Excellence is on schedule to be completed by November. The center will be home to the Avera Cancer Institute.



The facility will have 27,500 square feet on a single floor, nearly triple the size of the current cancer facility. It could be expanded to four floors in the future. It will be outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment and will expand available services.



Meyer was one of the winningest coaches in college basketball history. He died in May after a long battle with cancer, at the age of 69.
