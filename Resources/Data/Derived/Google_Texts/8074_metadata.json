(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n4752398\n\nIt\u2019s an Obamacare story with every imaginable outrage \u2014 blatant conflicts of interest, millions of tax dollars going to political cronies, thousands of Americans left without health insurance, lavish pay for incompetent executives, federal funds diverted illegally, multiple congressional investigations, insider trading convictions and big decisions made behind closed doors.\n\nTragically, there is even a child abuser. But search the New York Times web site for \u201cObamacare co-ops\u201d and nothing comes up. Just three entries appear for the same search on the Washington Post web site.\n\nNot so for Richard Pollock of the Daily Caller News Foundation\u2019s Investigative Group. Pollock has filed dozens of stories about the Obamacare co-ops since 23 of the tax-funded groups were created in 2011 at a cost of $2 billion. President Obama promised the co-ops would help lower medical costs by competing with profit-driven private companies.\n\nSeven of the co-ops have closed. A recent report by the Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General said the rest of the co-ops are in deep financial trouble and more are expected to close.\n\nNone of these dismal developments come as a surprise to those following Pollock\u2019s byline for the past four years. Here are a dozen of his most significant co-op stories, some of which were reported when he worked for the Washington Examiner.\n\nFollow Mark on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
