Spross and Isquith may be unable to identify a reformocon constituency right now, but that does not mean one will not develop. It certainly doesn\u2019t mean that they should give up on their party, as Spross suggests. And if you look closely, you can see where that constituency could lie: the Tea Party.\n\nIn the winter edition of National Affairs, Michael Needham, the CEO of Heritage Action, argues that the intraparty fights over the past few years have been productive for the Republican Party. \u201cThose eager to shake up the stale agenda of the Republican Party do their cause no service by standing on the sidelines or opposing the Tea Party\u2019s efforts; in this fight, reformers of all stripes must hope the Tea Party wins,\u201d he writes. Needham is not just any Republican. He is one of the most powerful Tea Party leaders, and Heritage Action is, in The Washington Post's words, \u201cD.C.\u2019s toughest arbiter of conservatism\u201d\u2014so tough that some House Republicans \"are peeved that it's so difficult to score well on the group's vote ratings.\"\n\nNeedham sees reform conservatism as a key ally of the Tea Party. He lavishes praise on Douthat and Salam\u2019s 2008 book and calls Lee and Rubio \u201camong the most innovative policy entrepreneurs among congressional Republicans.\u201d He even goes so far as to support Rubio and Lee\u2019s tax plan, which has angered some on the right by using money to expand the Child Tax Credit instead of focusing solely on cutting marginal tax rates. \u201cThe need for fresher ideas than marginal tax-rate reductions and platitudes about regulation and the size of government is not clear to [establishment Republicans], due not to poor motives but to a lack of reflection,\u201d he writes.\n\nWhile Needham seems to support the Lee-Rubio plan, convincing the remainder of the Tea Party to follow his lead will not be easy. After all, Republican presidential candidates have a bad habit of proposing wildly unrealistic, sometimes mathematically impossible tax plans. That\u2019s why many on the right think a flat tax is a legitimate option for tax reform. Any policy that raises revenue is dead on arrival\u2014and anything that increases spending is unacceptable, or at the very least requires a spending offset.\n\nSpross see this as a key reason why reformocons should join the Democrats. \u201cThey will be friendlier to the multiple different ways of paying for the [tax] credits,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn short, the Democrats' coalition provides the reformicons with a menu of different possible policy alliances and compromises that the GOP simply does not.\u201d But this gives the Tea Party too little credit and imagines far more overlap between the Democratic and reformocon agendas than actually exists. The Tea Party, as Needham writes, sees government as rigged for the rich and for big corporations. The policy solutions that flow from that generally involve shrinking government in irresponsible ways (more on that below). But both the Tea Party and reformocons want antipoverty spending to be efficient and work-friendly. Democrats largely want to raise taxes on the rich, such as by increasing the capital gains rate, to pay for different policies.\n\nTo be clear, the reformocons have a long way to go. They\u2019ve made it onto the national stage and have convinced some key Republican figures that their ideas are best. But it\u2019s a whole different game to convince the base of that\u2014the Tea Party, specifically.\n\nWhile Needham\u2019s essay demonstrates how the Tea Party\u2019s interests can be closely aligned with those of reform conservatives, it also reveals the reformocons\u2019 biggest challenge: governing responsibly without endangering that Tea Party support. If the Tea Party has proven anything during the Obama presidency, it is that they cannot govern responsibly. Needham\u2019s essay reinforces that.\n\n\u201cThe general perspective of the establishment is that, with a few exceptions, it is \u2018brinksmanship\u2019 to force conflicts over conservative policy,\u201d he writes, \u201cespecially on must-pass legislation.\u201d I don\u2019t know why Needham put brinksmanship in quotes. The Tea Party\u2019s position on the debt ceiling, in particular, has been quintessential brinksmanship. But Needham is blind to how dangerous and politically toxic these tactics are. He even believes that the 2013 government shutdown was a success for the GOP:\n\nAnd on the most controversial of all these fights \u2014 the effort to defund Obamacare \u2014 the failure to achieve immediate success obscured the important long-term victory secured in the process: that the Tea Party successfully forced Republican office-holders to recommit to repeal in the post-2012 landscape and forced the media to treat the law's status as a live issue rather than a settled policy matter. Obamacare opponents are far better positioned to achieve their goals as a result.\n\nNone of that is true. Obamacare was not a focal point of the midterms, and the media largely treats it a settled issue (with the exception of the upcoming Supreme Court case). In fact, the effort to defund Obamacare was a disaster, sending the party's approval rating shooting downward.\n\nNeedham points to last summer\u2019s fight over legislation to address the border crisis as the most substantial Tea Party victory that resulted from these brinksmanship tactics. In that, House conservatives killed legislation that would have provided additional resources for the Department of Homeland Security to deal with the thousands of unaccompanied minors crossing the Southwest border. Republican leadership instead worked with Tea Party members and the House eventually passed legislation to address the crisis while also rolling back President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 executive action on immigration.\n\nNeedham is right that conservatives won that fight. But that wasn\u2019t a fight over must-pass legislation. The Senate left town without passing anything and the border crisis dissipated, in no small part thanks to actions by the Obama administration. The fact that the fight was not over must-pass legislation is exactly what allowed the Tea Party to win. Otherwise, House Speaker John Boehner would have eventually had to compromise with Democrats, whether on the debt ceiling or government funding bill. That\u2019s how governing works when neither party has full control over government.\n\nWhile Needham and the Tea Party seem unable to understand this, the reformocons largely are not interested in picking these fights. As Republicans debated their strategy on the debt ceiling in 2013, Salam argued that they should tie it to passage of the Keystone pipeline. \u201cI am sympathetic to the view that we should not have a statutory debt limit,\u201d he wrote. Ponnuru argued that Republicans should use the leverage that comes along with the debt ceiling but wanted to insulate the economy from consequences of breaching it by allowing the Treasury to make debt-service payments. This is in sharp contrast to the Tea Party\u2019s defund Obamacare strategy. Many on the far right even view a default as a good thing.\n\nIf reformocons want to turn their ideas into laws, they\u2019ll have to govern without shutting down the government and bringing us to the brink of default. But it\u2019s not clear that they can adopt such a legislative strategy without alienating the Tea Party at the same time. And if that\u2019s the case, then Spross and Isquith will prove correct: the reformocons won\u2019t have a committed constituency. But it\u2019s far too early to declare that.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In 2008, Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam, two young conservative writers, argued in their book Grand New Party&nbsp;that the Republican Party needed a new agenda that focused on working class Americans.
