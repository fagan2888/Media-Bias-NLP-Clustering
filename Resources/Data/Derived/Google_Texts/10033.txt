Moments after showing new video of Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber calling American voters “stupid,” Megyn Kelly went off on the “deception” and “fraud” that went in to pushing Obamacare in a clash with Democratic pollster Bernard Whitman.

Kelly said that Gruber’s comments basically amount to “It’s all BS! We had to do it to get this law passed!” Whitman argued that while Gruber might be expert in his field, “he’s a political idiot.” He argued that the Affordable Care Act has actually done a lot of what what promised.

But Kelly wouldn’t let up, hammering away at the lack of transparency and burying her head in her hands when Whitman told her “everyone knew what they were getting” during the public debate over the health care law.

Kelly cried, “They rely on people that lie to our faces!”
