Supporters willing to pay $200 ($25 for students) attended last night\u2019s rally held at the National Guard Armory on Eggerts Crossing Road.\n\nImpact on the community included slowed traffic patterns and schedule adjustments of the nearby Lawrence Intermediate School.\n\nProtesters assembled along Eggerts Crossing Road, as early as 3:30 p.m., shouting \u201cNo hate in my state\u201d and \u201cDeport Trump.\u201d Occasionally, they were encouraged by cars beeping in support.\n\nLawrenceville residents, Areta Parle and Frank Goccia, were among the many locals holding signs protesting Trump\u2019s visit. Parle was compelled to come and \u201cspeak out against Trump\u2019s misogyny,\u201d while Frank Goccia said that, \u201cDonald Trump is dividing the nation.\u201d A fellow resident stood on the opposite side of Eggerts Crossing Road holding a sign in support of Trump but was afraid to give her name because a protester had said that he wanted to \u201ckick her butt\u201d.\n\nInside the Armory, supporters listened to speeches made by State Senators Joseph Pennacchio and Michael Doherty, Hamilton Township Mayor Kelly Yaede, and Governor Chris Christie. At 7 p.m., the Republican presidential candidate took the stage.\n\nTrump spoke to a spirited crowd wearing star spangled bandanas, red hats, and Trump t-shirts. Pulsing chants of \u201cBuild that wall\u201d, \u201cU.S.A,\u201d and \u201cWe want Trump\u201d reverberated. And, amidst promises to repeal Obamacare, terminate the Common Core Curriculum, and assurance of building a military \u201cso big and so strong and so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us,\u201d applause frequently erupted.\n\nFirst-time voters Marissa Gabriele, Mark Chesler, Pamela Stratton, Haig Bakhtiarian, and Val Kudryashob traveled from Rutgers University-New Brunswick because they \u201clove Trump, love the movement, and wanted to see him speak.\u201d When asked what they thought about Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign promise to provide free college tuition, Kudryashob expressed concern that students wouldn\u2019t \u201cbe as motivated to go to college\u201d if it was free. \u201cLoans,\u201d he said, \u201cgives me the incentive to work hard and make sure I have a good GPA\u201d.\n\nBy the time supporters left the Armory, the savvy businessman who sold Philly pretzels to the crowd outside was long gone, along with most of the protesters. Left were a few frustrated, enraged people who shouted through the Armory\u2019s metal fence at Trump supporters, who returned insults.\n\nThe rally\u2019s impact on the small town of Lawrenceville remains to be seen. As residents, divided last night by Eggerts Crossing Road and opinions on how to \u201cmake America great\u201d, walked home, the anonymous Trump supporter, voiced her firm belief that she and her neighbor, a registered Democrat, would continue to be friends.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Angela Jacobs", "og": {"site_name": "MercerMe.com", "description": "To a full house of supporters, Donald Trump announced that Governor Christie\u2019s $400,690 presidential campaign debt had been paid off by ticket sales.
