Ted Cruz announced, rather unoriginally, that God speaks through the Bible. Cruz p\u00e8re has declared that the Bible establishes criteria for political electability. Sarah Palin dreams of enacting Biblical law in the United States, and ponders her own biblical magnitude.\n\nFaith-fiend Rowan County (Kentucky) clerk Kim Davis purports to be defending \u201cbiblical marriage\u201d by refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but she would do well to check and see just what biblical matrimony actually looks like. Even Hillary Clinton looks at the Bible and thinks \u201cIt\u2019s alive!\u201d and has apparently spent a lot of time studying it.\n\nThese politicians are hardly alone in supersizing the Good Book\u2019s stature. The masses throughout history have used their cash and credit cards to assert the Bible\u2019s primacy; they have, in fact, made it the best-selling book of all time, though Guinness World Records commits the unpardonable error of listing it in the non-fiction category. Fantasy would have been a better choice, if fantasy of a particularly absurdist bent.\n\nYes, absurdist. The Bible is brimming with rank absurdities that insult our intelligence and affront our dignity as twenty-first-century, post-Enlightenment humans residing in one of the most developed countries on Earth.\n\nSuch absurdities include, exempli gratia, the following:\n\n1. Our soi-disant \u201csavior\u201d was born not following intercourse between a man and a woman, but as a result of God \u201cdebauching\u201d (to use Thomas Paine\u2019s word) an unconsenting (per Matthew) virgin two millennia ago. (By today\u2019s standards, Mary would be entitled to file sexual assault charges against the Lord, all the more so since He, according to the Bible, must have been at least four thousand years her senior, and occupied a position of authority over her. Imagine the settlement she could get!)\n\n2. This \u201csavior\u201d derived his standing from his filial relationship to an invisible, inaudible, altogether undetectable supernatural being we now understand would have to hover above us in the minus-455-degree-Fahrenheit vacuum of outer space that exists beyond the Earth\u2019s Thermosphere, a region formerly known as \u201cheaven.\u201d\n\n3. Said \u201csavior\u201d wandered about Middle Eastern territory under Roman occupation allegedly performing scientifically impossible deeds (raising people from the dead, sashaying across a body of H2O, influencing meteorological phenomena, curing chronic diseases in an era before sanitary wipes, and so on).\n\n4. A thrice-repeated ornithological omen presaged betrayal of said \u201csavior,\u201d who then, after a supper with close associates (known now as \u201capostles\u201d) that involved the ingestion of flour-based baked goods and grape alcohol, suffered an unspeakably ghastly death, and yet managed to resuscitate himself and officiate at a number of colloquies with the aforementioned associates.\n\n5. Bizarrely, and certainly suspiciously, not one of the \u201csavior\u2019s\u201d close associates thought to publish memoirs of said colloquies or even take notes, thereby leaving the so-called Word, purportedly critical for the salvation of our species, to be recorded by unknown scribes decades later. Worse, the \u201csavior\u201d spoke Aramaic and probably some Hebrew, but his eventual, long-after-the-factoid biographers wrote in Koine (common) Greek. The result: a mishmash of inconsistent accounts (the Gospels) that were composed in a language other than the original, and eventually translated into English, that, beautiful as it may be in the King James version, is nevertheless replete with errors. Subsequent interpretations may have eliminated some of these mistakes, but not the contradictions in the Gospels.\n\n(One wonders, as an aside, if Jesus were really such an up-to-snuff savior, couldn\u2019t he have vetted his apostles a bit more thoroughly?)\n\nIt outrages common sense to be asked to accept the Bible, bristling with improbable inanities and known inconsistencies, as authoritative in any way \u2014 and much less as some sort of public-policy guidebook. An inevitable question arises as to the Lord\u2019s competence: If He was so smart, why would He have chosen to communicate with us through such a shoddily composed tome? And a lot of time has passed. Given all the confusion and conflict nowadays over religious matters, why hasn\u2019t He issued an updated edition? Why doesn\u2019t He at least have His own website or Facebook page? He doesn\u2019t even tweet! Some Lord.\n\nSeriously, though, it insults our intelligence to be enjoined to believe, now that we have split the atom, discovered the Higgs Boson, and sent a probe to Pluto, in the veracity of a supernatural account of the origins of our cosmos.\n\nIt insults our intelligence to be enjoined to believe, now that we have mapped the human genome and fathomed our manifest kinship to other species of the animal kingdom, that a supernatural being verbally conjured us into existence.\n\nIt insults our intelligence that we are expected to believe, even venerate, all the rubbish found in the Bible, a book written \u2014 no one disputes \u2014 by mere humans. After all, humans have always been self-interested, and given to exaggeration, confabulation and outright lying. Who\u2019s to say that the authors of the Bible didn\u2019t just make it all up?", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The Art of the Deal\" might be real but historians think less of the Bible's veracity.
