× AG John Suthers to run for mayor of Colorado Springs

DENVER — Colorado Attorney General John Suthers wants to run for mayor of Colorado Springs.

According to the Gazette newspaper, Suthers, 62, has been pondering whether to run for months.

His announcement Tuesday morning comes one day after El Paso County Commissioner Amy Lathen said she will also run for mayor.

Suthers, who is term-limited after serving as attorney general for eight years, said he grew up in Colorado Springs and feels a strong connection to the community.

Suthers was appointed Attorney General in 2005 after Ken Salazar was elected to the U.S. Senate.

He won reelection in 2006 and 2010 and recently became a controversial figure with his opposition to clerks and recorder’s offices in Boulder, Denver and El Paso counties issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.

That stance, along with his decision to have Colorado join other states in the lawsuit that attempted to overturn the Affordable Care Act, should endear him to voters in the conservative Colorado Springs.

Last year, Suthers was also named as a potential gubernatorial candidate but was never interested in that race, noting the potential conflict of serving as Gov. John Hickenlooper’s official lawyer while campaigning against him.

The mayors job in his home town was likely the plan all along.
