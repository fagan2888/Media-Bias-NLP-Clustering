He\u2019s got that kind of access now that he\u2019s been appointed the United Nations\u2019 latest \u201cMessenger for Peace.\u201d\n\nIf you have not seen Leo\u2019s speech, it\u2019s quite a remarkable dramatic performance \u2013 and we should expect nothing less from the star of \u201cCritters 3\u201d and other fine films. Catch the video and run-down of Leo\u2019s speech at Newsbusters. The bearded actor (and we can only hope that face sweater is for an upcoming role, and not a style choice) offered a new wrinkle outside the usual list of doom and gloom.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cThis disaster has grown beyond the choices that individuals make. This is now about our industries and governments around the world taking decisive, large-scale action.\u201d\n\nThat is an awful convenient stance for a guy who owns at least four homes, took a private jet to New York, arrived at the rally in a limo and likes to party on an eight-story, 500-foot-long yacht that he rents from \u2026 wait for it \u2026 an oil-soaked Arab billionaire. I kid you not.\n\nLeo may be part of the 0.01 percent, but he\u2019s also in the minority of only 20 percent of Americanswho think \u201cthe debate is over\u201d about human-caused global warming. Most Americans rightly find themselves in the global warming \u201cskeptic\u201d camp \u2014 despite decades of propaganda by the media, public schools, and Hollywood actors like Leo saying human activity has caused a climate crisis.\n\nTo ease Leo\u2019s mind, here are five reasons why he and the rest of us need not be so worried about the climate \u2013 let alone take \u201cdecisive, large-scale action\u201d that will make life miserable for the other 99.98 percent.\n\nGlobal Warming Stopped in 1997\n\nGlobal temperatures rose through most of the 20th century, about 0.9 degrees Celsius. But for nearly the last 18 years, global surface temperatures have flatlined. In fact, some satellite measurements have even indicated a slight cooling trend. This has happened despite humans spewing out more than 100 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere since 2000. To put that figure in perspective, humans have emitted roughly 400 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere since 1750. So a quarter of all human emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution have occurred this century. And yet \u2026no warming since \u201cTitanic\u201d came out. This is good news, Leo! You can take your private jet from LA to New York even if all you want is a slice of pizza.\n\nExtreme Weather Events Have Actually Decreased\n\nAl Gore promised in his Oscar-winning 2006 film \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth\u201d that the earth was going to experience a sharp increase in severe weather because of man-caused global warming. So \u2026 have we experienced more frequent and violent tornadoes in the U.S.? Nope. Indeed, the number of powerful tornadoes has declined since the 1970s peak. Every single day sets a new record for a Category 3 hurricane failing to hit the U.S. And how about wildfires? Those are burning bigger and hotter every year, consuming more and more acreage, right? Again, no.\n\nRemember these facts the next time severe weather does strike somewhere. That\u2019s not happening because man angered the weather gods. It\u2019s happening because it happens \u2026 and less frequently now than is normal.\n\nSea-Level Rise is Not Accelerating\n\nThe seas began to rise at the beginning of the end of the last Ice Age about 20,000 years ago. At its peak \u2013 when the many-miles-thick glaciers that covered a lot of the Northern Hemisphere were melting \u2013 sea-level rise was about 10 mm per year. Since we don\u2019t have nearly as much ice to melt today (thank goodness), sea-level rise is not going to exceed that pace \u2013 let alone make coastal cities uninhabitable, as Gore and DiCaprio often say. Indeed, the pace of sea-level rise has been about 1 mm per year for most of the last century, and it is not accelerating.\n\nFun fact: Sea levels were actually higher than today in recorded history.\n\nThe Ice Caps Are Fine\n\nThe amount of ice on the earth\u2019s poles has decreased dramatically since the last ice age ended, but not all that much since. Humans were not able to measure polar ice levels from space until the 1970s, when the first satellites to observe the poles went into orbit. So when you hear that 2012 marked the lowest level of Arctic ice \u201cever recorded,\u201d that actually means \u201csince \u2018Dirty Harry\u2019 was in theaters.\u201d\n\nIn fact, 2014 is turning out to be a \u201crecovery summer\u201d for Arctic ice, up 43 percent from the recorded low of 2012. Gore, you might remember, predicted this would be the year we\u2019d see our first ice-free Arctic. But Gore gets a lot of things wrong, so that\u2019s hardly surprising.\n\nMeanwhile, down at the South Pole, there\u2019s even better news for ice fans. Antarctic polar ice extentkeeps setting new records. Will someone think of the penguins! Now they have to walk farther to reach the water to feed.\n\nCarbon Dioxide Is Not a Pollutant, but is Good for Plants and Animals\n\nThis is a radical, but correct supposition: Carbon dioxide is good for the planet.\n\nFirst of all, CO2 is not a pollutant. What you see in most of those photos of smokestacks in magazines and newspapers is steam released after most of the harmful particulates have been filtered out. Carbon dioxide, which is in that steam, is harmless to humans \u2014 but what plants need to keep greening the planet.\n\nAs we all learned in 8th grade, CO2 is also what makes plants grow. Back in the early \u201990s, Sting (who was at the NYC climate march with Leo) got some attention for singing about how we need to save the forests. Satellite data shows that the earth has actually been increasing the density of its forest cover for the last 30 years, and counting. Nice work, Sting!\n\nThe CO2 level in the atmosphere today is about 400 ppm, give or take. That puts the earth in the \u201csafe zone\u201d for keeping agriculture thriving. At 150 ppm, plants start dying. Human CO2 emissions are actually helping plant life and agriculture thrive \u2014 a great boon to humanity, especially in the developing world. Dr. Patrick Moore, one of the founding members of Greenpeace, explains this fact well (especially for laymen) during this presentation at The Heartland Institute\u2019s latest climate conference.\n\nOne more fact about CO2 levels: They were higher than 2000 ppm during past ice ages.\n\nI don\u2019t expect to see any of these inconvenient facts in Leo\u2019s latest horror flick \u201cCarbon,\u201d to be ignored by the masses in a theater or website near you. He\u2019s in the make-believe business. The rest of us should stay grounded in reality.\n\n[First published at Hollywood in Toto.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/09/5-reasons-leonardo-dicaprio-can-stop-worrying-about-the-climate/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Leonardo-DiCaprio-United-Nations.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "5 Reasons Leonardo DiCaprio Can Stop Worrying About the Climate"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcdd\"", "article_summary": "Leonardo DiCaprio last weekend participated in the \u201cPeople\u2019s Climate March\u201d in New York City and followed it up with an address to the United Nations.\nOne more fact about CO2 levels: They were higher than 2000 ppm during past ice ages.\n\u201cTo be clear, this is not about just telling people to change their light bulbs or to buy a hybrid car,\u201d DiCaprio said.\nTo put that figure in perspective, humans have emitted roughly 400 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere since 1750.\nHuman CO2 emissions are actually helping plant life and agriculture thrive \u2014 a great boon to humanity, especially in the developing world."}
