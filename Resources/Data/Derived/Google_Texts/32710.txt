A sharp rise and fall in the water level from the Gulf of Mexico in Naples indicates a small meteotsunami occurred during Sunday morning's severe weather in Southwest Florida.

Water level data recorded by the National Weather Service indicates just after 5:00 a.m. Sunday, as a tornado-warned storm moving eastward at nearly 60 mph slammed the shoreline, water levels rose sharply in the Naples to more than 7 feet.

Typically at its highest point during a high tide cycle, the water depth tops out around 4 feet.

After the peak of more than 7 feet, water level observations show a sharp drop after the initial wave's passage.

According to the NWS the definition of a meteotsunami is a tsunami sparked by "air pressure disturbances often associated with fast moving weather systems, such as squall lines. These disturbances can generate waves in the ocean that travel at the same speed as the overhead weather system."

The severe thunderstorm producing the meteotsunami in Naples on Sunday caused widespread wind damage in Collier County.

A peak wind gust of 84 mph was recorded at Naples Municipal Airport, and damage assessment from the NWS reveals damage consistent with wind speeds between 80 and 90 mph.

According to NWS, while uncommon, meteotsunamis are well documented and occur a few times a year in Florida.
