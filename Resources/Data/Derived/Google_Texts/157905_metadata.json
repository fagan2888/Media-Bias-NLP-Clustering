In a message to supporters, Ward relayed, \u201cI am receiving huge support from the grassroots.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWard promised supporters, \u201cI would run to give Arizona a powerful voice in the fight against Obamacare\u201d and would \u201cstand up for the enforcement of our immigration laws and to secure the border.\u201d In a March interview with Breitbart News, Ward reminded the public of McCain\u2019s 2010 campaign promise to \u201cbuild the danged fence,\u201d a promise that has not been fulfilled.\n\nHer letter continues:\n\nI would run to support the Constitution, smaller government and individual liberty. I would run as a positive, passionate, principled non-career politician. I would run to join a fresh, new generation of leaders in DC and end the stronghold that career politicians have had on our government for decades. I would run to be the voice that so many Arizonans long for from their representation in the US Senate. I would run to be your voice.\n\nShe welcomes prayers, comments and advice while laying out her plans to \u201ccontinue to travel the state to meet and listen to voters.\u201d\n\nWard closed her announcement, stating:\n\nInformed, motivated voters lead the way to restore government of, for, and by the people. If we want Arizona represented in DC and not DC represented in Arizona, it is up to all of us. Success will take time, motivation, hard work, and money. Financial support is imperative in a David and Goliath battle.\n\nConservative Republican Club of Kingman President Larry Schiff said of Ward, \u201cI have often heard of her described as a rising star.\u201d Schiff previously suggested Ward would need $10 million to overcome the McCain political machine, a task not insurmountable, given McCain\u2019s diminished campaign war chest. A 2014 year end FEC report listed a campaign committee balance of $2 million.\n\nJust days ago, McCain announced that he will run for re-election to the Senate seat he has held for over three decades. Within hours of the announcement, conservative groups began detailing McCain\u2019s record, giving him a failing grade and rallying grassroots and financial support for a potential McCain challenger.\n\nIn recent years, dissatisfaction with McCain has grown, Arizona Republicans formally censuring the Senator for liberal views. McCain allegedly lashed back to the censure, reportedly \u201cengaging in an aggressive and systematic campaign to reshape the state GOP apparatus by ridding it of conservative firebrands and replacing them with steadfast allies.\u201d Politico reported that after his censure, the Senator sought to \u201cunseat conservative activists who hold obscure, but influential, local party offices.\u201d\n\nLeading up to his announcement, McCain appeared concerned about weakness, pushing hard for contributions in an email to potential supporters: \u201cI\u2019m going to be the target of a wide array of powerful groups.\u201d He told them he would face a \u201cunique set of challenges.\u201d\n\nMcCain has acknowledged that he expects to face a primary challenge.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona State Senator Kelli Ward (R-Lake Havasu City) announced early Thursday she is officially exploring a 2016 run for the U.S. Senate.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Arizona State Senator Kelli Ward (R-Lake Havasu City) announced early Thursday she is officially exploring a 2016 run for the U.S. Senate.", "title": "State Sen.
