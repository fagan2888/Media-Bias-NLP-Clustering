Wolf later reported this:\n\n#USC A.D. Pat Haden said he did not see LenDale White after the game or have him kicked out of Coliseum \u2014 InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 19, 2014\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why White was kicked out, but it\u2019s worth noting that a week ago he had some choice words for USC defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox during the team\u2019s win at Arizona.\n\n\u201cLame a** prevent defense will do it to u eveytime. Justin Wilcox u stink. Ur play calling is absolutely f****** horrible,\u201d White tweeted, among other expletives.\n\nWhite, a running back at South High in Denver and later Chatfield Senior High in Littleton, was named the Gatorade Colorado Player of the Year in 2002 and finished his career as the state\u2019s all-time leading rusher with 7,802 yards. (The record was broken in 2003 by Kyle Bell of Weld Central.)\n\nWhite went on to play three seasons at USC, alongside Reggie Bush, before declaring for the 2006 NFL draft. He was selected in the second round (45th overall) by the Titans, but poor conditioning and off-the-field issues led to a short pro career. He last played for the Broncos, but after tearing his Achilles\u2019 and sitting out the entire 2010 season, he was released in the summer of 2011.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Colorado,Justin Wilcox,LenDale White,Los Angeles,Southern California", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Field House", "description": "After being escorted out of Saturday's USC-CU game, former Colorado prep standout and USC running back LenDale White took to Twitter to blame Pat Haden and call him a coward.", "title": "LenDale White escorted out of USC-CU game, calls out AD Pat Haden", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/10/18/lendale-white-kicked-out-usc-cu-pat-haden/31976/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/10/93344781-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "After being escorted out of Saturday's USC-CU game, former Colorado prep standout and USC running back LenDale White took to Twitter to blame Pat Haden and call him a coward.", "title": "LenDale White kicked out of USC-CU game, calls out AD Pat Haden", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/2014/10/18/lendale-white-kicked-out-usc-cu-pat-haden/31976/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/colleges/files/2014/10/93344781-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@nickijhabvala", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "After being escorted out of Saturday's USC-CU game, former Colorado prep standout and USC running back LenDale White took to Twitter to blame Pat Haden and call him a coward."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e3e\"", "article_summary": "White was escorted out of the game and he quickly took to Twitter to call out USC athletic director Pat Haden for the incident.\nFormer Colorado prep standout and Southern California running back LenDale White was in attendance for the Trojans\u2019 blowout win over CU at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday.\nScott Wolf, Los Angeles Daily News\u2019 USC writer, reported that White yelled he was 41-2 as a player at USC as he was be escorted out.\nI can't believe @ADHadenUSC kicked me out of #thecoli shook my hand then had me escorted out.\nWhite went on to play three seasons at USC, alongside Reggie Bush, before declaring for the 2006 NFL draft."}
