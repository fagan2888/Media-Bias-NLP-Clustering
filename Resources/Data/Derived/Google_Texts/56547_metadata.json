If the Governor succeeds in his plan, he will consolidate power in his office at the expense of the independently elected state Attorney General.\n\nThe state court should reject the Governor\u2019s plea for intervention, a plea that is more political than legal in its arguments for court intervention. If the Governor wins his gamble, the real losers are the people of Colorado.\n\nThere is far more at stake in this dispute than Colorado\u2019s participation in the 27-state lawsuit against the EPA\u2019s \u201cClean Power Plan.\u201d If the elected Attorney General cannot have a legal opinion different from the Governor on a federal regulatory issue, that office might as well be filled by appointment. That is the logical progression from the Governor\u2019s attempted amputation of the Attorney General\u2019s independent legal authority, and it is absurd on its face.\n\nThere is ample legal and historical precedent for the Attorney General\u2019s participation in a lawsuit without the Governor\u2019s assent. In a 2003 case, Salazar v. Davidson, the Colorado Supreme Court held that the state constitution granted the Attorney General independent authority to bring lawsuits on behalf of the State despite the Governor\u2019s objection. In 2003, Republican Governor Owens made the same arguments Democrat Governor Hickenlooper is making today, and he lost. The Governor also seems to have forgotten that in 2010, AG John Suthers joined 24 other states in an historic federal lawsuit against Obamacare that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Can anyone imagine that AG John Suthers asked Gov. Bill Ritter\u2019s permission to join that lawsuit?\n\nThe Governor\u2019s assertion that AG Coffman is acting on partisan motives is oddly ironic. Has the Governor not read liberal Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Tribe\u2019s March 2015 congressional testimony saying the EPA\u2019s carbon emission rules are illegal and unconstitutional? And hasn\u2019t he noticed that two of the other state Attorney General plaintiffs joining Coffman in the lawsuit \u2013 in Missouri and Kentucky\u2013 are Democrats?\n\nThe multi-state lawsuit AG Coffman has joined is not about politics, it is about unlawful regulatory overreach. It does not challenge the goals of the \u201cClean Power Plan,\u201d it challenges EPA\u2019s authority to impose that plan without congressional authorization.\n\nThis question goes to the very heart of the rule of law: regulatory agencies like the EPA can only make rules within the framework of laws enacted by Congress, and when they go beyond that, they are acting unlawfully. There is nothing \u201cpartisan\u201d about that issue.\n\nThe independent authority vested in the Attorney General plays an important role in the functioning of Colorado\u2019s state government by ensuring a check-and-balance on the Governor\u2019s \u201csupreme\u201d authority. The Governor is our chief executive officer, not our king, and both our public health and our environment are better served by the rule of law over the rule of good intentions.\n\nIf the 27 state plaintiffs win the lawsuit and the EPA is told by the US Supreme Court to stand down, Colorado is a winner, not a loser. That is because Colorado could still proceed to implement those same EPA goals \u2014 but only if it is a Colorado decision, not a Washington top-down mandate. Colorado could then choose carbon emission reduction goals on its own timetable \u2014 with appropriate reviews and safeguards adopted by Colorado\u2019s elected representatives, not unaccountable federal bureaucrats.\n\nOur Attorney General has chosen to stand up for the constitutional separation of powers and Colorado\u2019s sovereignty, while our Governor chooses to be a cheerleader for the EPA\u2019s very costly and legally dubious mandates.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to choose sides on this one.\n\nCadman represents Colorado State Senate District 12. As Senate President, he represents the voice of the Colorado Senate Republican Caucus.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Governor is our chief executive officer, not our king.", "generator": "WPZOOM Framework 1.4.6", "og": {"site_name": "Complete Colorado - Page Two", "description": "The Governor is our chief executive officer, not our king.", "title": "Guest op-ed: Why is Governor Hickenlooper obstructing Attorney General Coffman?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/LawsGavel3resized.jpg", "height": 1050}, "url": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/2015/11/13/guest-op-ed-why-is-governor-hickenlooper-obstructing-attorney-general-coffman/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 221004171379840}, "keywords": "Attorney General Cynthia Coffman,Attorney General John Suthers,Environmental Protection Agency,Governor John Hickenlooper,", "article": {"section": "Constitutional Law", "tag": "Governor John Hickenlooper", "published_time": "2015-11-13T18:46:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-15T17:37:21+00:00", "author": "http://completecolorado.com/pagetwo/author/admin/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Governor Hickenlooper is asking the state Supreme Court to block the ability of state Attorney General Cynthia Coffman to enter lawsuits without the Governor\u2019s permission.\nIf the Governor succeeds in his plan, he will consolidate power in his office at the expense of the independently elected state Attorney General.\nAnd hasn\u2019t he noticed that two of the other state Attorney General plaintiffs joining Coffman in the lawsuit \u2013 in Missouri and Kentucky\u2013 are Democrats?\nThe independent authority vested in the Attorney General plays an important role in the functioning of Colorado\u2019s state government by ensuring a check-and-balance on the Governor\u2019s \u201csupreme\u201d authority.\nThe state court should reject the Governor\u2019s plea for intervention, a plea that is more political than legal in its arguments for court intervention."}
