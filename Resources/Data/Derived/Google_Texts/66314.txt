A La Plata County man is in jail after repeatedly beating a woman with a cast iron skillet while holding her captive in her house for two days, the sheriff’s office reported.

Edward Venteroso, 46, is being held on $25,000 bail on first-degree assault, violation of a protection order, false imprisonment and obstructing telephone service, according to a La Plata County Sheriff’s Office report.

When deputies arrived at 7 a.m. Wednesday at a County Road 318 home, a 55-year-old woman fell out the front door, the report said. The bloodied and semi-conscious woman fell on her hands and knees and begged deputies for help.

Venteroso, who lived on the woman’s property, had a restraining order that barred contact with the woman, the sheriff’s office said. But he entered her house Tuesday and assaulted her multiple times.

He also allegedly damaged her phone to keep her from calling 911 and refused to allow her to leave or seek medical attention, the sheriff’s office reported.

The woman was admitted to a hospital with head and ear injuries, the sheriff’s office said.
