She will be buoyed in these efforts by sharp increases in the cost of medical care and insurance, which she will blame not on the shortcomings of Obamacare, but on the avarice of doctors, hospitals, and especially the companies that manufacture drugs and medical devices. Health-care costs are likely to be a central theme in the next Presidential election. \u2026\n\nBy embracing Obamacare and scapegoating the health-care industry for its ongoing problems, Hillary Clinton is merely pursuing the fulfillment of her original vision for American health care. She is the author of most of Obamacare\u2019s elements, and many of the pieces of the regulatory apparatus have not yet been fully activated. Obamacare, like its blueprint, Hillarycare, established the tools necessary to exercise the required control on the health-care industry, if it has yet to put all those tools to use.\n\nClinton\u2019s NHB envisioned a much more robust and direct role for government in managing access to medical technology and procedures and a more active role in price setting than that being realized by Obamacare so far. A President Clinton would be more likely than Obama to finally constitute IPAB and set it loose regulating the whole industry. The elements of even greater control of medicine are all embedded in Obamacare, but these provisions are still waiting for their full exercise. This is the unfinished element of the progressive health-care agenda, the detailed outline of which was first laid down more than 20 years ago.\n\nObamacare, like Hillarycare, principally asserted government control over the delivery of health care. Clinton\u2019s 2016 platform will no doubt focus on exercising that control as a means to forcibly lower prices to make the coverage itself, in her words, more affordable. Of course, Obamacare\u2019s problems go well beyond high prices. But even on the price issue, Clinton looks likely to offer yet another false premise. Prices aren\u2019t rising because businesses are exploiting Obamacare, as Clinton seems set to profess, even if some might be. Prices are going up mostly because businesses are following the law\u2019s dictates \u2014 rationally responding to an irrational framework that was invented largely by Hillary Clinton.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton at the last Democratic debate said \"I wanna build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.\" A preview from \"The Clintonian Roots of Obamacare\" by my AEI colleague Scott Gottlieb.", "og": {"site_name": "AEI", "description": "Hillary Clinton at the last Democratic debate said \"I wanna build on and improve the Affordable Care Act.\" A preview from \"The Clintonian Roots of Obamacare\" by my AEI colleague Scott Gottlieb.", "title": "Here's how Hillary might deal with Obamacare's problems - AEI", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTS7N8N_HillaryClinton-e1448037008410.jpg", "url": "http://www.aei.org/publication/heres-how-hillary-might-deal-with-obamacares-problems/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From \"The Clintonian Roots of Obamacare\" by my AEI colleague Scott Gottlieb:In the coming year, Clinton can be expected to turn back to this well-honed theme and to blame any of the health-care", "title": "Here\u2019s how Hillary might deal with Obamacare\u2019s problems", "image": "http://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RTS7N8N_HillaryClinton-219x150.jpg", "creator": "@AEI", "site": "@AEI", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=953539392", "article": {"section": "Economics", "tag": "Affordable Care Act (Obamacare),Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u2026By embracing Obamacare and scapegoating the health-care industry for its ongoing problems, Hillary Clinton is merely pursuing the fulfillment of her original vision for American health care.\nPrices aren\u2019t rising because businesses are exploiting Obamacare, as Clinton seems set to profess, even if some might be.\nOf course, Obamacare\u2019s problems go well beyond high prices.\nPrices are going up mostly because businesses are following the law\u2019s dictates \u2014 rationally responding to an irrational framework that was invented largely by Hillary Clinton.\nShe is the author of most of Obamacare\u2019s elements, and many of the pieces of the regulatory apparatus have not yet been fully activated."}
