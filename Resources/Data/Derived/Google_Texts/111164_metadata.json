Gainesville will pay for maintenance of the litter trap.\n\nStorm Water pushed the product to area officials several years ago, but the effort didn\u2019t pick up steam until the Gainesville-based Lake Lanier Association found out about the product and became a big promoter, Hopkins said.\n\n\u201cThey started an email and telephone campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nJoanna Cloud, executive director of the lake group, has been a longtime proponent and is glad to finally see the device installed.\n\n\u201cThis is in response to a long-standing issue on Flat Creek flowing into Lake Lanier,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are very pleased to see the local municipalities step up and collaborate on working toward a solution for this area.\u201d\n\nThe association also supports the idea of using the trash trap as an educational tool. A parking lot is planned at the site, with officials saying they believe the trap can be an informative lesson for school field trips and those interested in environmental issues.\n\n\u201cPart of the challenge in Flat Creek is educating the local community about how litter, in all forms and even in small amounts, can build up to be a significant problem, with far-reaching detrimental public health and economic impacts,\u201d Cloud said.\n\n\u201cGrassroots educational campaigns with children are very effective at helping to change social behavior in our communities over time.\u201d\n\nJason Ulseth, who heads Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, said his environmental watchdog group has seen similar trash traps installed in other areas.\n\n\u201cThey are very effective in removing trash from streams when they are properly installed and maintained,\u201d he said.\n\nFlat Creek \u201chas long been a significant source of trash flowing into Lake Lanier and we are thrilled to see a trash trap being installed,\u201d Ulseth said.\n\n\u201cHowever, an ideal solution would be to prevent the trash from ever flowing into the creek. People need to realize that when they throw litter on the ground, that litter will wash into waterways the next time it rains.\u201d\n\nA couple of years ago, the area where Flat Creek flows into the lake was filled with trash after a heavy rainfall the night before in Gainesville. Area officials noted at the time that the pollution may have been particularly bad because the rain had followed a long dry spell and a lot of trash had built up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredible the volume of trash that comes into Lake Lanier\u201d from Flat Creek, Gainesville Water Resources Director Kelly Randall has said, \u201cparticularly after a large rainfall.\u201d\n\nThe trash trap, which Storm Water Systems has pushed to Helen as a possible solution for trash on the Chattahoochee River, is anchored in such a way to allow the device to float up and down but never below the current.\n\n\u201cIt skims the surface,\u201d Hopkins said. \u201cThe unique thing about this product \u2026 is there\u2019s no chance of it backing up water and flooding downtown Gainesville or people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nArea officials also have hailed the product as a useful tool.\n\n\u201cFlat Creek, as a whole, flows in and out of both the city of Gainesville and Hall County, so the county has a vested interest in its overall health,\u201d said Hall County spokeswoman Katie Crumley.\n\n\u201cIn addition, pollutants in Flat Creek ultimately flow into Lake Lanier, one of Hall County's greatest assets. Therefore, this initiative will help clean up the lake, which is in the best interest of our entire region.\u201d\n\nMore than just trash has created problems for the largely urban waterway.\n\nFlat Creek had the highest fecal coliform count in 2014 at 811 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters of water, based on a geometric mean of 15 samples taken that year. The recreational standard is 200 per 100 milliliters.\n\nAnd Pilgrim\u2019s Pride was cited by the Environmental Protection Agency last year for violations of the Clean Water Act after sending pollutants into Flat Creek. Floating fats were found entering the city\u2019s wastewater system, for example.\n\nAlso, recently, about 2,600 gallons of sludge was mistakenly pumped into Flat Creek in a wastewater spill. Sludge \u201cthat would have eventually drained to the stormwater pumping station entered Flat Creek,\u201d the city of Gainesville said in a news release.\n\nFor Kirves, the litter trap is at least one way that governments can help cure at least one of the creek\u2019s ills.\n\n\u201cAnd this is important to me, as I live on Lake Lanier,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a big-time water skier, and been on the lake since I was a kid. (Through the device), we thought we could help clean up the environment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/113865/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/12/04/1206TRASHTRAP_0001.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The device looks a bit like something out of science fiction, with its long arms stretching in opposite directions and sturdy green basket attached in the back.", "title": "Device now trapping litter flowing in Flat Creek"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Device now trapping litter flowing in Flat Creek"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4af9\"", "article_summary": "The trap was placed Friday on Flat Creek just south of the Flat Creek Water Reclamation Facility at 2641 Old Flowery Branch Road in Gainesville.\n\u201cThis is in response to a long-standing issue on Flat Creek flowing into Lake Lanier,\u201d she said.\nAlso, recently, about 2,600 gallons of sludge was mistakenly pumped into Flat Creek in a wastewater spill.\n\u201cIn addition, pollutants in Flat Creek ultimately flow into Lake Lanier, one of Hall County's greatest assets.\nFlat Creek \u201chas long been a significant source of trash flowing into Lake Lanier and we are thrilled to see a trash trap being installed,\u201d Ulseth said."}
