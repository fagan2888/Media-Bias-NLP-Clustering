State Rep. Jim Moeller made his challenge of U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler official on Friday.

Moeller had previously declared he was giving up his seat in the 49th Legislative District to run for lieutenant governor, but announced earlier this week he plans to challenge the incumbent congresswoman.

The liberal Democrat said he was inspired to run for the seat because he believes the 3rd Congressional District is being “shortchanged” by Herrera Beutler, R-Camas.

Moeller, who said his goal is to be the Bernie Sanders of Washington, criticized Herrera Beutler for her efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and for not hosting traditional town hall meetings. Moeller served eight years on the Vancouver City Council before being elected in 2002 to a 49th Legislative District seat in the House. As speaker pro tempore, Moeller held a powerful position, often presiding over the House.

The 3rd Congressional District was redrawn in 2011, lopping off the Olympia area and making it a relatively secure district for Republicans. But Moeller has name recognition and will be one of the more viable opponents Herrera Beutler has faced.

The congresswoman, who is completing her third term, said the Affordable Care Act has hurt more people than its helped due to high premiums, canceled plans and websites that don’t work.

“She believes all Americans deserve access to health care choices that work for them and shouldn’t be forced into a system that doesn’t work,” said Amy Pennington, her spokeswoman. Pennington said Herrera Beutler provides an independent voice in Congress.

“Jaime has met with thousands of constituents in every format imaginable during her time in Congress,” she said.

Other races

Clark County voters will have 148 candidates to choose from for 63 elective offices this year, after the filings closed Friday.

Most of those offices are partisan races for legislative jobs. But two of the Clark County council’s five seats are up for grabs. In District 3, Democrat Tanisha Harris will challenge sitting Clark County Councilor David Madore, a Republican, for his east Vancouver seat. Harris, 39, joins Republican John Blom, 32, in the race.

Harris had previously announced her candidacy for the 17th Legislative District House seat vacated by Rep. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver. She works for YWCA Clark County as a program specialist for the Court Appointed Special Advocate Program.

Madore, the 64-year-old CEO of Vancouver motion-control device manufacturer US Digital, and Blom, a real estate agent, announced their candidacies for the District 3 seat earlier this year.

“It wasn’t unexpected,” Blom said of Harris’ announcement. “I’m looking forward to having a good debate over who has … the right leadership approach.”

Madore has held a county government seat since 2013, when he beat now-Chair Marc Boldt to represent District 2 on the Board of Clark County Commissioners. With the approval of the Home Rule Charter, however, what is now known as District 3 has been significantly shrunk, covering east Vancouver east of Interstate 205 to Camas’ western city limits. Geographically it is the smallest district in Clark County.

Also new under the charter: Only voters in each district will decide on their county councilor. There will be no countywide general election vote.

The District 4 council seat is up for grabs after Republican Tom Mielke announced he would not be a candidate. The candidates who have filed are Democrat Roman Battan and Republicans Eileen Quiring, a county planning commissioner who has been supported by Mielke and some of the local party’s most conservative members, and Washougal City Councilor Jennifer McDaniel who has been supported by more moderate Republicans.

The primary election is set for Aug. 2, and the general election will be Nov. 8. Any race for which there are more than two candidates will be on the primary ballot. From there, the top two candidates, regardless of party, will go on to the November ballot.

Washington voters are currently in the midst of voting in a presidential primary election. That election ends Tuesday.
