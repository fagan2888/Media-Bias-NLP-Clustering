Undeniably good swims still result for BoCo schools

THORNTON — Setting the record straight, Bob Smartt was extremely pleased with the way the Fairview girls swam Saturday afternoon at the annual Coaches Invitational, ending the pre-break slate with a second-place team finish.

Boulder, Monarch and Centaurus also saw success with various swims at what is considered the biggest early meet of the season.

For the Knights, though, there was one big gaffe — followed by a discouraging officials decision — that kept FHS from defending its title at the event.

Taking the meet aggressively with Julia Box, Brittany Beetcher and Adee Weller among the swimmers that finished high in multiple events, the Knights were busy packing up their equipment during the championship finals of the 400 freestyle relay rather than competing in the race because of an unusual disqualification.

The disqualification came as the top relay team missed their heat of the preliminary round, and even after officials allowed a second-tier team to compete in a prelim, the Knights were not allowed to have an entry for the nightcap. That opened the door for Regis to take the team title, scoring 241.50 points to Fairview's 234.50.

"It's just one of those things that we'll have to take as a lesson, to always be ready for your race," Smartt said. "The relay glitch was a big 'oops', but other than that we had a pretty good day."

Several other swimmers could identify with Fairview's plight with the way the heats were being funneled in and out of the pool. It was a topic of conversation for many swimmers, including Centaurus' Haley Rowley. In about 15 minutes, Rowley swam the 500 freestyle, the 100 backstroke and a leg of the Centaurus' 400 relay consolation final swim.

Despite that setback, there were plenty of shining moments for Fairview. Box finished third in a stacked 100 butterfly that included Fossil Ridge's Bailey Nero and Loveland's Brooke Hansen. Beetcher took third place in both the 200 and 500 freestyles. And Weller finished top-eight in both distance swims, too.

For Smartt, the highlight of the day was the 200 medley relay, which came within earshot of the school record with a time of 1 minute, 46.81 seconds. Box, Sidney Andrew, Sienna Stonesmith and Michaela Mullison helped FHS quickly move past the morning.

"Winning the medley against some really fast teams, that was just exciting," Smartt said. "It's a consideration All-American time, so that tells you how fast they were.

"Julia, Brittany, Adee — they all had fine days today. We've got eight weeks to focus, and we had a number of girls who were close to placing. The challenge is to get those girls in the top 16, and for those in the top 16 to get to top eight."

Andrew's breaststroke split in the relay was less than 30 seconds (29.9), and she said that adrenaline helped carry her through to a win in the consolation heat of the 200 IM about 5 minutes later. Her time of 2:09.65 would have been sixth in the championship heat.

"This was the first high school meet for me and a lot of the other club swimmers, so it was good to see where we compared at this point," said Andrew, who finished fourth in the 100 breaststroke (1:06.77). "Honestly, I think we did really well. I know where I am concerned, there is room for improvement. I can tell you that split pumped me up for the IM."

Individually, Rowley — a former Boulder Panther — starred in the distance free race just a week after placing third in junior nationals in the mile. Her 4:52.96 in the 500 looked effortless, and she bounced right back to place third in the backstroke (57.15 seconds). If that wasn't enough, she took two laps in the cool-down pool and then helped CHS break a school record in the 400 relay (3:41.89, 10th place).

The current Boulder contingent, which did not qualify any relays to the afternoon session but still dropped times, had much to cheer for in junior standout Josie Valette. Still considering herself a newcomer to the butterfly, Valette set a school mark in the discipline with a time of 57.90 seconds — bettering the old BHS standard by a full second.

She also placed in the top seven in the 50 free, her signature race, giving her a bright smile at the end of the meet.

"I really just became a butterflyer last year, so I am still kind of figuring things out but definitely working on breakouts, turns and kickouts," Valette said. "My 50 was only (five-hundredths) off my best time, and my turn was a little iffy. So I know I can do better.

"I'm really happy with the way (the fly) turned out."

For Monarch, Sidney Trimm placed second in the 100 freestyle (52.82) and fifth in the 50 free (24.26). The Coyotes also had two divers make the finals, with Grace Newell's eight-place finish contributing to MHS' 15th place team standing.
