A new study released by a nonprofit organization that favors gun-control legislation says that firearms are more likely to be used in a homicide than in self-defense.

“In 2012, across the nation there were only 259 justifiable homicides involving a private citizen using a firearm reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program as detailed in its Supplementary Homicide Report (SHR). That same year, there were 8,342 criminal gun homicides tallied in the SHR. In 2012, for every justifiable homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used in 32 criminal homicides,” The Violence Policy Center said.

The study, titled “Justifiable Homicides and Non-Fatal Self-Defense Gun Use,” concluded that “the reality of self-defense gun use bears no resemblance to the exaggerated claims of the gun lobby and gun industry.”

Julia Wyman, executive director of States United to Prevent Gun Violence, said she hopes legislators will now “stop believing the self-defense myth,” The Hill reported Wednesday.

VPC says on its website that the National Rifle Association has called it “the most effective … anti-gun rabble rouser in Washington.”
