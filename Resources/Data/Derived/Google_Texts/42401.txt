NorthJersey.com reports that Antoinette Young, the principal of School 20 in Paterson, New Jersey, was reassigned when photos of the sign with misspelled words, “Dicember,” and “progress reepor,” and a backward number “1,” were circulated via social media. School board member Corey Teague sent the photo to other school board members as well.

The magnetized letters were reportedly placed on the sign by a custodian.

Teague said that his purpose in sending out the photo was to highlight a situation in need of attention.

“If this is how the administration takes care of signage how can we expect the students to do better?” Teague wrote in an email that contained the photo of the sign to board members. “We must be held to a higher standard.”

Young, who had been principal at School 20 for less than two years, was already under scrutiny for other issues. According to NorthJersey.com, officials said she was under a Corrective Action Plan to address unsatisfactory areas of job performance. Young’s salary was listed at $108,000.

School 20 has approximately 465 students registered in kindergarten through eighth grade.
