A 23-year-old Charleston man was killed early Saturday in a single-vehicle collision on Clements Ferry Road.

William James Detyens III was pronounced dead at the scene by Berkeley County Chief Deputy Coroner George Oliver, according to a news release from the Coroner’s Office.

S.C. Highway Patrol Sgt. Bob Beres said a 2005 Audi was traveling on Clements Ferry Road near Cainhoy Village Road about 2:30 a.m. when it ran off the left side of the road, struck several trees and overturned.

The 28-year-old driver, who was wearing a seat belt, was rushed to Medical University Hospital. A hospital spokesman said the driver was in serious condition.

Detyens was a passenger in the Audi and was not wearing a seat belt, the Coroner’s Office said. He was trapped inside the car and had to be extricated by the fire department.

The death has been ruled accidental but the wreck remains under investigation by the Coroner’s Office and the S.C. Highway Patrol, Beres said.
