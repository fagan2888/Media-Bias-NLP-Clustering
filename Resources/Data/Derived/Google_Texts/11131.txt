A woman was struck and seriously injured while crossing Montauk Highway near South Elder Street in Montauk at approximately 6:30 a.m. Friday, said East Hampton Town Police.



According to police, Robert J. Budesa, 64, of Montauk was driving his 2005 GMC Yukon eastbound when he struck Mariana Guanga Baculima, 32, of Montauk as she walked north in a marked crosswalk between the IGA and the Montauk 7-Eleven.



Police said Mr. Budesa stated that he thought he struck a sign in the roadway and did not see Ms. Baculima because of the glare of the sun.



Ms. Baculima was airlifted to Stony Brook University Hospital, where she was listed in critical condition on Friday. In a press release issued the same day, East Hampton Town Police said her condition was stable. According to police, Mr. Budesa was not injured in the crash.



An employee of the 7-Eleven, who asked not to be named, said Ms. Baculima is assistant manager at the store, where she was scheduled to work that day.



According to East Hampton Town Police, Montauk Highway was reopened on Friday at about noon.
