Ever feel frustrated with drivers on Valley roadways? A new study says you have good reason to: Arizonans are the sixth worst drivers in the country.

The study by carinsurancecomparison.com looked at deadly crash data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and found Arizona drivers ranked high in both careless driving incidents and crashes involving a failure to obey traffic laws.

The site concluded the country’s worst drivers overall reside in Montana.

The study ranked each state in five categories: fatalities rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, fatal crashes involving a failure to obey seat belt or traffic laws, fatal crashes involving drunk driving, fatal crashes involving speeding, and the rate of deadly crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists, which the site calls careless driving.

Arizona ranked third worst for careless driving crashes and seventh worst for failure to obey traffic laws.

The Grand Canyon State fared well, however, in drunk driving crashes. Arizona ranked 47th – or fourth best – in the percentage of deadly crashes involving alcohol.

The Director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety said the positive drunk driving stats are the result of tough enforcement, and those efforts will be scaled up.

“We are putting together programs around the state with more dollars for more enforcement. Enforcement works,” said Alberto Gutier, saying enforcement has been shown to decrease fatalities, injuries, and the number of crashes in the state.

When it comes to careless driving, the study points out that 46 states have a total ban on texting while driving. Arizona and Montana are the only states in the country without some kind of statewide restrictions, according to NHTSA.
