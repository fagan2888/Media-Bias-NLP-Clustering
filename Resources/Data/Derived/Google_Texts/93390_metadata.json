Eck\u2019s spokesman, Chris Pordon, confirmed that it is to kick off her campaign.\n\nEck, who mainly based her campaign against Obamacare, hopes to run against longtime Democratic incumbent Rush Holt. Holt is one of the most liberal members of Congress. Holt supports Obamacare but doesn\u2019t think it goes far enough, preferring a single-payer option.\n\nEck founded the health care center where she will kick off her campaign. It serves as a clinic for the poor and uninsured. She'll have a tough battle if she wins the GOP nomination. Holt has held the seat since 1998. And while the district was once competitive, it has gotten increasingly Democratic.\n\nLonegan is moving to South Jersey where he plans to run for the seat being vacated by two-term U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan (R-3rd Dist.)\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Alieta Eck might run again after losing Republican U.S. Senate race to Lonegan\n\n\u2022A true upstart: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Alieta Eck takes on Obamacare in first-ever race\n\n\u2022 More Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Matt Friedman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "2014-congressional-races, 2014-election-us-house, 2014-elections, alieta-eck, rush-holt, steve-lonegan, us-house, news", "title": "Former GOP U.S. Senate candidate Alieta Eck to kick off campaign for House seat", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Steve Lonegan isn't the only former Republican U.S. Senate candidate making another appearance this year", "title": "Former GOP U.S. Senate candidate Alieta Eck to kick off campaign for House seat", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/alieta_eck_returns_former_gop_us_senate_candidate_to_run_against_rep_rush_holt.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/13231489-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Steve Lonegan isn't the only former Republican U.S. Senate candidate making another appearance this year", "title": "Former GOP U.S. Senate candidate Alieta Eck to kick off campaign for House seat", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/13231489-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MattFriedmanSL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, January 17, 2014,  4:59 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, January 07, 2014, 11:26 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Steve Lonegan isn't the only former Republican U.S. Senate candidate making another appearance this year"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf6f1\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Alieta Eck might run again after losing Republican U.S. Senate race to Lonegan\u2022A true upstart: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Alieta Eck takes on Obamacare in first-ever race\u2022 More Politics\nDr. Alieta Eck, who lost badly to Lonegan in the August 2013 GOP primary, plans to kick off a campaign for Congress in the 12th Congressional District on Thursday, her campaign announced today.\nEck, who mainly based her campaign against Obamacare, hopes to run against longtime Democratic incumbent Rush Holt.\nTRENTON \u2014 Steve Lonegan isn\u2019t the only former Republican U.S. Senate candidate making another appearance this year.\nEck founded the health care center where she will kick off her campaign."}
