Words were exchanged between Lord and Thomas Earl Jacobs, who lived at the home, before the deliveryman drove away.\n\nThe shouting match may have included some racial slurs, said Ronnie Mitchell, attorney for the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office. Lord is black; Jacobs is white.\n\nLord later returned to the residence and the men scuffled in the front yard. Lord pulled out a gun during the scuffle, Mitchell said, and the weapon fired after Jacobs body-slammed him.\n\nLord was shot in the arm. Jacobs was grazed in the neck.\n\nDeputies were originally scrutinized for not filing charges in the incident. Mitchell said last week that no charges were filed because the gun went off accidentally and the injuries were not serious.\n\n\"In this circumstance, the only serious injury that appears to have occurred is to the perpetrator and not to the victim,\" he said. \"That, of course, created some degree of confusion about what charges may be brought.\"\n\nLord is now charged with assault with a deadly weapon, trespassing and assault by pointing a gun.\n\nHe received a $3,000 bond Monday evening and is expected to be released from the Cumberland County Detention Center.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2014-03-17 18:23:00", "description": "A deliveryman involved in a shooting incident with an 18-year-old inside the Gates Four neighborhood last week surrendered to deputies Monday after he was released from Womack Army Medical Center.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2014-03-17 19:29:07", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=13487921|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "A deliveryman involved in a shooting incident with an 18-year-old inside the Gates Four neighborhood last week surrendered to deputies Monday after he was released from Womack Army Medical Center.", "title": "Deliveryman in Gates Four shooting surrenders :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/deliveryman-surrenders-in-gates-four-shooting/13487921/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/03/12/13472525/13472526-1395094922-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "pinterest": "nohover", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-17T18:23:00-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "A deliveryman involved in a shooting incident with an 18-year-old inside the Gates Four neighborhood last week surrendered to deputies Monday after he was released from Womack Army Medical Center.", "title": "Deliveryman in Gates Four shooting surrenders :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/deliveryman-surrenders-in-gates-four-shooting/13487921/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/local/2014/03/12/13472525/63179-gilnoon-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8db\"", "article_summary": "Words were exchanged between Lord and Thomas Earl Jacobs, who lived at the home, before the deliveryman drove away.\nLord pulled out a gun during the scuffle, Mitchell said, and the weapon fired after Jacobs body-slammed him.\nMitchell said last week that no charges were filed because the gun went off accidentally and the injuries were not serious.\nLord is now charged with assault with a deadly weapon, trespassing and assault by pointing a gun.\nHe received a $3,000 bond Monday evening and is expected to be released from the Cumberland County Detention Center."}
