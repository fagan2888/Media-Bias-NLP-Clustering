Soble ruled in favor of the United Farm Workers (UFW) union over a 2013 vote cast by 2,000 employees at Fresno-based Gerawan Farming, seeking to decertify the union at the company. The dispute essentially stems all the way back to 1992, when the UFW became certified at Gerawan; however negotiations stalled by 1995 without a collective bargaining agreement in place. While nothing of note occurred for nearly 20 years, the UFW returned to Gerawan in 2012, desiring to resume labor talks and collect dues. In 2013, worker Silvia Lopez became the catalyst for the decertification vote. After the ballots were cast, Lopez traveled to Sacramento to deliver the vote to the ALRB. The UFW, however, claimed that Lopez received a $20,000 donation from the Fresno-based California Fresh Fruit Association to assist with \u201ctravel expenses.\u201d In his 192-page ruling, Sobel cited Gerawan\u2019s complicity in the donation, writing \u201cThere is powerful circumstantial evidence to suggest that the company knew about this donation beforehand.\u201d The ruling will now go to the ALRB for a further appeal.\n\nDue to evidence of wrongdoing by Gerawan in light of the donation, the ALRB kept the ballots under lock-and-key since they were presented to the board in 2013. Soble ruled that the ballots will not be counted, writing, \u201cAs a result of the employer\u2019s unlawful support and assistance, I am setting aside the decertification election and dismissing the decertification petition.\u201d Gerawan attorney Ron Barsamian admitted to the violation, however claiming that it was not the crux of the issue, saying \u201cThe payment to the decertification petitioners to go to Sacramento was from a source outside Gerawan and may be a technical violation, but it also fails to consider the fact that they were going anyway. The money didn\u2019t make them decide.\u201d The case became the lengthiest labor hearing ever in the state of California, involving over 100 witnesses and six months of testimony. 19 witnesses claimed abuse by employers during the election process, along with \u201cJim Crow tactics.\u201d Lopez, an American citizen, also accuses the ALRB of bias, saying in a June interview with DCNF, \u201cThey call me ignorant. They said they\u2019d call immigration to take me out of the country.\u201d\n\nThe case has led to large rallies in support of the workers\u2019 rights and unsuccessful legislation introduced earlier this year by local Republican state Assemblyman Jim Patterson introducing to reign in the ALRB\u2019s authority. Patterson expressed his disappointment in the ruling in a Friday interview with the Daily Caller, saying \u201cThis unjust decision sends a clear message that the ALRB doesn\u2019t think farmworkers are capable of deciding for themselves whether they want union representation. If this ruling is not reversed by the Ag Labor Board, it will be a perpetual stain on their honor.\u201d Although the Gerawan is a member of the California Fresh Fruit Association, but the association\u2019s president Barry Bedwell insists that there is no conflict of interest involved in the board\u2019s response to the vote. Bedwell said, \u201cThis was requested by members who had nothing to do with this case. We had received advice on the free speech implications that we should be able to support this. We were transparent. The real question is, does anybody believe that the transportation somehow influenced the overall vote of 2,000 workers? The only way to understand their true intent is to count the ballots. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll continue to push.\u201d\n\nDepending on its appeal, the decision could have widespread implications for the workers at Gerawan and the company itself. As Barsamian notes, the ruling \u201ccould open the door to presenting evidence of abandonment of workers by United Farm Workers.\u201d Lopez and others had argued that most of Gerawan\u2019s employees did not work for the company when the initial certification was made in 1992. Soble questioned the motives behind Lopez\u2019s advocacy, and accused Gerawan of essentially paying for it, granting Lopez time off with pay to lead the effort. In light of the evidence of wrongdoing, Soble questioned the authenticity of the results, writing that \u201cthe misconduct created an environment which would have made it impossible for true employee free choice when it came time to vote.\u201d Armando Elenes, the national vice president of the UFW, responded to the ruling saying, \u201cThis decision reinforces what we have been saying all along. We want Gerawan to obey the law.\u201d\n\nSources:\n\nDaily Caller \u2013 Connor D.
