That\u2019s what it is all about for CVS Caremark, and that was a central theme of Wednesday\u2019s timely Analyst Day meeting in New York City, held just weeks before the New Year when health reform will begin to significantly alter the healthcare landscape.\n\n\n\nGathering at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York City, analysts heard from key members of the executive team who outlined the company\u2019s strategies to drive long-term enterprise growth through its vast pool of assets and its nimbleness in responding to the evolving health care landscape.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think today\u2019s meeting is particularly timely given all that is happening in the healthcare industry as we enter 2014. As we are all acutely aware, the industry is undergoing its most transformative shift in decades and CVS Caremark is extremely well positioned to thrive in this changing healthcare landscape,\u201d president and CEO Larry Merlo told analysts.\n\n\n\nDuring the meeting, which was also webcast, Merlo took to the stage to provide a 30,000-foot view of the changing healthcare landscape and the company\u2019s ability and agility to respond to these changes.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur ability is defined by the fact that we have brought together an unmatched breadth of assets and expertise to drive innovation. And that innovation has delivered results for our clients, our customers and for our shareholders,\u201d said Merlo. \u201cOur agility is rooted in the fact that, while we are laying out a clear direction and a long-term strategy, the marketplace is undergoing significant change. And we have the ability and nimbleness to respond to those changes while continuing to deliver strong results.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt is this unique combination of ability and agility that positions the pharmacy innovation company to capitalize on the opportunities created by such changes within healthcare as coverage expansion and payor mix, the retailization of healthcare, a greater focus on cost and quality, and evolving pharmacy economics. And its integrated business model is proving successful in enhancing access to care, lowering costs and improving health outcomes.\n\nAs 2014 draws near, CVS Caremark has set its sights on driving enterprise growth.\n\n\n\nBy 2018, more than 30 million Americans will gain insurance and many more will face changes in their coverage. Employer-sponsored coverage is expected to remain relatively flat, with Medicare, Medicaid and individual purchased coverage facing rapid growth. The growth in these areas spells a rise in the importance of government, payors and health plans.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you look at government payors, our advantage comes from our strong positions in both the Medicare and Medicaid businesses across both our retail and PBM channels,\u201d Merlo told analysts. \u201cWe made investments in building these businesses and you can see our significant share in these markets. Our ability to gain share of pharmacy spend across the enterprise from lives in our PDP and managed Medicaid business is a significant advantage over our standalone competitors. And we are especially well positioned to participate in coverage expansion through Medicaid as the leading PBM in the managed Medicaid market, along with our strong retail footprint in the majority of states that are expanding the Medicaid population.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs it relates to health plans, the company is confident in its ability to grow market share through its existing PBM relationships. Today, there are more than 80 health plan clients representing about half of its PBM lives.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe truly unique aspect of our model is the ability to support health plans through our assets across the enterprise, whether or not we\u2019re the PBM,\u201d Merlo added. \u201cAnd our consumer expertise in this new business-to-consumer world of healthcare is being welcomed by health plans across the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrivate payor CareFirst, for example, is a new CVS Caremark client starting January 2014. CareFirst has developed a primary care medical home model that is focused on improving quality and lowering costs. The physician is measured on more than 20 quality and efficiency metrics and is given annual spending targets for their patient group. To further improve care and cost improvements, CareFirst is leveraging CVS Caremark\u2019s capabilities.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have the ability to support the primary care physicians by improving quality and lowering overall health care costs for their patients through the work our enterprise assets can deliver,\u201d said Jon Roberts, president of CVS Caremark Pharmacy Services, during his presentation. \u201cWe are in the process of integrating our technology platform, along with our retail pharmacies, mail, specialty pharmacies and MinuteClinic into CareFirst\u2019s [iCentric network].\u201d\n\n\n\nRetailization of health care\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and continued growth in Medicare we are seeing a rapid increase in the number of consumers choosing their own health plans,\u201d Merlo told analysts.\n\n\n\nIn fact, in 2014 it is estimated that 2% to 3% of lives will be on the exchanges and this is projected to grow to 5% to 8% by 2016. By 2020, it is estimated that about 20% of consumers will be direct choosers of their health care purchasing. Meanwhile, many individuals will have more benefit design choices through employers.\n\n\n\nThis rise in consumers choosing their own health plans will mean a greater demand for transparency and value in the healthcare marketplace. And both consumers and plan sponsors will increasingly turn to tighter pharmacy management tools to help save money.\n\n\n\nEnter the retailization of health care.\n\n\n\nThis is an area, in which CVS Caremark executives \u2014 with its decades of retail experience in a business-to-consumer environment, its channel-agnostic offerings (i.e. Maintenance Choice, Pharmacy Advisor and Specialty Connect), a growing footprint of conveniently located and low-cost MinuteClinic locations, and new digital capabilities that enable it to personlize the relationship with consumers \u2014 are quite confident in the company's ability to compete aggressively.\n\n\n\nIn touching upon the retailization of healthcare in his remarks, Roberts said, \u201cThe growth of private exchanges and the emergence of public exchanges will put the decision of plan choice directly into the hands of the consumer. \u2026 This increased consumer involvement will push payors and providers to provide more personalized and cost-effective solutons.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdded Roberts, \u201cCVS has a much deeper understanding of the consumer and what drives consumer behavior than anyone else in the PBM industry. Our unique model with more than 7,600 CVS drug stores along with our MinuteClinics puts us in contact with millions of healthcare consumers every year. \u2026 This consumer contact combined with our research partnerships with leading academic institutions arms us with unique, unmatched insights to design our marketing and member engagement strategies.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnother trend playing out within the U.S. healthcare system is a much greater focus on cost and quality in the payor and provider communities as the shift toward an outcomes-based payment system continues. Meanwhile, narrow provider networks are gaining traction and payors are increasingly focused on controlling specialty trend.\n\n\n\nSo as the needs of payors and providers change and risk-sharing increases, CVS Caremark\u2019s business model enables it to support payor and provider goals. Furthermore, the company\u2019s success in improving adherence rates is not going unnoticed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWith a 400 basis point improvement over the past four years, our adherence rates are almost nine full percentage points above the competition,\u201d said Merlo, giving credit to its technology investments and unique clinical programs like Pharmacy Advisor.\n\n\n\nIt should also be noted that the company is expanding its presence in the infusion market through the previously announced acquisition of Coram, which even further broadens the capabilities that CVS Caremark can bring to its payor customers.\n\n\n\nIn addition, incoming president of CVS/pharmacy Helena Foulkes Andy Sussman, SVP and associate chief medical officer and president of MinuteClinic, also shared insight on their respective businesses.\n\n\n\nDriving retail growth through personalization\n\n\n\nSpeaking to analysts about how the company is driving growth through personalization and leveraging the front end of its stores to capitalize on the changing health care landscape was Foulkes.\n\n\n\nAs reported by Drug Store News, Foulkes will assume the role of president of CVS/pharmacy on Jan. 1. She succeeds Mark Cosby, who is stepping down on Dec. 31.\n\n\n\nFoulkes has been with the company for more than 20 years and, over the years, has held increasingly large and impactful roles in the company\u2019s retail business, including merchandising, marketing and store operations. Her industry track record includes taking on the massive challenge of building what has become one of the most successful loyalty programs in all of retailing, ExtraCare.\n\n\n\n\u201cPersonalization is core to our retail strategy. We have a number of initiatives underway and all of them designed to help us connect directly with individual consumers to deliver a personalized experience,\u201d said Foulkes, who was quick to point its ExtraCare loyalty program, which is the engine behind all of its personalization efforts.\n\n\n\nTo stay on the leading edge, the company is further investing in ExtraCare and remains focused on identifying top customers and the share of wallet opportunity they represent.\n\n\n\nAccording to Foulkes, 40% of front store shoppers represent 87% of ExtraCare front-end sales. She acknowledged that rivals may have a similar ratio but CVS/pharmacy has one major advantage. Knowledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur real advantage is that we know exactly who those 40% are yet, even with them, we have significant upside. As an example, we know that our top customers spend only 30% of their total beauty spend at CVS. We have them in our stores so there\u2019s a great opportunity to capture more of their share of wallet,\u201d said Foulkes.\n\n\n\nTo further illustrate the opportunities for conversion, there are roughly 50 categories within CVS stores and yet nearly one-quarter of its shoppers shop only one or two categories. Clearly, the opportunity to convert more shoppers is tremendous.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are providing customers with conversion offers that encourage her to shop in categories she hasn\u2019t shopped before. The coupons she receives will also drive greater share of wallet in those categories she does shop,\u201d Foulkes added. Year-to-date the company has delivered 2.5 billion targeted offers to drive profitable growth.\n\n\n\nThe company\u2019s store clustering initiative also remains a key focus. To date, the company has 560 Urban cluster stores in place. These stores are designed around the fact that they are in a dense trade area with limited competition, and are much like a general store with expanded grocery and on-the-go foods.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the company began piloting in 2013 its Suburban cluster stores. These stores integrate pharmacy and MinuteClinic, with an elevated health and beauty assortment. During the fourth quarter, the company completed roughly 60 of these stores.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too early to talk about results but we\u2019ll evaluate and learn what worked and what didn\u2019t and adjust as needed,\u201d said Foulkes. \u201cThe key takeaway regarding our cluster strategy is that we are continually evolving based on early wins and other key learnings that we incorporate into our ongoing reset and remodel program.\u201d\n\n\n\nFoulkes also pointed to enhancing the experience of the circular through its new myWeekly Ad digital circular, growing store brands and bolstering its digital offering as ways the company is working to drive growth.\n\n\n\nTransforming primary care\n\n\n\nWith a primary care physician shortage that is expected to reach 45,000 in 2020 and nearly half of patients indicating that they do not have a primary care physician, the role of MinuteClinic is becoming increasingly vital.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe continue to integrate MinuteClinic with other sources of care and these include patient-centered medical home practices and Accountable Care Organizations,\u201d said Sussman. \u201cWe now have affiliations with 30 major health systems \u2014 a foundation for our enterprise strategy to differentiate CVS Caremark for providers.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor 2013, MinuteClinic is expected to enjoy better than expected revenue growth, reaching about $240 million. For 2014, revenue is estimated to reach about $300 million.\n\n\n\nOne key growth driver is the expanded footprint. In the last three years, the company has added more than 350 MinuteClinics, including 160 new clinics in 2013. The company now operates about 800 clinics \u2014 more than half of all retail clinics within the United States. By 2017, it expects to have about 1,500 clinic locations.\n\n\n\nMinuteClinic is clearly not looking to replace primary care physicians but, with a physician shortage, its collaborative approach and broadening capabilities makes the clinic operator an important support to primary care practices.\n\n\n\nIn addition to expanding its geographic footprint and non-acute services \u2014 which now account for 18% of total volume \u2014 the company is also looking to increase access via such technology as telehealth.\n\n\n\nVia a pilot in Southern California, the company employs high-definition video and audio equipment.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur model differs from some other providers in our use of connected, peripheral device cameras. These transmit physical exam findings such as images of the ear, throat and skin. Along with heart and lung sounds provided by a digital stethoscope,\u201d said Sussman. \u201cWe anticipate applications that will include establishment of telehealth sites at Caremark employer locations. We also plan remote physician consultations for MinuteClinic patients, further expanding our scope of services.\u201d\n\n\n\nGoing forward, the company will look to provide this telehealth care to homes and on mobile devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/", "sailthru.author": "Antoinette Alexander", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Winning with ability and agility in the age of healthcare retail-ization.
