(Photo by Andy Holzman/Los Angeles Daily News)\n\nThe child\u2019s breasts kept growing.\n\nOvernight it seemed, Delorian Cole\u2019s body morphed, from a normal girl to a 10-year-old with a bra size of 50 F.\n\nIt was beyond anything her mother, Thalia Hicks, had imagined. Worse, the girl complained of the aches in her back and the pains in her chest. And then there were the taunts at school.\n\n\u201cIt gets me all teary to think about,\u201d said Hicks of Los Angeles. \u201cThis is my baby and she\u2019s in pain.\u201d\n\nIt was an unusual case for a team of physicians at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles. Specialists who would later perform surgery and remove 1,000 grams of tissue from Delorian\u2019s breasts determined that she would benefit from Lupron, a hormonal drug that would help stop the growth. But Hicks\u2019 health insurer, which is Medi-Cal through Anthem Blue Cross, disagreed.\n\n\u201cThe records received from your child\u2019s doctor show that your child is 10 years old and this medication is only used for treatment of children with central precocious puberty (defined as the beginning of sexual characteristics before age 8 in girls),\u201d according to a Blue Cross statement filed in a legal complaint. \u201cFor this reason, we believe that Lupron injection is not medically necessary.\u201d\n\nMedically necessary is a legal term used by insurers to deny a procedure or treatment based on evidence of clinical standards of care. But some say those decisions are made simply because of cost. And since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, meant to protect consumers, requests for cases to be reviewed have increased.\n\nIn California last year, more than 1,000 people fought those denials by requesting independent medical reviews. About half of those denials made by insurers were overturned through the process. For the other half, those denials continue, and some, such as Hicks, believe they have to turn to lawyers.\n\nBeverly Hills attorney William Shernoff said he hears repeatedly from clients who come to see him when an insurance company has denied them a procedure or treatment. Shernoff said he\u2019s fought for clients who have had to pay for their own knee surgeries or kidney procedures because an insurer denied it. It is one of those quality of care issues that went unchanged under the Affordable Care Act, Shernoff said.\n\n\u201cI think the Affordable Care Act has really helped in many ways,\u201d Shernoff said. \u201cIt prohibits people from being turned down for pre-existing conditions and that is one of the big benefits. But I think they left one big loophole.\u201d\n\nThat loophole is what Shernoff calls an overutilization by insurance companies on deeming a doctor\u2019s recommended treatment as unreasonable, or not up to the standard of care.\n\n\u201cThe law allows them to deny the procedure,\u201d Shernoff said.\n\nMost of the time, physicians can\u2019t do a thing, Shernoff said, leaving it up to patients to either pay for the procedures themselves then sue to recover those losses or else fight their own battles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in the ACA that lays down any guidelines or standards on who determines medical necessity,\u201d Shernoff added.\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director for Health Access, a California-based consumer advocacy coalition, said there are some ways patients can fight back outside the courtrooms.\n\nWright said denials based on medical necessity were a huge problem in the 1990s. It was Health Access that won a battle for a patient bill of rights, including the right to appeal an insurer\u2019s decision and request an independent medical review from a third party. In California, those who carry insurance through Medi-Cal or an HMO can file a request through the California Department of Health Care. For those with a Preferred Provider Organization, they can make requests through the California Department of Insurance.\n\n\u201cYou have a right to appeal it within the insurance company,\u201d Wright said, and then, if necessary, appeal the decision through a third-party source. And the Affordable Care Act protects that right nationwide, Wright said\n\nBut it can still be frustrating, Wright agreed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a contested issue, but at least we have a process in place,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThe point of it is to get people help, to not get a lawyer. Over time, if you need medical treatment, you need it sooner rather than later.\u201d\n\nRequesting an independent medical review creates a case law. For example, one of the drugs that Wright said has been denied by insurers lately is Savaldi, a new treatment for Hepatitis C. But it\u2019s expensive \u2014 $84,000 per injection. Wright said the medical necessity clause seems to come to play most when a newer, more expensive drug comes on the market, such as Savaldi.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certainly not of the camp that all these issues are solved, but I do think that this has been looked at,\u201d Wright said.\n\nThe California Department of Insurance handles requests for reviews from residents who are covered under health plans such as Anthem Blue Cross or Blue Shield. Data show that there have been 1,123 medical necessity cases that the Department of Insurance reviewed and decided on from 2011 to this year, many of them involving medication for mental illness and autism. About 37 percent of the insurance companies\u2019 decisions were overturned, but most, 53 percent, were upheld.\n\nCase review requests have also risen.\n\nIn 2011, a year after the ACA was signed, there were 291 medical necessity cases reviewed. In 2013 cases rose to 327. So far this is year, there were 202 cases reviewed and decided. These do not include cases in which the procedure was deemed experimental.\n\nThe state, meanwhile, received 1,123 requests for an Independent Medical Review based on a medical necessity denial in 2013. Of those, 55 percent of the denials were either overturned or the insurer reversed its denial.\n\nAnthem Blue Cross did not wish to discuss Delorian Cole\u2019s case because of a pending lawsuit against them. But a spokesman said the issue isn\u2019t as cut and dry as it would seem. He said there are doctors who try to prescribe the \u201cRolls Royce of treatment\u201d when there is something else less expensive and just as effective available, spokesman Darrell Ng said.\n\nHe gave as an example a man who suffered a knee injury, and his doctor requested an expensive device that would cool down the muscles and tendons of the knee. \u201cAn ice pack works just as well,\u201d Ng said.\n\nAppeals can drag on past the care that was medically necessary in the first place, said Dr. Robert Bitonte, past president of the Los Angeles County Medical Association and president of the Los Angeles Commission on Disability.\n\n\u201cThe issue of medical necessity is an issue that interacts with doctors and patients at every instance because physicians are required to do what\u2019s medically necessary,\u201d Bitonte said. \u201cI can\u2019t say it\u2019s gotten any worse or any better.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, specialists including endocrinologists at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles concluded that what was happening to Delorian was called \u201cvirginal mammary hypertrophy,\u201d a rare condition that includes rapid enlargement of one or both breasts that can occur during the adolescent years.\n\nDelorian\u2019s physicians declined to comment on her case, but her mother said she chose to go through the court system because of the yearlong battle and suffering that she and her daughter endured.\n\nIn March, a year after Delorian was taken to the hospital emergency room in pain and doctors performed a biopsy, they concluded that the tissue growth could only be stopped with Lupron, a drug that treats advanced prostate cancer in men, endometriosis or fibroid tumors in women, and premature puberty in children under a certain age.\n\nIt ranges from $900 to more than $2,000 per treatment.\n\nBut insurers disagreed, and a complaint filed in court by Shernoff said the delay in treatment prompted a difficult surgery. Delorian experienced almost 50 percent blood loss, according to the court documents, and needed a transfusion after the 1,000 grams of tissue in her breasts was removed. Doctors once again prescribed Lupron to help stop the tissue from regrowing, but once again, even after an appeal, insurers denied it. They made no suggestions for a substitution for Lupron, and Delorian received no other treatment.\n\nHicks, a single mother, said she hopes the court system can make insurers change their mind. Until then, Delorian said she has days when she\u2019s still in pain, and she fears another surgery.\n\n\u201cI was scared, because I didn\u2019t know if I was going to live or die,\u201d said Delorian, who is now in sixth grade. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re worried. All these doctors kept coming in and when I woke up after surgery, they were all in there in the room, looking at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to know when your child is feeling fearful,\u201d Hicks added. \u201cIt\u2019s the suffering parents go through knowing their child is suffering. I\u2019m doing this because people need to know that this can happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The child\u2019s breasts kept growing.
