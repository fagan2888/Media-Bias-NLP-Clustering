Highlands Ranch is the only school that has boys and girls coaches as members of the 500-victory club in Colorado basketball. Falcons girls coach Caryn Jarocki attained the mark Feb. 13, 2014.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d she said.\n\nAs a youth, Caton spent countless hours watching schoolboy ball at the old Auditorium Arena downtown, which is long gone but still ranks as perhaps Denver\u2019s all-time mecca of hoops.\n\n\u201cThat was my entertainment,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was great entertainment.\u201d\n\nYes, he said, he wanted to grow up to be one of those coaches he admired as a youth. He later played at Denver West and Colorado State. And coaching? Before Highlands Ranch, there were stops at Manual, Denver West, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Aurora Central.\n\nThere also were state runners-up showings at the previous two stops, but his biggest reward was teaching the game and interacting with high school kids.\n\nAnd what\u2019s a dinosaur to do with a trophy? Caton admits he may be one of the last of his breed, at least in the Denver area. A lifer. Rudy Carey, Gary Childress, Bruce Dick, Joe Ortiz and Ken Shaw, to name a few, are still active, piling up the years and the wins.\n\nBut the odds are stacked against others following in their footsteps. Teaching and coaching jobs don\u2019t pay much.\n\n\u201cWe had teaching jobs to go along with the coaching jobs, so in my era, you got out of college, got a teaching job and that would be connected with your coaching job,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many young future coaches cannot get into the teaching profession, and that in turn makes it very difficult for them to coach. And we don\u2019t encourage athletes in college to seek the high school teaching job.\u201d\n\nEnjoy these guys while we can.\n\nNeil H.
