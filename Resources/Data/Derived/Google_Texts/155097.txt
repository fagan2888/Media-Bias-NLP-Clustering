Another round of thunderstorms rolled through the foothills and spread along the Front Range on Saturday evening, with heavy rain and reports of hail and high winds in Jefferson County.

The National Weather Service said some storms produced 2 to 3 inches in less than 90 minutes, leading to flash-flood warnings.

A flash-flood watch began at 1 p.m. Saturday and continued until midnight.

Additional afternoon showers are expected through the holiday weekend.

The flood watch continued for the Waldo Canyon and Black Forest burn scars to the south and the Four Mile burn area west of Boulder because of recently saturated soils and potential for heavy rainfall.

“We have a lot of moisture in the atmosphere,” said Kyle Fredin, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Boulder. “The region will see some small afternoon storms on Memorial Day, but we will begin to dry out on Tuesday.”

Heavy rains with reports of funnel clouds hammered southwest parts of the Denver area — especially Jefferson County, where high winds and hail were reported.

While the Front Range kept an eye out for flooding, the southwestern corner of the state was expecting snow.

A winter-storm watch was in effect from Saturday evening through Sunday morning for Ouray, Telluride, Silverton and Rico. From 2 to 6 inches of snow was possible at elevations of 10,000 feet and above, with wind gusts up to 25 mph.

Friday night’s storm took dead aim at Loveland, even as flash-flood alerts were issued for much of the Front Range.

A thunderstorm that stalled over Loveland delivered as much as 4 inches of rain to neighborhoods scattered across the community, causing severe street flooding and damage to basements and windows, the Reporter-Herald said.

Some lightning strikes also were reported.

Much of last week saw hail pound the Front Range and Denver International Airport. Frontier Airlines had to ground some planes because of damage.
