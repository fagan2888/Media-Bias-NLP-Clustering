Doctors at UCLA Ronald Reagan Children's Hospital released Leo Friday, saying he's well enough to go home.

But the family's afraid.

"Who wants to go back to that?" Teresa Bernal said. "It's like a nightmare. My son's been crying about going home. He doesn't want to go home. He's horrified."

The family has set up a gofundme account to help raise money for medical costs.
