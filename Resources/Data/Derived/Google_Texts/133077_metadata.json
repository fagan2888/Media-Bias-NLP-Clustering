(Photo: petarg/Shutterstock)\n\nBy the time Nora Derenze took a test for the BRCA breast cancer genes \u2014 the same test that Angelina Jolie famously took and wrote about in the New York Times \u2014 she had already been diagnosed with cancer. Yet the test, which turned out positive for the \u201cfaulty\u201d gene BRCA1, still set off a string of serious consequences.\n\n\u201cI had a very small tumor. Under other circumstances, it would have been a lumpectomy and radiation sort of situation,\u201d says Derenze, who was diagnosed in 2012. \u201cBut once the results came back with the BRCA gene, it was clear I had to have a double mastectomy because this was going to recur.\u201d She also had to have a hysterectomy. Her siblings and daughter were recommended for testing. Derenze, now 57, learned she had to return for yearly scans for the rest of her life. Through it all, she worked with two genetic counselors, who spent at least two hours with her, by her own estimate.*\n\nWhat happened with Derenze is exactly what organizations like the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommend when doctors send their patients to get BRCA tests. Derenze had a proven personal and family history of breast cancer, which meant she was a good candidate for taking the test. Plus, she met with genetic counselors trained in interpreting results from genetic tests \u2014 and deciding whether it\u2019s worthwhile to take a genetic test in the first place.\n\n\u201cThis study adds to data suggesting that pre-test consultation with a trained genetics professional has benefits for patients.\u201d\n\nYet, more often than not, things don\u2019t unfold that way. A new study, published today in the journal JAMA Oncology, finds that about two-thirds of privately insured American women whose doctors send them to get a BRCA test don\u2019t meet with a genetic counselor. That\u2019s concerning because those who do meet a trained genetic counselor seem to fare better. The same study found that women who take a BRCA test without genetic counseling first were less satisfied with their testing experience, and fared worse on an 11-question test about their understanding of the BRCA gene.\n\n\u201cI think the main takeaway is that this study adds to data suggesting that pre-test consultation with a trained genetics professional has benefits for patients,\u201d says lead author Rebecca Sutphen, a professor at the University of South Florida\u2019s medical school.\n\nSutphen\u2019s study examined data from more than 6,000 women whose doctors requested a BRCA test. The data came from the health-insurance company Aetna. Under the Affordable Care Act, companies such as Aetna must now cover genetic counseling with no out-of-pocket cost to the patient.\n\nThe researchers sent the women surveys, which is how they determined those who meet with genetic counselors are more satisfied and more knowledgeable about BRCA than women who don\u2019t. Sutphen and her team also used the Aetna data to figure out what factors made women who took BRCA tests more or less likely to meet with a genetic counselor. The most important factor, the researchers found: who referred them. Women referred by their obstetricians and gynecologists were the least likely to meet with a genetic counselor, while those referred by internal medicine specialists and oncologists were more likely to get counseling. These front-line doctors matter a lot: The most common reason women cited for not seeing a genetic counselor was that their doctor didn\u2019t recommend one. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that additional mechanisms for enhancing genetics and genomics knowledge among professionals is needed,\u201d Sutphen says.\n\nOf course, another way to ensure women get genetic counseling before they consider a BRCA test is to make sure they ask for it, even if their doctors don\u2019t.\n\nOver the last decade, Americans\u2019 awareness about breast cancer and the BRCA test have grown. In their study, Sutphen and her colleagues write that \u201caggressive marketing by testing laboratories\u201d has led to more BRCA testing of people without breast cancer. About 100,000 Americans now get BRCA tests every year.\n\nYet Americans\u2019 awareness about genetic counseling doesn\u2019t seem to have risen apace. \u201cSo many factors have, over time, led to much more testing, and not much more counseling,\u201d Sutphen says. \u201cWe would like to ensure that more women know that they can talk to a genetic specialist.\u201d\n\nDerenze certainly got a lot out of hers, at a time when she had to deal with some important choices. \u201cI had really, really amazing counselors. They made it very easy to understand what they were telling me because it\u2019s a little overwhelming,\u201d she says. \u201cPersonally, I just felt like I was armed with more information than I would have ever known to ask for.\u201d\n\n* UPDATE \u2014 October 4, 2015: A previous version of this article mistakenly listed Nora Derenze\u2019s age as 67.", "article_metadata": {"description": "by Francie Diep \u00b6\n\nBy the time Nora Derenze took a test for the BRCA breast cancer genes \u2014 the same test that Angelina Jolie famously took and wrote about \u2026", "title": "Most Women Get Breast Cancer Gene Testing Without Essential Counseling \u2014 Pacific Standard", "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "description": "by Francie Diep \u00b6\n\nBy the time Nora Derenze took a test for the BRCA breast cancer genes \u2014 the same test that Angelina Jolie famously took and wrote about \u2026", "title": "Most Women Get Breast Cancer Gene Testing Without Essential Counseling \u2014 Pacific Standard", "url": "https://psmag.com/most-women-get-breast-cancer-gene-testing-without-essential-counseling-fe682ae5c4d6", "image": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*PcTILXZj6h1_b28_.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"creator": "@franciediep", "label1": "Reading time", "image": {"src": "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*PcTILXZj6h1_b28_.jpg"}, "site": "@Medium", "data1": "3 mins", "app": {"url": {"iphone": "medium://p/fe682ae5c4d6"}, "name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}}, "card": "summary"}, "author": "Francie Diep", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://psmag.com/most-women-get-breast-cancer-gene-testing-without-essential-counseling-fe682ae5c4d6"}, "android": {"url": "medium://p/fe682ae5c4d6", "app_name": "Medium", "package": "com.medium.reader"}, "ios": {"url": "medium://p/fe682ae5c4d6", "app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018, "smart_publish": {"robots": "noauto"}}, "theme-color": "#000000", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/medium", "published_time": "2015-10-01T15:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://psmag.com/@franciediep"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Most Women Get Breast Cancer Gene Testing Without Essential Counselingby Francie DiepBRCA1 tumor supressor protein RING domain, in complex with BARD1 protein.\nIn their study, Sutphen and her colleagues write that \u201caggressive marketing by testing laboratories\u201d has led to more BRCA testing of people without breast cancer.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, companies such as Aetna must now cover genetic counseling with no out-of-pocket cost to the patient.\n\u201cSo many factors have, over time, led to much more testing, and not much more counseling,\u201d Sutphen says.\nOver the last decade, Americans\u2019 awareness about breast cancer and the BRCA test have grown."}
