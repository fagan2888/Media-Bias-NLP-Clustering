And I want to be that champion,\u201d Clinton said when she announced her bid for president in April.\n\nIn an hour-long address at Four Freedoms Park\u2014named after President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfour freedoms\u201d (of speech, of worship, from want and from fear) in his 1941 State of the Union address\u2014Clinton reiterated that ambition. She promised to fight for \u201cthe innovators and inventors, the factory workers and food servers\u201d and \u201ceveryone who has ever been knocked down, but refused to be knocked out.\u201d\n\nWhite, the anesthesiologist who donned a Hillary for America baseball cap, finds Clinton\u2019s \u201cfour fights\u201d\u2014for economic issues, family issues, global issues and government issues\u2014the perfect platform to run on in today\u2019s increasingly polarized climate.\n\n\u201cShe really does want to see the middle class succeed, and see the people that are having a tough time pull themselves up,\u201d he said, before cautioning, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take more than Hillary Clinton to take centrist ideas that can move through Washington and affect people.\u201d\n\nClinton told the crowd she might not be the youngest candidate running for president, but jokingly promised she would be \u201cthe youngest woman president.\u201d The line received enthusiastic applause from the flag-waving crowd.\n\nWhile it certainly is a plus for the unemployed Edwards that the next leader of America might be a woman, it\u2019s not the defining quality of Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cI like that she talked about equality not just for women, but for men,\u201d she said, adding that she supports Clinton not because she\u2019s a female, but because she has \u201ca good platform and agenda.\u201d\n\nThe platform that Clinton outlined on a stage designed in the image of her campaign logo was wide ranging, promising to fight for equality for people from all walks of life. The speech contained broad outlines of her vision for small businesses that focus on \u201clong-term value, not short-term profit.\u201d She shared her wish to make the economy an inclusive one, for all Americans, not just those at the top. Details, she said, are to come in the following weeks.\n\nFor Anthony Moran, who watched Clinton speak from his wheelchair, the real test will come in the debate portion of the campaign, when lofty rhetoric from both sides is scrutinized by pointed questions and a demand for answers.\n\n\u201cWe need to see a lot more,\u201d Moran said. He\u2019s hoping for more substance once the Republican and Democratic tickets on either side have been solidified next year.\n\n\u201cWho on the other side is good? Put the two of them together and we\u2019ll find out,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the end of her speech Saturday, Clinton alluded to her recent stumbles, albeit without mentioning any of them directly. In March, she acknowledged sending work-related messages through a private email account as secretary of state. Then in May, author Peter Schweizer documented the Clinton Foundation\u2019s failure to disclose the source of some of its donations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made my share of mistakes,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no shortage of people pointing them out.\u201d\n\nClinton said she\u2019s a leader who will persevere through adversity. While many people have called her many things, she said, \u201cquitter is not one of them.\u201d\n\nTo Jeff, who came alone from Queens on Saturday, eager to hear what Clinton had to say, her simply acknowledging past mistakes was hardly enough.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re running for president, and you dirty yourself with your own hands, you need to be sincere about that and admit that you made a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople can see that sincerity in you. And she wasn\u2019t sincere in that.\u201d\n\nThroughout the morning, popular songs by Pharrell Williams and Taylor Swift played from giant speakers. The Brooklyn Express Drumline performed. Echosmith, a Los Angeles-based band, performed a few of its hits. When Clinton took the stage, she did so to Sara Bareilles\u2019 song, \u201cBrave.\u201d\n\nJeff saw the spectacle aspect of the event as \u201cplaying to the crowd.\u201d But when the performances concluded and the music died down, Clinton walked up to the microphone in her trademark bright blue pantsuit to address her supporters. At that point, she was their champion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Daily Signal spoke with attendees at Hillary Clinton's campaign relaunch to determine if they see her as the \"champion\" of everyday Americans.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Daily Signal spoke with attendees at Hillary Clinton's campaign relaunch to determine if they see her as the \"champion\" of everyday Americans.", "title": "Can Hillary Clinton Be the 'Champion' of Everyday Americans?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/FollowingHillaryFeat.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-15T16:00:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1LcaXo7"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Daily Signal spoke with attendees at Hillary Clinton's campaign relaunch to determine if they see her as the \"champion\" of everyday Americans.", "title": "Can Hillary Clinton Be the 'Champion' of Everyday Americans?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/FollowingHillaryFeat.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Evergreen Topics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-06-15T15:22:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15T16:00:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Clinton, 2016, Roosevelt Island, Campaign Speech, Middle Class, Democrats, Primaries"}, "article_summary": "In an attempt to connect with the struggles that face the everyday Americans in the crowd, Clinton fleshed out her own family story.\n\u201cEveryday Americans need a champion.\nAnd I want to be that champion,\u201d Clinton said when she announced her bid for president in April.\nHow did some of these everyday Americans attending the speech at Four Freedoms Park react to Clinton\u2019s message?\nSome attendees, however, need to hear more before crowning Clinton their champion."}
