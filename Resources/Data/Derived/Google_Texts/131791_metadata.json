(RELATED: So, the Obamacare website sure is a disaster, huh?)\n\n\u201c[P]rior to the website crashing, which was not the first time during the application process, it was discovered that the Obamacare website actually tries to register individuals to vote,\u201d Novak wrote. \u201cThe link is optional, but the question remains, what does registering to vote have to do with signing up for Obamacare?\u201d\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also known as the \u201cMotor Voter law\u201d since it allowed people to register to vote while renewing their driver\u2019s licenses, requires government agencies offering social services must also offer a chance to register to vote.\n\n\u201cSection 7 of the Act requires states to offer voter registration opportunities at all offices that provide public assistance and all offices that provide state-funded programs primarily engaged in providing services to persons with disabilities,\u201d according to the Department of Justice website.\n\nBut conservatives worry that Obamacare and its voter registration offer are meant to build a voting bloc off Americans dependent on government handouts.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of Obamacare got nothing to do with your health, and nothing to do with your insurance,\u201d conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh said on his program. \u201cIt\u2019s about building a permanent, undefeatable, always-funded Democrat majority.\u201d\n\nThirty-six states currently enroll individuals for health insurance through the Obamacare exchange website. At least four additional states \u2014 California, Connecticut, New York, and Vermont \u2014 ask or intend to ask users if they wish to register to vote.\n\n\u201cThe launch, the website and the enrollment process all have been a complete disaster for Obamacare,\u201d said Brett Healy, president of the MacIver Institute. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the federal government wait until they successfully sign some people up for the program before they complicate things even further?\u201d\n\nFollow The Daily Caller on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Allison Coyle", "description": "Americans enrolling in Obamacare may be prompted to register to vote, the MacIver Institute found on Monday while comparing premium rates on the Wisconsin", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Americans enrolling in Obamacare may be prompted to register to vote, the MacIver Institute found on Monday while comparing premium rates on the Wisconsin exchange.
