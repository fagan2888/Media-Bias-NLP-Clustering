Jerry Brown in 1979 during and after a fund-raising rock concert for his 1980 run for the White House.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nBrown challenged incumbent president Jimmy Carter, but was overshadowed by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who also launched a campaign and narrowly missed winning the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe pictures show Brown hugging Glenn Frey of The Eagles, who joined the band Chicago and Brown\u2019s then-girlfriend Linda Ronstadt to perform at the San Diego Sports Arena on December 21, 1979. Photographers eager to get pictures of Brown and Ronstadt found themselves empty-handed when the duo eschewed appearing with each other. When Brown appeared on stage at the end of the concert, fans booed him, the Times notes.\n\nThree days after the San Diego concert, Ronstadt performed in Las Vegas. Brown, seated in the third row, clambered on stage to join her when she sang, \u201cMy Boyfriend\u2019s back.\u201d The Times obtained no photos of their commingling.\n\nBrown\u2019s 1980 campaign featured three chief planks: opposing nuclear power, a position catalyzed by the 1979 Three Mile island nuclear accident; urging a constitutional convention to ratify a balanced budget amendment; and providing more funding for the space program. Unlike today, when Brown has championed ObamaCare, he opposed Kennedy\u2019s call for national health insurance.\n\nBrown joined Ralph Nader, Jane Fonda, Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell at a rally in May 1979 at the Capitol to protest nuclear power. Economic guru Milton Friedman called Brown\u2019s support for a balanced budget amendment \u201cthe kiss of death.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAT Runs 'Brown for President' Rock Photos from 1979", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "LAT Runs 'Brown for President' Rock Photos from 1979", "title": "LAT Runs 'Brown for President' Rock Photos from 1979\u00a0 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 688, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-22-at-11.04.21-AM1.png", "height": 516}, "updated_time": "2015-01-22T14:09:21-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/california/2015/01/22/lat-runs-brown-for-president-rock-photos-from-1979/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "LAT Runs 'Brown for President' Rock Photos from 1979", "title": "LAT Runs 'Brown for President' Rock Photos from 1979\u00a0 - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-22-at-11.04.21-AM1.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "1979, Brown, linda ronstadt, Rock Concert, White House,Breitbart California, Weird News,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-01-22T11:11:47-07:00", "section": "Breitbart California", "modified_time": "2015-01-22T14:09:21-07:00", "tag": "White House", "categories": "Breitbart California,Weird News"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdece5\"", "article_summary": "Jerry Brown in 1979 during and after a fund-raising rock concert for his 1980 run for the White House.\nBrown joined Ralph Nader, Jane Fonda, Jackson Browne and Joni Mitchell at a rally in May 1979 at the Capitol to protest nuclear power.\nPhotographers eager to get pictures of Brown and Ronstadt found themselves empty-handed when the duo eschewed appearing with each other.\nThree days after the San Diego concert, Ronstadt performed in Las Vegas.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Los Angeles Times has released a series of classic photos from yesteryear showing California Gov."}
