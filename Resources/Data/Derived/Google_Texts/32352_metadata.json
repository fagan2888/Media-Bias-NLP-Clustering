Berhane finished in 29 minutes, 11.37 seconds.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting to be No. 1,\u201d Berhane said through a translator. He smiled while recalling the thunderous noise of thousands as he entered Folsom Field, something he said he had never felt in a race.\n\nThe margin of victory was among the smallest in Bolder Boulder history. In 2010, three runners finished within a second of one another. In 2008 and 1992, only one second separated first and second.\n\nIn the team standings, USA Red finished third \u2014 equaling the team performance of the U.S. women \u2014 with 32 points, behind winner Eritrea, which had 16 and was fielding a team for the first time. Ethiopia finished second with 24, and Kenya was fourth with 40 points.\n\nPHOTOS: Thousands run in Colorado\u2019s 2014 Bolder Boulder 10K\n\nBut the biggest surprise of the race came from Lafayette\u2019s Sean Quigley, a Saucony-sponsored runner relatively unknown outside elite racing circles, who finished as the top American in seventh overall, besting Olympic marathoner Ryan Hall and others who were expected to beat him.\n\nHall finished ninth in 30:12.97 \u2014 his second running of the Bolder Boulder. He was seventh in 2011 in 30:29.33.\n\n\u201cEvery single guy who runs into this stadium feels like a rock star,\u201d Hall said. \u201cI was just taking it pretty conservative, because I knew from running at altitude that you can\u2019t get out too aggressively. So I played it pretty cautious, and it was nice running with Sean for a good part of the race. We worked together to catch a lot of guys.\u201d\n\nQuigley, quiet, unassuming and modest, deflected the praise, saying the talent of the Americans in the race was comparable from runner to runner. He has shunned Twitter, Facebook and other traditional promotional outlets, expecting his performances to speak for themselves. He called Monday\u2019s finish the biggest race he has had in four years.\n\n\u201cThe game plan was to be conservative the first two miles and then hopefully guys would start falling back and I could reel them in,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cI think the aggressiveness of the lead pack early on probably helped my advantage.\u201d\n\nQuigley graduated from La Salle in Philadelphia in 2008 and continued to train with his college coach, Charles Torpey.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Torpey accompanied Quigley on a bike for an 8-mile tempo run at a local park. Afterward, Quigley left Torpey for a cool-down, and when he returned, he saw ambulances in the distance, but didn\u2019t see Torpey. He ran to the ambulances, believing Torpey went over to help, and once over there, realized what had happened: Torpey died from a heart attack that day.\n\n\u201cIt was like losing a family member,\u201d Quigley said, recalling the incident a few months ago while trying to hold back tears.\n\nHe left Philadelphia behind for Colorado for a chance to train at altitude and to forge a fresh start. He has been coached by Boulder\u2019s Lee Troop ever since but has battled through injuries. Last year, he dropped out of the Bolder Boulder elite race with an Achilles tendon injury.\n\n\u201cThe only reason he wanted to run was because of the disappointment of last year,\u201d Troop said. \u201cHe wanted to redeem himself in the eyes of the organizers, his track club. It just speaks volumes about a kid who just came out and raced the way he did. I\u2019m proud of him.\u201d\n\nFor Quigley, success in races means much more now than it ever has.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thankful,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel my body\u2019s getting closer to that point. If I stay injury-free, I know good things can come.\u201d\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3a0\"", "article_summary": "The margin of victory was among the smallest in Bolder Boulder history.\nLast year, he dropped out of the Bolder Boulder elite race with an Achilles tendon injury.\nHall finished ninth in 30:12.97 \u2014 his second running of the Bolder Boulder.\nBOULDER \u2014 If the question in the women\u2019s elite race at Monday\u2019s Bolder Boulder was how much Ethiopia\u2019s Mamitu Daska would win by, then in the men\u2019s race, it was: Could Eritrea\u2019s Afewerki Berhane even hold on?\nEthiopia finished second with 24, and Kenya was fourth with 40 points."}
