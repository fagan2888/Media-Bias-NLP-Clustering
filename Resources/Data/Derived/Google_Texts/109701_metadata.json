He skateboarded through the store, snagged a 32-inch TV and made a quick getaway.\n\nSecurity cameras caught the bizarre heist, documenting the crook as he browsed items in the store's electronics section with the help of an associate. Finding what he apparently wanted, the man then hopped on his skateboard for a quick lap, pulling a TV worth several hundred dollars from the shelf as he did so.\n\nHe first attempted to skate out with the stolen merchandise, but, finding the door locked, had to dismount and proceed on foot to another exit. According to WFTS, the thief pulled a knife when an associate approached him.\n\n\"They're used to cars, bicycles, people running from the scene of a crime,\" Rob Shaw of the Clearwater Police Department said to Fox 13 News, reflecting on the criminal's modus operandi. \"You don't usually see somebody zipping away on a skateboard and making their exit that way.\"\n\nPolice told The Smoking Gun they're on the lookout for a \"white male in his 20s, about 5 feet, 11 inches tall, and 150 pounds.\" His getaway vehicle has been described as \"brown,\" with \"orange-yellow wheels.\"\n\nPer a release provided to the Tampa Bay Times, the suspect was last seen \"zipping eastbound on the major thoroughfare.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Apparently bored with the skate park, this thief in Clearwater, Fla., has taken his tricks to Target.\n\nPolice say an unidentified man entered a Super T...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-01-19 18:06:51 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Apparently bored with the skate park, this thief in Clearwater, Fla., has taken his tricks to Target.\n\nPolice say an unidentified man entered a Super T...", "title": "WATCH: Skateboarding Thief Steals TV From Target", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/18/skateboarder-steals-tv-target-video_n_4623817.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1570544/images/o-SKATEBOARDER-STEALS-TV-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Apparently bored with the skate park, this thief in Clearwater, Fla., has taken his tricks to Target.\n\nPolice say an unidentified man entered a Super T...", "creator": "@g_nobes", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1570544/images/o-SKATEBOARDER-STEALS-TV-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "WATCH: Skateboarding Thief Steals TV From Target", "site": "@HuffPostWeird", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-18 18:06:51 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4623817", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "weird-news", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "shoplifter steals tv on skateboard,thief makes getaway on skateboard,Caught On Tape,skateboarder steals TV,weird crime,skateboarding shoplifter,skateboarding,man on skateboard steals tv", "article": {"section": "Weird News", "tag": "shoplifter steals tv on skateboard,thief makes getaway on skateboard,Caught On Tape,skateboarder steals TV,weird crime,skateboarding shoplifter,skateboarding,man on skateboard steals tv", "published_time": "2014-01-18 18:06:51 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-01-25 16:01:55 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0092\"", "article_summary": "Apparently bored with the skate park, this thief in Clearwater, Fla., has taken his tricks to Target.\nHe skateboarded through the store, snagged a 32-inch TV and made a quick getaway.\nPolice say an unidentified man entered a Super Target there Wednesday night at 11:00 p.m. just before closing.\nPer a release provided to the Tampa Bay Times, the suspect was last seen \"zipping eastbound on the major thoroughfare.\"\n\"You don't usually see somebody zipping away on a skateboard and making their exit that way.\""}
