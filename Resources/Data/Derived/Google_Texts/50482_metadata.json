The Foreign Candy Company is hosting a community event to celebrate 35 years of business.\n\nIn the corn fields of Northwestern Iowa, there's a celebration that's sure to appeal to anyone with a sweet tooth.\n\n\"We also have a kettle corn stand where people can enjoy some kettle corn. Of course there's going to be candy. It wouldn't be a celebration without candy,\" Director of Marketing Bill Lange said.\n\nThe Foreign Candy Company was founded by Peter De Yager of Hull, Iowa 35 years ago.\n\nThe concept behind the business is to make the delicious candy other countries create more appealing to Americans.\n\n\"I think they get it, but they may not understand an American market. That's what we do. We get the candy and make them marketable to the U.S. consumer,\" Graphic Designer Nathan Bousema said.\n\n\"You know, you can always get the same thing here in the states. People are always looking for that new flavor new taste, new texture. New different types of candy. And we wanted to bring that and share that with the United States,\" Lange said.\n\nTonight, the business is giving back to the community with free food and fun.\n\nIowa Governor Terry Branstad will speak, and CEO De Yager will make a big surprise announcement to the crowd.\n\n\"It is very good for the community. It's Peter's way of giving back into the community,\" Lange said.\n\nTonight's celebration will include inflatables, free dinner, a Christian comedian, and a Christian Grammy award-winning artist.\n\nGiving thanks to God and the community is what tonight's celebration is all about.\n\n\"Everything is dedicated to God's glory and God's goodness. In Peter's remarks tonight that he'll speak to the crowd, it's not what my hands have done, it's what God's hands have done. It's a big part of our everyday life,\" Lange said.\n\n\"This is very much a company that is part of the community. And he wants to give thanks to God and to the rest of the community around us. That you know, this is for them too,\" Bousema said.\n\nThe celebration began at 4:00 p.m. and will last until 9:00 p.m., Thursday night at the Hull, Iowa factory location.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "The small town of Hull, Iowa is host to a sweet celebration tonight.
