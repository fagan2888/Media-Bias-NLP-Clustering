But it was later modified to three new buildings and the renovation of 15 others.\n\nThe work was \u201clargely completed according to the terms of the contract,\u201d however there were \u201cseveral instances\u201d of shoddy workmanship, from lack of required plumbing insulation to missing protective metal strips on stairways, according to SIGAR.\n\nRelated: US Has Given Nearly $1 Billion in Property to Afghanistan\u2019s Government\n\nThere were also instances of substitute construction materials were used without approval, resulting in at least $80,000 in potentially inappropriate cost saving for the contractor.\n\nMeanwhile, most, but not all, of the Afghan Air Force University's buildings are being used and the Kabul government hasn\u2019t properly maintained the 10 structures it transferred to Afghan control.\n\nFor instance, two of the building aren\u2019t being used because local authorities discovered multiple problems, including plumbing leaks in the bathrooms, broken sinks and fixtures, and non-functioning ceiling fans, the assessment states.\n\n\u201cIf maintenance does not improve, conditions will worsen and could affect not only the future use of the facility but also cadet morale, and could ultimately result in the waste of the funds spent on this project.\u201d\n\nRelated: Pentagon Posh: U.S. Spent $150 Million on Luxury Villas in Afghanistan\n\nThe Corps of Engineers conceded to SIGAR that it didn\u2019t perform two of the required inspections of the complex--checks that likely would have uncovered the problems in the barracks and bathrooms sooner.\n\nHowever, the Corps has developed a follow-on project to implement a host of fixes throughout the complex, including the 10 buildings given to the Afghans.\n\nIn a bit of good news, SIGAR believes the project includes work that falls under the original contract\u2019s warranty and can be repaired at no additional cost to the U.S. government.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Add another chapter to the ever-expanding book about how the U.S. Defense Department squandered taxpayer money in its bid to rebuild war-torn Afghanistan.", "title": "The Shoddy Construction Job in Afghanistan That Cost the US Millions", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/Shoddy-Construction-Job-Afghanistan-Cost-US-Millions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12032015_Kabul_Afghanistan.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/04/Shoddy-Construction-Job-Afghanistan-Cost-US-Millions", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12032015_Kabul_Afghanistan.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Add another chapter to the ever-expanding book about how the U.S. Defense Department squandered taxpayer money in its bid to rebuild war-torn Afghanistan.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The contract for the university originally required the construction of eight new buildings and renovation of 24 existing structures.\nAdd another chapter to the ever-expanding book about how the U.S. Defense Department squandered taxpayer money in its bid to rebuild war-torn Afghanistan.\nHowever, the Corps has developed a follow-on project to implement a host of fixes throughout the complex, including the 10 buildings given to the Afghans.\nIn a bit of good news, SIGAR believes the project includes work that falls under the original contract\u2019s warranty and can be repaired at no additional cost to the U.S. government.\nBut it was later modified to three new buildings and the renovation of 15 others."}
