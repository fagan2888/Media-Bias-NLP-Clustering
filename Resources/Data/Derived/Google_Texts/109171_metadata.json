Allyson Schwartz with a Social Justice Award for her service in the community.\n\nNow in its 13th year, this was JSPAN\u2019s 11th annual award ceremony, of which more than 100 people gathered at the Independence Visitor Center to honor Schwartz.\n\nJSPAN provides a progressive voice on domestic policy issues, and Executive Director Rabbi George Stern said Schwartz was an ideal choice as an award recipient.\n\n\u201cEvery year, we look for someone in the community that we can highlight for the work that they\u2019ve done around social justice issues,\u201d he said.\n\nSchwartz\u2019s policy work has done a lot for women and children, such as the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program she stewarded through the Pennsylvania Senate \u2014 of which she was the third woman elected to office \u2014 as well as the Affordable Care Act she backed during her 10 years spent in Congress. (She left office in 2015.)\n\n\u201cJSPAN has policy centers that deal with criminal justice, economic justice, voting rights, health issues, crime and gun violence, and certainly women,\u201d Stern continued. \u201cThe issues around women and children fall under so many different areas.\n\n\u201cHer interests sort of dovetailed with so many of ours, and she has been supportive of us in the past, so we thought this was a great opportunity to thank her and give people in the community a chance to thank her.\n\n\u201cWe strive to be a Jewish voice for justice in the community \u2014 in the broader community, not just among Jews. All of the work we do is domestic.\u201d\n\nA close friend and colleague of Schwartz\u2019s, JoAnne Fischer, executive director of the Maternity Care Coalition, spoke on her behalf during the ceremony as well.\n\n\u201cAllyson has always been a straight shooter. She works hard and never loses sight of the people she is working for,\u201d she said. \u201cI know as a result of her courage, her example, her support and her mentorship, more women will take the risk to run for office and \u2018play the women\u2019s card.\u2019\u201d\n\nSchwartz, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, said, \u201cWe understand very keenly, and we should, that our responsibility \u2014 our obligation, in a way \u2014 to do all we can to support ourselves, our families, our Jewish community, but to actually work to make sure that the world and society we live in, the government we have, is one that provides security and opportunity and is one that is just and fair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very meaningful to be recognized by the Jewish community and to get a social justice award from an organization that is so committed to many of the issues that I care about as well and worked on for so long as an elected official and in the private sector.\u201d\n\nSchwartz is continuing her commitment to work on health care for all citizens.\n\n\u201cI continue the work that I\u2019ve done \u2014 particularly in Congress where I was well known for the work I did on health care, particularly around Medicare \u2014 I\u2019m able to continue to do all I can to strengthen and sustain Medicare for seniors today and for tomorrow,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that is part of a mission that we have in the Jewish community to make sure health care is available.\u201d\n\nSchwartz began tearing up when she accepted her award.\n\n\u201cI am enormously proud of the work that I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m enormously proud of my service in Congress. I love my job,\u201d she said in her speech. \u201cYou actually can contribute to a larger purpose. I was willing to do that, I was willing to step up, I was willing to take those risks, and many of you did along with me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Jewish Exponent", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.jewishexponent.com/headlines/2016/05/jspan-honors-allyson-schwartz-for-social-justice", "image": "https://www.jewishexponent.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_og-image/public/article/main_image/DSC_2374.jpg?itok=KWrBSFyO", "site_name": "Jewish Exponent", "description": "Overlooking Independence Hall on May 12, the Jewish Social Policy Action Network (JSPAN) honored former Rep.
