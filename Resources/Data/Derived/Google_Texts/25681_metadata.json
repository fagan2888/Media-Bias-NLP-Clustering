One in eight visits for headache or migraine now ends with a brain scan. CTs and MRIs are commonly ordered for headache and migraine, and increasing over time, despite the fact that there are rare circumstances where imaging should be used,\" he said.\n\n\"Lots of guidelines say we shouldn't do this \u2014 including ones from neurology and radiology groups \u2014 but yet we still do it a lot,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a source of tremendous cost in health care without a lot of evidence to justify the cost.\u201d\n\nThe study, which is published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, used data on headache-related doctor visits between 2007 and 2010. Over 52 million cases were identified. The researchers then examined the rate of neuroimaging scans within this set.\n\nCallaghan and colleagues found that 12.4 of these visits involved some form of brain scan. However, past research has shown that only one to three percent of these scans reveal abnormalities like growth or blood vessel problems. And even when they do, abnormalities do not necessarily warrant medical attention.\n\n\"There's solid research showing that the number of times you find serious issues on these scans in headache patients is about the same as that for a randomly chosen group of non-headache patients,\" Callaghan explained. \"And a lot of the things we find on such scans aren't necessarily something we will do something about.\"\n\nExcessive neuroimaging may also have lasting consequences for the patients themselves. CT-scans, for example, deliver 100-500 times more radiation than x-rays.\n\nIn an email to Medical Daily, Callaghan said that the trend may have several causes. First, doctors may order a brain scan to ease a patient\u2019s fear of aneurysms, cancers, and other serious neurological issues. Even if a patient doesn\u2019t meet the conditions set forth in the guidelines, physicians may still grant the request in order to protect themselves legally.\n\nWidespread accessibility to advanced medical technologies such as MRI could also explain the increase in scans. \u201cThe bottom line for headache patients who think they might want to have a brain scan: if the doctor treating your headache doesn't think you need a scan, don't push them,\u201d he said.\n\nSource: Callaghan BC, Kerber KA, Pace RJ, Skolarus LE, Burke JF.
