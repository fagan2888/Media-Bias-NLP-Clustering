These are a few of the happenings across Texas in this week\u2019s edition of Lone Star Brites:\n\nFAKE GENERAL\u2019S LIES\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas - The medals and uniform didn\u2019t convince a North Texas police chief he was truly dealing with a U.S. Army brigadier general.\n\nMichael Douglas McDowell claimed to be one when he visited Fort Worth police Chief Jeff Halstead two years ago offering a tour of the White House or Pentagon. But the chief became suspicious and later discovered through investigators that McDowell had never served in the military.\n\nThe 57-year-old McDowell on Tuesday pleaded guilty to impersonating a public servant and was sentenced to five years of probation. He also pleaded guilty to bigamy for marrying a woman while still married to his estranged wife.\n\nThe Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports (http://bit.ly/1btIye1) McDowell spun a web of lies that lasted for years as he claimed a long military career that included secret intelligence work. He was sometimes seen with a briefcase handcuffed to his arm. He had a Washington, D.C., phone number with a voicemail informing callers that someone from his \u201ccommand staff\u201d would call back.\n\nMcDowell often wore medals and ribbons, and had a Purple Heart license plate.\n\nSUPER BOWL FURNITURE BET\n\nHOUSTON - Seattle\u2019s victory in the Super Bowl has cost flamboyant Houston furniture store mogul Jim McIngvale some $7 million.\n\nThe owner of one of the nation\u2019s largest independent furniture stores, Gallery Furniture, McIngvale promised customers who spent at least $6,000 and took delivery in the two weeks before the game that he\u2019d refund their purchase cost if Seattle won.\n\nThe Seahawks delivered.\n\nMcIngvale, known as \u201cMattress Mack,\u201d says his accountant told him the latest promotion was a \u201ccrazy idea\u201d and now the accountant is \u201cpulling his hair out.\u201d\n\nMcIngvale says while he didn\u2019t do well financially, he did build on his brand. He says the promotion was not covered by insurance.\n\nEX-NBA STAR\u2019S NEW CAREER\n\nHOUSTON - Retired seven-time NBA All-Star Tracy McGrady plans to try pitching for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the independent Atlantic League.\n\nThe team says that it is a \u201clifelong dream\u201d of McGrady\u2019s to play baseball. It also says that the 6-foot-8 McGrady has \u201cdemonstrated skill, determination and diligence during his training program.\u201d The team says it looks forward to monitoring his progress in a new sport.\n\nThe 34-year-old McGrady played for several NBA teams, including the Houston Rockets and Orlando Magic. He last played in the 2011-12 season.\n\nThe Skeeters last made national headlines when Roger Clemens pitched two games for them in 2012 at age 50.\n\nSCHOOL LUNCH DONATION\n\nHOUSTON - A volunteer at a Houston-area elementary school who noticed some students were getting a smaller lunch of cold cheese sandwiches is digging into his own pocket to cover delinquent meal accounts so every child can get the same full lunch tray.\n\nKenny Thompson is a volunteer tutor and mentor at Valley Oaks Elementary in Houston. He says he asked about the lunch differences after hearing about some Utah students who lost meals because of non-payment.\n\nThompson told Houston television station KPRC (http://bit.ly/1fXbkVi) that likely was the reason for smaller meals at his school. He learned more than 60 children were on reduced lunches because parents couldn\u2019t afford the 40-cent daily fee.\n\nHe provided $465 to eliminate the deficits.\n\nGIANT ASTRONAUT STATUE\n\nHOUSTON - A Houston suburb near NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center plans to erect a towering statue of an Apollo astronaut.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle (http://bit.ly/1fMsoxF) reports the statue planned by the city of Webster will be 80 feet tall on top of a 50-foot pedestal that will house a space museum. The proposed site is at Interstate 45 and NASA Parkway.\n\nHouston sculptor and painter David Adickes has been commissioned for the statue, which will depict a space-suited astronaut planting a U.S. flag on the surface of the moon.\n\nCity officials estimate the entire space-themed attraction will cost about $30 million. Adickes says he\u2019ll need a little over a year to sculpt the astronaut.\n\nHis work includes the 67-foot Sam Houston statue in Huntsville.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A furniture store mogul loses $7 million in a Super Bowl bet with customers.
