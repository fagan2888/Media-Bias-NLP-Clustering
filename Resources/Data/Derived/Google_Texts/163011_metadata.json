But many are betting on a weeklong continuing resolution before the details are ironed out, so we may have to wait until next week before finding out whether the rosy predictions for a big boost for NIH \u2014 $2 billion or more \u2014 and a smaller one for FDA come to pass. No word on whether AHRQ will escape the gauging it got in subcommittee funding bills over the summer \u2014 it was eliminated in the House proposal \u2014 when appropriators were working with a budget $25 billion smaller.\n\nThe wild cards are GOP-favored funding riders and any blowup over how to deal with ISIL and refugees. Some NIH advocates are fearful that Congress might pass a spending bill that includes funding for most government agencies but leaves out more difficult subcommittees like Labor-HHS, which could have problems with controversial policy riders. If Labor-HHS was funded through a longer-term continuing resolution, it could lower the odds of NIH getting the desired boost made possible by this year\u2019s budget deal lifting the sequester caps.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHappy Monday and welcome to Prescription PULSE, where we note that this week in 1979 the World Health Organization certified that the small pox virus had been eradicated \u2014 preserved only in laboratory samples for scientific study. http://bit.ly/1Q59XrT\n\nDISCORD IN HHS OVER CDC OPIOID GUIDELINES \u2013 Officials from FDA and AHRQ leveled some blunt criticisms at CDC\u2019s effort to draft prescribing guidelines for painkillers last week. The Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee decided at a meeting Thursday to file a formal critique of the guidelines, which are due next month. An AHRQ scientist said the recommendations were \u201cridiculous\u201d and \"an embarrassment to the government.\" FDA\u2019s Sharon Hertz, who oversees the regulation of opioids, said the recommendations had little evidence to support them. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem,\u201d she said.\n\n\u2026 Several committee members expressed frustration that the White House response to the opioid epidemic was trumping a broader effort underway to develop an integrated National Pain Strategy and could in fact hinder it by limiting access to certain necessary drugs. CDC policy official Sara Patterson defended the effort as based on an exhaustive literature review by well qualified experts. ASPE\u2019s Richard Frank said the opioid guidelines, which have also come under criticism by the AMA and ACSCAN, would complement the overall pain strategy. The full story.\n\nOBAMA EXPORT COUNCIL CALLS FOR TPP PUSH NEXT YEAR \u2013 The President\u2019s Export Council, which includes prominent pharma executives, urged the White House in a letter last week to implement the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d Pfizer CEO Ian Read and Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier did not speak during a webcast of the meeting, but several other members spoke in favor of the TPP, Pro Trade\u2019s Doug Palmer reports. It\u2019s notable because BIO and PhRMA have objected that the agreement doesn\u2019t include 12 years of exclusivity protection for biologics, although they haven\u2019t said they will oppose its passage by Congress. Archer Daniels Midland chairman Patricia Woertz said at the meeting that the company \u201cand our sector stand ready to support this in every way possible.\u201d The letter: http://bit.ly/1TGwiL4 Doug\u2019s story.\n\n\u2026 In other trade news, while pharma and labor remain concerned about TPP, the majority of Obama\u2019s trade advisory committees backed the agreement in mandated reports they released Friday. Again, from Doug here.\n\nFIRST HEARING ON DRUG PRICE HIKES \u2013 The Senate Aging Committee on Wednesday holds the first congressional hearing examining price spikes for off-label medications since Turing and Valeant started making headlines this summer. The bipartisan investigation, led by Sens. Susan Collins and Claire McCaskill, had already asked four companies to provide documents by last week. No executives are slated to appear Wednesday \u2013 instead, experts will discuss the cause of the hikes and their effect on patient access, as well the effect of current regulations. A committee aide said this is the first of what will likely be a series of hearings. Details in the notice: http://1.usa.gov/1Is5TiX\n\nIMAGINE THIS GUY ON THE HILL \u2013 ICYMI, Turing CEO Martin Shkreli continued his performance as a caricature of a pharma villain last week, expressing his regret at a Forbes event on Thursday that he didn\u2019t raise the price of Daraprim even higher and make \u201ceven more profit.\u201d See POLITICO New York's Dan Goldberg\u2019s take on the \u201cpharma bro\u201d story that just keeps giving. http://politi.co/1O6OzMI\n\n\u2026 Bonus: a click- and cringe-worthy exchange between Shkreli and Express Scrips executive Steve Miller. http://onforb.es/1HJ2Tyv\n\nFDA DELAYS GENERIC LABELING RULE \u2013 The agency has once again delayed finalizing a proposal that would allow generic drug makers to unilaterally update their safety labels when they learn about safety risks. The move would expose them to greater legal liability, similar to what branded drug companies currently face. HHS\u2019s regulatory agenda now targets the final rule for next July, prompting outrage from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, which has been pushing for the change. \u201cThe agency should resist pressure from the pharmaceutical industry and finalize a rule that will protect patients,\u201d Michael Carome, director of Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group, said in a statement. http://bit.ly/1lfyHB2\n\n\u2026 GPhA WELCOMES DELAY \u2013 The generic drug lobby, which is sharply opposed to the policy, said it was \u201cpleased\u201d that FDA \u201cwill continue to evaluate the wide range of concerns\u201d that have been raised. http://bit.ly/1IJ7hIB\n\nFDA PUNTS ON BIOSIMILAR LABELING, TOO \u2013 The agency isn\u2019t yet ready to say whether biosimilars will need to have labels that specify the product is a copycat version of a branded biologic medicine and whether it has been deemed interchangeable, it told AbbVie in response to the company\u2019s petition to FDA to mandate such labeling. The agency approved the first biosimilar, Sandoz\u2019s Zarxio, with labeling that was identical to its branded counterpart, Amgen\u2019s Neupogen. AbbVie argues this approach is inconsistent with the Obamacare provision that established the biosimilar pathway and says disclosing that a product is a biosimilar is a safety issue necessary for informed prescribing, since biosimilars aren\u2019t identical to their branded biologic counterparts. FDA\u2019s response and AbbVie\u2019s petition are available here: http://1.usa.gov/1m1x4aa\n\nMORE PAYERS UTILIZING FORUMARLY EXCLUSIONS \u2013 More insurance companies are beginning to use exclusion lists, according to a report from Bernstein financial analysts. Optum, Aetna, Cigna and Prime Therapeutics will join Express Scripts and CVS Caremark in resorting to the strategy in 2016, taking the share of the market using exclusions to more than 50 percent. Most of these payers are a bit cautious, the analysts note, and plan to use 2016 as a test year, but they said they are a bit concerned about how certain exclusions for anti-diabetic drugs known as GLP1s, multiple sclerosis drugs and ADHD meds will shake out. \u201cThe rate of growth of formulary costs is unsuitable and U.S payers will need to act to contain it,\u201d the analysts conclude.\n\nFIRST IN RX PULSE: PURDUE PHARMA TO FUND LAW ENFORCEMENT NALOXONE TRAINING \u2013 The biggest player in the painkiller business plans to announce today a grant of $350,000 to fund a National Sheriff\u2019s Association pilot initiative to train police in the use of naloxone \u2014 the opioid overdose antidote. Next year, some departments will also receive naloxone kits as part of the program, funded by Purdue Pharma, the maker of the blockbuster pain pill OxyContin. HHS is also working to expand first responders\u2019 access to the drug. According to CDC, 44 people a day die from painkiller overdoses, and the number of states that have passed laws providing liability protections for emergency personnel administering naloxone has doubled since 2013. At least 32 states and the District of Columbia now have such \u201crescue drug\u201d laws. \u201cTraining and equipping deputies with naloxone is similar to putting a defibrillator, a tourniquet or other lifesaving equipment in squad cars,\u201d Sheriff Rich Stanek of Hennepin County, Minn., said in a statement.\n\nPHARMA IN THE STATES: MARYLAND RELEASES OPIOID RECOMMENDATIONS \u2013 A state task force made 33 final recommendations to address prescription painkiller and heroin abuse in the state, urging expanded access to treatment and greater efforts to crack down on trafficking. http://1.usa.gov/1SDaSxF\n\nSENATE FINANCE REPORT PUTS INNOVATOR DRUGS BACK IN THE NEWS \u2013 Sens. Ron Wyden and Chuck Grassley unveiled a voluminous report detailing the pricing strategy for Gilead\u2019s breakthrough hepatitis C drugs last week, inserting pricey new medicines back into the debate over drug prices. The conclusion? Gilead priced for maximum profit, knowing that the high prices would mean fewer patients would be treated. The bipartisan investigation concluded that state Medicaid programs and Medicare had \u201clittle to no policy levers at their disposal\u201d to negotiate with the company before AbbVie brought its competitor Viekira Pak to the market a year after Sovaldi hit the shelves in December 2013.\n\n\u2026 Don\u2019t expect any hearings soon by the Senate Finance Committee, chaired by longtime pharma ally Sen. Orrin Hatch, industry sources say. But the nearly 2,000-page report provides a lot of fodder for lawmakers who may be considering policy options. It shows a huge variation in Gilead\u2019s approach to negotiating with different players, driven largely by how many potential hepatitis C patients they represented. But because of legal restrictions against disclosing the negotiated prices, investigators were not able to paint a clear picture of what insurers and government programs are now paying for the drugs. Based on industry sources, the committee estimated Gilead is receiving on net about 60 percent of its list price for the drugs, which is $94,500 in the case of Sovaldi successor Harvoni. The report: http://bit.ly/1NvBuQW Our story here.\n\nEUROPE INVESTIGATING CALIFF RUN CLINICAL TRIAL \u2013 The European Medicines Agency is investigating a clinical trial designed and overseen by Robert Califf, the nominee for FDA commissioner, Regulatory Focus reports. It\u2019s investigating whether a defect in a medical device used in the trial, which compared the new anti-clotting drug Xarelto to the older warfarin, could have had affected the study results. The EMA should have a final assessment early next month, and it\u2019s not clear what impact this could have on Califf\u2019s nomination. Sanjay Kaul of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who served on Xarelto\u2019s FDA advisory committee, said the key issue will be determining whether there was any \u201cmalfeasance\u201d with regards to the device. The full story: http://bit.ly/1TDLloG\n\n\u2026 The HELP Committee has yet to schedule a vote to advance Califf\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, and time is running out to squeeze it in this year.\n\nQUICK HITS: PRODUCT-HOPPING SETTLEMENT, RX MONITORING PROGRAMS, FDA INSPECTIONS & MORE\n\n\u2014 Allergan has agreed to withdraw its request for the Supreme Court to take up its \u201cproduct-hopping\u201d case as part of a settlement with New York\u2019s attorney general. The Second Circuit said the company must continue to produce an older version of its Alzheimer\u2019s drug Namenda until generics could launch. The company had been aiming to switch patients to a newer version of Namenda to decrease the impact of generic competition. The settlement: http://bit.ly/1QktxPi\n\n\u2014The Network for Excellence in Health Innovation released a report outlining how to strengthen state prescription drug monitoring programs, which help prevent doctor shopping. The report, backed by PhRMA, calls for making the databases more user friendly, improving data integrity, and enabling them to send proactive alerts. A recent study found that 25 percent of primary care doctors in states with PDMPS didn\u2019t know they existed. http://bit.ly/1ODlsWb\n\n\u2014 GPhA argues FDA\u2019s plan to request quality metrics from drug manufacturers to help it determine which facilities to inspect exceeds FDA\u2019s statutory authority. It says FDA should have to issue regulations, not guidance, if it wants to impose new binding data reporting requirements. The lobby\u2019s comments: http://1.usa.gov/1oFF37E. FDA\u2019s draft guidance ICYMI: http://1.usa.gov/1h37K11\n\n\u2014 ICYMI: President Barack Obama signed into law a bill ensuring that FDA-approved drugs that need DEA scheduling before they can be marketed don\u2019t lose out on any marketing exclusivity while they are waiting for a DEA determination. http://1.usa.gov/21Cy5pz\n\n\u2014There needs to be a global system to protect vaccine developers from liability caused by vaccine-related injuries to better encourage development of treatments, particularly for rare diseases like Ebola that affect poor countries, a piece in the journal PLOS Medicine argues. The authors argue the current paradigm used by the World Health Organization is too slow in pandemics, and the enforceability of WHO\u2019s legal framework is questionable. The authors suggest the World Bank could oversee a compensation system. http://bit.ly/1XOgaHO\n\nJUSTICE SUPOENAS MYLAN OVER ANTIBIOTIC PRICING \u2013 DOJ is seeking information related to the marketing, pricing and sale of Mylan\u2019s generic versions of the antibiotic doxycycline, as well as any communication that company has had with competitors about the drug, the company disclosed Friday in a SEC filing: http://1.usa.gov/1QYVMVr. Doxycycline is one of the drugs cited by Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as part of their lengthy investigation into soaring generic drug prices. Last year, the two noted the drug cost $20 in Oct. 2013 for a 500-tablet bottle, but the price was hiked to more than $1,800 by April 2014. http://1.usa.gov/1oFF37E\n\nCATCHING OUR ATTENTION: ECONOMIST DISPELS MYTHS THAT RESEARCH COSTS DRIVE RX PRICING \u2013 And creating a system that would ensure the benefits of greater research efficiency are passed on to governments and health insurers would require drastic changes, like abolishing the patent system or finding new ways to incentivize basic research, The Economist writes. The drug industry is moving away from a model in which giant firms spend huge sums on in-house research and is instead moving to a model where companies buy drugs from smaller biotechs that have already done most of the R&D. This approach seems to be approving the industry\u2019s efficiency, The Economist notes, and buyers should respond. http://econ.st/1Q5oOmf\n\n\n\n** A message from The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association: PBMs are projected to save employers, unions, government programs, and consumers $654 billion - up to 30 percent - on drug benefit costs over the next decade. PBMs reduce drug costs by: \u00b7 Offering Amazon-style home delivery of medications and creating select networks of more affordable pharmacies; \u00b7 Encouraging the use of generics and more affordable brand medications; \u00b7 Negotiating rebates from drug manufacturers and discounts from drugstores; \u00b7 Managing high-cost specialty medications; and \u00b7 Reducing waste and improving adherence.
