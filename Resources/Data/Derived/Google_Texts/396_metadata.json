(Photo: ~Courtesy of Ahh! la Cart) Story Highlights Establishing a demographic and brand is the first step a prospective food truck owner must take.\n\nSimple and focused is the best approach to a food truck menu because of the small kitchen.\n\nAn average food trucks costs about $100,000, which includes equipment, fabrication, design and insurance.\n\nAbout $700 to $2,000 in certifications and permits also are needed, depending on the municipality.\n\nIf you have had a lifelong dream to open a restaurant, but never had had the financing to do so, a food truck may be a more affordable and lucrative option.\n\nAn average cost of about $100,000 includes equipment, fabrication, graphic design, painting, insurance, permits and certification, said Joe Hepner, president of the Hoboken-based New Jersey Food Truck Association and co-owner of the Aroy-D Thai Elephant food truck since 2011. That's a much more affordable investment than the $1 million it can cost to open a brick-and-mortar establishment, according Forbes magazine.\n\nBut before you spend a penny, there are several steps a food truck owner must take in order to solidify success, Hepner said. Here are his suggestions:\n\nStart with a demographic, concept and brand -- \u201cIf you\u2019re dealing in regional foods, a high school student is not going to be your target market. If you\u2019re offering flavors of a different area, it\u2019s not going to go over that big at a big drink fest, where people are getting hammered. Knowing your demographic will determine whether you will succeed or bomb. I was invited to Six Flags Great Adventure. They said, \u2018We would love to have your truck,\u2019 but I knew it wouldn\u2019t do great because a bunch of young people going on rides don\u2019t want Thai food. My demographic is white collar, American corporate offices. At corporate parks, I slam it with long lines. But barbecue goes over well with blue collar. You have to know which demographic is right for you.\n\n-- \u201cIf you\u2019re dealing in regional foods, a high school student is not going to be your target market.

You have to know which demographic is right for you. Know your competition \u2014 \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting your business plan, don\u2019t be fooled by your great food. To understand your demographic, you also need to know your market. That\u2019s not just your audience. Back in 2009 and 2010, I did exhaustive research on food trucks, and there were not many of us in New Jersey back then, so I knew I could start up in the state. If there were 10 Thai trucks, I might have rethought my decision. Look up where the trucks go, what venues, where the opportunities are.\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cWhen you\u2019re putting your business plan, don\u2019t be fooled by your great food.

It\u2019s a great book for someone trying to get into the business.\u201d\n\nOnce you\u2019ve purchased a truck, which will cost on average about $80,000, Hepner said, have it fabricated. Hepner recommends Shore Kitchen Supply because of the vast experience the Brick Township-based fabricator has been designing industrial kitchens.\n\nHe also suggested hiring a graphic designer to create a custom vinyl wrap that will help to brand and market the truck.\n\nOnce you\u2019re ready to open in a demographic-friendly location, you\u2019ll have to obtain municipal health and fire permits, as well as an additional peddler\u2019s license, parking permit and other permits in some towns, Hepner said. They cost between $500 to $2,000, depending on the municipality.\n\nFor more information, visit www.njfta.org/.\n\nStaff Writer Bob Makin: 732-565-7319; bmakin@MyCentralJersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1F6adTk", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New Jersey Food Truck Association shares tips on how to open a food truck.", "og": {"site_name": "MY CENTRAL JERSEY", "description": "New Jersey Food Truck Association shares tips on how to open a food truck.", "title": "How to open a food truck", "url": "http://www.mycentraljersey.com/story/entertainment/2015/09/11/how-open-food-truck/72005798/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/mycentraljersey.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New Jersey Food Truck Association shares tips on how to open a food truck.", "creator": "@MyCentralJersey", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71a1b6683723c0c802b927f378307d28634dd6ab/c=26-0-935-909&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/10/NJGroup/Bridgewater/635774879021921496-Ahh-La-Cart.jpg", "title": "How to open a food truck", "site": "@MyCentralJersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=859380356", "fb": {"app_id": 177893718898560}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/bob.makin"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "food trucks, Oink and the Moo, Cow and the Curd, Thai Elelphant, French Quarter, Empanada Guy, Union County, Clark, Oak Ridge Park, Food Truck and Rock Carnival"}, "article_summary": "New Jersey Food Truck Association shares tips on how to open a food truck.\nla Cart food truck is among 40 that will be at the Food Truck and Rock Carnival from Sept. 18 to 20 at Oak Ridge Park in Clark.\nAn average cost of about $100,000 includes equipment, fabrication, graphic design, painting, insurance, permits and certification, said Joe Hepner, president of the Hoboken-based New Jersey Food Truck Association and co-owner of the Aroy-D Thai Elephant food truck since 2011.\nIf you have had a lifelong dream to open a restaurant, but never had had the financing to do so, a food truck may be a more affordable and lucrative option.\nSimple and focused is the best approach to a food truck menu because of the small kitchen."}
