By the time Ronald Dukes completed his undergraduate studies in accountancy at Villanova University, he had a full-time job in New York waiting for him and and another campus job offering to pay for his graduate school tuition.

Dukes, now 24, put the job offer at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP on hold for a year and went for a master’s in accountancy at Villanova University. He simultaneously worked as a retention adviser for the university’s Center for Multicultural Affairs.

In 2013, Dukes began his career as an associate for PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP– a company he interned at for three years in college. About a year and a half later he would decide that he wanted to work closer to his hometown of Red Bank.

Dukes said he needed to spend more time with the youth group he leads at Calvary Baptist Church in Red Bank. The group is comprised of about 20 teenagers. Dukes said he leads discussions about life with the youth and hosts sessions for academic tutoring and SAT preparation.

“I wouldn’t be where I am had it not been for all the mentors I have had in my time growing up in Red Bank,” said Dukes, who now lives with his family in Neptune. “So for me it’s just paying it forward.”

In January, Dukes started a new job as a senior accountant for The Curchin Group, LLC in Red Bank.

He has delivered keynote speeches for the Monmouth County Cotillion and at Red Bank Regional High School. Last year, he received the Presidential Award for outstanding service from the Greater Red Bank Chapter of the NAACP.
