Ted Cruz (R-TX) tells Breitbart News that he\u2019s \u201cvery, very seriously\u201d considering launching a presidential candidacy for 2016. Cruz adds that he thinks a bold conservative needs to win the GOP nomination next time around, or else he fears Democrats are likely to win the White House as they did in 2008 and 2012.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cGod bless South Carolina. South Carolina has historically played a critical role in helping select Republican presidential nominees,\u201d Cruz said in an interview here at the state\u2019s Tea Party Coalition Convention:\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s central role has been ensuring that we nominate a strong conservative. And when Republicans nominate a strong conservative with a positive, optimistic vision, we win. It\u2019s the pathway to victory. So I\u2019m thrilled to be here in South Carolina. You asked about 2016? It\u2019s something I\u2019m looking at very, very seriously. I got to tell you, the encouragement, the expressions of support that we\u2019ve been receiving have been breathtaking. I\u2019ve spent the day just meeting with grassroots activists, sitting here at roundtables with Republican women, with Tea Party leaders, with small business owners, with young people\u2014answering their questions, listening to their concerns. The support we\u2019re seeing at the grassroots but also at the financial level, the support we\u2019re seeing from donors who recognize what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working and we\u2019ve got to change paths. Really it\u2019s been humbling and it\u2019s been overwhelming.\n\nWhen asked if politicians Washington\u2014both the Republican establishment and the Democrats, including Obama\u2014missed the point of the midterm elections, Cruz replied simply \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nImmediately after the resounding midterm electoral victory, featuring millions of conservative voters helping Republicans retake the U.S. Senate majority and expand the GOP\u2019s U.S. House majority, the GOP establishment in Congress rammed through a 1,774-page, $1.1 trillion so-called \u201ccromnibus\u201d spending bill. That bill did nothing to reverse the president\u2019s then-just-announced executive amnesty. Meanwhile, Obama has continued expanding the use of his executive authority by opening up negotiations with Cuba and implementing the executive amnesty\u2014with plans to push other executive actions in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cNumber one, President Obama came out of this election\u2014he was right when he said his policies were on the ballot all across this country. There was a referendum on the Obama policies and the American people overwhelmingly rejected the path we\u2019re on,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBut unfortunately when Republicans came back for the lame duck, we quickly went back to business as usual passing a trillion dollar cromnibus that did not reflect the values and priorities the American people had voted for.\u201d\n\nCruz said that Republicans in Congress can fight for something different\u2014and can lay out a bold contrast to President Obama and the Democrats, if they actually fight:\n\nIt is my hope that with Republican majorities that we will stand up and lead, that Republicans will demonstrate we deserve a Republican majority, that we will present a big, bold, positive agenda. It\u2019s what I\u2019m pressing for that we will number one, champion jobs and economic growth and opportunity. We\u2019ll champion energy and tax reform, that we\u2019ll fight to abolish the IRS, to repeal Obamacare, and we\u2019ll honor the commitments we\u2019ve made. Number two, that we\u2019ll fight to defend our constitutional liberty that\u2019s been under assault from the Obama administration and number three that Congress will begin to provide meaningful leadership in the world that\u2019s been so absent from the Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind. That\u2019s what we should do. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s what we will. But it\u2019s what I\u2019m going to press to do.\n\nAt several points in the interview, which aired on Breitbart News Sunday on Sirius XM Patriot Channel 125, Cruz praised conservative grassroots activists around the country who have been fighting for conservative values:\n\nAt the end of the day, our country is not going to be turned around in Washington. If you\u2019re looking to Washington for hope, you will be disappointed. The only avenue to turn this country around is the American people and what gives me excitement as I travel here in South Carolina and as I travel all across the country I see millions of men and women\u2014many of whom have never been involved in politics\u2014standing up and saying enough is enough, stop bankrupting our children and grandchildren. Stop violating the Constitution. Let\u2019s get back to the common sense principles our country was built on. Where we are today reminds me a great deal of the late 1970s. There are powerful similarities between Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama. I think 2016 is going to be very much like 1980 in that the way we win is not to paint as Reagan said in pale pastels but in bold colors. If we provide a clear optimistic alternative, that\u2019s how we win and turn the country around.\n\nCruz said the \u201cenergy and enthusiasm\u201d in South Carolina at the Tea Party convention is \u201celectric\u201d a year out from the GOP primaries for 2016. South Carolina is the first primary state in the south, making it a key stop for Republicans who want to be president.\n\nI think people are impassioned to turn our country around. You asked why people are here, the answer is simple: Our country is in crisis. It is now or never that we turn things around. We haven\u2019t hit the point of no return yet, but we are close. We are very, very close. I think all across this country people are waking up and realizing the path we\u2019re on isn\u2019t working. The Obama economy is a disaster, Obamacare is a train wreck, the lawlessness\u2014executive amnesty\u2014is unconstitutional and wrong. Our Bill of Rights are under assault. The Obama-Clinton foreign policy of leading from behind has made the world much more dangerous. I think people are hungry for a change back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that have been the foundation of this nation.\n\nCruz also said he is hopeful Republican leaders in Congress won\u2019t cave in to Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, and will hold the line after blocking funding for its implementation in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill. The House passed legislation blocking funding for Obama\u2019s amnesty last week, and the Senate is expected to take it up soon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive: Sen.
