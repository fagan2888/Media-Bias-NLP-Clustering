One would not expect that a decorated Chaplain would have to fight for his constitutional right to religious freedom. But that is exactly what the decorated 19-year Navy chaplain Wes Modder is doing with great courage.\n\nThe U.S. Navy likes to advertise itself as \u201ca global force for good.\u201d But when the Navy starts trampling the constitutional rights of Chaplain Wes Modder, it\u2019s anything but good.\n\nThroughout his career, Chaplain Modder distinguished himself from his peers. As Chaplain for Naval Special Warfare Command, Modder deployed around the globe multiple times to support and minister to our Navy SEALs. At the end of his tour, Chaplain Modder\u2019s commanding officer called him \u201cthe best of the best,\u201d and recommended him for early promotion.\n\nAt his next assignment in South Carolina, Chaplain Modder\u2019s new commander echoed those accolades, giving Chaplain Modder the highest performance ratings possible and writing that Chaplain Modder set the \u201cclear benchmark\u201d for professionalism.\n\nBy now, you must be thinking: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t sound like a chaplain who should be worried about losing his constitutional rights, much less his job.\u201d Unfortunately, there is a war occurring within the military between constitutional religious freedom and \u201cpolitical correctness.\u201d In the wrong circumstances, those who do not bow at the altar of \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d can be made to walk the plank. And right now, Chaplain Modder is facing the plank.\n\nAs an ordained minister, endorsed by the Assemblies of God, one of Chaplain Modder\u2019s primary duties is to provide pastoral and spiritual counseling to service members. As a military professional, he has received extensive training on everything from maintaining confidentiality to dealing with difficult questions in a sensitive, respectful way.\n\nChaplain Modder has proven his expertise at his job, having conducted thousands of counseling sessions with sailors and Marines. His work has been so effective that it elicited the highest praise from his superiors.\n\nNot everyone with whom he meets is a religious person seeking spiritual guidance, and he respects that. However, when a sailor comes to a chaplain, the sailor must recognize that the chaplain is obligated to conduct the counseling session in accordance with his religious beliefs. And recently, Chaplain Modder\u2019s discharge of that duty to uphold the tenets of his faith apparently crossed the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d line, and led to a fiasco.\n\nIn late 2014, a handful of sailors complained about religious beliefs Chaplain Modder expressed during private counseling. These sailors asked Chaplain Modder about biblical teachings on matters such as faith, family, and marriage. When Chaplain Modder stated his beliefs, which line up with his denomination\u2019s teachings, the sailors took offense.\n\nTheir complaints can be summarized as follows: \u201cChaplain Modder\u2019s religious beliefs are not politically correct, so he should lose his job.\u201d Incredibly, instead of acknowledging chaplains\u2019 constitutional right of religious free exercise, Chaplain Modder\u2019s commanding officer agreed with the disgruntled sailors. He requested that Chaplain Modder be kicked out of the Navy, threatening to end Chaplain Modder\u2019s military career just months before his pension vests.\n\nIsn\u2019t it odd that when a handful of sailors disagreed with a chaplain\u2019s religious beliefs, the U.S. Navy responded by seeking to fire the chaplain they had praised as the \u201cbest of the best\u201d only weeks before.\n\nAs part of Chaplain Modder\u2019s legal defense team at Liberty Institute, I am honored to have the opportunity to represent this American hero in his courageous fight for religious freedom. I believe the constitutional freedoms that exist throughout federal and military law\u2014which were reaffirmed by Congress in 2013 and again in 2014\u2014will prevail over unlawful political correctness. But frankly, it is deeply disturbing that our legal services are even needed. I admire the courage that Chaplain Modder exhibits. What a great man of the faith!\n\nChaplain Modder\u2019s 19 years of faithful service deserve our honor and respect. What the Navy is doing to one of its best chaplains is a disgrace. It is a slap in the face to service members of faith\u2014which includes the vast majority of our military\u2014who wish to serve free from fear that they will be punished for expressing their beliefs. What the Navy is doing goes against all that Americans fought for in the Revolutionary War. After Congress officially established the Continental Army, it recommended \u201call officers and soldiers diligently to attend Divine Service.\u201d Similarly, Congress instructed America\u2019s fledgling Navy that \u201ccommanders of the ships of the Thirteen United Colonies are to take care that Divine Service be performed twice a day on board, and a sermon be preached on Sundays.\u201d Clearly, Congress at that time expected Chaplains to stand strong for the faith they represent.\n\nAmerica cannot afford to allow this tragedy to go unchallenged. If the government can strip a chaplain of his religious freedom, then none of us is truly free.\n\nOur troops sacrifice so that we can enjoy the blessings of freedom. Although they give up many rights to serve, religious freedom is not one of them. I salute you, Chaplain Modder, for standing up for what is right.\n\n\u2022 Mike Berry, Esq., is Senior Counsel and Director of Military Affairs at the Liberty Institute, and a former U.S. Marine JAG Officer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Having the courage to stand up for what is right is not always an easy thing to do.
