While the Douglas County company had originally planned to go live today, the launch was scrapped to coincide with new apps and service improvements.\n\nSling TV obviously doesn\u2019t want a repeat of last weekend\u2019s Final Four fiasco, where the service was overloaded and customers saw errors during sign up. Roger Lynch, Sling TV\u2019s CEO, told tech-news site Re/Code that \u201coutages and quality issues only affected around 1,000 users \u2014 \u2018a fraction\u2019 of Sling\u2019s base.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Sling said that Saturday\u2019s launch will update apps to improve several things, including:\n\n1. Various enhancements to reduce overhead and load on our servers. This will allow us to provide a more seamless experience to all customers during periods of heavy viewership.\n\n2. Addition of parental controls across all channels that give customers the ability to manage TV shows by rating.\n\n3. Mini guide updates that make it easier for customers to find shows by subject/genre on the following devices: Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Roku players, Roku TV models and Xbox One.\n\nHBO on Sling now arrives about five days after Apple released the HBO Now app, which is more of a on-demand streaming HBO service available to non cable-TV customers. You can only view shows on Apple products.\n\nSling\u2019s provides the actual live channel. Cablevision, meanwhile, is also offering HBO Now.\n\nEither way, consumers must pay about $15 a month to access HBO, though all the streaming options offer a free trial. Sling TV users must have the regular $20 basic TV package before they can add HBO.\n\nRecent stories on Sling TV:\n\nView RSS feed\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "App,Apple,Dish Network,Final Four,HBO,OTT,Sling TV,SlingTV,streaming video", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "Tech+", "description": "Related", "title": "HBO goes live on Sling TV on Saturday; app updated to avoid another fiasco | Tech+ \u2014 The Denver Post", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/08/hbo-available-on-sling-right-now/16627/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/SlingTV_HBOc.jpg?fit=495%2C309", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Related", "title": "HBO goes live on Sling TV on Saturday; app updated to avoid another fiasco", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/tech/2015/04/08/hbo-available-on-sling-right-now/16627/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/blogs.denverpost.com/tech/files/2015/04/SlingTV_HBOc.jpg?fit=495%2C309", "creator": "@gadgetress", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "HBO now available on Sling TV's live streaming service.
