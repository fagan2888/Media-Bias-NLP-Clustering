The website 38north.org, which focuses on North Korea, said earlier in the year that commercial satellite images taken of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site showed the North is preparing to conduct an additional nuclear test, although preparations for the test seemed to have a long way to go before ready.\n\nSeveral weeks ago, North Korean Dear Leader, Kim Jong-un visited an historic weapons test site in North Korea and stated the North was, \u201ca powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation.\u201d\n\nAlthough this claim seems suspect, there is no doubt North Korea is expanding its nuclear weapons capability and the delivery systems as well to threaten America\u2019s Asian allies as well as the west coast of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A source within the South Korean defense ministry has told the South Korean press on Friday that North Korea has produced at least 88 pounds of plutonium which would allow the Stalinist state to produce multiple nuclear weapons, according to Newsis.
