That means Brunswick County has been squarely in the cross hairs of the storm.\n\nHeavy rain soaked Brunswick County overnight with reports of 1-3 feet of water from overwash along East 5th Street and Shallotte Blvd. in Ocean Isle Beach early this morning. Flooding continues to be a serious concern, and flood warnings have been posted much of the night and into the morning.\n\nAs day broke, Brunswick County Emergency Services said there was not much going on other than some street flooding. Through the day, though, the rain picked up, dropping several inches in some places and causing ponding and more concerns about flooding.\n\nThroughout the night there were scattered power outages in Brunswick, New Hanover and Columbus counties, but all were resolved fairly quickly, including one that affected about 1,300 customers in Wilmington and another the cut power to about 400 customers in Whiteville.\n\nWhen it\u2019s safe for you to go out where you are, we\u2019d love to see your pictures and videos of Ana.
