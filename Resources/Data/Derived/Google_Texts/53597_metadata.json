Questions came from the anchors as well as audience members.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was the first candidate to take the stage, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared in the second hour. Tapper\u2019s first question to both Sanders and Clinton dealt with the violence at Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s recent rallies.\n\nWhen asked about Trump blaming Sanders\u2019 supporters for the violence at Trump\u2019s recent rallies, Sanders said, \u201cDonald Trump is a pathological liar.\u201d\n\nSanders also noted that while he can\u2019t be held responsible for everything every one of his supporters does, he would never encourage violent behavior from his supporters.\n\n\u201cI never have and never will condone violence,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen the the topic was brought up to Clinton, she said Trump incited violence by telling his supporters he would pay their legal expenses if they got into fights with protesters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just so much of what he\u2019s doing that I think we all have to reject,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat Trump has done is like a case of political arson.\u201d\n\nClinton compared the businessman\u2019s response to violence at his rally as him starting a fire but throwing his hands up and not claiming responsibility.\n\nBoth candidates also received questions from an audience member about who would be the best candidate to go up against Trump and about specifics of their anti-Trump strategy.\n\nSanders pointed to the polls for the answer, saying many indicate that he does better against Trump by a larger margin than Clinton.\n\nWhen asked the same question by radiologist Amit Majmudar of Dublin, Ohio, who said he is a son of immigrant parents, Clinton pointed to her experience going up against Republicans.\n\nShe said the Republicans have been after her for 25 years.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anything that they haven\u2019t already said to me,\u201d Clinton said, adding that she believes this will help her in what she thinks will be the \u201chighest-stakes election.\u201d\n\nOne question posed to Sanders from the audience came from Charles Noble, a program director for My Brother\u2019s Keeper. Noble asked Sanders how he would ensure that international trade deals promote U.S. job growth in minority, rural and impoverished areas.\n\nSanders emphasized that he would work to make sure the U.S. is successful in trade while also making sure trade policies fit all citizens.\n\n\u201cWe will develop an entirely new set of trade policies not written by corporate America for corporate America,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nCrystal Oertle, an audience member who is in recovery for heroin addiction, brought up the issue of drug policies.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is fundamentally rethink the so-called \u2018war on drugs,\u2019\u201d Sanders said in response.\n\nSanders called for looking at substance abuse as a mental health issue, not a criminal issue.\n\nClinton faced a question from audience member Teresa O\u2019Donnell, who said she wants to vote Democrat but doesn\u2019t know if she can because of rising costs she said she\u2019s faced as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI want very much to get the cost down, and that is going to be my mission,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton said she believes the Affordable Care Act has done a lot of \u201creally good things,\u201d such as reducing costs in most cases and guaranteeing insurance. However, she said she wants to work to reduce cost for everyone if elected president.\n\nTapper introduced a question by an anti-fracking activist, Christine Hughes, about Ohio not allowing fracking bans and how to handle farmers\u2019 and communities\u2019 concerns.\n\nClinton said she will do everything she can to regulate it, but she said promising to get rid of it completely would be unrealistic.\n\n\u201cWe need much more scientific research,\u201d she said. Clinton added that though researchers know of a few problems associated with fracking now, they need to be sure of everything in the future to make sure they don\u2019t allow it going forward.\n\nThe town hall was one of several presidential candidate appearances that took place in Columbus on Sunday.
