Some analysts say that consolidating hospitals may be a good thing in the long term, because it will help make health care delivery more efficient. But the advocates rallying in Washington, D.C. this week say it\u2019s an untenable situation that\u2019s disproportionately affecting vulnerable Americans, who are increasingly losing their access to nearby emergency services.\n\nLed by Adam O\u2019Neal \u2014 the Republican mayor of a small North Carolina town named Belhaven where a rural hospital, Vidant Pungo, was recently shuttered \u2014 a group of activists from 11 states walked 283 miles on foot over the past two weeks to draw more attention to the hospitals in peril.\n\nEach mile they walked represents a rural hospital, that, according to a recent report from the Advisory Board Company, is currently at risk of closure without sufficient funding. Their journey took them from North Carolina to the nation\u2019s capital, where the group gathered on Monday morning for a press conference.\n\nO\u2019Neal, who says that some Belhaven residents have died because they couldn\u2019t be treated at a nearby hospital, made the same journey last year to raise awareness about the issue. This summer, it\u2019s been dubbed simply \u201cThe Walk\u201d and has picked up additional supporters, including civil rights leader Bob Zellner, who marched on Washington more than 50 years ago.\n\nEven though O\u2019Neal is a Republican, he says that lawmakers need to think carefully about how their positions on Obamacare may be affecting rural hospitals. That\u2019s because failing to expand Obamacare\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion leaves hospitals struggling to remain profitable without an influx of newly insured patients. Rural health care experts have long warned that refusing to accept Medicaid expansion threatens to have negative consequences for their constituency. In addition to closures in North Carolina, multiple rural hospitals have also shuttered in other red states where GOP lawmakers have resisted expanding the public health program \u2014 including Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama.\n\nSome of those closures have resulted in tragic stories. For instance, in 2013, the loss of a hospital in a rural East Texas town became quite personal after an 18-month old died from choking on a grape. The baby\u2019s family rushed her to the closest hospital, but it was closed and locked \u2014 it had been shut down just months earlier. By the time they reached the next emergency room facility, which was about 20 miles away, it was too late.\n\nO\u2019Neal and his supporters suggest that future tragedies may be averted by finding ways to prevent small hospitals from suffering big financial losses, like accepting the Medicaid expansion. \u201cI\u2019m not a huge Obama fan. But when you look at Medicaid expansion, you look at the numbers and you look at statistics, it\u2019s something that you have to do. If you don\u2019t do it, you\u2019re penalizing your people pretty harshly,\u201d O\u2019Neal told NPR this week.\n\nMany of the activists who walked alongside O\u2019Neal agreed. Laura Guerra, who lives in Texas, wrote in a blog post documenting her fifteen-day journey that she decided to take a stand in response to her state lawmakers\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid. \u201cI joined The Walk frustrated because of political inaction. But now, I walk in hope that a new moral movement is possible and beginning to take hold,\u201d Guerra wrote.\n\nActivists have long been making a moral case for Medicaid expansion, pointing out that there\u2019s a human cost to lawmakers\u2019 refusal to accept the policy. The president of North Carolina\u2019s NAACP, Rev. William Barber \u2014 who has been an instrumental player in the state\u2019s ongoing Moral Monday movement \u2014 joined O\u2019Neal on part of his walk.\n\n\u201cHospitals are not like hardware stores; we can\u2019t simply close them and not expect people to be affected. The Walk must start a national debate about the condition of rural hospitals today,\u201d O\u2019Neal said in a press release marking the beginning of his trek to the U.S. Capitol. \u201cWe must demonstrate to lawmakers in D.C. how we the people can cross party lines to work on this vital issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"We must demonstrate to lawmakers in D.C. how we the people can cross party lines to work on this vital issue.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"We must demonstrate to lawmakers in D.C. how we the people can cross party lines to work on this vital issue.\"", "title": "GOP Mayor Says Other Republicans Need To Consider How Opposing Obamacare Hurts Rural Areas", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/06/15/3669531/north-carolina-walk-dc/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/save-our-hospital.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We must demonstrate to lawmakers in D.C. how we the people can cross party lines to work on this vital issue.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/save-our-hospital-321x214.jpg", "title": "GOP Mayor Says Other Republicans Need To Consider How Opposing Obamacare Hurts Rural Areas", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/save-our-hospital.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/save-our-hospital.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-15T13:57:08+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Each mile they walked represents a rural hospital, that, according to a recent report from the Advisory Board Company, is currently at risk of closure without sufficient funding.\nHealth GOP Mayor Says Other Republicans Need To Consider How Opposing Obamacare Hurts Rural Areas CREDIT: Eric Byler, TheWalkNCToDC.comAfter a two-week journey spanning nearly 300 miles, a diverse group of activists arrived at the U.S. Capitol on Monday morning with a simple message for their lawmakers: Save rural hospitals.\nRural health care experts have long warned that refusing to accept Medicaid expansion threatens to have negative consequences for their constituency.\nEven though O\u2019Neal is a Republican, he says that lawmakers need to think carefully about how their positions on Obamacare may be affecting rural hospitals.\nBut when you look at Medicaid expansion, you look at the numbers and you look at statistics, it\u2019s something that you have to do."}
