Mack of Hennepin into his role as the county\u2019s first new resident judge in nearly a quarter-century.\n\n\n\nMack, the newest judge in the five-county 10th Judicial Circuit surrounding Peoria, took his oath of office in the oldest operating courthouse in the state before a crowd that included several other current and retired judges.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for me to be here. This is a historic event in a historic building. The last time we did this was 24 years ago,\u201d said Chief Judge Stephen Kouri, who swore Mack in.\n\n\n\nMack, 49, a Republican, succeeds the retiring Scott Shore, a Granville Democrat who was elected without opposition in 1990. Mack defeated Democrat Brad Popurella of McNabb and independent John Grivetti of Standard in the Nov. 4 election.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is the happiest and most important day of my professional life,\u201d Mack said.\n\n\n\nShore, who will return to private legal practice in a Hennepin office, recalled his own beginnings on the bench while also summarizing Mack\u2019s record of public and private practice.\n\n\n\n\u201cJudge Mack, this now begins what is certain to be another eventful chapter in your life and your career,\u201d Shore said.\n\n\n\nAfter brief remarks that mostly consisted of thanking numerous people, Mack swore in new and re-elected county officials who seldom have occasion to take their oaths before such large assemblies.\n\n\n\nThe new work schedule Mack begins Tuesday morning was a reminder that being the \u201cresident\u201d judge has almost nothing to do with actually presiding here. Judges elected in the 10th district\u2019s \u201cNorthern Circuit\u201d of Marshall, Putnam and Stark counties typically spend their first five years in Peoria and Tazewell counties to minimize conflicts from their past legal practices.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be in Room 203 (in the Peoria County Courthouse),\u201d handling chancery, probate and \u201cmiscellaneous remedy\u201d cases, Mack said.\n\n\n\nThat indicates a great responsibility, noted Shore, who is leaving as the district\u2019s senior judge. Chancery cases, in particular, involve a judge\u2019s powers of equity, which are based on principles of fairness and generally broader than those arising from specific statutes.\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s attorney for at least the next two years will be Christina Mennie, a Hennepin attorney who was appointed Saturday to fill Mack\u2019s two-year unexpired term. She was closing out her private practice Monday while also making arrangements to be sworn in soon by the now-former prosecutor whom she previously often faced as a defense attorney.\n\n\n\n\u201c(Mack) was a fair-minded prosecutor, and I believe he always had the county in mind as he worked,\u201d she said. \u201cI admired that in him and will be conscientious of that throughout my term.\u201d\n\n\n\nGary L.
