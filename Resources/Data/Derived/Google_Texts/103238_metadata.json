And the Dodd-Frank \u201cWall Street\u201d reform package that Obama rammed through Congress is forcing endless compliance costs on businesses.\n\nObama puts a damper on business activity by bashing CEOs and a variety of legal business practices, suggesting an anti-business climate that convinces corporations they just might want to ride out his presidency before deciding to invest.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think there has been a president in my lifetime who has been more hostile to business than Obama,\" veteran GOP consultant Ed Rogers wrote last year in the Washington Post. \"I could be corrected, but I don\u2019t think anyone in the president\u2019s Cabinet has ever started a business, and I would doubt that many of his senior staffers have either. At the end of the day, Obama doesn\u2019t seem to have much respect for what it takes to start a business. And this cratering in the number of start-ups under his administration reminds us of the gratuitous smackdown he gave business owners everywhere during the 2012 campaign when he pointedly said, 'If you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that.'\"\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Average GDP growth under Obama has been less than two percent, among the worst \u2014 if not the worst \u2014 in modern presidential history. Earnings have declined, and the number of people who have opted out of the workforce is at levels not seen in 40 years.\n\nThe president isn't quite finished inflicting damage, preparing a \"flurry\" on regulations to which he wants businesses newly chained, the Wall Street Journal has reported.\n\nRelated Content PoliZette Obama Power Play Executive actions on carbon emissions latest end-run around Congress\n\n\"Planned moves \u2014 across labor, health, finance and the environment \u2014 range from overtime pay for white-collar workers to more obscure matters such as requiring food makers to disclose added sugar on cartons of flavored milk,\" the Journal said.\n\n\"The expected burst of regulation follows an intense few weeks in which the administration has targeted corporate tax inversions, imposed new rules on brokers and advanced restrictions on company relations with union organizers.\"\n\nObama is rushing the rules along so that they can be written by mid-May, with the goal of finalizing before a potential Republican Congress and president overturn them. He needs to get the regulations on the books at least 60 days before a Republican president might take office.\n\nOf course, the longer he waits, the fewer businesses there will be, reducing some of the work federal paper pushers will need to do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is there any president in recent memory who has done so much harm to America's businesses, large and small?
