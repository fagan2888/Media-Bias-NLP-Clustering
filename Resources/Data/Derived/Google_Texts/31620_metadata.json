Merely the presence of browsing through a webpage is enough to infect a computer.\n\nOnline ads are often run by third-party companies and aren\u2019t directly overseen by companies like Google and Yahoo.\n\nWhile that may make it less expensive for those companies, \u201cit can lead to greater hazards for consumers,\u201d said McCain.\n\nExecutives from Yahoo and Google said they supported efforts to allow companies to share threats with each other but rejected the idea that they should be held liable for malware channeled through their networks.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the criminals are liable for their actions,\u201d Stamos said.\n\nThat claim is \u201csort of like the automobile that has a problem, but the maker of the automobile is not responsible because they\u2019re just the person who sold it,\u201d McCain retorted.\n\nIn previous years, McCain has backed the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights Act, which would require companies to be up front about what information they are collecting and how it would be used. The White House has also pushed for similar protections for people's data and searches online.\n\nMcCain said on Thursday that he was eyeing the chance to \u201creinvigorate\u201d that bill or a similar measure to protect Web users.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me there should be standards of enforcement, standards of behavior, standards of skin, standards [for companies] to do everything they can to prevent the consumer being harmed,\u201d McCain said. \u201cAnd then, if they don\u2019t employ those practices, they should be held responsible.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission can go after companies with \u201cdeceptive\u201d ads, but critics said that has not been enough to stop online criminals.\n\nCraig Spiezle, the executive director of the information security working group Online Trust Alliance, said companies have \u201clittle incentive\u201d to share information. He said Congress should pass a law requiring companies to notify federal regulators if they come across a case of malvertising.\n\nNot all members of the subcommittee supported new legislation.\n\nMajor Web firms \u201chave enormous financial incentives to try and police this and prevent malvertising and malware,\u201d said Sen.
