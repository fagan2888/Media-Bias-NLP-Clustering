And, candidly, the chances of a show like this making it are slim to none,\u201d host Carson Daly said of his and others\u2019 reactions when they were approached for the American version of \u201cThe Voice of Holland.\u201d \u201cNone of us cared about another one of these singing shows. But then when I went into the first meeting and saw the format I knew it was different.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s made a major difference for NBC, helping boost the network\u2019s ratings to No. 1 among the Big Four networks in adults ages 18-49 and every other key demographic. Last week \u201cThe Voice\u201d ranked No. 5 overall, and last Tuesday\u2019s show ranked No. 7, according to an NBC statement.\n\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t mention \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Audrey Morrissey, executive producer of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d said coaches for the show had to have the right spirit.\n\n\u201cI think one core value is that we always wanted our coaches to be vibrant, active artists,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always have the understanding that people, if they are going to be in that realm on the show, take time off and commit to the show.\u201d\n\nSounds basic, but that and the \u201cblind audition\u201d \u2014 when coaches only hear the contestant \u2014 are what set it apart. The producers built the show around coaches working with mentees who compete for the grand prize of a recording contract.\n\nIn a press conference before the show\u2019s April 2011 debut, Maroon 5 singer and coach Adam Levine stressed the mentoring aspect: \u201cJudging is kind of a dirty word around here.\u201d\n\nFirst season contestant Jared Blake, who last month released the six-song EP \u201c\u2018Til Morning Light,\u201d said those words are true.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t realize how much you get or how different it is [from similar shows] until it\u2019s over,\u201d said Mr. Blake, whose coach was country star Blake Shelton. \u201cI was a little scared to go on any reality show, especially knowing how they have worked.\n\n\u201cWhat I found was it was completely different from what I expected. [The show\u2019s producers] weren\u2019t trying to start fights or make fun of people. There was some drama behind the scenes, but it was never shown. They really worked hard to keep it professional.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mr. Blake writes, performs and records the same type of country music as his coach, Mr. Shelton didn\u2019t try to mold him in his professional image.\n\n\u201cBlake gave me a lot of response right off the bat,\u201d Mr. Blake said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to teach you about writing or about performing. I\u2019m going to teach you how to develop your career once you leave the show.\u2019\u201d\n\nMr. Blake took Mr. Shelton\u2019s advice and works hard to develop a fan base. He shares his personal addiction stories as a supporter of \u201cLive to be Sober\u201d and organized \u201cThe Movement,\u201d a series of concerts at campgrounds designed to bring families together.\n\nSuch advocacy is just another positive from the coaching choices made for \u201cThe Voice,\u201d said Ms. Morrissey.", "article_metadata": {"description": "You're to be forgiven for thinking the \"Knockout\" rounds tonight and tomorrow on NBC's \"The Voice\" could result in fisticuffs.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "You\u2019re to be forgiven for thinking the \u201cKnockout\u201d rounds tonight and tomorrow on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d could result in fisticuffs.", "title": "Knockout rounds in NBC\u2019s \u2018The Voice\u2019 all professional, not personal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/26/strictly-musical/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/26/10262014_voice-1-nup-165179-8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/26/10262014_voice-1-nup-165179-8201.jpg", "description": "You're to be forgiven for thinking the \"Knockout\" rounds tonight and tomorrow on NBC's \"The Voice\" could result in fisticuffs.", "card": "summary", "title": "Knockout rounds in NBC\u2019s \u2018The Voice\u2019 all professiona"}, "Author": "Nancy Dunham \u2014 Special to The Washington Times", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Audrey Morrissey, NBC, Blake Shelton"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re to be forgiven for thinking the \u201cKnockout\u201d rounds tonight and tomorrow on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d could result in fisticuffs.\n\u201cBlake gave me a lot of response right off the bat,\u201d Mr. Blake said.\nThey really worked hard to keep it professional.\u201dAlthough Mr. Blake writes, performs and records the same type of country music as his coach, Mr. Shelton didn\u2019t try to mold him in his professional image.\nAlthough she doesn\u2019t mention \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Audrey Morrissey, executive producer of \u201cThe Voice,\u201d said coaches for the show had to have the right spirit.\nSuch advocacy is just another positive from the coaching choices made for \u201cThe Voice,\u201d said Ms. Morrissey."}
