In South Carolina, the fastest a moped is allowed to go is 30 mph.\n\nThat\u2019s turned the proposed moped changes into a classic urban vs. rural feud: what might make sense in Charleston or Columbia doesn\u2019t play as well in the Upstate or the Pee Dee.\n\nRep. Walt McLeod, D-Little Mountain, said that in rural areas of the state, people trying to make it to work are forced to take farm-to-market roads with a 55 mph speed limit.\n\n\u201cThere seems to have been a coalition at work to basically forbid mopeds from being functional transportation devices,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want them around. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nAt least three bills are moving through committees and two have already passed the House. One calls for classifying mopeds as motor vehicles. The second calls for riders to wear reflective vests and attach a blinking light to the back of their two-wheelers.\n\nBut a third, more comprehensive bill being discussed in the House Transportation Subcommittee would also require riders to obtain a moped license, to register their moped, pay for a plate and get insurance. Plus, it would bar those with suspended licenses from obtaining a moped license, and the ban is reciprocal. Riders would have until 2018 to comply with the new law.\n\n\u201cI get complaints almost every week about mopeds,\u201d said Rep. Joe Daning, R-Goose Creek. \u201cI\u2019ve had complaints about people on mopeds being drunk.\u201d\n\nDaning, who is a co-sponsor of the comprehensive bill, said the state is simply trying to limit the possibility of someone getting hurt, from the riders who get hit by a car that doesn\u2019t spot them fast enough to potential habitual drunks.\n\n\u201cMany people on mopeds are getting killed on highways,\u201d said Rep. Bill Crosby, R-North Charleston, the sponsor of the bill. He added that law enforcement asked him to fix the statute because it\u2019s hard to convict drunken riders who are not considered drivers under the law.\n\nMoped fatalities in South Carolina rose through 2012 and dropped in 2013 from 37 to 25. Earlier this month, 56-year-old Clifford Jackson was killed in Berkeley County while riding a moped when he crashed into a truck after running a red light, according to the South Carolina Highway Patrol. On Thursday, a moped rider was killed when a pickup turned in front of the two-wheeler in Berkeley County.\n\nThose are all concerns McLeod said he understands. However, he said, tractors, bicycles and other slow-moving farm vehicles are often on the road and no one is trying to kick them off.\n\nHe said he doesn\u2019t want drunken drivers to escape the law any more than anyone else, but they still have to get to work. In many rural areas, public transportation is not an option.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no fun to think about, but they need to remain productive members of society,\u201d McLeod said of those with suspended licenses who turn to mopeds. \u201cIf you can\u2019t go to work, you don\u2019t have any money, you become a member of the under class and you can never get out.\u201d\n\nReach Cynthia Roldan at 708-5891.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lawmakers trying to close moped loophole in rural vs. urban debate, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLegislature, \r\nState Government, \r\nState Government, Bill Crosby,Columbia,Joe Daning,legislature,mopeds,Walton McLeod", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are hoping to close a loophole that has allowed drunken drivers and others whose licenses have been suspended or revoked to skirt the law by hopping behind the handlebars of mopeds.", "title": "Lawmakers trying to close moped loophole in rural vs. urban debate", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150425/150429599/lawmakers-trying-to-close-moped-loophole-in-rural-vs-urban-debate", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150425/PC1603/150429599/AR/0/AR-150429599.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150425/PC1603/150429599/AR/0/AR-150429599.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are hoping to close a loophole that has allowed drunken drivers and others whose licenses have been suspended or revoked to skirt the law by hopping behind the handlebars of mopeds.", "title": "Lawmakers trying to close moped loophole in rural vs. urban debate", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150425/PC1603/150429599/AR/0/AR-150429599.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150429599}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Lawmakers trying to close moped loophole in rural vs. urban debate , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLegislature, \r\nState Government, \r\nState Government, Bill Crosby,Columbia,Joe Daning,legislature,mopeds,Walton McLeod", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-25T17:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T17:48:00Z", "author": "Cynthia Roldan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 South Carolina\u2019s lawmakers are hoping to close a loophole that has allowed drunken drivers and others whose licenses have been suspended or revoked to skirt the law by hopping behind the handlebars of mopeds."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde57d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere seems to have been a coalition at work to basically forbid mopeds from being functional transportation devices,\u201d McLeod said.\nThat\u2019s turned the proposed moped changes into a classic urban vs. rural feud: what might make sense in Charleston or Columbia doesn\u2019t play as well in the Upstate or the Pee Dee.\nIn South Carolina, the fastest a moped is allowed to go is 30 mph.\nPlus, it would bar those with suspended licenses from obtaining a moped license, and the ban is reciprocal.\nMoped fatalities in South Carolina rose through 2012 and dropped in 2013 from 37 to 25."}
