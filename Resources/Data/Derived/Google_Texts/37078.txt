Minnesotans are getting the best bargains from the new healthcare law premiums, followed by residents of northwestern Pennsylvania and Tucson, Arizona.

Kaiser Health News and NPR ranked U.S. regions based on the lowest cost of a “silver” plan, a mid-range marketplace health insurance plan level that most Americans opt for. Why is Minnesota consistently ranking high for good premiums? The state’s high-density hospitals and healthcare systems creates more competition between hospitals and doctors, according to Kaiser. Premiums for the top four regions are half that of the most expensive areas in the country.

Here are the top 10 places where you can get a great deal on health care:

$154: Minneapolis-St. Paul

$164: Pittsburgh and Northwestern Pennsylvania

$166: Middle Minnesota

$167: Tucson, Ariz.

$171: Northwestern Minnesota

$173: Salt Lake City

$176: Hawaii

$180: Knoxville, Tenn.

$180: Western and North Central Minnesota.

$181: Chattanooga, Tenn.
