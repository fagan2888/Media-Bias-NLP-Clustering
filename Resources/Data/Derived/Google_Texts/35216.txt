MARQUETTE — Many of us who haven’t already filed income tax returns for the previous year are starting to prepare them right now.

The process can be confusing, but there’s free assistance available. Certified volunteers provide help nationwide through the AARP Foundation Tax-Aide Program. A group of volunteers is doing that at the Marquette Senior Center.

“We also do a couple of days in Negaunee and a couple of days in the Gwinn area,” Tax–Aide local coordinator Richard Brich said. “With that, we would love to be able to establish some more sites.”

The program works with seniors and low-to-moderate income residents. The start of Obamacare is affecting the returns of some of the people that have come in for help.

“The big thing is, if they don’t have health care coverage and they don’t meet certain exemptions, they’re going to be hit with a penalty,” Brich said. “I’ve already had three people since (February) 3rd that have been hit with penalties.”

Volunteers will be at the center every Tuesday and Friday through April 7th. The free assistance is also confidential.
