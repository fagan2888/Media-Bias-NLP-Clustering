While this comes just one day late for Halloween, I'd like to think that this blood-spurting exclusive clip from tonight's episode of "Untold Stories of the ER" (Fri. Nov. 1 at 10:00 p.m. on Discovery Fit & Health) might extend the holiday for you just a little bit. It's not a zombie apocalypse, but it's something!

In this clip, we learn about how one patient's vomiting jag rips apart the carotid patchwork on his throat. The result is one big mess that may not be possible to fix. There's a storm in town, and the small hospital isn't equipped to help this guy, who's too unstable to move. His I.V. has come out, the nurse can't find a vein, and he's going into shock. It's a nail biter, but I'm hopeful, aren't you?
