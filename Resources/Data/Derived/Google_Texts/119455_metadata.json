Quite the opposite, actually.\n\nJust like most western governments, the US government has gone deeply into debt to fund its social insurance programs.\n\nOfficially, the US government is now $18.5 trillion in debt, and Social Security is the biggest financial sinkhole in America.\n\nSocial Security\u2019s various trust funds currently hold about $2.7 trillion in total assets; yet the government itself estimates the program\u2019s liabilities to exceed $40 trillion.\n\nAnd Social Security\u2019s second biggest trust fund, the Disability Insurance fund, will be fully depleted in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe trustees who manage these massive funds on behalf of the current and future retirees of America are clearly concerned.\n\nIn the 2015 report of the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees they state very plainly:\n\n\u201cSocial Security as a whole as well as Medicare cannot sustain projected long-run program costs\u2026\u201d, and that the government should be \u201cgiving the public adequate time to prepare.\u201d\n\nWow.\n\nNow, we always hear politicians say that \u2018Social Security is going to be just fine\u2019. So this Board of Trustees must be a bunch of wackos. Who are these guys anyhow?\n\nThe Treasury Secretary of the United States of America, as it turns out. Along with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Labor. Etc.\n\nThese are the folks who sign their name to the report saying that Social Security is going bust, and that Congress needs to give people time to prepare.\n\nAnd prepare they should.\n\nThe US Government Accountability Office recently released a report showing that tens of millions of Americans haven\u2019t saved a penny for retirement; and roughly half of Baby Boomers have zero retirement savings.\n\nThis means that there\u2019s an overwhelming number of Americans pinning all of their retirement hopes on Social Security.\n\nBad idea. In a recently proposed resolution, H. Res 488, Congress states point blank that Social Security \u201cwas never intended by Congress to be the sole source of retirement income for families.\u201d\n\nApparently they got the message from the Social Security Trustees and they want to start preparing people for the inevitable truth.\n\nThis is no longer some wild conspiracy theory.\n\nThe Treasury Secretary is saying it. Congress is saying it. The numbers are screaming it: Social Security is going to fail.\n\nUltimately this is a just another chapter in the same story\u2013 that government cannot be relied on to provide or produce, only to squander and fail.\n\nSure, their intentions may be noble. But this level of serial incompetence can no longer be trusted, nor should we be foolish enough to believe that some new candidate can fix it.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your fifties and beyond, you\u2019re probably going to be OK and at least get 10-15 years of benefits.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your 40s and below, you have to be 100% prepared to fend for yourself.\n\nFortunately you have time to recover. Time to build. And time to learn.\n\nFinancial literacy is absolutely critical here, which includes the ability to both generate income and manage money, two things that aren\u2019t taught in the government controlled education system.\n\nYou might also consider some lifestyle adjustments, which may include moving abroad where your money can go much, much further.\n\nUltimately, learning to rely on yourself is no easy task, but it is an incredible opportunity to become more free.\n\nAnd in doing so, one day you will no longer panic about the decisions being made by incompetent bureaucrats, because you will be the one in control of your own fate.\n\nLike this article?
