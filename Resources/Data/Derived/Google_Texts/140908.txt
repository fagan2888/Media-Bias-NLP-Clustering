Two Mosaic Co. employees were injured when an explosion rocked the phosphate company's Riverview plant off of Highway 41 this afternoon, Hillsborough County Fire Rescue spokesman Ronnie Rivera said.

An empty acid tank exploded during routine maintenance, causing the top to fly approximately 100 feet in the air and come crashing to the ground, Rivera said. The explosion also sent up a cloud 100 feet above the plant.

The two employees were taken to the hospital with what were deemed non-life threatening injuries, Rivera said.

According to The Associated Press, one worker who had been standing on the structure was struck in the chest by shrapnel. The other injured worker was on the ground.

Hillsborough County Fire Rescue's Hazardous Incident Team was on the scene after the explosion, metering the air for safety.
