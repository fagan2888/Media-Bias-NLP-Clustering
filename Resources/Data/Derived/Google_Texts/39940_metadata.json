Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood morning.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\u2022 The wild ride continues.\n\nChina\u2019s economic uncertainty is keeping the markets volatile today, with trading marked by wide swings but not resulting in big losses or big gains so far.\n\nU.S. stocks are up more than 1 percent, but European shares ended down, after a 1.3 percent fall in the Shanghai index.\n\nThe volatility will most likely give the world\u2019s central bankers pause at their annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., starting on Thursday. Before the market turmoil, Federal Reserve officials had signaled that U.S. growth was strong enough that interest rates could rise next month.\n\n\u2022 Two reporters killed on live TV.\n\nTwo journalists were shot and killed this morning while broadcasting live from a strip mall in Moneta, Va., near Roanoke.\n\nVideo from the shooting appeared to show a crew from WDB-7 News in Roanoke being attacked. The station confirmed that the shooting involved members of its crew.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Trump shuns Latino journalist.\n\n\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump snubbed and ejected Jorge Ramos, a prominent news anchor at Univision and Fusion, when he tried to ask a question without being called on.\n\nThe confrontation extended the adversarial relationship between Mr. Trump and the Spanish-language news media. Mr. Ramos returned 15 minutes after being removed by a security guard to continue his verbal tussle.\n\n\u2022 Echoes of 2008.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders appears to be drawing even more support from small donors than Senator Barack Obama did in 2008, a study shows, with an average contribution of $31.30.\n\nA new poll shows Hillary Rodham Clinton with a strong lead over Mr. Sanders in Iowa, however. And Martin O\u2019Malley attends 30 house parties across Iowa today.\n\n\u2022 Making peace.\n\nThe president of South Sudan signed an agreement today to end an 18-month civil war. The U.N. Security Council had threatened unspecified \u201cimmediate action\u201d if he didn\u2019t follow through.\n\nAnd Kosovo and Serbia on Tuesday signed a deal brokered by the European Union that puts them on track to normalize ties. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008.\n\n\u2022 Inaccurate ISIS analysis?\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s inspector general is investigating whether military officials portrayed too optimistically the intelligence assessments of the U.S.-led campaign in Iraq against the Islamic State, according to unnamed officials.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox. Monday \u2013 Friday.\n\n\u2022 Sorry, Washington.\n\nCommuters in the U.S. capital suffer from the worst gridlock in the country, wasting 82 hours a year stuck in traffic, a report released today says. That\u2019s nearly twice the national average.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMARKETS\n\n\u2022 Oshkosh Defense in Wisconsin won a Pentagon contract, potentially worth $30 billion, to make the ground vehicle that will replace the Humvee.\n\n\u2022 Disney is teaming up with YouTube, ABC and retail chains around the world to begin selling merchandise next week for the newest \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie, due out in December.\n\n\u2022 Burger King is proposing a one-day truce with McDonald\u2019s to sell a blend of their burgers called the McWhopper.\n\nA pop-up store staffed by workers from both chains would donate proceeds to raise awareness of the International Day of Peace on Sept. 21.\n\nNOTEWORTHY\n\n\u2022 Remember to bring safety goggles.\n\nAbout 22,000 people in Bu\u00f1ol, Spain, take part today in La Tomatina, the world\u2019s largest food fight, featuring about 150 tons of overripe tomatoes.\n\nIt started at the end of World War II, when a street brawl broke out near a vegetable store. So much fun was had that it became an annual event.\n\n\u2022 Wanted: exit strategy.\n\nIn the thriller \u201cNo Escape,\u201d opening today, an American family in a Southeast Asian nation has to find a way out of the country after a violent coup. The film stars Owen Wilson, Lake Bell and Pierce Brosnan.\n\n\u2022 What\u2019s on TV.\n\n\u201cKatrina 10 Years Later\u201d features New Orleans residents who endured the 2005 hurricane, including one who spent the night on the roof of his house as his 4-year-old granddaughter and his elderly mother died (8 p.m. Eastern, BET).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd \u201cThe Carmichael Show\u201d is a new sitcom inspired by the actor Jerrod Carmichael\u2019s relationship with his outspoken family (9 p.m. Eastern, NBC).\n\n\u2022 Passing the torch.\n\nOrganizers in Los Angeles, the city likely to replace Boston as the U.S. bidder for the 2024 Olympics, released financial projections that put the cost of hosting the Games at $4.1 billion.\n\n\u2022 A step toward equality.\n\nNinety-five years ago today, American women got the right to vote when the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was declared in effect. Today, it is celebrated as Women\u2019s Equality Day.\n\n\u2022 In memoriam.\n\nAugusta Chiwy, a black Belgian nurse who saved countless Americans wounded in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, even though black nurses were barred from treating white soldiers, died near Brussels. She was 94.\n\nBACK STORY\n\nCompetitors take the stage in Oulu, Finland, today as the 20th Air Guitar World Championships begin.\n\nThe hallmark of air guitar, of course, is that you don\u2019t need an actual guitar.\n\nYou also don\u2019t need to know how to read music or take pricey lessons. You can practice anywhere and won\u2019t disturb anyone (at least not with noise).\n\nWhat\u2019s most needed is an air-guitar-friendly song, so that you can impress the judges in the categories of charisma, technical skill and the vague notion of \u201cairness.\u201d There\u2019s also a separate award for audience favorite.\n\nPhoto\n\nWe don\u2019t have a clue who the first person to play air guitar was, but one of the earliest known public renditions was by Joe Cocker at the Woodstock music festival in 1969, as a prelude to his performance of \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNational winners from Germany, India, Japan, Russia, the U.S. and other countries are in this week\u2019s showdown.
