San Francisco artist Wei Li has designed a line of so-called \u201cDangerous Popsicles\u201d that give new life to the hazardous bacteria, which normally infect our bodies, not delight our taste buds.\n\nLi\u2019s project of magnifying bacteria and viruses like HIV, E. Coli (Escherichia coli), MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), influenza, and chicken pox stems from her desire to bring a fun sense of familiarity to an otherwise gross and off-putting subject. \u201cThe idea was to explore how our preexisting knowledge of something will influence our perception of something else,\u201d Li told the NY Daily News. Popsicles are inviting, but at the same time, your brain also knows you\u2019re licking a deadly virus.\n\nThe frozen creations are simply made of sugar water, their molds cast from a 3D printer. Li says she had visions of making the project a unique tactile experience, which she invites people to recreate on their own with the help of some modeling software and silicone molds. The popsicles aren\u2019t for sale, though Li\u2019s focus group of coworkers already seems to be onboard with the project.\n\n\u201cThe idea is a little bit disturbing, but I do want the experience to be delightful and intriguing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe general response I got from people was more on the delight side.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dangerous, popsicles, 3d, printed, look, bacteria, strains, e, coli, mrsa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Artist Wei Li wanted to bring a sense of fun to the deadly world of infectious disease.
