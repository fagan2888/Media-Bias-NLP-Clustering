A new poll from CNN found Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) have risen while Walker has fallen in with the rest of the pack.\n\nTo be clear, the early and fluid race has been consistently close and Walker has never registered a double-digit lead over his opponents. Nonetheless, six weeks ago he\u2019d edged out Jeb Bush for first, nabbing 18% in a CNN poll to the latter\u2019s 16%, with the rest of the field trailed. Today\u2019s CNN poll, however, finds Bush maintaining his support while Walker is statistically tied with Rubio and Paul at 12% and 11%, respectively. The deflated numbers suggest at least some of Walker\u2019s early appeal was a lack of contenders.\n\nMeanwhile today\u2019s poll was Rubio\u2019s best showing yet, reflecting a boost from his announcement last week; Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), the first to announce, remains out of the top five, his support marooned in the far right of the party.\n\nHowever, nobody in the GOP should be celebrating the following:\n\nMarco Rubio fares best against the former first lady, trailing Clinton by 14 points, 55% to 41%. Bush trails Clinton by 17 points, 56% to 39%. Christie and Paul fall 19 points behind Clinton, each putting up 39% to Clinton\u2019s 58%. Huckabee, Walker, Carson and Cruz each trail Clinton by more than 20 points.\n\nAll normal polling caveats apply: nobody votes for almost a year, national polls are not indicative of the results of a state-based electoral system, etc.\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to a series of rollouts by his possible rivals, Scott Walker's advantage has dissipated.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scott-walker1.jpg", "title": "Scott Walker Loses Polling Advantage, Everybody Loses to Clinton"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to a series of rollouts by his possible rivals, Scott Walker's advantage has dissipated.", "title": "Scott Walker Loses Polling Advantage, Everybody Loses to Clinton", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/scott-walker1.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-04-20T10:30:25+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc07c\"", "article_summary": "Today\u2019s CNN poll, however, finds Bush maintaining his support while Walker is statistically tied with Rubio and Paul at 12% and 11%, respectively.\nA new poll from CNN found Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) have risen while Walker has fallen in with the rest of the pack.\nChristie and Paul fall 19 points behind Clinton, each putting up 39% to Clinton\u2019s 58%.\nHuckabee, Walker, Carson and Cruz each trail Clinton by more than 20 points.\nNonetheless, six weeks ago he\u2019d edged out Jeb Bush for first, nabbing 18% in a CNN poll to the latter\u2019s 16%, with the rest of the field trailed."}
