UPDATED: The ABC News journalist is set to sit down with "Hunger Games" second-unit director Peter Rodger less than a month after she officially retired from daytime TV.

So much for Barbara Waltersâ€™ retirement.



The former View host, who officially retired from daytime TV in May, is set to interview the father of Santa Barbara shooting suspect Elliot Rodger, ABC News announced Monday.



Walters will interview Peter Rodger, who was a second-unit director on The Hunger Games, for a piece that will air on an upcoming special edition of 20/20. It's unclear exactly when the interview will take place. But it is yet another booking coup for Walters and ABC News. And sources tell THR that representatives for the Rodger family actually requested Walters for the interview. With every TV news booker working to land Peter Rodger, ABC News got a call earlier Monday asking if Walters was available.

Walters officially retired from daytime TV on May 16, when her final episode as co-host of The View aired. The show was preceded by an array of farewell celebrations, including a dedication ceremony in which ABC News' New York headquarters was renamed "The Barbara Walters Building."

Despite leaving The View, it was always the plan for Walters to remain a part of the ABC News team, contributing as news warrants.

As her official retirement approached, many of her colleagues were skeptical about how long she'd stay off television.
