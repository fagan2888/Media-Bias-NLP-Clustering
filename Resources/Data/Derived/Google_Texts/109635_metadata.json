But what is it that motivates kids to take it seriously, and commit to the sort of practice that can turn them into skilled musicians?\n\nAccording to newly published research that checked in with budding virtuosos as they started their studies, and again 10 years later, successful students tend to be those who have \u201ca sense of where their future learning may take them, and whose personal identity includes a long-term perspective of themselves as musicians.\u201d\n\nWhile some of that long-range thinking no doubt emerges from an inner drive, the study finds it is strongly influenced by the role music plays in both their home and school environments.\n\nIn the journal Psychology of Music, Australian researchers Paul Evans of the University of New South Wales and Gary McPherson of the University of Melbourne describe a study featuring 157 young instrumentalists. The kids, ages seven to nine, were first approached in 1997, as they were \u201cabout to commence learning music in a primary school band program.\u201d\n\nThe kids were interviewed as part of a broader study designed to measure what factors influenced their later learning. Among the questions they were asked was: \u201cHow long do you think you will continue playing an instrument?\u201d\n\nTheir school music programs were rated as either \u201cbasic\u201d or \u201cenriched.\u201d The latter ranking, which was earned by five of the eight schools the children attended, was reserved for schools \u201cwhere the band was a prominent activity that was visible and well-integrated over a number of years into the culture of the school.\u201d\n\nThe researchers checked in with the kids and their mothers periodically over the following three years, to determine how much they were practicing. They then re-established contact 10 years after those initial interviews, noting how long the children continued playing their instrument, what musical activities (if any) they were involved with in high school, and the highest they had scored on a standard test of musical ability.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Data reveals successful students tend to be those who have \u201ca sense of where their future learning may take them\"", "title": "How to motivate a young musician", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Data reveals successful students tend to be those who have \u201ca sense of where their future learning may take them\"", "title": "How to motivate a young musician", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/how_to_motivate_a_young_musician_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_115261459.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Data reveals successful students tend to be those who have \u201ca sense of where their future learning may take them\"", "title": "How to motivate a young musician", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/shutterstock_115261459.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Tom Jacobs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Instruments, Music, Musicians, Pacific Standard, Students", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1157\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Instruments, Music, Musicians, Pacific Standard, Students, Life NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\nIn the journal Psychology of Music, Australian researchers Paul Evans of the University of New South Wales and Gary McPherson of the University of Melbourne describe a study featuring 157 young instrumentalists.\nGiven all the recent research into the benefits of learning a musical instrument, it makes sense that parents encourage their youngsters to give it a try.\nBut what is it that motivates kids to take it seriously, and commit to the sort of practice that can turn them into skilled musicians?\nThe kids, ages seven to nine, were first approached in 1997, as they were \u201cabout to commence learning music in a primary school band program.\u201dThe kids were interviewed as part of a broader study designed to measure what factors influenced their later learning."}
