Maybe, maybe not. A government panel says there\u2019s not yet enough data to recommend either for or against it. The panel\u2019s uncertainty reflects the complexity of the issue at a time when scientists are progressing much faster in their ability to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s than in their ability to treat it.\n\nThis news is especially relevant in light of the recent discovery of a blood test that can predict with 90 percent accuracy who will get mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer\u2019s within two to three years. Mild cognitive impairment is a less severe form of memory loss than dementia. It sometimes, but not always, progresses to Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n>> Sign up for the AARP Health Newsletter\n\nJust last week, Maria Carrillo, vice president of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, told NPR that identifying people at high risk for Alzheimer\u2019s could help scientists find treatments that can stop the disease before it takes hold. Currently, more than 5 million Americans have the disease, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, and a new study found that the condition may cause up to six times more deaths than previously reported.\n\nSo wouldn\u2019t it make sense to find out who will get Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nNot so fast, says Douglas Owens, M.D., professor of medicine at Stanford University and a member of the task force that published the recommendations in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Screening every older person for dementia or mild cognitive impairment isn\u2019t worthwhile because there are presently no treatments that work to slow the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease or reverse memory problems. The panel noted that the best argument for screening would be to give the patient and potential caregivers the opportunity to plan for the future, but the panel didn\u2019t find any studies showing that the ability to plan for Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other memory problems was either helpful or harmful.\n\nOwens, however, stresses that this recommendation applies only to people who aren\u2019t worried about their memory. \u201cIf someone has concerns, or their family is concerned, they should see their doctor for an evaluation,\u201d he says. Currently, screening tests involve doctors asking patients to perform tasks to evaluate memory, language and attention. It will be years before doctors can use the new blood test, and biomarker tests to diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s are far from conclusive.\n\n>> Get discounts on health services with your AARP Member Advantages\n\nWith the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, Medicare began covering the detection of cognitive impairment as a part of the annual wellness visit benefit in 2011. In 2013, the Alzheimer\u2019s Association published guidelines to help primary care doctors assess cognitive impairment at the wellness visit.\n\nPhoto: sunabesyou/iStock\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Should older adults be routinely\u00a0screened for Alzheimer\u2019s disease or memory problems?
