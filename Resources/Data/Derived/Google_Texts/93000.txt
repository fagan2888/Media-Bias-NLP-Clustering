A stark and searing reminder that Healthcare.gov’s ongoing struggles and security vulnerabilities are only a small component of Obamacare’s comprehensive failure. After the website’s myriad technical difficulties are at long last sorted out, mass cancellations, rising premiums and doc shock will remain as the devastating residual legacy of President Obama’s top legislative “accomplishment.” Every one of those consequences represents a broken White House promise. Meet young Ellie Porter and her family, who’ve experienced the new law’s affects firsthand. Heartbreaking:

Having a child diagnosed with cancer is an unimaginable ordeal for any family, and adding any challenges on top of it can seem overwhelming. Paul and Jami Porter of Kaysville learned last week their insurance plan was terminated under the Affordable Care Act, more than 3 1/2 months into their daughter’s fight with undifferentiated sarcoma began.

Six-year-old Ellie Porter, who has had one kidney removed, just wrapped up her radiation treatments and is expected to be done with chemotherapy around the first of the year.

“You’re getting used to what’s going on; and then all of a sudden having something like this thrown in is definitely challenging and frustrating at the same time,” Paul Porter said. He and his wife are now in the middle of shopping for a new plan that complies with the Affordable Care Act. He said the old plan didn’t meet some of the requirements, according to a letter from the insurer. The options the family is weighing have premiums that are more than double the premiums under their previous plan, Paul Porter said. Additionally, the Porters said they had limited time to sign up for a new plan and didn’t have all the information they felt they needed to make an informed decision. Like many others across the nation, they were also struggling to simply enroll through the federal website, healthcare.gov.
