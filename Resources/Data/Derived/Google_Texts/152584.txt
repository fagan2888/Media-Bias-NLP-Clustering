After an officer was stabbed multiple times by an inmate at the Hutchinson Correctional Facility Wednesday, a former employee shares what his experience there was like and the issues they face with staffing.

Phil McAmis of Hutchinson worked at the facility for thirteen years. He said he quit two years ago because he was concerned for his safety after budget cuts led to major short-staffing.

"I promise you that there will be an officer killed in the correctional facilities, within the next two years because they are absolutely lacking in their concern for the officers and in their concern for all the staff," said McAmis.

After climbing the ranks to Sergeant at the facility, he quit for a sales job because he felt his safety was at risk almost every day.

"I've seen everything from fecal matter thrown at officers, I've seen toilet paper caught on fire and thrown at staff," said McAmis. "Fights, yeah I've been in many fights, I break up many fights. They're doing it constantly out there."

On Wednesday morning, an inmate stabbed an officer thirteen times in the neck with a 6-8 inch piece of plexiglass.

"The bad thing about this is I saw this coming," said McAmis. "Since that time that I left we've had three officers badly hurt. We've had one inmate killed."

McAmis said the main issue in under staffing. The Kansas Dept. of Corrections said the facility is down 43 officers. A current officer who not to be named said it can get dangerous.

"You're talking about an officer watching about 200 inmates at one time and we are talking about the worst of the worst inmates."

McAmis said this has been going on for the past five years, ever since the facility faced major budget cuts. But the KDOC said there's no under-staffing situation there, adding that the 43 vacancies come from turnover.

"They may say they're fully staffed, but the fact of the matter is they're not fully staffed because they've eliminated jobs to save money," said McAmis.
