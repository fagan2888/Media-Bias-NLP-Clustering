A Hennessey man was arrested after police received reports he had molested a girl in his home, according to the Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation.

Agents say William Jay Chestnut, 53, was booked on a complaint of lewd acts with a child. Hennessey Police arrested Chestnut Friday after interviewing him at the police station.

"Agents will continue to investigate to determine if more victims exit," a news release states.

The Kingfisher County District Attorney requested the OSBI investigate the case.
