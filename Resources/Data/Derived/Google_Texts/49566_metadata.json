They are being covered mainly by local news outlets (though such national outlets as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal have also dipped into these waters). But these occasional pieces have been utterly overwhelmed by reporting on the downside of ObamaCare: the botched rollout, the dysfunctional website and millions dropped by their insurance companies.\n\nAs the White House sees it, the media criticism of the program is warranted, but the other side of the story is barely being told at the national level. And that, officials believe, is presenting a distorted picture of the program.\n\nObama himself alluded to this view at his news conference by saying: \u201cPart of this job is the things that go right, you guys aren\u2019t going to write about; the things that go wrong get prominent attention.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s put this in perspective:\n\nAt least 3.5 million people have been booted from their health plans\u2014the president\u2019s proposed \u201cfix\u201d is unlikely to help most of them--and millions more have been unable to get on the ObamaCare website or to sign up there.\n\nBy contrast, about 100,000 people have successfully enrolled in the new exchanges, and another 400,000 in the expanded Medicaid program. So in terms of sheer numbers, those who are suffering or stymied by the program are far more newsworthy.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the question of expectations. A health care law designed to extend insurance coverage and federal subsidies to millions of people is supposed to work; that\u2019s not big news. That the program\u2019s rollout was horribly botched and that millions are losing their coverage despite a president\u2019s explicit promise to the contrary, that\u2019s big news.\n\nThe media should not lose sight of those being helped by the Affordable Care Act, but there\u2019s a reason those aren\u2019t the dominant headlines.\n\nCheney vs. Cheney\n\nI bumped into Liz Cheney yesterday before her appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d I told her it wouldn\u2019t be long before Chris Wallace asked her about a poll showing her down 53 points to Mike Enzi in the Wyoming Senate race.\n\nBut a much more telling moment came when Wallace asked Cheney about her opposition to same-sex marriage\u2014in light of the marriage of her sister, Mary Cheney, to Heather Poe.\n\nThe vice president\u2019s daughter said she loved her sister Mary, but \u201cthis is just an area where we disagree.\u201d\n\nThat, as the New York Times notes, brought a sharp rejoinder.\n\n\u2018Liz \u2013 this isn\u2019t just an issue on which we disagree, you\u2019re just wrong \u2013 and on the wrong side of history,\u201d Mary Cheney, who is gay, wrote on her Facebook page.\n\n\u201cMs. Poe\u2019s comments were sharper and more personal. \u2018Liz has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 \u2013 she didn\u2019t hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us,\u2019 Ms. Poe wrote on her own Facebook page. \u2018To have her say she doesn\u2019t support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s got to be tough, when your political position causes such pain for a member of your own family, and she feels the need to hit back.\n\nKiller Gets a Pass\n\nI have rarely read a better example of local journalists missing a big story:\n\n\"We've been hearing the warnings for years now,\" Vincent Duffy, chairman of the Radio Television Digital News Foundation, wrote Thursday. \"At journalism conferences, in the trades, and amongst ourselves we've heard some variation of this: 'If newsrooms keep cutting reporters, while demanding higher story counts, and measuring story success by web-hits, important news is going to start falling through the cracks.' Admittedly when we say it, it sounds more like, 'With fewer people and more to produce, when are we supposed to cover the news?'\n\n\"The election results last week in Flint, Michigan provide a perfect example of what can happen when 'the media' [don't] do their job well. On election day, voters in Flint's fifth ward elected Wantwaz Davis to be their representative on city council. Davis beat the incumbent by 71 votes.\n\n\"The day after the election, the Flint Journal reported, for the first time, that Davis was a 'convicted killer' who served 19 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder in 1991.\n\n\"Yes, you read that correctly, a convicted murderer was on the ballot for city council, and the local newspaper/website, and the local ABC and FOX affiliates, never reported his past until the day after Davis won. (Full disclosure \u2014 as a nearly statewide radio station, Flint is also in my station's listening area. We do not have a reporter there and have been trying unsuccessfully to raise money to create that position.)\n\n\"Newly elected Councilman Davis makes no effort to hide his criminal past. In fact, helping felons who served their time find employment was one of his campaign issues. All a reporter had to do to discover his past was Google his name and scan the items that came up on the first page. Davis also told one of my reporters that he told voters about his past when he canvassed door-to-door, and it came up during a debate sponsored by the NAACP.\n\n\"But it never came to the attention of the newspaper or its political reporter. It wasn\u2019t even mentioned in a now comical looking story by Dominic Adams that the newspaper published under the headline: Everything you need to know about the Fifth Ward Flint City Council race. . . .\"\n\nTOP TWITTER TALK\n\nLiz Cheney\u2019s same-sex sister spat\n\nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).
