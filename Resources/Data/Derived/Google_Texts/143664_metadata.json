But I bet late at night, when he\u2019s having that last smoke and thinking back over his day, he fears that he\u2019s wrong and that the central Republican\u2026\u201cidea,\u201d if you want to call it that, of the last three years\u2014get rid of Obamacare\u2014is going to look awfully stupid to a majority of Americans eight or 10 months from now.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t gone to HealthCare.gov just for kicks, I certainly recommend now that you do. Pretend that you\u2019re from a state that didn\u2019t create an exchange, if you aren\u2019t, because if you\u2019re from a state with its own exchange, you\u2019ll just be kicked to the state website, and what you want to test here is the federal one. So just choose a yahoo state that didn\u2019t play ball, where the law was mocked as just so much socialism.\n\nI just did, for the first time in weeks, an hour before scribbling these sentences. I was amazed. It was lightning fast. Explanations were clear and straightforward. Instead of bureaucratese, I encountered something I didn\u2019t expect at all: plain English!\n\nAnd here\u2019s the key thing. It gave me loads of choices. I pretended to be a 35-year-old man from Kansas with a spouse and child. Without even having to enter my fake income, the site delivered me in a split second to a page with loads of plan options.\n\nChoice. That\u2019s what America\u2019s about. As I heard Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) say on Alex Wagner\u2019s show a couple of weeks ago, we\u2019re a nation of shoppers. It\u2019s what we do best. Alas, he is correct. That\u2019s what we want. From TVs to smartphones to flavors of potato chip that have been stretched to include ketchup and dill pickle (who eats those?), we believe that endless options are our right.\n\nHow many options? An amazing 42, to be precise. Forty-two plans! That might be more than the number of available potato-chip flavors in America. I would have to think it will shock people, in a highly positive way, to see they have so many choices. And most of all, it will feel\u2026American. Something that offers a person 42 options ain\u2019t socialism, as Americans know in their bones.\n\nThe plans ranged from $70 a month, which would have covered only me, to $742 a month for the Rolls-Royce family version, with $0 deductible and $6,500 out-of-pocket. It was an astonishing menu. And take it from a guy who just moved house and has been on the phone and online interminably with private-sector service-providers, mostly but hardly limited to the cable/Internet/phone company: This looked easy. The interface was great, really user-friendly, really clear.\n\nNow, most of these plans weren\u2019t cheap. Health insurance isn\u2019t cheap. For example, a middle-of-the-pack silver plan looked like this: $472 a month; a $7,500 family deductible; a $12,700 out-of-pocket maximum. Those aren\u2019t cheap. But a $10 copay for a doctor\u2019s visit, $75 to see a specialist, and just $15 for a generic prescription. That\u2019s not bad at all.\n\nSo yes, Mr. Speaker, it\u2019s more than a website. It\u2019s a chance for people who\u2019ve eschewed insurance for years to buy it and take their kids to a doctor and even to a specialist when needed. Individuals will have to decide for themselves whether that buys them $5,664 in peace of mind (that\u2019s $472 times 12), but I suspect a lot of people will decide that it sure does.\n\nAnd this is where Republicans, if they\u2019re looking around the corner, might be freaking out. They are going to emphasize the horror stories going forward, and those stories will exist. The Democrats will emphasize the violin stories, and they will exist, too.\n\nBut in between the decontextualized disasters and the stories with Hollywood endings will be millions of people to whom nothing particularly dramatic, but something very positive indeed, will have happened. They got insurance, or decent insurance, for the first time in their lives. They went and got their first physical in years. They had that bad back checked out finally. They took their child to an eye doctor and got her glasses. That\u2019s not dramatic enough for a television ad, but any parent will understand that a child going from struggling with reading to being able to read easily at school is plenty dramatic.\n\nI\u2019ve known for a long time the Republicans were on the wrong side of history here. Forty-something million uninsured in this impossibly rich country, and they don\u2019t want to do a thing about it. And don\u2019t fall for their \u201cplans.\u201d They\u2019re unworkable. They\u2019re unworkable because the Republicans aren\u2019t willing to spend the money that experts all say is required to make plans workable. And they aren\u2019t willing to spend the money because spending money acknowledges the existence of a common purpose in this nation, and they certainly can\u2019t acknowledge a common purpose, unless it\u2019s war.\n\nSo while I\u2019ve known they were on the wrong side of history, I have feared they were on the right side of the politics. Well, I\u2019m starting to think otherwise. No American who has 42 choices is going to feel like the jackboot of the state is stomping on his neck. And sometime next year, the people in the states that didn\u2019t take Medicaid money are going to start noticing something else: that in a lot of cases, they\u2019re going to be paying more for the same plan that a person in a participating state is paying. How\u2019s that going to go down, Rick Perry?", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "mtomasky"}, "keywords": "Republican Party, u.s. poli, Obamacare, Democratic Party, John Boehner, health care", "publicationDate": 201312051045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/voxbox/michael-tomasky", "description": "Here\u2019s a nightmare for John Boehner: Eight or 10 months from now, Republicans\u2019 obsession with getting rid of the health-care law is going to look awfully stupid to a majority of voters.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Why Obamacare Could Help the Democrats in 2014", "tags": "entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,Obamacare:Industryterm,entity:organization/democratic_party,entity:person/john_boehner,entity:industryterm/health_care", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Why Obamacare Could Help the Democrats in 2014\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/05/why-obamacare-could-help-the-democrats-in-2014.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/05/why-obamacare-could-help-the-democrats-in-2014/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/46208011.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/05/why-obamacare-could-help-the-democrats-in-2014\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-05T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Michael Tomasky\",\"tags\":[\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"Industryterm\",\"democratic_party\",\"john_boehner\",\"health_care\"]}", "news_keywords": "Republican Party, US Politics, Obamacare, Democratic Party, John Boehner, health care", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics.michael-tomasky", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Michael Tomasky", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2013-12-05T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/michael-tomaskyhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/05/why-obamacare-could-help-the-democrats-in-2014", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Here\u2019s a nightmare for John Boehner: Eight or 10 months from now, Republicans\u2019 obsession with getting rid of the health-care law is going to look awfully stupid to a majority of voters.", "title": "Why Obamacare Could Help the Democrats in 2014", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/12/05/why-obamacare-could-help-the-democrats-in-2014.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2013/12/05/why-obamacare-could-help-the-democrats-in-2014/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1386240334629.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/michael-tomasky", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "So just choose a yahoo state that didn\u2019t play ball, where the law was mocked as just so much socialism.\nAnd don\u2019t fall for their \u201cplans.\u201d They\u2019re unworkable.\n\u201cObamacare is not just a broken website,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner sputtered the other day in retreat as it emerged that the website is now working well.\nThey\u2019re unworkable because the Republicans aren\u2019t willing to spend the money that experts all say is required to make plans workable.\nNo American who has 42 choices is going to feel like the jackboot of the state is stomping on his neck."}
