A miniature success

Most collectors society members received the standard version, but by luck of the draw some received a filter with different glaze.

Red Wing Collectors Society unveiled the 2014 commemorative — a success filter — Thursday morning. Red Wing Stoneware Co. manufactured close to 3,000 miniature filters for this year’s convention.

Full-size original water purifiers or filters were manufactured here starting in the late 1800s. Poured into the upper crock and covered, water seeped through a porous bottom into a cooler below.

To go with the commemorative, Red Wing Stoneware made an accessory piece — a stoneware riser.

The last time the commemorative piece was made in Red Wing was 2007.

Distribution of the commemorative runs through the weekend.
