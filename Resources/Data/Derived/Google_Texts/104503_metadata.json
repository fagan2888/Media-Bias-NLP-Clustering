And the other thing is that the law is based on the issues of transparency and belief in the American people and choices in the marketplace,\u201d she said, stressing that the latest numbers tell a different story.\n\nBurwell said Sunday that the White House expects \u201cstrong and healthy growth\u201d to bring enrollment in 2015 to more than 9 million.\n\nEven Obama himself weighed in on the comments, defending, during a speech in Australia earlier Sunday, his office\u2019s marketing of his signature health-care law.\n\n\u201cThe fact that an adviser who was never on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with in terms of the voters is not a reflection on the actual process that was run,\u201d Obama said.\n\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
