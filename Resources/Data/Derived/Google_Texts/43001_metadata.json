Insurance Women\u2019s wage as pct. of men\u2019s: 62.5%\n\n2. Retail Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 64.3% 3. Real estate brokers and sales agents\n\nWomen\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 66.0% 4. Personal financial advisors Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 66.3% 5. Education administrators Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 67.2% 6. Physicians and surgeons Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 67.6% 7. Marketing and sales managers Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 67.7%\n\n8. Security, commodities and financial services sales agents Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 69.1% 9. Inspectors, testers, sorters, samplers and weighers Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 69.2% 10. Claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners and investigators Women\u2019s wages as pct. of men\u2019s: 69.3%\n\n\n\nStudy director at the Institute for Women's Policy Research, Ariane Hegewisch, said this is because sales is such a broad industry.'\n\n\n\n'For the wage gap in sales positions, commissions seem to be a factor,\u201d Hegewisch said.\n\n\n\n'Women tend to work selling clothes, men tend to work more selling cars and TVs.\n\n\n\n'These higher price tag products tend to bring in much more in commissions, while items like clothing tend to bring in much lower commissions, if any at all.'\n\n\n\nWhen it came to physicians and surgeons, women earned barely teo thirds of their male counterparts\n\n\n\nHegewisch explained that the majority of surgeons are men, while women physicians are more likely to be engaged in care-based or clinical work.\n\n\n\nSurgeons are usually required to be available as many as 80 hours a week, and they are usually paid more as a result.\n\n\n\nTo identify the 10 jobs with the largest wage gap, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 release of earnings data from the Current Population Survey for 2012.\n\n\n\nThe wage data are based on weekly earnings of both men and women working at least 35 hours a week year-round.\n\n\n\nThey only considered occupations that were not themselves broken out into more specific categories by the CPS.\n\n\n\nThey also excluded those occupations that the BLS considered too broad to define.\n\nA typical woman working as an insurance agent earned $641 per week, compared to a typical man\u2019s pay of over $1,000.\n\n\n\nDisparities in pay and opportunity in the insurance industry extend beyond the sales force.\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2012 study by St. Joseph\u2019s University, just 6% of top executive positions across the insurance industry were held by women, and only 12.6% of board seats belonged to women.\n\nWhen it comes to real estate, it is a female-dominated industry.\n\n\n\nAs of 2012, women accounted for the majority of such workers, roughly 60%.\n\n\n\nWomen who work as a surgeon or physician earned $600 less than their male counterparts in the US last year\n\nYet, the median income for women working full-time as brokers was just $680 a week, versus over $1,000 for men.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to teaching nearly 65% of education administrators were female in 2012.\n\n\n\nHowever, pay for women was barely two-thirds that of men in these positions.\n\n\n\nWomen on average earned an average of $1,052 a week .\n\nMen earned about $1,566 .\n\n\n\nIn the medical field, most male physicians and surgeons earned more than $2000 per week last year, which was over $600 than women.\n\n\n\nMost male physicians and surgeons working full-time earned more than $2,000 per week last year, or over $600 more than the women in these occupations.\n\nA male surgeon or physician can earn over $2000 a week\n\nThe number of women versus men working in marketing was more balanced than many other occupations.\n\n\n\nThe typical man working in this job, however, earned about $500, or 48%, more a week than the typical woman working the same job.\n\n\n\nAs of 2012, women accounted for just under 30% of the security, commodities, and financial services industry.\n\n\n\nThey earned a median salary equal to just 69% that of men.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Insurance,real,estate,healthcare,See,10,jobs,paying,women,far,men", "original-source":
