Given how swimmingly things have been going at the Environmental Protection Agency (and I mean \u201cswimmingly\u201d as in all the fish swimming in polluted Colorado waters) you might think they\u2019d be watching their books pretty closely and keeping an eye on their contractors. You\u2019ll recall that it was one of those contractors who was equally responsible \u2013 along with agency personnel \u2013 for the Gold King mine spill. One part of the contractor process when dealing with the government is the arrangement in the initial statement of work which provides for the payment of bonuses to companies which meet or exceed expectations and finish things ahead of schedule, presumably saving the taxpayer some money. It\u2019s a sensible system on the surface because it provides incentives for efficiency and cuts down on the bite taken out of the federal budget.\n\nOf course, that system completely falls on its face if you just hand out all the bonuses without checking to see if the objectives are met. Why do you suppose we\u2019re discussing this here today? (Daily Caller)\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) isn\u2019t doing a very good job managing the contractors it uses to conduct employee background checks, according to a government watchdog report which found the agency had handed $545,000 in incentives without adequate support documents. \u201cBy not maintaining contract documentation, the EPA does not have reasonable assurance that work is progressing according to the contract, or that [Office of Personnel Management] billings are correct,\u201d the EPA\u2019s inspector general finds. \u201cThe agency overpaid approximately $6,000 over the last 2\u00bd years, and awarded over $545,000 in incentive fees without adequate support,\u201d the IG reports Monday.\n\nThe article focuses initially on the contractor who performs all the background checks on prospective employees. (I can tell you\u2019re feeling safer already.) Whether they met their targets or not they seem to have gotten all of the bonuses available under the terms of the contract. Did they do it? Nobody can say for sure because the contract administrator apparently has a dog that ate their homework.\n\n\u201cThe [Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative] does not maintain documentation to support her annual [Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan] reviews,\u201d the IG notes. \u201cThe COR\u2019s contract file only contains evidence of one recommendation to the CO to award the full incentive fee due to the contractor meeting performance standards. However, the COR does not maintain supporting documentation to establish a basis for the rating assigned.\u201d\n\nOne long running set of bonuses was paid out with nothing more than a single recommendation from one person saying that they should be paid with no supporting documentation provided for review. It\u2019s already a fairly dodgy system in terms of who gets these contracts, with a byzantine system of race based quotas, set-asides and non-competitive awards taking place. Once the contractor is firmly attached to the government teat, at least at the EPA it sounds as if they\u2019re set up on the gravy train for quite some time and nobody is minding the store as to whether they are meeting their goals or not. The agency\u2019s administrators may come back and claim that they are, but if they\u2019re not bothering to keep records of compliance, how are the taxpayers to know if their money is being flushed down a rat hole?\n\nIt\u2019s another fine job by Gina McCarthy\u2019s people. And yet there is no sign on the horizon that Barack Obama plans to discipline anyone at the agency, to say nothing of getting rid of the incompetent person he appointed to run it.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Hey, it\u2019s only money", "title": "EPA gives out a half million dollars in bonuses for no apparent reason", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/17/epa-gives-out-a-half-million-dollars-in-bonuses-for-no-apparent-reason/", "image": "http://media.hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/EPA_Office.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-17T18:21:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-17T16:44:56+00:00"}, "keywords": "abuse, bonuses, Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, fraud, Gina McCarthy, government waste,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "\u201cBy not maintaining contract documentation, the EPA does not have reasonable assurance that work is progressing according to the contract, or that [Office of Personnel Management] billings are correct,\u201d the EPA\u2019s inspector general finds.\n\u201cThe [Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative] does not maintain documentation to support her annual [Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan] reviews,\u201d the IG notes.\nYou\u2019ll recall that it was one of those contractors who was equally responsible \u2013 along with agency personnel \u2013 for the Gold King mine spill.\nEPA gives out a half million dollars in bonuses for no apparent reasonposted at 1:21 pm on December 17, 2015 by Jazz ShawToday we bring you entry 387 in our ongoing, 1,495 part series on why Gina McCarthy needs to be impeached.\nWhether they met their targets or not they seem to have gotten all of the bonuses available under the terms of the contract."}
