He is Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology, and Decision Science; and former Chief of Cardiology (Pediatric). Dr. Deane serves on the Board of Directors of the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange (NMHIX). Opinions offered here are Dr. Deane's alone, and do not necessarily reflect those of the NMHIX Board.\n\nDr. Ben Carson has forgotten how to be a good doctor. He has succumbed to the Siren call of political expediency. He would rather join the political ruling class than do the right thing for Patient USA. We expected more, better, or simply good medical practice from him.\n\nCarson\u2019s Approach to Patient USA\n\nOn Fox News on December 6, Carson discussed his proposals for U.S. healthcare with Chris Wallace. Carson wants to repeal Obamacare, but he will keep Medicare, Medicaid, and government control of both insurance and healthcare. He also wants to give $2,000 to some, but not all Americans, for medical spending. Where this money is coming from or even what his plan will cost is unclear to Wallace, who said, \u201cI\u2019m a little bit confused.\u201d\n\nSo was Carson \u2026 about his own plan.\n\nOne of the most obvious signs of bad planning is unnecessary complexity. Carson\u2019s plan is even more confusing and contradictory than the incomprehensible mess we have now. Carson doesn\u2019t even start with what every good doctor knows he or she must start proper care of a patient \u2013 the diagnosis.\n\nDiagnosis For Patient USA\n\nPatient USA has a malignancy in the federal healthcare bureaucracy. That is the diagnosis, the root cause, and Carson knows it. However, because he wants to be \u201cpolitically less toxic,\u201d he practices bad medicine by partially treating the patient. He would stop the current treatment that is harming the patient \u2013 Obamacare \u2013 but leave the malignancy unchecked and untreated.\n\nProper Medical Care for Patient USA\n\nWhat would Carson do if he took off his political dunce hat and put back his surgical cap?\n\nHe would:\n\nTell the patient the precise diagnosis: a malignant tumor in the bureaucracy Explain how he would remove this cancer Discuss all the risks and benefits of his treatment recommendation Answer any questions the patient has, including discomfort, recovery time and long-term costs Seek the patient\u2019s consent to proceed.\n\nThe correct treatment that will cure, not merely palliate, Patient Healthcare\u2019s malignancy is Direct-Pay USA. It attacks the root cause, a malignant federal bureaucracy, by getting the government out of your doctor\u2019s chair and out of your wallet.\n\nIt restores control where it belongs \u2013 in the patient\u2019s hands. Calculations described in \u201cThe Cancer in the American Healthcare System\u201d show that the simple Direct-Pay USA approach costs half, yes half, of what we are currently spending on our wasteful healthcare system.\n\nNo more Medicare, Medicaid, or Obamacare. No more lengthy pre-authorization process; 10-page insurance forms; government websites that don\u2019t work and require too much personal information; and denial of care. No more waiting forever for authorized care, and no American veterans dying for lack of approved medical treatment.\n\nDoctor Carson Has Become Candidate Carson\n\nDirect-Pay USA is good medicine for Patient USA: simple, sustainable, and in keeping with U.S. values of freedom and independence. Anyone who has read Carson\u2019s books (and I have) would expect just such a plan from him, not the politically acceptable garbage he is currently offering. I fear \u201cDoctor\u201d Carson has become Candidate Carson and has thrown away the very reasons so many people supported him.\n\nDr. Deane Waldman MD MBA is author of just released \u201cThe Cancer in the American Healthcare System;\u201d Host of www.wecanfixhealthcare.info; Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics, Pathology and Decision Science; and Adjunct Scholar (Healthcare) for the Rio Grande Foundation, a public policy think tank.
