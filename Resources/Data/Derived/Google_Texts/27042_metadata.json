That\u2019s the question the Charlotte Observer asks in a story about a 49-year-old Republican who declined to sign up for Obamacare because he \u201cprided himself on paying his own medical bills,\u201d and is now upset that the Affordable Care Act won\u2019t bail him out.\n\nLuis Lang, a self-employed handyman from Fort Mill whose clients include the federal government, told the Observer he \u201cknew the act required him to get coverage but he chose not to do so. But he thought help would be available in an emergency,\u201d like the mini-strokes and deteriorating vision he suffered in February.\n\nIt\u2019s not available though, because that\u2019s not how insurance works. Insurance companies are profitable because they take your money before you incur major medical expenses, not because they save new customers\u2019 eyes for free. It\u2019s almost like the needs of the market aren\u2019t aligned with the needs of actual human beings, as if the American healthcare system encourages people to gamble that they\u2019ll stay healthy instead of getting insurance, and forces society to bear the costs when the house wins (which is always).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf only there were some way to make people get insurance, and maybe even help them pay for it to save all of us money in the long run.\n\nNahhh, that\u2019s crazy.\n\n\n\nSponsored\n\nAnyway, Lang is now stuck in a position where, suddenly having come around on this whole insurance thing with the impending loss of his eyesight, it\u2019s too late for him to sign up under what his wife calls \u201cThe Not Fair Health Care Act.\u201d Furthermore, his income has dropped now that he\u2019s out of work, making him ineligible for a federal insurance subsidy. (What about Medicaid, you ask? Well, South Carolina was one of 17 states that opted out of the ACA\u2019s Medicaid expansion.)\n\nFor now, Lang\u2019s doctor, Malcolm Edwards, will keep treating him for free, but he doesn\u2019t have the expertise to do the surgery Lang needs. And he can\u2019t force his patient to take care of himself.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talk about personal responsibility in health care reform,\u201d the Observer observes, \u201cso it\u2019s probably fair to note that Lang is a smoker who has, by his own account, been inconsistent in his efforts to control his diabetes.\u201d\n\nCool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLang has set up a GoFundMe page, and people are donating\u2014because even though it\u2019s insane to blame Obamacare, the system really is fucked up\u2014but they\u2019re also chastising him for being \u201ca poster child for what you claim to be against\u201d and \u201cvoting against [your] own self-interest.\u201d\n\n[H/T Wonkette, Photo: GoFundMe]", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Insurance, Blindness, South Carolina, Gawker", "author": "Jay Hathaway", "og": {"site_name": "Gawker", "description": "Who should save the sight of an uninsured South Carolina man who can\u2019t afford eye surgery?
