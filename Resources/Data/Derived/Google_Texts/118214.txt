President Obama last week set in motion the most sweeping shift in immigration policy since the Reagan era.

His executive order temporarily suspends the threat of deportation for some 4.4 million unauthorized U.S. immigrants whose kids are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.

While they can't vote or qualify for Obamacare, under the order the reprieved can step out of the shadows into formal American society and legally apply for work.

Still, Obama's bold stroke does nothing to decide the future of E-Verify, the hiring database created to flag unauthorized immigrants. Currently, five states compel employers to use E-Verify, while 13 other states mandate that their government agencies consult the database when hiring employees.

All told, many of the more than a half-million employers nationally that use E-Verify do so voluntarily. Yet champions of the verification system want the system made a requirement for all employers. Advocates, such as one of today's columnists, say that E-Verify is a cost-free, speedy, accurate tool for helping to stem the flow of unauthorized immigrants.

E-Verify critics, however, like today's other columnist, dispute that the database is accurate. They argue that the system still has a propensity for errors — such as flagging authorized candidates — and a slipshod record of ignoring actual violators. And that makes E-Verify too unreliable a means for making a greater share of potentially life-changing decisions, critics contend.

By the numbers

•23,937,505: total number of E-Verify checks in Fiscal Year 2013.

•1,400: average number of new employers adopting E-Verify each week.

•98.81: percentage of employees who are automatically confirmed as authorized to work either instantly or within 24 hours.
