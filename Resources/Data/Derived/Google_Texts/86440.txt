Oklahoma City police arrested a man who reportedly led officers on a chase on a stolen motorcycle.

According to police, at about 11:50 p.m. on Sunday, September 28, an officer noticed a possible stolen motorcycle at the intersection of S.W. 59th and Penn.

The officer tried to pull over the motorcycle, however, the rider, later identified as 29-year-old Ryan Christopher Locklear, did not stop. That's when the chase began.

During the pursuit, the officer said Locklear threw a cigarette box out of his left hand. It was later determined the cigarette box contained a white crystal type substance tested positive for meth, and 30 small round unmarked blue pills.

Locklear eventually pulled over at the intersection of S.W. 53rd and Western, where he was arrested.

Police said the motorcycle had been reported stolen by the New York City Police Department in March, 2014.

Locklear was booked into the Oklahoma County Jail on multiple charges, including unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, possession of CDS with intent to distribute, and possession of CDS without a prescription.
