Cuccinelli\u2019s campaign showed how much of a weapon Obamacare can be in the hands of the GOP.\n\nIn the two biggest elections of the night \u2014 the New Jersey and Virginia governor\u2019s races \u2014 neither Democratic candidate topped 50 percent. Indeed, between purple-state Virginia and deep-blue New Jersey, the Republican candidates combined for 2.2 million votes, or 400,000 more than the Democratic candidates.\n\nThe results will leave many Republicans wondering about what-ifs in Virginia, including what would have happened if the GOP in Washington hadn\u2019t gotten caught up in a government shutdown for most of October, and if major donors had pumped a little more money into the race in the closing days.\n\nSEE ALSO: Christie\u2019s win, Cuccinelli\u2019s loss: Two playbooks for defending against the \u2018war on women\u2019\n\n\u201cIf we had had five more days, or 5 million more dollars, we would have won,\u201d said Michael McKenna, a Republican strategist in Virginia, who also said Tuesday\u2019s results will be studied by candidates heading into the next two federal elections. \u201cObamacare is toxic. Democratic senators up in either 2014 or 2016 are probably terrified at what happened in Virginia.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s easy path to re-election underscored how well Republicans can do when they are seen as strong leaders \u2014 even when voters disagree with them on specific issues such as gay marriage or taxes. In Virginia, meanwhile, exit polling showed voters fed up with both Mr. Cuccinelli and Mr. McAuliffe, though the electorate appeared to fear the Republican more than the Democrat.\n\nStill, the final results in Virginia were far closer than polls suggested just days ago.\n\nSEE ALSO: Terry McAuliffe wins Virginia governor\u2019s race; Chris Christie re-elected in N.J.\n\nAt the end of the government shutdown, Mr. McAuliffe held leads of as much as 17 percentage points. But with the shutdown over, Mr. Cuccinelli and national Republican figures argued that Virginia\u2019s election was a referendum on Obamacare \u2014 and the polls began to tighten, ending with Mr. McAuliffe\u2019s narrow 2 percentage-point victory on Tuesday.\n\nExit polling showed 41 percent of Virginians \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d the health care law, while only 27 percent \u201cstrongly support\u201d the law. Of voters who said health care was the most important issue in their vote, Mr. Cuccinelli topped Mr. McAuliffe, 49 percent to 45 percent.\n\nMr. Cuccinelli\u2019s big stumble came on social issues, with a large chunk of voters saying abortion was their chief concern, and Mr. McAuliffe overwhelmingly winning those voters, 59 percent to 34 percent.\n\nThat showing will give ammunition to Democrats who say their party should continue to accuse Republicans of a war on women \u2014 a message that helped Mr. Obama win re-election last year.\n\nIn New Jersey, the polling on Obamacare was a little closer, with 34 percent strongly opposed and 23 percent strongly supporting it.\n\nLiberal groups said they welcomed viewing election night as a referendum on Obamacare, since Virginia did end up going Democratic in both the governor\u2019s race and the lieutenant governor\u2019s race.\n\n\u201cAdvantage: Obamacare,\u201d said Americans United for Change, a group run by the former spokesman for the national Democratic Party.\n\nCurrent Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in a statement that the Virginia victories showed just how badly the government shutdown hurt Republicans.\n\n\u201cTonight in Virginia, we saw voters reject the extreme tea party politics that caused our government to shut down and drove our economy to the brink of collapse,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile there\u2019s little doubt Mr. Cuccinelli turned off voters, so did Mr. McAuliffe. Exit polling showed just 52 percent said they strongly backed the man they voted for, while 17 percent said they voted for their choice because they disliked the others.\n\nMr. McAuliffe won half of those voters, signaling his margin of victory came not because voters were eager to see him in office, but because they were wary of Mr. Cuccinelli.\n\nA Libertarian candidate, Robert C. Sarvis, won 6.6 percent of the vote, which was well more than the slim margin of victory for Mr. McAuliffe. Mr. Sarvis won almost all of his support from voters who simply disliked the two major-party offerings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats spent heavily to win the Virginia governorship Tuesday, but Republicans said by making the race far closer than polls had projected just a few weeks ago, Kenneth T.
