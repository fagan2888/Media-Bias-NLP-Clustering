The event was the \u201cSouth Carolina Freedom Summit.\u201d It was held at an auditorium ironically named \u201cThe Peace Center.\u201d Ironic because every candidate seemed bent on starting the Third World War.\n\nCitizens United was the primary sponsor. Yes, the \u201cCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission\u201d crew. Only Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, George Romney and Lindsey Graham had better things to do. Tickets were free and gone in a flash with a 700-ticket backlog for the daylong event.\n\nThe stage was festooned in red, white and blue bunting; An anti-Hillary propaganda video that ended with giant lettering \u201cHillary\u2019s Web of Deception\u201d greeted attendees.\n\nAt 9:08AM, Citizens United President, David Bossie, walked to the microphone. \u201cWell, good morning Greenville.\u201d\n\nAll speakers followed essentially the same template. Islamic terror, repeal the president\u2019s health care plan, Hillary and Obama-bashing, no taxes, no regulations, no anti-Wall Street, repeated bows to the military from the candidates, a balanced budget, welfare recipient-bashing, candidate humble beginnings, ceaseless damnation of immigrants, the \u201cporous border\u201d, American exceptionalism, Israel as BFF, the constitution and amendments, keep the fed\u2019s nose out of state business, free speech, especially when it comes to state denial of gay rights and the homosexual-hating musings of that old bearded, camouflaged TV guy. Most speeches ended with \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d I could stop the story here and you wouldn\u2019t have missed a thing.\n\nWisconsin Governor and recall survivor, Scott Walker, was the first candidate speaker. He paid homage to the veterans in the audience, as did the other speakers. Nothing wrong with that, though, none of the Republican candidates ever saw actual combat duty. Walker said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk about freedom today.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. He mentioned that state unemployment is now 4.6%. What he didn\u2019t mention, and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel did, was that the Wisconsin grew low paying jobs at the fastest rate ever, since 2000.\n\nHe also said the state\u2019s bond rating is strong. Really? Wisconsin Public Radio reported that the rating is still among the lowest in the country, and a recent modest upgrade came the same day the state reported a projected $2.2 billion shortfall in the next budget. This, after bragging about lowering the tax burden by 2 billion dollars. He defunded Planned Parenthood and urged repeal of Obamacare.\n\nAfter the speech, Walker left for Israel to visit with fellow blood-luster, Bibi Netanyahu. The duo will figure out how they can level any home country of \u2018radical\u2019 Islam. \u201cI want to take the fight to them, before they take the fight to us.\u201d Third World War, anyone?\n\nRick Santorum followed. In addition to radical Islam, he added China and Russia to the list of American enemies. As for Islam, \u201cIf these folks want to bring back 7th Century Islam, we need to ramp up and bomb them back to the 7th century.\u201d Do I need to bother with anything else Mr. Macho had to say other than he hates immigrants?\n\nHe bragged on South Carolina for attracting all those huge companies. Yeah, no unions, lousy wages, unfettered pollution, huge incentives and tax breaks everywhere. According to the Post and Courier newspaper (scroll down to S.C. Hard hit), household wages dropped by 10.9% between 2000 and 2012 when all those great new companies were moving in.\n\nRick Perry continued the Islamist theme. He accused the president of weakness and vacillation. He wants to attack Islamists. \u201cWe must have the same resolve to defeat them that we did with the Soviet Union.\u201d H\u2019mmmm. I guess our attack on the Soviet Union slipped my mind. He wants Washington \u201cout of our lives.\u201d I want Perry out of the campaign.\n\nEgomaniac Donald Trump then addressed the crowd. This cartoonish oaf opened with Tom Brady having all that snow in front of his house. \u201cTell Tom Brady about Global Warming.\u201d He got progressively dumber after that.\n\nHe tacked a bit to the left in telling the religious evangelicals that he didn\u2019t give a s**t about lobbyists. The audience laughed uproariously. I guess \u2018cursing\u2019 is OK when an avowed conservative decides to go potty-mouth.\n\nSouth Carolina Senator Tim Scott admitted he had flunked out of high school. \u201cI think I\u2019m the only Senator who ever flunked civics. Then I went to the Senate and there was a whole lot of competition across the aisle.\u201d Another Scott admission: He used to sing a song to Obamacare. \u201cHit the road, Jack, and don\u2019t you come back no more.\u201d How about \u201cHit the road, Tim?\u201d\n\nFlorida Senator Marco Rubio was next. He had the requisite poor parents/American dream story, realized when his parents came to America from Cuba in 1956 and found work as a bartender and stock clerk. \u201cThey found good jobs.\u201d The line that really defined Rubio was in relation to Jihadists: \u201cWe will look for you; we will find you and we will kill you.\u201d The audience cheered wildly. He wants to (ho) repeal Obamacare (hum). Telegenic, but not great on the stump.\n\nThen came arguably the star of the show, Ted Cruz. \u201cGod bless the great state of South Carolina. What a blessing to be with so many incredible patriots.\u201d You mean the kind that retain dual citizenship for the first 43 years of their life? Cruz\u2019s birthplace of Calgary might have been a clue. He renounced the Canadian side last year. He wants to \u201cpadlock\u201d the IRS building and bring its 90,000 employees to \u201cour southern borders.\u201d Repealing every word of Obamacare and initiating a flat tax (as in flat earth) are on his agenda.\n\nJohn Bolton was there as a special hit man to dismantle Hillary/Obama foreign policy \u201cfailures\u201d, especially Benghazi and Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities (finding nothing doesn\u2019t mean Republicans won\u2019t let go). Is there a more unlikable human on the planet?\n\nWe can skip over the Bolton\u2019s continued tedious attacks on Hillary\u2019s foreign policy bona fides and former New York Governor, George who? Pataki\u2019s speech.\n\nThat brings us to Bobby Jindal, governor or Louisiana. Covering the template as described earlier in detail, Jindal, nonetheless, identified our \u201cgreatest threat\u201d as what Obama is doing to redefine the American dream. That\u2019s because his administration doesn\u2019t give carte blanche to the aforementioned Indiana, Arkansas and \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d boob, Phil Robertson, calling homosexuality a sin and comparing it to bestiality. Jindal ended with three \u201cGod-blesses.\u201d\n\nBen Carson told of his mother in the end-stages of Alzheimers. I\u2019m not going to pick apart someone who is going through that incredibly difficult time with a loved one.\n\nBut Carly Fiorina faces no such challenge. She just needs to make excuses about why she was unceremoniously booted out as CEO of Hewlett-Packard. In truth, she approved the purchase of Compaq for $25 billion and promptly laid off 15,000 Hewlett-Packard employees. Over the next few years, profits lagged, and HW was losing out to competitors. Bye bye!.\n\nMoving on\u2026\n\nWe\u2019re done. People are filing out. They started just after lunch. Nothing really bombastic came out of the event. Iowa and New Hampshire held similar shindigs and there will be more around the country in the future.\n\nThe three candidates to be taken seriously from this group are Cruz, Walker and, possibly, Jindal. The others can pack their bags.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A bunch of Republican real and presumed presidential primary candidates descended on Greenville, South Carolina, Saturday.
