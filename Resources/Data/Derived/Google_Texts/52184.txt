As Senate Republicans awaken from their slumber to discover that Speaker John Boehner actually did not have a plan, and has indeed ceded power and control of the U.S. House to the Tea Party, a Republican Representative reminded America of just how crazy House Republicans are.

Rep. Morgan Griffith (R-VA) suggested today that the House should reject an unfavorable agreement from the Senate even if it results in a default that destroys the economy. Why?

“We have to make a decision that’s right long-term for the United States, and what may be distasteful, unpleasant and not appropriate in the short run may be something that has to be done,” Griffith told the Hill.

He then cited the American Revolution as an example of doing great harm for patriotic reasons.

“I will remind you that this group of renegades that decided that they wanted to break from the crown in 1776 did great damage to the economy of the colonies. They created the greatest nation and the best form of government, but they did damage to the economy in the short run,” Griffith said according to the Hill.

This kind of talk is hardly new for him. The Tea Partier said of ObamaCare in 2011, “As Virginians we did not accept the chains of George III nor will we accept the chains of ObamaCare.”

Clearly, Morgan needs to put down his Revolutionary Ken doll and stop fantasizing about himself as the hero against President Obama. Being a tool of corporate lobbying sorta misses the Revolution mark.

And so we once again meet the crazy driving the economy over the edge. Did you think they were just bluffing? These people are too full of themselves to have a clue about just how blatantly incompetent and unfit for office they are.
