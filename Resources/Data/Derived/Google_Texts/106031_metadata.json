Michelle\u2019s pretty happy about that,\u201d Obama said during a speechto business students at Northwestern University. \u201cBut make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Republicans to use the president's own words against their Democratic opponents in debates, campaign ads and stump speeches.\n\nAlmost immediately after the speech, Senate candidate Thom Tillis, R-N.C., took to Twitter to post a picture of Obama and his opponent Kay Hagan with a link to a blog post on his website titled, \"28 words that Democrats really wish President Obama didn\u2019t say today.\"\n\nBy the next morning Pat Roberts, Scott Brown and Mitch McConnell had released new campaign ads featuring the Obama remarks to attack their opponents.\n\nRoberts has been fighting a tough battle for a Kansas Senate seat. His latest ad argues that Obama\u2019s policies such as debt, Obamacare and unemployment are on the ballot \u2013 and that a vote for his opponent Greg Orman \"is a vote for the Obama agenda.\"\n\nArkansas Senate candidate Tom Cotton also used the quote at an event last weekend to link his opponent's voting record to the president's policies.\n\n\"He said last week that he may not be on the ballot, but his policies are on the ballot \u2013 every single one of them\u2026 more debt, higher taxes, Obamacare, a foreign policy of weakness and indecision,\" Cotton told ABC's Jeff Zeleny. \"Here in Arkansas the way you find those policies on the ballot is Mark Pryor \u2013 cause Mark Pryor's voted for him 93 percent of the time.\"\n\nThe quote has been a popular go-to line in debates too, and was used by Tillis and Georgia Republican nominee David Perdue in Senate debates this week.\n\nDavid Axelrod, former senior advisor to the president, said on \"Meet the Press\" that he would not have included the line if he was still writing the president's speeches.\n\n\"It was a mistake,\" Axelrod said.\n\nWhen White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked during a briefing if he agreed with Axelrod's assessment he replied, \"Well, I guess the short answer is no.\"\n\nEarnest sought to clarify the president's comments, saying he meant voters have a choice this election between \"candidates who are supportive of policies that will benefit the middle class, and candidates who are supportive of policies that will benefit those at the top in the hopes that the benefits will trickle down to the middle class.\"\n\nABC's Erin Dooley contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Here Are the 28 Words Obama Said That Republicans Can\u2019t Stop Repeating", "description": "Here Are the 28 Words Obama Said That Republicans Can\u2019t Stop Repeating", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "What a difference 28 words make when they are spoken by the president of the United States.\nA few sentences uttered recently by President Obama are fast-becoming the defining talking point of the 2014 election season for GOP candidates across the country.\n\"I am not on the ballot this fall ......", "title": "Here Are the 28 Words Obama Said That Republicans Can\u2019t Stop Repeating", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-quote-republicans-stop-repeating/story?id=26086760", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_Obama_at_Northwestern_emd_20141002_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2014-10-10", "twitter": {"description": "What a difference 28 words make when they are spoken by the president of the United States.\nA few sentences uttered recently by President Obama are fast-becoming the defining talking point of the 2014 election season for GOP candidates across the country.\n\"I am not on the ballot this fall ......", "title": "Here Are the 28 Words Obama Said That Republicans Can\u2019t Stop Repeating", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-quote-republicans-stop-repeating/story?id=26086760", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,26086760", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,26086760", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-quote-republicans-stop-repeating/story?id=26086760"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "site": "@ABC", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_Obama_at_Northwestern_emd_20141002_4x3t_240.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-10", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,26086760", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-quote-republicans-stop-repeating/story?id=26086760"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/obama-quote-republicans-stop-repeating/story?id=26086760", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,26086760", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News -
