After clearing a key Senate committee Monday, sponsors of the bill to reauthorize Medicaid expansion are making sure they have the votes needed to pass the full Senate.

At a press conference Tuesday morning, lawmakers and advocates urged senators to pass the legislation – saying 48,000 newly-insured people will keep their coverage without costing taxpayers more money. Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley has been a key supporter of the measure. “This is a bi-partisan plan, it’s a New Hampshire plan – it’s not Obamacare. It involves 48,000 of our friends and neighbors, many of whom do not qualify for the benefits of the Affordable Care Act. It’s helped make a more productive work force.”

Until the end of this year, the federal government has fully covered the costs of expansion. Under this proposal, state hospitals and insurance companies have agreed to make up for the eventual shrinking of federal funds. Medicaid expansion has the full support of Democrats, including Governor Hassan, but has divided Republicans who believe insurance premiums will rise.
