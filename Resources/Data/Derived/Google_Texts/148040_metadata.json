It\u2019s typically something that will cause people to procrastinate,\u201d says Kate Maguire, president of Motivation Mechanics, a group of Philadelphia-based research and marketing strategists who worked for Solis Women\u2019s Health.\n\nAfter interviewing women about what they wanted in a mammography experience, Maguire \u2013 whose grandmother and mother had breast cancer \u2013 outlined a major marketing makeover.\n\nThe Makeover\n\nHere are a few examples of what Solis Women\u2019s Health changed:\n\nTerminology: Women are referred to as visitors, instead of patients.\n\nClinic Layout: There are two different hallways, one for women coming in for a standard screening and another for women who have been called back for additional imaging. This helps reduce anxiety for the women who are nervous after being called back, Maguire says, because they don't see people leaving faster.\n\nTagline: The old tagline at Solis was \u201cAnnual mammograms, it\u2019s what smart women do.\u201d That phrase, says VP of marketing Greg Scott, was a \"bad girl message.\u201d\n\nNow, the tagline is \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d\n\nCost & Convenience\n\nBreast imaging is big business. A report from Frost & Sullivan estimates revenues of $1 billion in 2011, and an expected rise to $1.4 billion in 2016.\n\nBut, from a business perspective, there are two main barriers to getting women in the door for screenings: financial and emotional. The Affordable Care Act, by making mammograms a fully-covered service, has cut the cost obstacle.\n\nNow, there\u2019s the psychological barrier \u2013 which companies like Solis Women\u2019s Health are trying to counter by alleviating the fear that comes with scheduling and going through with a mammogram.\n\nMarketing director Greg Scott says, by offering convenient, fast visits and fast results (within 24-48 hours by email if there is no additional screening required) his company is pushing past the competition.\n\nSolis Women\u2019s Health saw about 240,000 women in 2013, Scott says, and for the first quarter of 2014, growth was more than 10 percent in Dallas-Fort Worth and 4 percent nationwide.\n\nConflicting Messages\n\nSteve Woloshin of Dartmouth says deciding whether to get a mammogram is much more complicated than any glossy brochure may suggest.\n\n\u201cThe reason it\u2019s controversial is the evidence supporting mammography, even though intuitively it seems like it\u2019s got to be the right thing to do, the evidence we have isn\u2019t so clear cut.\u201d\n\nMammograms do save lives, Woloshin says, but they can also have downsides: false alarms, follow-up testing, and over-diagnosis.\n\nA study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association says for every 10,000 women, mammograms probably save five lives of women in their 40s, ten lives of women in their 50s, and 42 lives of women in their 60s. Meanwhile, half of women screened for ten years have a \u201cfalse positive\u201d \u2013 a suspicious mammogram that leads to a repeat test or biopsy on a healthy breast.\n\nUltimately, decisions on whether or not to get a mammogram, he says, should be individualized. And the decision should be based on information, rather than fear.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2014/05/21/health-care/turns-out-shame-and-fear-dont-fight-cancer", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/solis-photo.jpg?itok=O3gccN0e", "type": "article", "description": "What we can learn from one clinic's experiment with mammogram \"marketing\".", "title": "Turns out, shame and fear don't fight cancer"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "oc+MvPqhIgJInALeqX2Vhg+0elM+ea+PdtptMZPp3+qU9EAUIJxckdkuo565prl1W75daDiT3TBOsiaJDtXIIg==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "At Solis Women\u2019s Health centers across the U.S., employees don\u2019t just steer clear of scaring women, they avoid talking cancer at all.\nNo Scolding Allowed\"Avoid anxiety\": That's the mantra at the country\u2019s largest breast imaging company in the country \u2013 Texas-based Solis Women\u2019s Health.\nThe MakeoverHere are a few examples of what Solis Women\u2019s Health changed:Terminology: Women are referred to as visitors, instead of patients.\nTexas-based Solis Women\u2019s Health, the country\u2019s largest breast imaging company, promises a \u201cpeaceful mammogram\u201d on its brochures.\nIt\u2019s typically something that will cause people to procrastinate,\u201d says Kate Maguire, president of Motivation Mechanics, a group of Philadelphia-based research and marketing strategists who worked for Solis Women\u2019s Health."}
