The clincher was when Rep. Frank McNulty passed around a tray of candies and cookies in a legislative committee Thursday to emphasize that some marijuana-infused products look exactly like the regular products without pot.

“If you can’t tell the difference, how could a 3-year-old?” asked McNulty, R-Highlands Ranch, who is sponsoring a bill that would require all edible marijuana products to be “shaped, stamped, colored or otherwise marked with a standard symbol” indicating they contain marijuana.

We’re not certain markings would stop a 3-year-old and urge caution for anyone who possesses marijuana in a residence with kids. But the idea of the bill has merit.

The fe deral government already warned Colorado to do everything it can to keep pot out of kids’ hands.

Already this year, six children have been treated for marijuana-related illnesses at Children’s Hospital Colorado after eating edibles. Last year, the hospital treated eight kids, so the incidents may be trending up.

The state already requires edibles to be sold in child-proof packaging and to be clearly marked as being an infused product.

But to McNulty’s point, when the products are out of the bag, it is difficult to discern the difference. Forcing manufacturers to identify their products as infused is a reasonable request and one that should be approved.
