On Tuesday, Apple released a statement denying that there was a system breach in iCloud or Find My iPhone, which could have led to the theft and release of hundreds of celebrity nude photos.

“We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities,” the statement said. “When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple’s engineers to discover the source.”

The company stated that it spent over 40 hours investigating and determined that the hacks were a result of “a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet.”

On Sunday, nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Kate Upton and possibly 100 more were posted online. The photos, originally posted on 4chan, were reportedly stolen from the celebrities’ personal Apple accounts.
