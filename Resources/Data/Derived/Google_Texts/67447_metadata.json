(Scott Morgan/For The Washington Post)\n\nSome of the harshest criticism of potential presidential candidate Ben Carson can be found in a little-known online magazine called American CurrentSee.\n\n\u201cBen Carson, whose reputation for genius rests on the singular neurological feat of separating conjoined twins fused at the cranium, has displayed far less talent in separating himself from the brainless excesses that now darken the heart of black conservatism,\u201d Georgetown professor Michael Eric Dyson starts his essay published there this week. \u201cWhen reason gives way to political demonology it mocks the scientific progress on which Dr. Carson\u2019s surgical career depended. That\u2019s why he\u2019d make a bad president.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t anything new for Dyson to say; he has long been a critic of the retired physician who has said Obamacare is the \u201cworst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u201d and compared Obama\u2019s America to Nazi Germany. But publishing in CurrentSee \u2014 a weekly magazine launched in March by the Washington Times in an effort to appeal to black conservatives \u2014 is a particularly interesting choice. That\u2019s because Carson is its founding publisher.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get tunnel vision unless you hear from all sides,\u201d Carson said in a phone interview Monday. Clearly, Carson is a believer of the old cliche that all press is good press.\n\nThe idea, says executive editor and Carson\u2019s business manager Armstrong Williams, came after hearing Dyson criticize the maybe-candidate on television.\n\nJeremiah Ndiaye, 10, of Cedar Rapids, was among the supporters to greet Carson in Iowa. (Scott Morgan/For The Washington Post)\n\n\u201c[Carson] said he could only gain from hearing what people like him had to say,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo I reached out to Michael Eric Dyson, who thought it was a joke. He said, \u2018Brother, you\u2019re serious? You want me to criticize him?\u2019 I said \u2018We\u2019re not like everybody else; we want to hear your criticism.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDyson joined four other writers who took turns pointing out what they considered weaknesses of both Carson\u2019s policies and his politics.\n\n\u201cYou told Glenn Beck the Second Amendment may not apply in some urban areas, but also wrote a column for The Washington Times accurately explaining why our Founding Fathers gave it to us in the first place,\u201d writes conservative radio host Steve Deace. \u201cYou called the killing of unborn children \u2018murder,\u2019 which it is, but then you also praised a friend of yours running for U.S. Senate in Oregon because she was \u2018pragmatic\u2019 for not opposing it. So which is it?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s an article from a student pursuing a master\u2019s degree in clinical and health services called \u201cAgainst Carsoncare: Free market is the wrong medicine,\u201d and Raynard Jackson, a Republican political consultant, warned him that he could risk being just another \u201cflavor of the month.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Carson says he would like to learn and adapt based on what his critics have to say, but he hasn\u2019t yet been convinced. In response to the essay about his free-market alternative to Obamacare, for example, Carson just said, \u201cI think probably the writer doesn\u2019t fully understand my proposals.\u201d\n\nCarson is nothing if not a divisive character. After a wildly successful career as a surgeon, he took a hard turn into politics at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. There, just feet from President Obama, he gave ascathing speech about the Affordable Care Act. Obama tried not to look angry in front of the cameras, and Carson became a star.\n\nThis past summer he took a bus tour promoting his best-selling book \u201cOne Nation\u201d and publicly flirted with the idea of a presidential run.\n\nWhile in Iowa, he stopped at bookstores overflowing with supporters, signed hundreds of books and grinned to the chant of \u201cRun, Ben, Run.\u201d There is no such thing as negative attention.\n\n\u201cI expected it,\u201d Carson says of the criticism that he solicited. \u201cOnce you get close to the hornet\u2019s nest, they start buzzing. You\u2019re not challenging what\u2019s happening at all if they\u2019re not talking about you.\u201d\n\nAnd what better way is there to get people talking about you, than to just ask for it?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The retired physician and possible presidential candidate solicits and publishes negative feedback.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ben.terris", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The retired physician and possible presidential candidate solicits and publishes negative feedback.", "title": "Ben Carson\u2019s critics weigh in \u2014 at Ben Carson\u2019s invitation", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ben-carsons-critics-weigh-in--at-ben-carsons-invitation/2014/10/06/382df754-4d89-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/08/26/Style/Images/STbencarson%20111409094187.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bterris"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/ben-carsons-critics-weigh-in--at-ben-carsons-invitation/2014/10/06/382df754-4d89-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ben carson, criticism of ben carson, american currentsee, stylefront", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ben.terris"}, "news_keywords": "ben carson, criticism of ben carson, american currentsee, stylefront", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "382df754-4d89-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf609\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen reason gives way to political demonology it mocks the scientific progress on which Dr. Carson\u2019s surgical career depended.\nThe idea, says executive editor and Carson\u2019s business manager Armstrong Williams, came after hearing Dyson criticize the maybe-candidate on television.\n(Scott Morgan/For The Washington Post)Some of the harshest criticism of potential presidential candidate Ben Carson can be found in a little-known online magazine called American CurrentSee.\nBen Carson took an August swing through Iowa to promote his book \u201cOne Nation.\u201d He has now solicited criticism of his politics and policies in on online magazine that he edits.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get tunnel vision unless you hear from all sides,\u201d Carson said in a phone interview Monday."}
