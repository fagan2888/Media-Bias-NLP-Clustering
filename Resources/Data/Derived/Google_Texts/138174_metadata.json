At that point the animal has to be removed and likely killed,\" he said.\n\nIn response to those attacks, and a number of other reports of coyotes exhibiting little or no fear of humans in other areas of the city, Brampton Animal Services has placed traps and enlisted a licensed trapper \u2013 unprecedented moves in the city's history.\n\n\"The behaviour we're seeing is extremely rare. As a result of that behaviour we've increased our response in the area in an attempt to protect residents,\" said Kathy Duncan, manager of animal services. \"We are looking at a multi-pronged approach. There is no one-size-fits-all solution here.\"\n\nThe City of Brampton brought in Coyote Watch to consult on that approach, as did Niagara Falls three years ago, after a series of close encounters with coyotes in schoolyards.\n\n\"It has worked out terrific,\" said Niagara Falls mayor Jim Diodati. \"We hosted a large meeting with everyone involved\u2026 Lesley (Sampson) came in with more of a management program that was sustainable, affordable and it seemed to balance the interests of all parties (from the nature lovers to the city dwellers).\n\nNiagara Falls and Mississauga already have fines in place for feeding wildlife and both Gehrt and Sampson agree such ordinances are an essential part of any management strategy.\n\n\"You can remove as many coyotes as you want, but without some kind of anti-feeding ordinance to discourage people from doing it, other coyotes will move into the area and the problem will continue to repeat itself,\" said Gehrt.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\nMISSISSAUGA'S BAN ON FEEDING WILDLIFE (Source: mississauga.ca)\n\n\n\nFeeding of wildlife is prohibited in the City of Mississauga as per the Mississauga Animal Care and Control By-law #0098-04, as noted below:\n\nREQUIREMENTS OF ANIMAL CARE AND CONTROL BY-LAW 0098-04 PART IV: FEEDING OF WILDLIFE\n\n10) No person shall intentionally feed a wild animal or leave food or attractants of any type or in any form out of doors in such a manner as to attract, or be accessible by a wild animal, feral or stray domestic animal on private or public property. (242-11)\n\n11) Section 10 does not apply to the feeding of song birds on a property, provided the following feeding requirements are met by the owner or occupier: (242-11)\n\n(1) seed is placed in a bird feeding device that is sufficiently above grade as to not attract or be accessible by wild animals; and\n\n(2) bird feeding practices do not attract large flocks of homing birds such as wild, feral or domestic pigeons; and\n\n(3) spillage of seed upon the ground is removed by the property owner or occupier forthwith and disposed of in such a manner that it does not attract wild animals, feral or stray domestic animals.\n\n12) Section 10 does not apply in the following situations: (242-11) (1) the leaving of food as bait in a trap by a property owner to capture a nuisance animal inhabiting or\n\nhabituating their property pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act, 1997, S.O.1997, c.41\n\n(2) the leaving of food as bait by a licensed trapper, and employee of a licensed wildlife or pest control agency, Municipal Law Enforcement Officer an Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Inspector or a Mississauga Peel Police Office, in the performance of their work.\n\n(3) The leaving of food for a colony of stray or feral cats for the purposes of trap, neuter or spay and release program approved by the City of Mississauga.\n\nMaximum Penalty for Contravention of this By-Law is $5000.00\n\n\n\nWHY YOU SHOULD NOT FEED WILDLIFE\n\nWildlife experts agree that feeding wildlife causes problems for the animals and discourages the feeding of wildlife for the following reasons;\n\n\u2022 The feeding of wild animals causes them to become dependent on a food source making them unwilling to forage naturally for food which could seriously affect their health. For instance, squirrels are at risk of developing Metabolic Bone Disease if their diet consists mainly of nuts. This condition causes their bones to become brittle and break easily, and in advanced stages, is irreversible and fatal.\n\n\u2022 The feeding of wild animals creates an unnatural increase in wildlife populations thereby causing an increase in nuisance wildlife activity. Squirrels and raccoons will take up residence in neighbouring attics while skunks prefer burrowing beneath sheds, decks and solariums so that they may be close to the food source. Raccoons maintain a common \u2018latrine\u2019 area on neighbouring properties which can become a health hazard to humans.\n\n\u2022 This unwanted wildlife activity causes frustrated area residents to take unwanted action such as trapping and relocating animals that are merely trying to take advantage of a food source.\n\n\u2022 Studies have shown that trapping and relocation causes orphaned young to die of starvation and diseases to spread, infecting healthy animal populations. NOTE: Re-location of trapped animals beyond 1km is prohibited under the Provincial Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act.\n\n\u2022 Excessive feeding of birds generates larger populations of hardy non-native birds such as feral pigeons, starlings and sparrows which compete for habitat with our rarer, native song bird species.\n\n\u2022 Ducks naturally feed on vegetation and water insects. A nutritionally deficient diet of seed or bread will cause illness and disease. Birds may become ill from bacteria ridden food that is not consumed or bacteria levels in the watercourse due to large concentrations of birds and faeces. Ducks that have become dependant on human handouts may not fly south and starve or freeze during winter months.\n\n\u2022 Improperly maintained bird feeders or poor quality bird feed can actually cause birds to die of illnesses such as salmonella, botulism or other deadly bacterial infections.\n\n\u2022 Providing food for birds and squirrels often attracts rats and mice due to the spillage of seed. \u2022 An increase in rodent activity can attract larger predators like coyotes and foxes which can also prey on\n\nneighbourhood pets.\n\n\u2022 Predators such as coyotes that have eaten human food lose their natural fear for humans and as a result they can become predatory towards humans. If a predator such as a coyote becomes a danger to human safety wildlife authorities recommend the destruction of the offending animal as it can no longer coexist safely with humans.\n\nThe City of Mississauga encourages residents to enjoy and live in harmony with our native wildlife. This can only be accomplished if we do not interfere with a wild animal\u2019s natural instincts, behaviours and ability to forage for food. If you enjoy wildlife, a better alternative would be the planting of certain native flora that will enhance your property and attract wildlife naturally without altering their behaviour or diet.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRECOMMENDED CODES OF PRACTICE TO AVOID WILDLIFE CONFLICTS\n\no Store garbage, green bins, recycling, compost etc. in an area inaccessible to wildlife.\n\no Place garbage, recycling and green bins to the curb on the morning of collection.\n\no Remove any debris or materials from property/decks/balconies that may provide hiding or nesting sites for wild animals or rodents.\n\no Conduct a spring and fall exterior home inspection to ensure shingles, eaves, soffit, facia, vents etc. are in good repair.\n\no Cap/screen roof, dryer, bathroom vents and chimney\u2019s with secure, safety approved mesh. o Sheds, decks or any structure without a foundation should be screened below ground in a reverse L\n\nformation, (12\u201d down,and 18\u201d away from the structure) to prevent burrowing animals. o Cover window wells with mesh or commercial window well covers.\n\no Trim tree branches away from the roof of your home.\n\nFor additional information visit the Animal Services website at www.mypetmississauga.ca or contact Animal Services at 905-896-5858", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "BRAMPTON \u2013If the City catches you feeding wildlife within city limits, it could soon cost you $5,000.", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
