This may be my karmic retribution for disparaging awards show ceremonies recently, but there will be no new episode of “The Good Wife” this Sunday. Instead, interested parties get to sit on their hands and hold their breaths in anticipation of Daft Punk and Pharrell or Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams picking up a Grammy for record of the year. Personally, I’d get a kick out of seeing Kendrick Lamar’s “Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City” take home the prize for album of the year, but I wouldn’t exactly say I have a horse in this race. Scheduled performers include Lamar, Sara Bareilles, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Paul McCartney, Pharrell Williams and many more.

If music isn’t your thing, the big ticket cablers will be providing their usual fare. On Showtime’s “Episodes,” Matt LeBlanc continues to play a — hopefully — more sinister version of himself. His faulty attempts to retain child custody may earn him some sympathy, but not much. “Episodes,” like its 8:30 follow-up, “House of Lies,” is something of a guilty pleasure of mine. The shows share Showtime’s tendency toward dramatic excess and titillation, but they’re mostly fun and as easy to digest as they are to dismiss. This week, “Lies” offers up a compelling gender conundrum as Marty (Don Cheadle) tries to understand his son’s newest infatuation.
