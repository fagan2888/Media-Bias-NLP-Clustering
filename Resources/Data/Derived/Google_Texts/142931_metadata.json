The Federal Trade Commission receives about 300,000 complaints about unwanted robocalls every month, and efforts to curb the number of robocalls you receive haven\u2019t exactly been successful.\n\nComputers can dial phone numbers much faster, from anywhere in the world, and despite the Do No Call Registry having been around for more than 10 years, the number of complaints has spiked over the past five to six years.\n\nSeveral new initiatives have launched to try to address this problem again.\n\nConsumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, launched a new campaign earlier this year to end robocalls. It has called on major phone carriers to offer customers free tools to block unwanted calls.\n\n\u201cBy putting intense consumer pressure on the phone companies and government, and pushing for improved technology, we can end illegal robocalls,\u201d wrote the group on its website. As of Monday, more than 298,000 consumers had signed the petition.\n\nRelated: The Caller ID Scam You Must Know About\n\nNew software to block unwanted calls is starting to emerge, particularly following the FTC Robocall Challenge, a program from two years ago that awarded $50,000 to two software designers to fully develop systems to intercept and filter out illegal prerecorded calls.\n\nOne robocall-blocking option that came out of that challenge is Nomorobo. Although the technology seems quite efficient, only a limited number of consumers have access to the service since phone carriers aren\u2019t yet working with it, according to Consumers Union.\n\n\u201cTechnology exists that can stop illegal robocalls before they reach you, but few consumers have access to it,\u201d said the consumer advocacy group on its campaign website. \u201cThe major phone companies are dragging their feet claiming they can\u2019t legally block calls to most landlines, offering blocking only to certain Internet-based phone customers.\u201d\n\nPhone companies have said it can be difficult to efficiently stop robocalls, especially considering that callers can easily change phone numbers if one they use is blocked. They also worry that a blocking software could stop a legitimate robocall, such as a public safety announcement.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Federal Trade Commission receives about 300,000 complaints of unwanted robocalls every month, and efforts to curb the number of robocalls you receive haven\u2019t been exactly successful.", "title": "There\u2019s New Hope to Block Annoying \u2018Robocalls\u2019", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/There-s-New-Hope-Block-Annoying-Robocalls", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04042011_robot_worker_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/27/There-s-New-Hope-Block-Annoying-Robocalls", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04042011_robot_worker_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Federal Trade Commission receives about 300,000 complaints of unwanted robocalls every month, and efforts to curb the number of robocalls you receive haven\u2019t been exactly successful.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Federal Trade Commission receives about 300,000 complaints about unwanted robocalls every month, and efforts to curb the number of robocalls you receive haven\u2019t exactly been successful.\nChris Hughson of Portland, Oregon, was so fed up with receiving unwanted phone calls from telemarketers that he began filing lawsuits against auto-dialers.\nIt has called on major phone carriers to offer customers free tools to block unwanted calls.\n\u201cTechnology exists that can stop illegal robocalls before they reach you, but few consumers have access to it,\u201d said the consumer advocacy group on its campaign website.\nConsumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, launched a new campaign earlier this year to end robocalls."}
