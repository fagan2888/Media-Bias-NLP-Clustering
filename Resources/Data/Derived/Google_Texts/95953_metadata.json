''For some providers, especially those in expansion states with a previously high level of uninsured patients, this has been remarkably significant and is reflected in a notable drop in the level of uninsured care, and typically, a commensurate rise in Medicaid revenue.''\n\nS&P also noted that there is little evidence to suggest that new Medicaid enrollees are generating high medical costs \"although there have been a few anecdotes to the contrary.\"\n\nOn mergers and acquisition, S&P said, the rationale is evolving. At first M&A's were seen as a way to gain market share, leverage with payers, and economies of scale.\n\nNow, hospital leaders see M&A's as a good way to develop more comprehensive care models for the geographical regions they serve. S&P cautioned, however, that these M&A's are often taking place in a fee-for-service environment, and that only a handful of consolidated systems are operating in an at-risk payment model. In addition, hospital and health system M&A's are coming under increasing regulatory review by state and federal officials.\n\nWhile the outlook is stable, S&P identified several areas of concern:\n\nThe rollout for healthcare reforms such as value-based care has been uneven and slower than expected, with fee-for-service remaining the dominant payment model.\n\nIn addition, a \"credit gap\" continues to grow between larger providers with specific market skills and smaller providers that can't leverage their smaller size and scale.\n\nThe reemergence of inpatient utilization pressures as volume and payer mix improvement are absorbed into baseline performance.\n\nThe volatility of the investment income linked to recent declines in the financial markets.\n\nThe growing cost and price consciousness of healthcare consumers when choosing health insurance and care networks.\n\n\"We believe growing price consciousness on the part of healthcare purchasers, including individual consumers as well as large insurance payors, will continue to challenge many hospitals' payor mixes in the absence of meaningful wage growth,\" S&P said.\n\n\"This could lead to declining patient volumes, particularly elective procedures, partly because more people have to bear the first-dollar cost of their healthcare through higher deductibles and copayments but also because more people have lost employer-sponsored insurance.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals have seen a short-term boost in volumes, revenues, and improved payer mix thanks to the Affordable Care Act, says Standard & Poor's.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "finance, revenue, rural health, cost, business, ACO", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "S&P: Not-For-Profit Healthcare Remains StableHospitals have seen a short-term boost in volumes, revenues, and improved payer mix thanks to the Affordable Care Act, says Standard & Poor's.\nDespite ''significant transformation'' in the healthcare market that includes long-term declines for inpatient admissions and reimbursements, and the uneven transition to value-based care, the credit outlook remains stable in 2016 for the nation's not-for-profit healthcare sector, according to Standard & Poor's Rating Services.\nS&P credits the Medicaid expansion with a recent uptick in patient volumes but said that's like a ''temporary surge.''\nThe growing cost and price consciousness of healthcare consumers when choosing health insurance and care networks.\nWhile the outlook is stable, S&P identified several areas of concern:The rollout for healthcare reforms such as value-based care has been uneven and slower than expected, with fee-for-service remaining the dominant payment model."}
