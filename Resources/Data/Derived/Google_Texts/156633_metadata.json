So I was at work a couple weeks ago and I heard 2 teenage boys walked by this old man\u2019s house. He sits on\u2026 Posted by Josh Cyganik on Wednesday, July 15, 2015\n\n\n\n\u201c[Leonard] could hardly talk he was so ecstatic,\u201d Cyganik told ABC News. \u201cHe sits on his porch every day all day long so I wanted to give him a nice canvas to sit in front of.\u201d\n\nBullock was appreciative and happily agreed to let Cyganik paint.\n\nCyganik then posted a message to Facebook to recruit help. The post spread, with over 6,000 shares.\n\nBy the morning of July 18, Cyganik had over 100 volunteers sign up to help, with some even driving from Texas, Washington, and California to be a part of the effort.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe the turnout,\u201d Cyganik said to TODAY.com. \u201cI stopped counting at 95 because I couldn\u2019t keep up, but it ended up being well over that.\u201d\n\nPeople who could not make it sent food and water. Others donated money to Bullock and his wife.\n\nWith paint donated from a lumber supplier, Cyganik and his volunteers painted the home from white and turquoise to beige.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are calling me a hero, but I just wanted to paint a house,\u201d Cyganik told ABC News. \u201cThat\u2019s just how I was brought up \u2026 to respect your elders and help people in need.\u201d\n\nThe Bullocks watched the home makeover while sitting on lawn chairs. They sat on their front porch until 11 p.m. that night to wave as cars passed by to see the house.\n\n\u201cI know that will probably be the last coat of paint he sees on the house,\u201d Cyganik said. \u201cSo for me to give him that and to be able to see him on the porch smiling with a beautiful backdrop made it all worth it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "One Pendleton, Oregon community rallied around an elderly man after he was taunted by teenagers over the status of his home.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One Pendleton, Oregon community rallied around an elderly man after he was taunted by teenagers over the status of his home.", "title": "Over 100 Volunteers Rehab Elderly Man\u2019s Home", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150813_House.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-13T22:38:23+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1KjMlYu"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "One Pendleton, Oregon community rallied around an elderly man after he was taunted by teenagers over the status of his home.", "title": "Over 100 Volunteers Rehab Elderly Man\u2019s Home", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150813_House.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "American Dream", "published_time": "2015-08-13T16:58:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-13T22:38:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Josh Cyganik, Leonard Bullock, volunteer"}, "article_summary": "He sits on\u2026 Posted by Josh Cyganik on Wednesday, July 15, 2015\u201c[Leonard] could hardly talk he was so ecstatic,\u201d Cyganik told ABC News.\n\u201cA lot of people are calling me a hero, but I just wanted to paint a house,\u201d Cyganik told ABC News.\n\u201cI know that will probably be the last coat of paint he sees on the house,\u201d Cyganik said.\nWith paint donated from a lumber supplier, Cyganik and his volunteers painted the home from white and turquoise to beige.\nSo I was at work a couple weeks ago and I heard 2 teenage boys walked by this old man\u2019s house."}
