I even became a volunteer for a new GOP women\u2019s political action committee, hoping and believing that I could help with its goal of appealing to young women voters.\n\nBy dedicating time and thought to this challenge, I\u2019ve learned what so many political consultants already know but perhaps are not readily confessing: With no clear way to message on abortion in a way that will appeal to the 50 percent of women who are pro-abortion rights, we are really, really stuck.\n\nI\u2019ve discovered that brainstorming on the topic of women and the GOP is like the film \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d: I have to start over every time the topic of abortion comes around. As a result, I feel stumped, unable to come up with anything better than phrases like \u201ceconomic strength\u201d and \u201caffordable health care.\u201d I\u2019ve even spent time trying to develop a message on the concept of \u201cindependence,\u201d thinking maybe I can play this off of a \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d theme: \u201cFifty Shades of Dependence: Women Who Love Big Government\u201d versus \u201cFifty Shades of Freedom: Women Who Like to Do it Themselves.\u201d\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nBut you know what? None of it really works. Independence, economic opportunity, affordable health insurance \u2013 these messages aren\u2019t specific to women, and they can\u2019t compete with an emotionally charged phrase like \u201cwomen\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThe funny thing is that when I talk to women in my everyday life who are pro-abortion rights (neighbors, college classmates, people I meet at parties), it is so easy. I simply tell them that I share their desire to keep abortion safe, legal and rare, but it doesn\u2019t impact the way I vote since I\u2019m so confident that abortion rights are here to stay. I\u2019ll confirm that these women friends or acquaintances understand how unlikely it is that another Roe v. Wade-type case will ever make it to the Supreme Court, and how, even if Roe were overturned, abortion would not be immediately banned, but would simply be left to the states where, like so many other complex social issues, it probably belongs.\n\nI\u2019ll remind women that we\u2019ve had many years of Republican presidents and Republican majorities in Congress without abortion rights being taken away. And then I\u2019ll point out that I think we, as women, are being manipulated by interest groups on both sides of the issue. Most women will readily recognize that both sides are trying to scare us into writing a check or casting a vote. I will often note that I, personally, don\u2019t appreciate being talked to like I\u2019m nothing more than a set of reproductive organs. I\u2019ll make them laugh by telling them that Democrats make me feel like saying, \u201cHey, my eyes are up here.\u201d\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on the Democratic Party]\n\nIf I\u2019m getting a few nods at that point in the conversation, I sometimes ask women to take abortion off the table and then tell me how they feel about politics. Once that issue is put aside, I find there is all kinds of room to find common ground on issues like the economy, health care, the size of government, national defense, lawsuit abuse, et cetera.\n\nBut a campaign to reach out to women isn\u2019t a cocktail-party conversation. It\u2019s got to take the shape of talking points and bumper stickers and 30-second television ads. Oh, and P.S., Republicans would rather lose elections than raise a white flag of surrender on abortion. Publicly, anyway. But, wait, what if the conversation among women on this issue could be private and separate from the party platform?\n\nWhat if Republican women could, off the record, reassure undecided women voters that they should base their vote on issues other than abortion? Show them that their right to choose is not actually being seriously threatened and that thousands of Republicans are privately, quietly pro-abortion rights, while still comfortable being part of the GOP because they know it\u2019s actually a nonissue? What if we simply spread the word that it\u2019s okay to set yourself free from the fear and guilt of the abortion lobby; that it\u2019s necessary to take control of your own vote the way you want to keep control over your own body?\n\nMaybe the campaign idea I\u2019ve been searching for is #takeitoffthetable. As in: Take abortion rights off the table, then tell me what you\u2019re comfortable with when it comes to the size of government. Take it off the table, then think about what\u2019s best for our economy. Take it off the table, then tell me how you want America kept safe. Take abortion off the table, then talk about the cost and limited choices of health insurance under Obamacare.\n\nIf it sounds like the language of negotiation, it is. When you\u2019re making amends for mistakes, sometimes you have to negotiate. Republicans have made mistakes in this area. It\u2019s time to make amends and negotiate a way forward.\n\nA tough negotiation can also benefit from a proxy. In this case, the professional negotiators need to be women. Because girlfriends need to hear the truth on abortion from their own, sister to sister.\n\nI think the best advice I have is just this: If you are a pro-abortion rights Republican woman who is frustrated by seeing her friends vote for Democrats based on one intractable issue, think about starting your own #takeitoffthetable campaign where you take women aside, literally or figuratively, and tell them that the abortion issue is safely decided. Tell them that it\u2019s off the table. We can think about other issues now.\n\nLadies, I won\u2019t tell the party leadership if you won\u2019t. This is just between us girls, and the results could change the direction of a nation.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "How the GOP Can Get Unstuck With Women Voters on Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Republicans can move on from an intractable issue.", "title": "The GOP Is Stuck on Abortion (But Doesn't Have to Be)", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/08/13/how-the-gop-can-get-unstuck-with-women-voters-on-abortion", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/89/bb/0c3825784019b57a70fd4435ec72/140812-abortion-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans can move on from an intractable issue.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "How the GOP Can Get Unstuck With Women Voters on Abortion"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Aug. 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Jean Card,abortion,Republican Party,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republicans can move on from an intractable issue."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe361f\"", "article_summary": "What if Republican women could, off the record, reassure undecided women voters that they should base their vote on issues other than abortion?\nI\u2019ll remind women that we\u2019ve had many years of Republican presidents and Republican majorities in Congress without abortion rights being taken away.\nAs in: Take abortion rights off the table, then tell me what you\u2019re comfortable with when it comes to the size of government.\nI even became a volunteer for a new GOP women\u2019s political action committee, hoping and believing that I could help with its goal of appealing to young women voters.\nI\u2019ve discovered that brainstorming on the topic of women and the GOP is like the film \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d: I have to start over every time the topic of abortion comes around."}
