What do you do as a falconer?\n\nA. I work with falcons to rid areas of gulls and other birds that pose a danger or environmental threat at places like airports and landfills. Landfills are a food source for them, and their waste is a public health hazard. I\u2019ve worked for the company for almost four years, earlier at a military airfield in Kansas. Now I\u2019m at a landfill in New Jersey.\n\nDid the company train you to work with falcons?\n\nNo, I had hunted with falcons and hawks on my own, for sport, and I was already licensed. You really need to know what you\u2019re doing before you can do it as a profession.\n\nHow did you become interested in this field?\n\nMy aunt\u2019s neighbor was a falconer. When I was about 6, my cousins and I would go to his house to watch them. I was fascinated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHow did you get this job?\n\nI was working at a nature center while completing an apprenticeship on my own time when a falconer friend told me about this opening and I applied. My degree in geology with a concentration in environmental science from State University of New York at Cortland may have helped.\n\nWhat is your day like?\n\nIn the morning a co-worker and I move our 10 falcons to the outside pen. We release them one by one throughout the day to chase gulls away from the landfill and blow a whistle to signal them to return. When they do, we give them quail.\n\nDo you find your work rewarding?\n\nI love working with the birds; you have to be passionate about animals to do this. In the wild, you can\u2019t be 10 feet from a bird jumping out of a tree to catch a squirrel; it would fly away. But these are trained birds, so they accept us as part of their world.\n\nDo you have a favorite falcon?\n\nThat\u2019s like asking a parent if they have a favorite child. Elena, who weighs a pound and a half, is really cute and well-behaved. I also like Isabella, who sits next to Elena and is very dependable. We use her as our closer at the end of the day.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141206093417, "twitter": {"description": "A falconer works with the birds at airports and landfills to rid them of gulls and other birds that pose environmental threats.", "title": "Cleaning Up With Falcons", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/jobs/vocations-cleaning-up-with-falcons.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003268882"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/07/business/7-VOCATION/7-VOCATION-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/jobs/vocations-cleaning-up-with-falcons.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003268882", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/jobs/vocations-cleaning-up-with-falcons.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "jobs", "hdl_p": "Cleaning Up With Falcons", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/jobs/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 6, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Falcon Environmental Services, Inc", "keywords": "Hensel  Elizabeth,Careers and Professions,Falcon Environmental Services  Inc,Waste Materials and Disposal", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Patricia R.
