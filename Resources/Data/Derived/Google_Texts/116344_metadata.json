(Photo: Bryon Houlgrave/The Register)Buy Photo\n\nThe tally of those vying to be president of the United States has reached 21, with 16 of them Republicans. So, why did we single out one candidate who we believe should drop out of the race? Why him, and why did we take that position now?\n\nThose questions have been asked, in various forms, since The Des Moines Register published an editorial Monday evening saying Donald Trump needs to exit the race. Our editorial board \u2014 comprised of President and Publisher David Chivers, Opinion Editor Lynn Hicks, Editorial Writers Andie Dominick, Clark Kauffman and Rox Laird, and me \u2014 made the decision on the heels of Trump\u2019s appearance at the Family Leadership Summit in Ames.\n\nThat\u2019s where he insulted Sen. John McCain\u2019s war record. But it was more than that. Just last month, he drew criticism for his comments on Mexico and illegal immigrants.\n\nOur reasoning can be summed up perfectly in one sentence from the editorial: \u201cBy using his considerable wealth, his celebrity status, and his mouth to draw attention to himself, rather than to raise awareness of the issues facing America, he has coarsened our political dialogue and cheapened the electoral process.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to have serious debate when the field is this crowded, without one candidate commanding attention with outlandish statements and rhetoric.\n\nIt\u2019s time for serious conversations about serious issues facing America. Iowans want to talk about college affordability, the growing opportunity gap, terrorist threats, immigration reform and a host of other concerns close to home and overseas.\n\nThus far in the race, Trump does not appear serious about having those conversations by providing solutions and his vision.\n\nPredictably, we\u2019ve gotten reaction from Trump supporters and detractors, and Trump himself. Not surprisingly, he attacked the Register for our position, as well as our news reporting on his campaign.\n\nWe clearly stand by our editorial. We also stand by our reporting. We have covered his campaign fairly and accurately, even before his announcement for the presidency, and will continue to do so. Our editorial position has no bearing on our news reporting; our news reporters and editors aren\u2019t aware of our editorial board\u2019s decisions until an editorial is ready for publication.\n\nOur formal endorsement of candidates in the Democratic and Republican caucuses won\u2019t come until late January. We\u2019re watching all of the candidates closely. The Register has endorsed Democrats and has endorsed Republicans in presidential elections in the past. Our compass is guided by which candidate we believe is the right person to lead this country.\n\nTo get there, we need to have less vitriol and more thoughtful debate focused on issues that Americans truly care about.\n\nAmalie Nash is the executive editor and vice president for news and engagement at The Des Moines Register.
