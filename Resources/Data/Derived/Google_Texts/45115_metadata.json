Must be willing to accept large sums of money. Political prudence not required.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve been wondering why the threatened House lawsuit against President Obama hasn\u2019t been filed: apparently, there\u2019s a shortage of D. C. area lawyers looking for high profile cases and clients. No one will take taxpayer money from poor Speaker Boehner.\n\nRobert Costa and Ed O\u2019Keefe reported in The Washington Post last week that \u201cthe suit has wallowed ever since [late June] as GOP lawmakers have struggled to find a D.C. area law firm willing to take up their legal fight.\u201d\n\nThis may strike you as suggesting a lack of initiative on the part of the Republican leadership, but the article leaves room for a more flattering excuse: perhaps the Speaker, with Machiavellian craft, \u201cwas purposely stalling his legal fight to include whatever actions Obama opts to take to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws.\u201d\n\nFair enough. But think about how much more powerful the lawsuit would be if Speaker Boehner waited until we see just what the president plans to do about Iran, global warming, and the Obamacare employer mandate. By, say, New Year\u2019s Day, 2017, he could assemble such a powerful case that the most diffident D.C. attorney would be unable to turn him down\u2013if only a court would be willing to take a moot case against a president scheduled to leave office nineteen days later.\n\nWe\u2019ve expressed skepticism more than once concerning the merits of the Speaker\u2019s threatened lawsuit and his intentions to act forthrightly against President Obama\u2019s executive overreach. But to be fair, not all of this is his fault.\n\nBlame the Twenty-Second Amendment, which, since 1951, has limited presidents to two terms in office, and thereby has allowed the timid and distracted to run out the clock on every term-limited presidency. It\u2019s also produced a market for clever bumper stickers:\n\nImagine if, like many Americans reconsidering their vote for a second Obama term, we had a similar escape hatch from important personal decisions: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not going to be able to introduce you to my family this Thanksgiving. We\u2019re term-limited to Halloween.\u201d\n\nAlexander Hamilton offered a powerful case against presidential term limits in Federalist 72, arguing that \u201cthe duration of the executive magistrate in office and the stability of the system of administration\u201d go hand in hand. Better \u201cto give the officer himself the inclination and the resolution to act his part well\u201d than to promote a system in which the constant struggle for the office produces administrative instability.\n\nFurthermore, Hamilton argued, excluding a president from being re-eligible for office would:\n\nDissuade talented men from pursuing a challenging office they would have to relinquish quickly or from undertaking arduous, publicly-spirited projects they would have no time to complete. Tempt an avaricious executive to satisfy his appetites with \u201crecourse to the most corrupt expedients to make the harvest as abundant as it was transitory\u201d and an ambitious executive \u201cto embrace a favorable conjuncture for attempting the prolongation of his power\u201d by \u201cusurpation.\u201d Prevent experienced leaders from making use of wisdom acquired while in office. Place the nation in greater danger during times of national emergency. Make the administration of government \u201cmutable,\u201d \u201cfluctuating,\u201d and \u201cvariable.\u201d The last three points concern the necessary price of any forced change in officeholders. We naturally weigh this against the benefits of such a change when we consider the wisdom of any form of term limits. The first two, however, concern the disposition of the president toward the office\u2013a point often overlooked. At the heart of Hamilton\u2019s argument is this simple principle: that the interest and duty of every party to our republican system ought to coincide. A two-term (or any other) limit for presidents breaks that link in several ways.\n\nConsider first the case of the president himself. The United States, by the grace of God, has never had a president unwilling to relinquish his office at the expiration of his term. But we have suffered from many disappointing second terms, generally characterized in recent times by some combination of scandal, impotence, and imprudent legacy-building.\n\nScandals are never far from the presidency, but second-term scandals have more than once all but paralyzed it (think Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Clinton-Lewinsky). Weakness too, to one degree or another, is the experience of every lame duck officeholder, less and less able to command or intimidate as the end of a final term draws near. Even what seems to be the best impulse of second term presidents\u2013to build a \u201clegacy\u201dof historical significance\u2013is often spoiled by the divergence between the interests of the outgoing president and the American public at large, since, however meritorious his service, the president must give up power when the sand in his hourglass runs out. Thus, the legacy-builder prefers any international agreement now to a better one later (or, sometimes better yet, none at all), forced executive action over constitutional deliberation (which may produce very different results or, again, no action at all), and the like.\n\nThe influence of presidential term limits on Congress creates a similar separation between members\u2019 personal interest and their constitutional duty\u2013to represent themselves at the expense of their constituency. It is natural for Congresses to become risk averse as the end of a presidency draws near, calculating that being well-positioned for the next presidential election year is more important than confronting an outgoing president, whose power and prestige is already waning.\n\nAnd what of the people? An electorate with a term limit safety net can easily forgive itself, if not for its \u201cstupidity,\u201d then at least for a lack of presidential oversight. After the second midterm election, especially, there is less reason to keep an eye on a lame and lame duck president.\n\nAll parties, in sum, have incentives for unrepublican action almost from the moment of the president\u2019s reelection, undermining the system of responsible self-government our Constitution was designed to create.\n\nAll parties, in sum, have incentives for unrepublican action almost from the moment of the president\u2019s reelection, undermining the system of responsible self-government our Constitution was designed to create. How much does this matter? Imagine the current debate over immigration policy in a world without the Twenty-Second Amendment. President Obama, we have every reason to believe, would be much more hesitant to cut the gordian knot with executive action. He\u2019s already delayed action at least once based on political calculation\u2013and that merely on behalf of fellow party-members. How much more cautious would he be if he expected to be on the ballot in 2016\u2013or even was contemplating the possibility? Without a fixed term limit, you might again have the president\u2019s ambition counteracting his own ambition.\n\nAt the same time, the Republican leadership\u2019s implicit run-out-the-clock, quiet-lawsuit-in-the-corner strategy would be a non-starter. Make the public case against President Obama\u2019s executive overreach or risk losing to him in 2016 too.\n\nThe people would also have more reason to tune in. And altogether we\u2019d have the context for a real public debate on immigration, where all parties are engaged and mutually accountable.\n\nConstitutional amendments should never be proposed lightly, and certainly not merely to solve a temporary political problem. Of course, that reasoning adds to the case against the Twenty-Second Amendment, which was a response to FDR\u2019s unprecedented election to four presidential terms.\n\nThe bottom line for this, as for any institutional question, is this: is American liberty more secure with a presidential term limit or without? Alexander Hamilton suggests good reasons in Federalist 72 to believe the latter and our own experience in the sixty years since the ratification of the Twenty-Second Amendment confirms at least some of his fears.\n\nThere are, of course, other ways to stop executive amnesty, although long-shot, half-hearted lawsuits should not be among them. But repealing the Twenty-Second Amendment might help do this and more: reconnect the interest and duty of presidents, Congresses, and the people to responsible political action nearer to the limits of the Constitution.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 07:41:02 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Amnesty?
