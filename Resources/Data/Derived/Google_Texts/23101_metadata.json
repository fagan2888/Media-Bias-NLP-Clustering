As head of the Marijuana Policy Project, Kampia has his finger on the pulse of pot politics as well as anyone, and he made a pretty startling prediction at the International Drug Reform Conference in suburban Washington last weekend.\n\nAt a panel on \u201cMarijuana Reform in Congress,\u201d Kampia suggested that a handful of state-level marijuana legalization victories next year is going to set in motion a congressional debate on legalization that could see an end to federal marijuana prohibition before the end of the decade.\n\nLegalization campaigns are already well-advanced in Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, and Nevada, and while getting on the ballot is no guarantee of victory next November, polling so far suggests that most of them will win. And next year could also be the year the first state, and even perhaps a second, legalizes it through the legislative process.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s about to happen,\u201d Kampia said, \u201cVermont is most likely to legalize through the legislature, and Rhode Island has a good shot, but those are the only two states in play.\u201d\n\nBut then there are the initiative states.\n\n\u201cIt could be that four or five initiative states legalize it, and then all of this is facing Congress in 2017,\u201d Kampia continued. \u201cThen there will be a vigorous debate on legalization, and then, I predict, Congress could pass the states\u2019 rights bill in 2019.\u201d\n\nKampia is talking about something along the lines of this year\u2019s Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2015 (HR 1940), sponsored by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), which would amend the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) so that it would not apply to persons in compliance with marijuana laws in their state.\n\nPassage of such a bill would not make marijuana legal everywhere\u2014that would be up to the individual states\u2014but would end the federal government\u2019s role in enforcing marijuana prohibition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A handful of state-level marijuana legalization victories could spur federal action before the decade is out", "author": "Phillip Smith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A handful of state-level marijuana legalization victories could spur federal action before the decade is out", "title": "Soon we\u2019ll all be getting high: The end of marijuana prohibition is closer than you think", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/06/soon_well_all_be_getting_high_the_end_of_marijuana_prohibition_is_closer_than_you_think_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_241089598.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A handful of state-level marijuana legalization victories could spur federal action before the decade is out", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/shutterstock_241089598.jpg", "title": "Soon we\u2019ll all be getting high: The end of marijuana prohibition is closer than you think", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Soon we\u2019ll all be getting high: The end of marijuana prohibition is closer than you think", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Drugs, marijuana, Marijuana Policy Project, weed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, Drugs, marijuana, Marijuana Policy Project, weedRob Kampia thinks so, and he\u2019s a very well-placed observer.\nPassage of such a bill would not make marijuana legal everywhere\u2014that would be up to the individual states\u2014but would end the federal government\u2019s role in enforcing marijuana prohibition.\nAt a panel on \u201cMarijuana Reform in Congress,\u201d Kampia suggested that a handful of state-level marijuana legalization victories next year is going to set in motion a congressional debate on legalization that could see an end to federal marijuana prohibition before the end of the decade.\n\u201cIt could be that four or five initiative states legalize it, and then all of this is facing Congress in 2017,\u201d Kampia continued.\nAnd next year could also be the year the first state, and even perhaps a second, legalizes it through the legislative process."}
