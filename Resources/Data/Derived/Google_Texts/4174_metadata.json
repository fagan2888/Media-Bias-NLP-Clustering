That resident was taken to Poudre Valley Hospital for treatment.\n\nOf the three pets that were rescued from the fire, one dog needed medical attention and was taken to the Colorado State University Veterinary Hospital.\n\nA second alarm was almost immediately called while firefighters searched for possible trapped residents and attempted to extinguish the fire, Love said.\n\nA section of roof later collapsed, triggering a third call for reinforcements, he said. Loveland and Wellington fire departments responded to the fire.\n\nCrews worked to keep the inferno from spreading into other sections of the building and helped protect residents\u2019 belongings by placing fire-retardant covers over furniture.\n\nTwo apartments were heavily damaged by fire, smoke and heat. Six other units were damaged by smoke and water.\n\nInvestigators are working to determine what caused the fire.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell, denverpost.com/coldcases", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fort Collins fire: resident injured; pets rescued", "title": "Fort Collins fire: resident injured; pets rescued", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/10/fort-collins-fire-resident-injured-pets-rescued/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110_114004_apt-fire-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150110_114004_apt-fire-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-10T11:31:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T22:11:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Fort Collins firefighters rescued two dogs and a cat in an apartment blaze that injured one person and caused up to $100,000 in damage to eight apartments early Saturday morning, authorities say.\nOf the three pets that were rescued from the fire, one dog needed medical attention and was taken to the Colorado State University Veterinary Hospital.\nThat resident was taken to Poudre Valley Hospital for treatment.\nThirty residents were quickly evacuated from the building including a person who suffered non-life-threatening burns.\nA second alarm was almost immediately called while firefighters searched for possible trapped residents and attempted to extinguish the fire, Love said."}
