Col. Oliver North predicted that the Russians will kill famed National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and pin the murder on the United States.\n\n\u201cEdward Snowden is in the hands of the Russian intelligence services. Everyone he meets every day with is a Russian intelligence agent,\u201d North said Tuesday on the Fox News show, \u201cMarkets Now.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re all asking the questions: \u2018How do the Americans do this? Can we do this? How do we protect ourselves from what you\u2019re doing? How do we penetrate things like the American data system for, let\u2019s say, the Affordable Care Act?\u2019 And at the end of the day, what will happen is the Russians will kill Edward Snowden. And we will be blamed for it.\u201d\n\nGiven Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s momentum in the Middle East and the tenuous relationship between the Obama administration and the Russians, prospects don\u2019t look good, for Snowden or America. Snowden\u2019s death would benefit Russia, North said. He also offered this advice to Secretary of State John Kerry:\n\n\u201cAnd the reason they\u2019ll kill him is because they don\u2019t want us to know how much he gave away. This is a very, very serious problem. And what Mr. Kerry really ought to be doing is traveling to Moscow to see if he can convince Edward Snowden\u2019s dad to get the kid back home to face the music because the Russians will kill him.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about Obama\u2019s handling of intelligence matters and the NSA scandal, North said the president hasn\u2019t done his job well in either case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this president has handled anything in regards to national security in this country well.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com\n\nPost navigation\n\n[poll id=\u201d134\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "Ever the crack military analyst, Lt.
