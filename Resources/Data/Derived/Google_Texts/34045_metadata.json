They can go do that. They just can\u2019t spend the nights there or have barbecues during the day.\n\n\u201cThey need to get in and get out.\u201d\n\nAnd so the vacation homes will remain vacant until Congress can compromise and end the shutdown, which entered its fifth day on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a government shutdown,\u201d said Hitchcock, 71, a retired zone manager for 7-Eleven. \u201cI\u2019d call it a government meltdown. If my kids ever acted like these politicians are acting \u2014 it\u2019s probably not politically correct to say this anymore \u2014 but I\u2019d beat the crap out of them, then send them to their rooms.\u201d\n\nHitchcock, who has lived in his cabin for more than 25 years, said he knows the situation is completely out of his control. But being an adult about it doesn\u2019t make it any easier being away from what he truly loves: Restoring antique engines inside his garage while making daily trips on his motor scooter to Overton, the closest town, a 15-minute ride to the north.\n\n\u201cI seriously, seriously threatened to stay and not leave,\u201d says Hitchcock, recalling that moment when a pair of park rangers delivered the bad news. \u201cI mean, I thought, \u2018Are they really going to come down hard on somebody for trespassing inside his own home?\u201d\n\nIn the end, he took his friend\u2019s advice: The last place he wanted to wind up was in federal court.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018What if I don\u2019t leave,\u201d Hitchcock recalled. \u201cAnd they told me, they\u2019d issue me a citation, and when I asked them what would happen if I didn\u2019t pay the citation, they said they\u2019d take me to jail. And when I asked them which jail I was going to go to, they said \u2018Henderson.\u2019 \u201c\n\nPolitically speaking, Hitchcock is a lifelong Republican and proud of it. In fact, he sports a shirt that says, \u201cThe only thing I hate about Nevada \u2026 Harry Reid.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s of the opinion that the less government intervention, the better. He believes the U.S. government should pay its debt. He doesn\u2019t believe anyone, whether it\u2019s an individual or a government entity, should be able to borrow huge sums of money without paying it back.\n\nAfter all, he did very little borrowing over the course of his life, and what little he did, he paid back.\n\nIt\u2019s time to cut spending and take a closer look at slashing federal entitlements, he said.\n\nBut, as much as Hitchcock wants to scale back government, he\u2019s in this position because of the federal government shutdown.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who built the Hoover Dam, began giving away yearly leases on land around Lake Mead at bargain rates to make the place a popular tourist attraction.\n\nIn later years, the National Park Service took the land over. That\u2019s who Hitchcock has been writing his yearly rent check to since 1987, when he retired and bought the cabin from the previous owner.\n\nAt first the rent was only $500 a year; it\u2019s since grown to $2,400 a year.\n\nHe expected the increase, it was part of the deal 25 years ago. A deal that requires he take apart his cabin and haul it away when he ends his lease.\n\nBut he can\u2019t quite grasp this latest calamity. After all, he wasn\u2019t told to vacate during the Clinton Administration in 1995, when the government was closed down for more than three weeks.\n\n\u201cThis can\u2019t last forever,\u201d he says. \u201cOctober 17 is going to be a big deadline with the debt limit vote coming up. Heaven help me if the government doesn\u2019t open by then.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bob Hitchcock is in his \u201cleast favorite place\u201d these days \u2014 inside his landlocked Las Vegas home instead of at his cabin on the North Shore of Lake Mead, tooling around with old engines in his garage.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "TOM RAGAN LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "Shutdown forces owners to leave Lake Mead homes", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_004.jpg", "twitter": {"description": "Bob Hitchcock is in his \u201cleast favorite place\u201d these days \u2014 inside his landlocked Las Vegas home instead of at his cabin on the North Shore of Lake Mead, tooling around with old engines in his garage.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/shutdown-forces-owners-leave-lake-mead-homes", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_004.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_002.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_003.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_001.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_010.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_011.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_005.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_012.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_007.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_006.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_009.jpg"}, "title": "Shutdown forces owners to leave Lake Mead homes", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-06T01:05:19Z", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-797491"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=272303", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=272303", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=540820524", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "TOM RAGAN LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-section": "Government", "keywords": "Government,,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-05T18:05:19-07:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Government", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Bob Hitchcock is in his \u201cleast favorite place\u201d these days \u2014 inside his landlocked Las Vegas home instead of at his cabin on the North Shore of Lake Mead, tooling around with old engines in his garage.", "title": "Shutdown forces owners to leave Lake Mead homes", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/shutdown-forces-owners-leave-lake-mead-homes", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_OVERTONSHUT_004.jpg", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/government/shutdown-forces-owners-leave-lake-mead-homes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd803f\"", "article_summary": "Although Vanover couldn\u2019t put an exact number on how many residents were actually living in their vacation homes at the time of the government\u2019s closure, she wanted to make one thing clear: \u201cThey are all vacation homes and everybody who lives in them are considered visitors,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey need to get in and get out.\u201dAnd so the vacation homes will remain vacant until Congress can compromise and end the shutdown, which entered its fifth day on Saturday.\nHe\u2019s one of an estimated 60 families with vacation homes along the lake who were given notice by the National Park Service earlier this week to gather their stuff and leave, according to Christie Vanover, a spokeswoman for the Lake Mead Recreational Area.\nBut, as much as Hitchcock wants to scale back government, he\u2019s in this position because of the federal government shutdown.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it a government shutdown,\u201d said Hitchcock, 71, a retired zone manager for 7-Eleven."}
