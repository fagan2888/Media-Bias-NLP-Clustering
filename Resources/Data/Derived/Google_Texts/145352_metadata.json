In 2018, the so-called Cadillac tax kicks in on high-cost health insurance plans. The law lets companies offer wellness incentives valued at up to a 30 percent of plan premiums, and up to a 50 percent discount to nonsmokers.\n\n\"I think employers would be best served if the final (EEOC regulation) tracks the bipartisan provisions that were in the ACA,\" explained Katy Spangler, senior vice president for health policy at the American Benefits Council, \"particularly as they look to change their benefit design in anticipation of the 40 percent excise tax on high-cost plans, they need the maximum amount of flexibility.\"\n\nThe new EEOC proposal is open for public comments through June 19, with final rules expected later this year.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Wellness plan incentives have coaxed employees to get on a path to better health, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had posed a roadblock, until now.", "author": "Bertha Coombs", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Wellness plan incentives have coaxed employees to get on a path to better health, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had posed a roadblock, until now.", "title": "Wellness program rules still leave room for debate", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/24/clearer-rules-for-wellness-programs-perhaps-not.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/04/23/102615402-533764419.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wellness plan incentives have coaxed employees to get on a path to better health, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had posed a roadblock, until now.", "title": "Clearer rules for wellness programs?
