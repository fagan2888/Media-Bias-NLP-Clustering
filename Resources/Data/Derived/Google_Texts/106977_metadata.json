The target of his degrading tweets was \u201cFirst Takes\u201d host Cari Champion, whom Lange described as \u201cmy slave\u201d while referring to himself as Thomas Jefferson.\n\nBut Lange wasn\u2019t just writing sexually degrading things about Champion (\u201cjokes!\u201d) \u2014 he was tweeting at her, including her handle in the stream of comments and making her an audience to his racism and misogyny. The comments alone were vile, but Lange forcing Champion to receive an alert about them made the whole gross enterprise even grosser.\n\n#IStandWithCari started trending soon after, and ESPN issued a statement condemning Lange\u2019s comments. \u201cHis comments were reprehensible and no one should be subjected to such hateful language,\u201d the network said Wednesday. \u201cThey objectify and demean one of our valued employees under the thin guise of \u2018comedy\u2019 and are offensive to all of us. We will not dignify them with any other comment.\u201d\n\nPressure from Twitter, led by many women of color who first called Lange out, also lost him an appearance on @Midnight, which made him very mad at \u201cPC groups,\u201d which he expressed in a series of tweets on Wednesday:\n\nThis observation came while I was watching one of my favorite TV shows ESPNs First Take. I also noticed she was black. I then thought it would be funny to tweet JOKES about that observation. A decision which might be the end of modern comedy. I tweeted jokes that in the past I would\u2019ve said in privately in my home among friends. I know black women who could join me and handle it. I won\u2019t debate if the tweets were funny. That could take minutes of precious time left in my career. The issue is do they warrant an apology. Tricky question. I would rather load trucks for a living then ever apologize to one of these awful PC groups ruining the country. So that\u2019s a NO. But if it upset the lady in question that\u2019s another story. Let me say to Cari Champion if this hurt u in any way I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a comedian. Sometimes I\u2019m funny! For the record my moms disgusted w the tweets. But if I based my humor on my mom I\u2019d be broke. They\u2019re now telling me I can\u2019t appear on @Midnight tonight cause of the pressure they\u2019re getting from these groups. But who cares. I love the show & it\u2019s my living but who cares. These groups have won again. All I care about is @CariChampion Truly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A series of racist and sexist tweets about ESPN host Cari Champion lost him a gig.
