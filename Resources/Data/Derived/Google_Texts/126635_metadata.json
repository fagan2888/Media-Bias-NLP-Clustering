Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, stated that these children believe they will become American citizens once they come into the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis flood is going to mean children dying trying to get in,\u201d Issa told Fox News Radio. \u201cAnd more important, children coming here with the anticipation that somehow they\u2019re going to be granted citizenship and then they will bring the rest of their family \u2026 that\u2019s a false narrative. It\u2019s not consistent with what Republicans or Democrats would choose to do to fix the immigration problem.\n\nFBI Launches Criminal Investigation Into VA Health Care System\n\nMany say the influx of unaccompanied minors stems from word spreading that Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not hold children in detention and from misinformation about immigrant children who qualify for Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects some youth brought to the U.S. illegally from being deported. Others say the children are looking to reunite with parents who are already in the country.\n\nIssa blamed the Obama administration for not enforcing federal immigration laws for the problem to escalate.\n\n\u201cWhen the president made a decision that he was not going to enforce immigration laws \u2013 and some federal judges have agreed \u2013 he created a real magnet to pull in a great deal of new illegals, particularly children, who would qualify under the president\u2019s own executive DREAM Act,\u201d Issa explained to Fox News Radio. \u201cAnd when you become all three branches of government, this is what happens.\u201d\n\nIssa added: \u201cThis president is purposefully willing to do it on his own and ignore the Constitution, but yes, he would also like to backdoor his way into enforcing immigration reform.\u201d\n\nDurbin: White House Only Finalized Bergdahl Deal Day Before Swap\n\nThe children are mostly on their own, complicating the influx of migrants last month to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas that overwhelmed the Border Patrol there. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security started flying immigrants to Arizona, where they were released and told to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office near where they were traveling within 15 days.\n\nMexican immigrants caught crossing the border are usually deported immediately, but it is more difficult to deport migrants from Central American countries, especially if they are minors.\n\nImmigration advocates have warned for months that they expect tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors to cross the border this year.\n\nThe number of unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has soared more than 1,000 percent, according to Border Patrol data. In fiscal year 2009, border agents apprehended 3,304 such children from those three countries. This year, that figure is now more than 48,000 and expected to continue to grow. Meanwhile, the number of minors from Mexico crossing the border alone has dropped.\n\nArizona border officials will indefinitely continue to process hundreds of these Central American children immigrants caught crossing the border illegally from Mexico into Texas.\n\nImmigration authorities have so far provided few details about how many of those children are being flown from Texas to Arizona and how often, but in a statement said the flights will continue.\n\nArizona politicians have criticized the transfer of hundreds of migrant children to a state known for its immigration problem. But the mayor of a border town where the kids are being held in a former warehouse said Monday that the conditions of their temporary housing were good enough.\n\nNogales Mayor Arturo Garino toured the massive facility Monday where state officials say about 700 to 1,000 mostly Central American children were sent after they were caught crossing into Texas.\n\n\u201cThe warehouse is very nice comparing to a lot of what I\u2019ve heard. \u2026 I\u2019m very comfortable with it,\u201d Garino said.\n\nFederal authorities plan for the facility to be transitional, where the children will be vaccinated and given medical checkups. They will then be sent to facilities being set up in Ventura, California; San Antonio; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\n\nArizona Gov. Jan Brewer and other state officials have harshly criticized the transfers and called for them to stop, some even threatening criminal charges.\n\nMaricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery said Monday that immigration authorities may have violated state child abuse laws by dropping off women and children at Greyhound stations in Phoenix and Tucson a few weeks ago.\n\nBut border officials say that as long as the children keep coming, they need somewhere to hold them and expect to continue processing minors in Arizona.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2014 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
