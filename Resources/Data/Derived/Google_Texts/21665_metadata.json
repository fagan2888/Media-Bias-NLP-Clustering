Often, we don\u2019t even realize that we can smell until we get a whiff of something we wish we hadn\u2019t. According to a new study from Germany, our noses aren\u2019t the only part of our bodies capable of smelling. Apparently, our skin has scent receptors, too. Unlike those in our noses, these don\u2019t trigger emotion in our brains; they prompt our skin to heal itself.\n\nHanns Hatt and his laboratory at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany have discovered that Sandalore, a synthetic sandalwood oil often used in perfume, attaches to olfactory receptors in the skin, New Scientist reported. Normally, when you smell something with your nose, the smell receptors send a message to your brain. This can alert the brain to danger, relaxation, or the presence of a potential mate. Unlike the smell receptors in our nose, Hatt and his team found that the smell receptors in the skin triggered the skin cells to essentially repair damage. Although, according to Joel Mainland of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, \u201cthere is a big trend towards odor receptors being found elsewhere in the body doing other jobs,\u201d the fact that these receptors aid in wound repair is quite surprising.\n\nWhen the main skin cell type used in this study, called keratinocytes, was mixed with Sandalore for five days in a test tube, the cell reproduction increased by 32 percent and cell migration increased by nearly half. These are two necessary processes involved repairing damaged skin, New Scientist reported. According to Mainland, the concentration needed to achieve these repairs is much higher than that used to activate a receptor in the nose. It\u2019s more likely that a skin cream would be used to achieve these results rather than the strong smelling oils used in aromatherapy, Mainland told New Scientist.\n\nAlthough it the idea of a skin healing cream may sound exciting, the results are likely to differ depending upon the individual, due to the \u201cgenetic variation in the olfactory receptors,\u201d Mainland explained to Medical Daily. To one individual, the oil may have a healing effect, while on others with different olfactory receptors; the results could be neutral or even toxic. Mainland added however that \u201cconcern about drugs working on one subset of people and not on another subset are very real, but cases where a drug/cream are beneficial in one case and actually toxic in another are, I would imagine, quite rare.\u201d\n\nHatt suggests this study may usher in the developments of new disease treatments based on targeting scent receptors in other areas of our bodies. These could come in the form of treatments to heal wounds, repair skin damage caused by aging, and perhaps eventually drugs to treat internal organs, the researcher explained. Although this is all quite exciting, in Mainland\u2019s opinion \u201cwe won\u2019t have a new treatment based on this work in the next 1-2 years.\u201d This due to the often long period time if often takes to pass safety and efficacy trials. \u201cThis is not a slam against this work in any way\u2014it\u2019s just the way that anything in this field works,\u201d Mainland concluded.\n\nSource: Hatt H, Busse D, Kudella P, et al.
