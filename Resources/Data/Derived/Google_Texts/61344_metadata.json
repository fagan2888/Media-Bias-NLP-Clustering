The shooting happened at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., about 180 miles south of Portland. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP)\n\nIt is time for Americans to wake up and smell the coffin. On Nov. 13, ISIS carried out a carefully planned attack in six different locations in Paris. The death toll is 129 and more than 300 injuries. We have an administration that believes if we are nice to the Muslims, they will be kind in return. Our president, just hours before the massacre, announced that ISIS is contained. We have a military that is bare bones and generals who have disagreed with President Barack Obama have been fired.\n\nWe live in a very scary world, people. If you think that ISIS doesn\u2019t have plans for the United States of America, you had better start reading.\n\nThis country is being ridiculed all over the world and our president is a laughing stock. This weakness is very dangerous for the American people. Next year, we will have the most important general election of our country\u2019s future. When Democrats declare they believe our greatest enemy is climate change, we had better start looking for better leaders.\n\nIt is critical to our safety that we elect a president that is strong enough to stand up to our real enemies. Yes, we have a financial mess, unemployment, more people than ever on welfare, but our greatest fear is that the Caliphate will come to the United States. If you count all the hunters in this country, you will see that we have a well-armed army right here. We can survive and win the war against Islam. But, first we must start with an administration that understands the real danger we live in.\n\nBarbara Cochrane Bisby,\n\nMenasha\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1XF4oj2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We live in a very scary world, people.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "We live in a very scary world, people.", "title": "Our president is a laughing stock", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/12/01/our-president-laughing-stock/76625660/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We live in a very scary world, people.", "title": "Our president is a laughing stock", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fe334fb715c7ef3293a0dad7a5d45e130a7cdcef/c=529-0-3684-3155&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/02/WIGroup/FondduLac/635793997386113836-Obama-Oregon-School-S-Muno-1-.jpg", "creator": "@postcrescent", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "This country is being ridiculed all over the world and our president is a laughing stock.\nWhen Democrats declare they believe our greatest enemy is climate change, we had better start looking for better leaders.\nWe have a military that is bare bones and generals who have disagreed with President Barack Obama have been fired.\nIf you think that ISIS doesn\u2019t have plans for the United States of America, you had better start reading.\nYes, we have a financial mess, unemployment, more people than ever on welfare, but our greatest fear is that the Caliphate will come to the United States."}
