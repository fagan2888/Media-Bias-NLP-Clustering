This sample did not include people with \u201cred-flag\u201d symptoms such as pain radiating down the leg, which can indicate a nerve problem.\n\nFor those patients, prescriptions for opiate pain medication increased, from 19 percent in 1999-2000 to 29 percent in 2009-2010; likewise, referrals to another physician increased from 7 percent to 14 percent, and CT or MRI scans increased from 7 percent to 11 percent. These trends run counter to clinical practice guidelines, such as those published by the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians, the study says\n\nGetting an MRI scan or an X-ray is a reasonable step if back pain has persisted for six weeks or more, the guidelines say. But imaging can be misleading, Mehling says. In \u201c25 percent of people walking down the street with no pain,\u201d doctors could find some pathology, he says, such as bulging or thinning disks.\n\nIndeed, says Daniel Cherkin, a senior investigator at Seattle\u2019s Group Health Research Institute, \u201cin 85 percent of people, it\u2019s not possible to confidently identify a cause of back pain.\u201d\n\nWith unclear cause, treatment options are murky. Yet many doctors turn to surgery.\n\n\u201cAs a spine surgeon, I try to avoid surgery,\u201d says Jay Khanna, director of the Johns Hopkins Orthopedic and Spine Surgery practice. For chronic back pain, he recommends physical therapy to strengthen muscle support for the spine as well as \u201cactivity modification,\u201d which might mean avoiding bending over or lifting heavy things.\n\nIf pain persists, he may recommend injecting steroids or nerve blocks directly into the back. Such injections provide temporary relief \u2014 weeks to months for steroids \u2014 which might be enough for natural healing to take place.\n\nMore researchers are studying how the emotional component of pain contributes to back problems. One study found that people with acute back pain had increased activity in sensory areas of the brain, but people with chronic back pain had increased activity in emotional areas, which suggests doctors should find ways to address the emotional aspects of lingering pain.\n\nAlternative care, such as chiropractic, acupuncture, physical therapy, therapeutic massage or yoga, may also provide relief.\n\n\u2013 Jill U.
