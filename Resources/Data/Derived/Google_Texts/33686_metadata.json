That was for Amsterdam, not America.\n\nBut in November 2012, citizens in Colorado and Washington defied conventional wisdom and overwhelmingly voted to end their prohibitions on cannabis. Other states followed suit in 2014 and even more look poised to do so next year.\n\nNow, organizers in Colorado are hoping the state can be a trailblazer again by convincing voters to pass another policy many experts consider a pipe dream: free statewide healthcare.\n\nColorado\u2019s secretary of state, Wayne Williams, announced this week that ColoradoCare, a citizen initiative to implement a single-payer healthcare system in the state, had submitted enough valid signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot. The group turned in 158,831 signatures, far surpassing the 98,492 required. The initiative is tentatively titled Amendment 69.\n\nRelated: A single-payer system, like Medicare, is the cure for America's ailing healthcare | Bernie Sanders\n\n\u201cColoradans will have a chance to replace government and multinational corporate control of our health and our health care money with user-friendly, bureaucracy-lite, fiscally responsible financing,\u201d ColoradoCareYES, the advocacy group behind the initiative, triumphantly declared in an email after Williams\u2019s announcement.\n\nIf passed, ColoradoCare would create a single-payer system to provide health coverage for all residents of Colorado. It would be the first state to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with universal coverage.\n\nUnder the proposal, any time a Coloradan is billed for a healthcare service, they would simply forward that claim to ColoradoCare, which would foot the bill. Some services may require a small co-payment, but deductibles would be done away with altogether.\n\nIf that sounds similar to Medicare, that\u2019s because it is. Like Medicare, all Coloradans would be required to pay into ColoradoCare, and thus be entitled to its benefits. However, just as senior citizens are free to buy supplemental health insurance or skip Medicare altogether if they choose, residents of Colorado would be free to do the same with ColoradoCare.\n\nOne prominent supporter of the plan is Senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cColorado could lead the nation in moving toward a system to ensure better healthcare for more people at less cost,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told the Colorado Independent. \u201cIn the richest nation on earth, we should make healthcare a right for all citizens. No one should go bankrupt or skip getting the care they need because they cannot afford it.\u201d\n\nColoradoCare would be paid for through a mix of federal Obamacare and Medicaid funding, as well as a 10% payroll tax increase. One-third of this \u201cHealth Care Premium Tax\u201d would be assessed on individuals, with employers footing the other two-thirds.\n\nOpponents have already blasted the plan as a $25bn income tax hike. Advancing Colorado, a conservative group that Colorado Democrats claim has ties to the Koch Brothers, blasted the initiative in a press release: \u201cColoradoCare will triple our taxes, lead to rationing of health care and will make Colorado a less attractive state for Millennials, businesses and families.\n\n\u201cColoradans do not want to see their taxes triple and all the progress with health care reform thrown in the trash for a single-payer health care system. We can get more people covered, more affordably and more realistically with market-driven reforms that ensure choice and options.\u201d\n\nTR Reid, the author of ColoradoCare, batted away these claims. \u201cThe average family is currently spending $400 to $500 per month on health costs,\u201d or as much as 8% of the average monthly household income. \u201cColoradoCare would cost that family just $196 month,\u201d he said, a flat 3.3% of their income that would be paid in taxes.\n\nIn other words, taxes would indeed go up, but ColoradoCareYES argues the average Coloradan\u2019s healthcare expenses would go down even further and that everyone making $225,000 or less would pay less in the aggregate under ColoradoCare. Those making above that threshold would pay more.\n\nIn addition, ColoradoCare would actually cover everyone in the state, including the estimated 400,000 Coloradans who still lack health insurance under Obamacare. Unlike Obamacare, which denies benefits to undocumented immigrants, ColoradoCare would not deny care based on legal status. \u201cOur view is that if someone is living in our state and sending kids to our schools and has a contagious disease, we should treat them like everyone else,\u201d said Reid, who is the author of the New York Times bestseller, The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper and Fairer Health Care.\n\nSection 1332 of Obamacare allows states to opt out of the health reform law so long as the proposed replacement would provide coverage that doesn\u2019t cost more and was at least as comprehensive. Single-payer is one idea that would satisfy these requirements, but no state has implemented such a system yet. Lawmakers in Vermont had considered converting to single-payer, but the proposal was ultimately scrapped last December.\n\nAccording to an economic analysis commissioned by ColoradoCareYES, in 2019, Coloradans will pay $31.2bn in healthcare expenses for everything from premiums to deductibles and beyond. If ColoradoCare passes and takes effect in 2019, that overall cost of healthcare would be reduced to $26.7bn. Reid said he expects those savings to increase over time because a single-payer system wouldn\u2019t have the incentive to increase fees that for-profit health insurers do.\n\nAs the name implies, ColoradoCare would only cover Coloradans. A patient would have to show Colorado residency in order to get their care covered by the system. If an Ohioan breaks his leg on an Aspen ski vacation, he would have to use his Ohio-based insurance plan to pay for treatment at a Colorado hospital.\n\nState senator Irene Aguilar, a practicing physician and proponent of the measure, explained why the group is putting the measure to a citizens\u2019 vote rather than the normal legislative procedure. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to pass ColoradoCare through the legislature, but with the money in politics these days, there\u2019s just no chance,\u201d she said in a video. \u201cFortunately in Colorado, we don\u2019t have to wait for the legislature to get things done.\u201d\n\nInaction in the legislature is what prompted proponents of marijuana legalization to take the matter to a citizens\u2019 vote. And with success in Colorado and elsewhere, that legalization push is spreading across the country.\n\nCould healthcare be next? \u201cSome state has got to be brave enough to be the leader,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWhy not Colorado?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Coloradans will vote next year on whether to become the first state to opt out of ObamaCare and set up a single-payer system similar to Medicare", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Scott Keyes", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Coloradans will vote next year on whether to become the first state to opt out of ObamaCare and set up a single-payer system similar to Medicare", "title": "After pot legalization could Colorado spearhead universal healthcare?", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/13/colorado-spearhead-universal-healthcare-single-payer", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137f0099e98176c7c20f74ca8832d1fbc075ad5a/0_80_3888_2332/master/3888.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=b4328f7c5c4f41d8a92ebc4025604366", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/nov/13/colorado-spearhead-universal-healthcare-single-payer?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/13/colorado-spearhead-universal-healthcare-single-payer", "iphone": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/nov/13/colorado-spearhead-universal-healthcare-single-payer?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/137f0099e98176c7c20f74ca8832d1fbc075ad5a/0_80_3888_2332/master/3888.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@guardian"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://us-news/2015/nov/13/colorado-spearhead-universal-healthcare-single-payer?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Colorado,US healthcare,US news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2015-11-13T13:00:00.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-keyes", "section": "US news", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T15:36:26.000Z", "tag": "Colorado,US healthcare,US news"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137f0099e98176c7c20f74ca8832d1fbc075ad5a/0_80_3888_2332/3888.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=1ebf4f2f0fa6d3768da0ecb002c3f3af", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado,US healthcare,US news"}, "article_summary": "\u201cColoradans do not want to see their taxes triple and all the progress with health care reform thrown in the trash for a single-payer health care system.\nOne-third of this \u201cHealth Care Premium Tax\u201d would be assessed on individuals, with employers footing the other two-thirds.\nIf passed, ColoradoCare would create a single-payer system to provide health coverage for all residents of Colorado.\n\u201cColorado could lead the nation in moving toward a system to ensure better healthcare for more people at less cost,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told the Colorado Independent.\nIt would be the first state to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with universal coverage."}
