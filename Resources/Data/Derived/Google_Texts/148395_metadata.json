Ted Cruz (R-TX) says if he\u2019s president, he\u2019ll have real estate magnate and current national GOP frontrunner Donald Trump on his team in more ways than one: working on trade and immigration.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Cruz says he\u2019d bring Trump into his administration to negotiate trade deals. Last week, Cruz vowed on Jeffrey Kuhner\u2019s radio program that he would hire Trump to build the wall along the southern border with Mexico.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that Donald Trump would be a phenomenal negotiator with China and if you look at TPP [Trans Pacific Partnership], I have come out against TPP, it is an incredibly long and complicated mess of a bill,\u201d Cruz told Breitbart News when asked if Trump would make a good negotiator for the nation\u2019s trade deals.\n\nIt has more pages than the Gang of Eight amnesty bill and Obamacare combined. And I support free trade, but free trade that benefits American workers\u2014that opens up foreign markets to our products, to our agriculture, to our goods and services. There is no doubt that Donald Trump would be a tremendously effective negotiator to help open up foreign markets.\n\nEarlier in the day, during a press availability in his Greenville office, Cruz reiterated he has no plans whatsoever\u2014as many other candidates have tried but failed doing\u2014to attack Trump.\n\n\u201cOh listen, I like and respect Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz said when a reporter asked if he expected Trump to take aim at him now that at least one Iowa poll shows him ahead of Trump in the Hawkeye State. \u201cI continue to like and respect Donald Trump. While other candidates in this race have gone out of their way to throw rocks at him, to insult him, I have consistently declined to do so and I have no intention of changing that now.\u201d\n\nA poll from Monmouth University released this week shows Cruz with a five-point lead over Trump in Iowa. Cruz\u2019s 24 percent in that poll is five points better than Trump\u2019s 19 percent. In third place is Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) with 17 percent and in fourth is Dr. Ben Carson with 13 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
