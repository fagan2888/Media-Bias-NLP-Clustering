After a brief investigation, suspect Jesse Matthew was quietly allowed to leave campus in the middle of the semester, less than a month after he had joined the school\u2019s football team. The police were not notified, and Matthew was never charged with assault.\n\nMatthew was also implicated in rape charges at Liberty University in 2002, but claimed the relationship was consensual. In that instance, police apparently persuaded the woman not to pursue charges, and the case was never brought. A trail of assault reports followed in Matthew\u2019s wake over the next decade, most of them involving young college-aged females.\n\nWe now have come to learn that Matthew is the prime suspect in the recent kidnapping and death of Hannah Graham, a University of Virginia sophomore. DNA evidence also links him to the 2009 disappearance of Morgan Harrington, another UVa student whose dead body was found dumped on a rural farm in Virginia. He\u2019s also been charged in a 2005 sex assault in Fairfax County, based on DNA evidence.\n\nTo be fair, Matthew has not been convicted of any of these crimes, and could be totally innocent. But to the casual observer, the patterns and coincidences are too numerous to ignore.\n\nYet there are those in society that feel that the whole issue of campus sexual assault is the result of feminist political correctness run amok. Commentators including George F. Will have even alleged that identifying oneself as a rape victim bestows \u201ccoveted status\u201d among women on college campuses. I wonder if the parents of Graham and Harrington would agree.\n\nColumbia University is widely known as a bastion of feminist scholarship. And yet it is facing a class-action suit by 23 current and former students for failure to adequately address allegations of sexual abuse.\n\nThe lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, Emma Sulkowicz, says she initially did not report the assault to college authorities because she was ashamed, but only stepped forward after several of her classmates confided that they had also been sexually assaulted by the same perpetrator. She stepped forward, she said, to protect other potential victims.\n\nAfter a university panel considered her and other women\u2019s accusations, and heard testimony from the accused, it dismissed the women\u2019s complaints. Still, Ms. Sulkowicz proceeded with her lawsuit because, in her words, \u201cColumbia University is harboring a serial rapist.\u201d\n\nNo one other than Ms. Sulkowicz and the suspect really knows what happened between them. That is the real challenge in rape cases in general, and the reason why less than 20 percent of rape cases end in conviction. Contrary to Mr. Will\u2019s assertion, far from conferring a \u201ccoveted status\u201d upon the victim, rape is so closely associated with negative stigmas about victims that it is second only to child molestations as the most underreported violent crime in America. Compound that with the incentive for colleges to avoid bad publicity (and legal culpability), and we have a potential crisis on our hands.\n\nLet me be the first to say this. Colleges and universities are not equipped to adjudicate violent crimes like sexual assault (or assault in general). They do not possess the investigative resources, training, expertise, or legitimacy that traditional law enforcement bring to the table. And yet every day across America, colleges are attempting to try and determine which assault accusations merit disciplinary action and which don\u2019t.\n\nA recent survey conducted among over 250 colleges revealed that almost three out of every four had no protocol for how to work with the local police in sexual assault cases, and many had no formal process for dealing with the allegations internally. In many instances, even when universities do the right thing and the victim is informed of his or her option to report the crime, the crime still goes unreported because victims feel that once the police are involved, they won\u2019t be able to control the process.\n\nBut rape is not only stigmatizing for the victim. It also stigmatizes the accused. In fact, social stigma, often appearing in the form of punishments such as a \u201cregistered sex offender\u201d designation, is one of the ways in which society attempts to discourage sexual violence. The reality is that the allegation of sexual assault should stigmatize the author of a false accusation, and it should also stigmatize the perpetrator of a crime.\n\nThe threat of stigma is a means by which we as a society teach and enforce moral behavior to children and adolescents. Correctly applied, these stigmas encourage moral excellence (not merely adhering to the limits of legally permissible behavior). The \u2018coveted status\u2019 we should all be striving for is moral excellence.\n\nThe problem with sweeping accusations of sexual assault among college students under the rug is that it encourages misbehavior among both sexes. The \u201cboys will be boys\u201d attitude about raucous college antics flies in the face of society\u2019s increasingly co-educational schools and workplaces, where that behavior will be counterproductive. Furthermore, the reluctance to report such crimes to the proper authorities on the part of victims puts other potential victims at increased risk of serious harm.\n\n\u2022 Armstrong Williams is sole owner/manager of Howard Stirk Holdings and executive editor of American CurrentSee online magazine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let me be the first to say this.
