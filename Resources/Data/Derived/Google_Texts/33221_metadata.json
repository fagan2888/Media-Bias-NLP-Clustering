A member of the club for the past 12 years, Wyatt was looking for a specific buck, a main frame 11-pointer with kickers he knew was there.\n\nPowell Bottom is a 9,000-acre tract that is cooperative managed by a number of clubs. Wyatt and his group have about 1,900 acres leased.\n\nAfter taking several days off from hunting, Wyatt was back in the stand for an afternoon hunt Oct. 3.\n\n\u201cI had some deer come out to the feeder and they ate up all the corn. This deer came out and was looking for corn,\u201d Wyatt said.\n\nHe explained he was hunting an area that had been clear cut about five years and replanted two years ago, so there was no vegetation above about head high.\n\nAs he watched the deer a pipeline plane flew overhead.\n\n\u201cHe must have seen the deer because he turned around and flew back over. When he came back the buck ran off,\u201d Wyatt said.\n\nAfter about an hour the buck came back out. Wyatt could see the kickers, but with the setting sun in his face he actually thought it was the bigger deer he was looking for.\n\n\u201cI just made a mistake,\u201d he said.\n\nIn this case it wasn\u2019t that bad of a mistake.\n\nWyatt said he has had pictures of this deer on a game camera for the past three years. It was almost shot two years ago, but after breaking a tine the hunters decided to let it go. Last year Wyatt and his wife had several chances to take the buck, but decided to pass.\n\n\u201cI have this deer\u2019s horns from last year. He looks just like he did last year, but has twice the mass,\u201d he said.\n\nThis deer was a main frame 9-point with three kickers that added just over eight inches of non-typical points. It had a longest main beam length of 25 2/8 inches and a longest tine of 12 6/8 inches. It had an inside spread of 17 1/8 and a largest base mass measurement of 4 5/8.\n\nBased on previous pictures of the deer Wyatt believes it to be at least 4\u00bd years old, but its teeth indicate it to be just 3\u00bd.\n\nWith Wyatt\u2019s entry Palestine\u2019s Donald Ressler drops to second place in the division. Ressler took a 9-point buck scoring 135 7/8 hunting with a crossbow in Anderson County.\n\nRegistration continues for the Big Buck Contest and is free at any of the contest sponsors including: The Tire Barn, 13687 FM 206 at Spur 364; Army/Navy Store of Tyler, 1201 E.SE. Loop 323; East Texas Seed, Cotton Belt Rail Yard; Lynch\u2019s Food Store, 3400 E. Fifth; Mac\u2019s Gun Shop, 213 E. Elm; Noonday Gun Trader, 14674 Texas 155 South; and Still Life Taxidermy, 1415 E. Tyler St., Athens. Participating hunters must register at least 24 hours before taking their deer.\n\nThere is one change in this year\u2019s contest. The Youth Division will include both statewide boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 categories. The girls\u2019 division replaces the South Texas division for the Youth Division, open to hunters 16 years old and younger.\n\nWinners in the two youth divisions will receive a mount of their buck. Second and third place winners will receive a gift certificate.\n\nThe contest has three adult divisions: North Texas, South Texas and Women\u2019s. Winners in each division will receive a Remington .270-caliber rifle and a mount of their deer. Second-place winners will receive gift certificates.\n\nNo deer taken within a high-fence property may be entered in the contest.\n\nOnly bucks with hardened antlers may be entered in the contest. This eliminates so-called velvet-horned deer from the competition. The change was made not because velvet-horned deer aren\u2019t bucks, but because the velvet covering provides an unfair scoring advantage.\n\nAll deer must be taken to either Still Life Taxidermy or Lynch\u2019s Food Store within 10 days of being harvested to be entered in the contest.\n\nThe contest runs through Jan. 26, one week after the regular season closes in South Texas.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "Change has come quickly this season to Tyler Paper\u2019s 34th annual Big Buck Contest.", "title": "Panola County buck takes contest lead - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-Outdoor/187684/panola-county-buck-takes-contest-lead", "image": "http://www.focusinon.me/photos/i-bHsFggq/0/L/i-bHsFggq-L.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda58f\"", "article_summary": "The girls\u2019 division replaces the South Texas division for the Youth Division, open to hunters 16 years old and younger.\nChange has come quickly this season to Tyler Paper\u2019s 34th annual Big Buck Contest.\nThe contest has three adult divisions: North Texas, South Texas and Women\u2019s.\nRegistration continues for the Big Buck Contest and is free at any of the contest sponsors including: The Tire Barn, 13687 FM 206 at Spur 364; Army/Navy Store of Tyler, 1201 E.SE.\nAfter taking several days off from hunting, Wyatt was back in the stand for an afternoon hunt Oct. 3."}
