GEORGETOWN, Ind. - Southern Indiana authorities have identified a UPS driver who was killed in a fiery highway crash while making a Thanksgiving Day delivery.

Floyd County Sheriff Frank Loop says Greg McCoy died early Thursday when his tractor-trailer slammed in a light tower and burst into flames on westbound Interstate 64 at the Georgetown exit. The truck and all packages on board were destroyed.

McCoy and another UPS truck driver were traveling close together after leaving Louisville, Kentucky, and were talking on their two-way radios when the crash occurred. The other driver was waiting for McCoy to reply when he saw him lose control of his vehicle and crash.

Loop says officials donâ€™t yet know what caused McCoy to crash the truck.
