First, he signed with Legacy Fighting Championships, only to have his contract bought out by Bellator before ever stepping foot in the LFC cage. He was then entered in the Bellator season 9 welterweight tournament, except that shortly thereafter, he injured his rib and decided to retire from the sport to find a \u201creal job.\u201d Except that less than a month later, Riddle announced his unretirement and accepted a fight at Bellator 109.\n\nUnfortunately for Riddle, it looks like he will have to start looking for a \u201creal job\u201d once again (I hear Josh Rosenthal is seeking an understudy/mule), as he has now been released from his Bellator contract after pulling out of his second straight fight. Said Bellator Director of Communications Anthony Mazzuca in a prepared statement (via MMAFighting):\n\nMatt was a guy we had high hopes for coming into Bellator. After Matt suffered his rib injury and withdrew from our tournament, we went back to the drawing board and got Matt another fight on November 22nd. Unfortunately, Matt very recently informed us he would not be fighting on November 22nd from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and at that point we decided to release Matt from Bellator. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.\n\nFurther muddying the \u201cDeep Waters\u201d (I\u2019m so sorry, you guys) is the fact that no solid reasoning has been given for Riddle\u2019s withdrawal from the card. As you might expect, Riddle\u2019s scheduled opponent, Nathan Coy, is understandably pissed (via BloodyElbow):\n\nHe bailed out. I\u2019m not happy about it. As far as I know, maybe he was sick and didn\u2019t get the proper training in. I\u2019d love to have him in the first round of the tournament and smash him up. Maybe he wants to put it off. I\u2019ll fight him no problem. If he wants to wait until he can be better another day, I\u2019m fine with that. Just make sure you man up and fight that day. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s trying to accomplish here by playing games. This is my livelihood. I\u2019m supporting my family by doing this. I needed this opportunity like he needed this opportunity. It\u2019s his hometown. What the hell\u2019s going on? He should be thrilled to fight on that card. Apparently not. Apparently he doesn\u2019t want that. Let\u2019s fight, you\u2019re a fighter. This is what we got into the sport for, to test ourselves.\n\nFor whatever reason, I am only reminded of that awesome Little Caesar\u2019s Pizza commercial when reading Coy\u2019s reaction. You know the one\u2026\n\nDammit, now I just want to get super high and eat five dollar pizza until my intestines explode. Does that count as walking a mile in Riddle\u2019s shoes?\n\n-J.
