That same week, the pro-Israel group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) also plans to deploy hundreds of activists to Capitol Hill.\n\nCongress has until Sept. 17 to act on the deal, and Republicans are planning to introduce a resolution of disapproval, which if passed would prevent the deal from being implemented.\n\nIf Republicans remain united, they would need six Democrats in the Senate to pass a resolution of disapproval. There are plenty of Republicans in the House to pass the resolution, where there is no filibuster. But its unclear if there are the 60 votes needed to move the resolution in the upper chamber.\n\nIf the resolution does pass Congress, President Obama has threatened a veto, forcing the deal's critics to gather two-thirds support to override him. Even Republican leadership says that is unlikely.\n\nStill, deal opponents are hoping to first pass the resolution, while proponents are attempting to prevent them from even getting to that point.\n\nUndecided lawmakers \u2014 particularly Democrats \u2014 have also been under intense pressure in recent weeks, bombarded by ads, phone calls and activists from both sides.\n\nTea Party Patriots CEO and co-founder Jenny Beth Martin said the group recently organized protests at 185 different local congressional and senatorial offices across the country on a recent day of activism.\n\n\"We look forward to our next round of protests on September 9 on the West Lawn of the Capitol,\" she said.\n\n\"The American people have not forgotten the 444 days their compatriots were held against their will by the Iranian regime,\" she continued. \"Nor have they forgotten that we are only days removed from Ayatollah Khamenei's repeated calls for 'Death to America.'\n\n\"This \u2018deal\u2019 does not prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons; it virtually guarantees it,\" she said. \"Congress must reject this terrible deal.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The rally will be held a day after Congress returns to Washington.", "description": "The rally will be held a day after Congress returns to Washington.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The rally will be held a day after Congress returns to Washington.", "title": "Iran deal opponents plan DC rally for Sept. 9", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252145-anti-iran-deal-groups-to-hold-rally-as-congress-returns", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/iranprotest_timessquare_072215getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252145-anti-iran-deal-groups-to-hold-rally-as-congress-returns", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-27T18:30-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kristina Wong", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Tea Party movement, American Israel Public Affairs Committee,Donald Trump, Ted Cruz,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-27T18:30:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252145-anti-iran-deal-groups-to-hold-rally-as-congress-returns", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The rally will be held a day after Congress returns to Washington.", "card": "summary", "title": "Iran deal opponents plan DC rally for Sept. 9"}, "dcterms.title": "Iran deal opponents plan DC rally for Sept. 9"}, "article_summary": "A coalition of three anti-Iran deal groups will host a rally on Sept. 9 on Capitol Hill, as members of Congress return from recess and prepare to vote on the deal.\nIf the resolution does pass Congress, President Obama has threatened a veto, forcing the deal's critics to gather two-thirds support to override him.\nStill, deal opponents are hoping to first pass the resolution, while proponents are attempting to prevent them from even getting to that point.\n\"This \u2018deal\u2019 does not prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons; it virtually guarantees it,\" she said.\nCongress has until Sept. 17 to act on the deal, and Republicans are planning to introduce a resolution of disapproval, which if passed would prevent the deal from being implemented."}
