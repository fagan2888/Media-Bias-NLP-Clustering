Officials said the plan had begun to grow so fast that they were uncertain it would be able to afford to cover all its members\u2019 health-care claims if it expanded further.\n\n\u2014 Susan Levine and Amy Goldstein\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nAstronomer accused of harassment resigns\n\nA prominent astronomer resigned Wednesday from the University of California at Berkeley after an investigation found that he sexually harassed female students over many years, two top administrators said.\n\nThe university immediately accepted professor Geoffrey Marcy\u2019s resignation, according to a statement from Chancellor Nicholas B. Dirks and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Claude Steele.\n\nThe university has not released details of a six-month investigation into one of the world\u2019s leading experts on planets outside Earth\u2019s solar system. The inquiry involved incidents dating as far back as 2001. Marcy apologized last week, but the university faced growing pressure to fire him.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nJudge orders man to be forcibly medicated\n\nA North Carolina man accused of trying to join al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Syria should be forcibly injected with anti-psychotic medication to see if that will make him competent to face trial, a federal judge ruled.\n\nBasit Sheikh faces serious charges that require a trial and prison doctors could medicate him with limited side effects, U.S. District Judge Terrence Boyle in Raleigh said in his order Tuesday. He put the order on hold to allow an appeal, which was filed Wednesday. Sheikh, 32, of Cary, is charged with attempting to join Jabhat al-Nusra militants. He was arrested almost two years ago in an FBI sting.\n\n\u2014 Associated Press\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nNo release of photos in church shooting\n\nGraphic crime scene photographs and audio of 911 emergency phone calls made after a gunman killed nine people in a Charleston church in June will not be released to the public, a South Carolina judge ruled Wednesday.\n\nJudge J.C. Nicholson said releasing the sensitive materials collected as evidence in the prosecution of the accused shooter would harm the victims in the case.\n\nNicholson in July blocked the release of all investigative materials gathered in the state\u2019s case against Dylann Roof, 21, a move challenged by news media organizations that argued the gag order was too broad. On Wednesday, the judge lifted the gag order for the bulk of the other evidence in the case.\n\nNine black churchgoers died in the June 17 attack at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n\u2014 Reuters\n\nNEW YORK\n\nParents face charges in death of teenager\n\nA New York couple were charged with manslaughter in the death of their 19-year-old son \u00adafter allegedly beating him for hours during a family counseling session inside the \u201csanctuary room\u201d of an upstate church, police said Wednesday.\n\nThe victim\u2019s parents, Bruce Leonard, 65, and Deborah Leonard, 59, were arraigned Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. They were being held in lieu of $100,000 bail each.\n\nIn addition, four of the couple\u2019s fellow parishioners were charged with assaulting the teenager\u2019s younger brother on Sunday at the Word of Life Church in Chadwicks, about 50 miles east of Syracuse.\n\nThe brothers were subjected to \u201cphysical punishment over the course of several hours in the hopes that each would confess to prior sins and ask for forgiveness,\u201d New Hartford Police Chief Michael Inserra said.\n\nThe older brother, Lucas Leonard, died Monday afternoon after being driven to a hospital by family members, who falsely told doctors the teenager had suffered a gunshot wound, police said. Leonard\u2019s injuries were consistent with blunt-force trauma to his torso and extremities. Church members told police that Leonard\u2019s 17-year-old brother, Christopher, had also been severely beaten during the counseling session.\n\n\u2014 Reuters\n\nCustoms computers go down briefly at airports: U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the computer systems used to process international travelers at airports across the United States went down for about 90 minutes Wednesday evening.
