So that\u2019s who we are at war with,\u201d Holder said, \u201cand we are determined to take the fight to them to prevent them from engaging in these kinds of activities.\u201d\n\nIndividuals with ties to al Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS, also known as ISIS and ISIL) carried out attacks in Paris that left seventeen dead, including journalists at the satirical paper Charlie Hebdo.\n\nHolder spoke to ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d and three other Sunday programs, from France, where he was concluding meetings with his European counterparts, discussing the attack and the threat of terrorism.\n\nThe threat, Holder said, has changed in recent years, and the primary concern is not another large scale attack, like what occurred on September 11, but an attack by a \u201clonewolf\u201d terrorist.\n\n\u201cI certainly think the possibility of such attacks in the United States exists,\u201d Holder said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something we worry about all the time. It\u2019s something that we meet about all the time. It\u2019s something frankly that keeps me up at night, worrying about the lone wolf or a group of people, very small group of people, who decide to get arms on their own and do what we saw in France this week,\u201d he said.\n\nIn many ways those smaller attacks are more difficult to detect, but the U.S. government, Holder said, is focused on preventing them and working with \u201cstate and local counterparts to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nDespite those efforts, and the efforts of governments around the world, some lawmakers noted that the threat is unlikely to subside.\n\nSenator Richard Burr (R., N.C.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told ABC that a host of groups located throughout the Middle East have a clear desire to attack innocent civilians in places like France and the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen you look around the world, whether it\u2019s in Yemen, whether it\u2019s in Syria, whether it\u2019s Iraq, whether it\u2019s in Afghanistan or in North Africa with Boko Haram, we\u2019ve got terrorist elements that are carrying out terrorist attacks, and if you put that collection together what you\u2019ve got is a war on Western civilization,\u201d said Burr.\n\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter which terrorist group we insert into the blank, the commitment is that they\u2019re out to kill innocent people, and whether it happens in Paris or London or New York we\u2019ve got to collectively do our best to make sure we thwart those attacks.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama invited allies to attend a February 18 \u201csecurity summit,\u201d in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe summit intends to increase cooperation as countries discuss the various ways to \u201ccounteract this violent extremism that exists around the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Prime Minister of France, Manuel Valls, said in a speech Sunday that his country was at war with radical Islam, but U.S. officials refrained from using similar language on Sunday.
