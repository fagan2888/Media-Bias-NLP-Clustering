The Broward County Sheriff’s Department arrested a veteran deputy Tuesday on multiple charges relating to prescription drugs.

Eduardo Mesa, 40, was arrested by the BSO Public Corruption Unit just before noon Tuesday. He was charged with one count each of: armed trafficking in hydrocodone; possession of Alprazolam; grand theft of a controlled substance; tampering with evidence and official misconduct/falsifying public or court records.

The charges come from a January incident when Deputy Mesa was responding to a pedestrian who was hit by a train. BSO said Mesa took custody of the dead person’s belongings including a suitcase, ID, clothing, and several prescriptions.

When a homicide detective asked Mesa for his report and the belongings, Mesa told him he threw away everything except for the prescription medications. The homicide detective said he saw a prescription bottle at the crash scene labeled with the victim’s name containing hydrocodone and confirmed with the Crime Lab that the medications were not submitted.

The Public Corruption Unit got a search warrant for Mesa’s patrol car and said it found a prescription bottle containing hydrocodone that was labeled with the train victim’s name. BSO also said it found 26 Alprazolam (Xanax) pills in the car, but never found the prescription for Klonopin.

Mesa was suspended without pay and being held without bond.
