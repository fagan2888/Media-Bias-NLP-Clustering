Kaiser Health News, in a story published Tuesday, noted that some employers are demanding that their workers buy the firm's health plans and they are deducting the monthly costs from their paycheck "whether they want to or not."

The story notes that under the Affordable Care Act, "employers with 100 or more full-time workers can enroll them in company coverage without their say so as long as the plan is affordable and adequate. That means the employee contribution is no more than 9.5 percent of the federal poverty guideline and the plan pays for at least 60 percent of covered medical expenses, on average."
