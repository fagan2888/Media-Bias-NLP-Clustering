He took a biopsy, returning 15 minutes later to confirm the diagnosis and schedule her for an outpatient procedure at the Arkansas Skin Cancer Center in Little Rock, 30 miles away.\n\nThat was the prelude to a daylong medical odyssey several weeks later, through different private offices on the manicured campus at the Baptist Health Medical Center that involved a dermatologist, an anesthesiologist and an ophthalmologist who practices plastic surgery. It generated bills of more than $25,000.\n\n\u201cI felt like I was a hostage,\u201d said Ms. Little, a professor of history at the University of Central Arkansas, who had been told beforehand that she would need just a couple of stitches. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any clue how much they were going to bill. I had no idea it would be so much.\u201d\n\nReaders have shared their experiences by responding to questions in this article. Comments are now closed, but you may explore the responses received. I will write a follow-up article about your comments in the coming days.\n\nMs. Little\u2019s seemingly minor medical problem \u2014 she had the least dangerous form of skin cancer \u2014 racked up big bills because it involved three doctors from specialties that are among the highest compensated in medicine, and it was done on the grounds of a hospital. Many specialists have become particularly adept at the business of medicine by becoming more entrepreneurial, protecting their turf through aggressive lobbying by their medical societies, and most of all, increasing revenues by offering new procedures \u2014 or doing more of lucrative ones.\n\nIt does not matter if the procedure is big or small, learned in a decade of training or a weeklong course. In fact, minor procedures typically offer the best return on investment: A cardiac surgeon can perform only a couple of bypass operations a day, but other specialists can perform a dozen procedures in that time span.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat math explains why the incomes of dermatologists, gastroenterologists and oncologists rose 50 percent or more between 1995 and 2012, even when adjusted for inflation, while those for primary care physicians rose only 10 percent and lag far behind, since insurers pay far less for traditional doctoring tasks like listening for a heart murmur or prescribing the right antibiotic.\n\nSharp Climb Salaries in some medical specialties have risen much more sharply than in others. $350 Diagnostic radiology 300 250 Hematology and oncology 200 Dermatology 150 Primary care 100 Figures in thousands, adjusted for inflation to 1995 dollars. The actual dollar figures in 2014 are higher. 50 1995 2012\n\nBy 2012, dermatologists \u2014 whose incomes were more or less on par with internists in 1985 \u2014 had become the fourth-highest earners in American medicine in some surveys, bringing in an average of $471,555, according to the Medical Group Management Association, which tracks doctors\u2019 income, though their workload is one of the lightest.\n\nIn addition, salary figures often understate physician earning power since they often do not include revenue from business activities: fees for blood or pathology tests at a lab that the doctor owns or \u201cfacility\u201d charges at an ambulatory surgery center where the physician is an investor, for example.\n\n\u201cThe high earning in many fields relates mostly to how well they\u2019ve managed to monetize treatment \u2014 if you freeze off 18 lesions and bill separately for surgery for each, it can be very lucrative,\u201d said Dr. Steven Schroeder, a professor at the University of California and the chairman of the National Commission on Physician Payment Reform, an initiative funded in part by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nDoctors\u2019 charges \u2014 and the incentives they reflect \u2014 are a major factor in the nation\u2019s $2.7 trillion medical bill. Payments to doctors in the United States, who make far more than their counterparts in other developed countries, account for 20 percent of American health care expenses, second only to hospital costs.\n\nSpecialists earn an average of two and often four times as much as primary care physicians in the United States, a differential that far surpasses that in all other developed countries, according to Miriam Laugesen, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health. That earnings gap has deleterious effects: Only an estimated 25 percent of new physicians end up in primary care, at the very time that health policy experts say front-line doctors are badly needed, according to Dr. Christine Sinsky, an Iowa internist who studies physician satisfaction. In fact, many pediatricians and general doctors in private practice say they are struggling to survive.\n\nStudies show that more specialists mean more tests and more expensive care. \u201cIt may be better to wait and see, but waiting doesn\u2019t make you money,\u201d said Jean Mitchell, a professor of health economics at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Let me do a little snip of tissue\u2019 and then they get professional, lab and facility fees. Each patient is like an ATM machine.\u201d\n\nFor example, the procedure performed on Ms. Little, called Mohs surgery, involves slicing off a skin cancer in layers under local anesthesia, with microscopic pathology performed between each \u201cstage\u201d until the growth has been removed. While it offers clear advantages in certain cases, it is more expensive than simply cutting or freezing off a lesion. (Hospitals seeking to hire a staff dermatologist for Mohs surgery had to offer an average of $586,083 in 2010, even more than for a cardiac surgeon, according to Becker\u2019s Hospital Review.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUse of the surgery has skyrocketed in the United States \u2014 over 400 percent in a little over a decade \u2014 to the point that last summer Medicare put it at the top of its \u201cpotentially misvalued\u201d list of overused or overpriced procedures. Even the American Academy of Dermatology agrees that the surgery is sometimes used inappropriately. Dr. Brett Coldiron, president-elect of the academy, defended skin doctors as \u201cvery cost-efficient\u201d specialists who deal in thousands of diagnoses and called Mohs \u201ca wonderful tool.\u201d He said that his specialty was being unfairly targeted by insurers because of general frustration with medical prices. \u201cHealth care reform is a subsidized buffet and if it\u2019s too expensive, you go to the kitchen and shoot one of the cooks,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they\u2019re shooting dermatologists.\u201d\n\nPricing 100 Mohs Procedures A random sample of 100 similar outpatient Mohs surgeries shows an enormous range in how much was paid for the procedure. The difference between the most expensive and the least expensive is more than $7,000. $7,594 Most expensive The most expensive ones were performed at hospitals and have large operating-room charges. $474 Least expensive 100 individual Mohs surgeries\n\nThe specialists point to an epidemic, noting there are two million to four million skin cancers diagnosed in the United States each year, with a huge increase in basal cell carcinomas, the type Ms. Little had, which usually do not metastasize. (A small fraction of the cancers are melanomas, a far more serious condition.) But, said Dr. Cary Gross, a cancer epidemiologist at Yale University Medical School, \u201cThe real question is: Is there a true epidemic or is there an epidemic of biopsies and treatments that are not needed? I think the answer is both.\u201d\n\nPatient Given No Choice\n\nA fair-skinned redhead who teaches history at the University of Central Arkansas, Ms. Little had gone to a private dermatology practice in Heber Springs, Ark., to check some moles on her arms when the physician\u2019s assistant on duty noticed a whitish bump \u2014 like a \u201ctiny fragment of thread\u201d \u2014 on her face, she said. Her family practitioner had told her it was just a clogged pore.\n\nA diligent medical consumer, Ms. Little had read up on the Mohs technique (invented by Dr. Frederic Mohs in 1938) before she and her husband arrived for her surgery in November 2012 in a doctors\u2019 office building at Baptist Health Medical Center here. Pressed for time as the end of the semester approached, she asked Dr. Randall Breau, the dermatologist, why the tiny growth needed the specialized surgery, as she had asked the physician\u2019s assistant earlier. They both answered that it was because it was on her eyelid, a delicate area where Mohs surgery is always required; she repeatedly insisted that it was on her cheekbone below her eye.\n\nAfter the 30-minute removal, the dermatologist told her that she would have to go across the street to the Arkansas Center for Oculoplastic Surgery, another private doctors\u2019 office on the hospital\u2019s campus, to have the wound closed by a plastic surgeon with \u201ca couple of stitches.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140118134416, "twitter": {"description": "Patient costs have risen as doctors have become more entrepreneurial, protecting their turf through lobbying by medical societies and increasing revenues by offering new and more lucrative procedures.", "title": "Patients\u2019 Costs Skyrocket;
