But the report found that employees are sitting at their desks, claiming up to two hours of overtime every day. Some employees have even dubbed the fund the department\u2019s (taxpayer-funded) \u201ccandy bowl.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by the subcommittee chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) what the department was doing to stop the abuse, DHS official Catherine Emerson said her office, which first became aware of the issue in 2009, was \u201cstill looking into it.\u201d She told the committee they opened the case on Oct 31 and the \u201creview could take several months.\u201d\n\n\u201cOctober 31? You started a few days ago?\u201d Chaffetz asked. \u201cI can tell exactly why this continues to be a problem. There are millions of tax dollars being stolen from the American people and you\u2019re doing nothing\u2026. Don\u2019t tell me it will take months to review this\u2026.You\u2019re a very nice person but your answers are unacceptable.\u201d\n\nEmerson declined to say when the review will be complete.\n\nThe fund\u2019s abuse is nothing new. The same problem was uncovered five years ago when two CBP offices in Washington State were dipping into the \u201ccandy bowl.\u201d At the time, the agency had assured the special council\u2019s office that it would end the abuse.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t.\n\nTestifying before the committee, president of the National Border Patrol Council Brandon Judd said he was told when he applied for his job at BPC that money from the fund would be part of his compensation package. He added that until last year, it was included in the job announcement. BPC Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello confirmed to the committee that funds from the AUO have been used as a recruitment tool.\n\nRelated: Government Wastes More Money Than You Think\n\nSpecial Counsel Carolyn Lerner, author of the report, said the abuse \u201cis such a widespread problem\u201d that it is engrained in the office culture. Indeed, seven whistleblowers within six agencies at DHS have reported the abuse.\n\n\u201cThese are not border patrol guys chasing bad guys who can\u2019t stop what they are doing and fill out paperwork for overtime. We are not questioning that,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cThese are employees sitting at their desks, collecting overtime because it\u2019s become a culturally acceptable practice.\u201d\n\nShe suggested a seemingly simple solution.\n\n\u201cYou could put a stop to it right away by saying anyone who\u2019s not working\u201d should not be collecting overtime,\u201d Lerner said. Though she told the committee that the department has been unwilling to resolve the issue in the past, Lerner expressed optimism now that there\u2019s \u201ccongressional interest.\u201d Her office is expecting five new reports about what, if any, remedial efforts the department is taking.\n\nRelated: Government Audit Shows Agencies Waste Billions\n\nIn the meantime, Chaffetz has proposed legislation aimed at reducing the funds\u2019 abuse.\n\nThe measure eliminates the AUO fund entirely. Instead, it allows Border Patrol agents to choose to work 100, 90 or 80 hours per two-week period. Any amount worked between 80 hours and the schedule they choose would be compensated as overtime, or time and a half. If they exceeded that amount they would be rewarded through paid leave.\n\nThe proposal would save taxpayers an estimated $125 million a year, but it would also result in an effective pay cut of $7,000 per agent, BPC officials estimate. Though the legislation has received support from the BPC, Department officials say they still have to review the legislation.\n\nThe idea was proposed by the National Border Patrol Council, which represents more than 17,000 employees. BPC officials say that although it results in a pay cut, it allows the agency to hire more manpower to secure the border.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I am asking for a pay cut,\u201d Judd said. We gave you a fix. It saves taxpayers money and secures the border. I don\u2019t know why they have to review it.\u201d Judd said.\n\nFollow Brianna Ehley on Twitter @BriannaEhley\n\nTop Stories From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "During a House oversight subcommittee hearing Wednesday, lawmakers seemed shocked to hear that DHS officials were only \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d put forth by a report from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) which found that some DHS employees were using money from the \u201cAdministratively Uncontrollable Overtime\u201d (AUO) fund to pad their paychecks\u2014sometimes increasing their income by 24 percent.", "title": "DHS Winks at Workers Stealing Unearned Overtime", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/21/DHS-Winks-Workers-Stealing-Unearned-Overtime", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04162013_homeland_security_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/21/DHS-Winks-Workers-Stealing-Unearned-Overtime", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04162013_homeland_security_money_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "During a House oversight subcommittee hearing Wednesday, lawmakers seemed shocked to hear that DHS officials were only \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d put forth by a report from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) which found that some DHS employees were using money from the \u201cAdministratively Uncontrollable Overtime\u201d (AUO) fund to pad their paychecks\u2014sometimes increasing their income by 24 percent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0235\"", "article_summary": "Instead, it allows Border Patrol agents to choose to work 100, 90 or 80 hours per two-week period.\nThough the legislation has received support from the BPC, Department officials say they still have to review the legislation.\n\u201cThese are not border patrol guys chasing bad guys who can\u2019t stop what they are doing and fill out paperwork for overtime.\nEmployees at the Department of Homeland Security are allegedly continuing to pocket millions of dollars of unearned overtime every year and department officials don\u2019t seem to be doing much about it.\nBut the report found that employees are sitting at their desks, claiming up to two hours of overtime every day."}
