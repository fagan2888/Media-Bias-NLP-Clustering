They are: Feeling overwhelmed or ill-equipped; hospital/payer emphasis on employing physicians to secure engagement rather than \"more effective holistic strategies that combine multiple alignment approaches;\" overdependence on financial compensation as a mode of physician engagement; and low understanding of risk-based models combined with \"their inherent risk aversion.\" Consider group dynamics: To engage physicians, organizations must focus on building relationships, two-way communication and decision-making that involves wide participation, according to Wallace. \"ACO leaders should either emphasize or downplay a physician practice's relationship to the whole, depending on the level of independence the group perceives for itself,\" he writes. Keep physicians in the loop: Wallace cites the McKinsey study's finding that people are more likely to change their behavior if they understand the reasoning behind the changes, as well as if they have role models for them. Moreover, providers must make sure physicians have the skills and knowledge necessary to accomplish the required changes, and have environmental support for those alterations, including compensation, training and information systems.\n\nA June survey found many doctors think their systems lack physician engagement. The survey concluded that to improve engagement, organizations could take steps such as asking doctors specific questions about how engaged they feel, creating clear plans for what needs to change and sharing survey results, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\n- here's the McKinsey study (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n4 pillars for physician engagement\n\nHealthcare systems fall short in physician engagement, docs report\n\n4 steps for successful hospital-physician integration\n\nHIMSS Analytics: EHR governance efforts lack doc engagement\n\nPhysician engagement can cut waste\n\nHow hospitals can boost physician engagement", "article_metadata": {"description": "Physician engagement is more important than ever as healthcare shifts in the direction of value-based purchasing models like accountable care organizations (ACOs), John Wallace, vice president and general manager of ACO services at McKesson, writes in Becker's Hospital Review.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Physician engagement is more important than ever as healthcare shifts in the direction of value-based purchasing models like accountable care organizations (ACOs), John Wallace, vice president and general manager of ACO services at McKesson, writes in Becker's Hospital Review.", "title": "3 ways to improve physician engagement", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/3-ways-improve-physician-engagement/2014-09-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations,Financial Incentives,HR & Workforce Management,Mckesson Corporation,Operations & Business Management,physician engagement,value-based purchasing", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd211c\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the article- here's the McKinsey study (.pdf)Related Articles:4 pillars for physician engagementHealthcare systems fall short in physician engagement, docs report4 steps for successful hospital-physician integrationHIMSS Analytics: EHR governance efforts lack doc engagementPhysician engagement can cut wasteHow hospitals can boost physician engagement\nA June survey found many doctors think their systems lack physician engagement.\nThe survey concluded that to improve engagement, organizations could take steps such as asking doctors specific questions about how engaged they feel, creating clear plans for what needs to change and sharing survey results, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\nConsider group dynamics: To engage physicians, organizations must focus on building relationships, two-way communication and decision-making that involves wide participation, according to Wallace.\nPhysician engagement is more important than ever as healthcare shifts toward value-based purchasing models like accountable care organizations (ACOs), John Wallace, vice president and general manager of ACO services at McKesson, writes in Becker's Hospital Review."}
