Tom McClintock, California Republican, cast his amendment to shield recreational use as a check on federal power instead of an ambitious foray into drug policy.\n\n\u201cWe have the opportunity to watch what comes of various state policies on this issue and benefit from that experience. That\u2019s what federalism is all about,\u201d he said in a phone interview.\n\nSupporters in both parties said it made little sense to exhaust limited federal dollars on people who toke up in states where it\u2019s legal, either for medical or recreational purposes.\n\nOpponents of both measures, however, said marijuana reduces memory, IQ and ambition and causes \u201cprofound brain changes\u201d among users, especially children.\n\n\u201cThe idea of medical marijuana is a joke,\u201d Rep. John Fleming, Louisiana Republican, said in late-night debate prior to Wednesday\u2019s daytime votes. \u201cIt\u2019s an end-run around the laws. There are more pot shops in California than there are Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s.\u201d\n\nRep. Jared Polis, Colorado Democrat, unloaded on the southerner, saying he wouldn\u2019t like it if the feds cracked down on Louisiana\u2019s less-than-healthful \u2014 yet quite legal \u2014 fondness for crayfish.\n\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s fried? Might clog your arteries, huh? Bet that\u2019s not good for you,\u201d he said. \u201cWant me to send federal troops down there?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House voted Wednesday to ban federal drug agents from pursuing people who use medicinal marijuana where its legal, although a parallel and unprecedented effort to shield all state pot laws fell short by just 16 votes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The House voted Wednesday to ban federal drug agents from pursuing people who use medicinal marijuana where its legal, although a parallel and unprecedented effort to shield all state pot laws fell short by just 16 votes.", "title": "House votes to shield medical marijuana users from feds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/3/house-votes-shield-medical-marijuana-users-feds/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/31/aee94656ff99e717770f6a706700bed5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/31/aee94656ff99e717770f6a706700bed5.jpg", "description": "The House voted Wednesday to ban federal drug agents from pursuing people who use medicinal marijuana where its legal, although a parallel and unprecedented effort to shield all state pot laws fell sh", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "House votes to shield medical marijuana users from feds"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7a9\"", "article_summary": "The House voted Wednesday to ban federal drug agents from pursuing people who use medicinal marijuana where its legal, although a parallel and unprecedented effort to shield all state pot laws fell short by just 16 votes.\n\u201cThe idea of medical marijuana is a joke,\u201d Rep.
