The question resurfaced last week when Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, claimed on Meet the Press that the Catholic Church is unfairly \u201ccaricatured\u201d as anti-gay. The Huffington Post\u2019s Paul Raushenbush quickly wrote up a response, saying that \u201cThe hard reality that Cardinal Dolan and all Christians need to face up to is that the Catholic Church along with every other church whether Orthodox, Protestant or Catholic has been horrifically, persistently and vehemently anti-gay for almost all of its history.\u201d Then Raushenbush hauled out a familiar argument: \u201cLet's just be very clear here \u2014if you are against marriage equality you are anti-gay. Done.\u201d As a gay man, I found myself disappointed with this definition\u2014that anyone with any sort of moral reservations about gay marriage is by definition anti-gay. If Raushenbush is right, then that means my parents are anti-gay, many of my religious friends (of all faiths) are anti-gay, the Pope is anti-gay, and\u2014yes, we\u2019ll go here\u2014first-century, Jewish theologian Jesus is anti-gay. That\u2019s despite the fact that while some religious people don\u2019t support gay marriage in a sacramental sense, many of them are in favor of same-sex civil unions and full rights for the parties involved. To be sure, most gay people, myself included, won\u2019t be satisfied until our loving, monogamous relationships are graced with the word \u201cmarriage.\u201d But it\u2019s important to recall that many religious individuals do support strong civil rights for the gay members of their communities. Related Story I'm Gay, My Dad's a Pastor, and ... We're Working on It What exactly do we mean when we say \u201canti-gay,\u201d or \u201chomophobic\u201d? Often when I try to understand where my conservative opponents are coming from, my gay friends accuse me of being homophobic. It isn\u2019t homophobic of me to try to understand why someone might be opposed to marriage equality. Giving someone the benefit of the doubt takes courage; dismissing him before considering his argument\u2014well, that seems a bit phobic. Beside\u2014me? Homophobic? I write essays about being gay, and then I publish them, and everyone goes, \u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s gay.\u201d I have no reservations about my sexuality, so as far as the accusation of homophobia goes: that gay ship has already sailed to Disneyland, with a speedo-clad Tom Daley carved into the bow. If it\u2019s \u201canti-gay\u201d to question the arguments of marriage-equality advocates, and if the word \u201chomophobic\u201d is exhausted on me or on polite dissenters, then what should we call someone who beats up gay people, or prefers not to hire them? Disagreement is not the same thing as discrimination. Our language ought to reflect that distinction.\n\nI would argue that an essential feature of the term \u201chomophobia\u201d must include personal animus or malice toward the gay community. Simply having reservations about gay marriage might be anti-gay marriage, but if the reservations are articulated in a respectful way, I see no reason to dismiss the person holding those reservations as anti-gay people. In other words, I think it\u2019s quite possible for marriage-equality opponents to have flawed reasoning without necessarily having flawed character. When we hastily label our opposition with terms like \u201canti-gay,\u201d we make an unwarranted leap from the first description to the second. My gayness is not the most fundamental aspect of my identity; it seems to me that someone could ideologically disapprove of my sexual expression while simultaneously loving and affirming my larger identity. To me, recognizing the distinction between opposing gay marriage and opposing gay people is a natural outgrowth of an internal distinction: When it comes to my identity, I take care not to reduce myself to my sexual orientation. Sure, it\u2019s a huge part of who I am, but I see myself to be larger than my sexual expression: I contain my gayness; it doesn\u2019t contain me. If it\u2019s true that my gayness is not the most fundamental aspect of my identity as Brandon, then it seems to me that someone could ideologically disapprove of my sexual expression while simultaneously loving and affirming my larger identity. This is what Pope Francis was getting at when he asked, \u201cWhen God looks at a gay person, does he endorse the existence of this person with love, or reject and condemn this person?\u201d The Pope probably won\u2019t be officiating gay marriages any time soon. But because he differentiates between a person\u2019s sexual identity and her larger identity as a human being, he is able to affirm the latter without offering definitive commentary on the former. Maybe his distinction between Brandon and Gay Brandon is misguided, but it isn\u2019t necessarily malicious, and that\u2019s the point.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some people just aren&#39;t sure about marriage equality\u2014but their reasoning isn&#39;t necessarily a reflection of their character.", "author": "Brandon Ambrosino", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Some people just aren&#39;t sure about marriage equality\u2014but their reasoning isn&#39;t necessarily a reflection of their character.", "title": "Being Against Gay Marriage Doesn't Make You a Homophobe", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/RTR3EVUI/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/12/being-against-gay-marriage-doesnt-make-you-a-homophobe/282333/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe233d\"", "article_summary": "Done.\u201d As a gay man, I found myself disappointed with this definition\u2014that anyone with any sort of moral reservations about gay marriage is by definition anti-gay.\nSimply having reservations about gay marriage might be anti-gay marriage, but if the reservations are articulated in a respectful way, I see no reason to dismiss the person holding those reservations as anti-gay people.\nDoes being against gay marriage make someone anti-gay?\nThat\u2019s despite the fact that while some religious people don\u2019t support gay marriage in a sacramental sense, many of them are in favor of same-sex civil unions and full rights for the parties involved.\nBut because he differentiates between a person\u2019s sexual identity and her larger identity as a human being, he is able to affirm the latter without offering definitive commentary on the former."}
