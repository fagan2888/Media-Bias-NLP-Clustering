The reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \u2013 the law formerly known as NCLB \u2013 is being fast-tracked by committees in both the Senate and the House. On Wednesday, the House marked up H.R.5, The Student Success Act, and, while nobody should be under the illusion that this process will be concluded rapidly (whatever they say on the Hill), the debate has already laid bare some important contours that have to be addressed.\n\nOver the past weeks the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions has conducted no less than three hearings on reauthorization. Importantly, the hearings \u2013 designed to cover topics ranging from innovation to teacher evaluation \u2013 consistently veered back to the central topics of assessments, accountability and federal government control and oversight. In its coverage of the hearings, some of the media has oversimplified the issue \u2013 with Democrats, predictably, painted on one side in the role of big Government intervention, and Republicans on the other defending against federal overreach.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSadly lost is the discussion of how best to defend the law\u2019s underlying intent: to help children who have been \u2013 and still are \u2013 let down by American education. These typically low income, minority students are stuck in a system that does not serve them well.\n\nAlso lost in the debate about fixing NCLB is a clear-sighted look at what is working in the law. It\u2019s not so much broken, but rather needs to be updated (as any law should be after 14 years!). The premise behind it \u2013 that all children can learn and should have access to high quality education \u2013 rings as true today as it did in 2001 as do some of its major tenets, like annual assessment, disaggregated data and accountability. With those tenets in place (though the waivers undid some of them), we now have a foundation from which to build and provide opportunity for innovation.\n\nWe can likely all agree with Sen. Richard Burr Richard BurrThe Trail 2016: Hell breaks loose Burr, Ross in statistical dead heat in NC Senate race Senate panel advances spy policy bill, after House approves its own version MORE (R-N.C.) when he ties innovation, accountability, higher standards and appropriate federal oversight together in saying that, \u201cFunding needs to come with \u2026 flexibility. We need to decrease the burden of proof on the district\u2019s part by implementing these innovative programs. We need to be most concerned with outcome.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a neat, encompassing and probably accurate way to look at it, underpinned by what is common ground on both sides of the aisle \u2013 the understanding that NCLB needs to be reexamined.

And in order to do that, we need to empower states, through policy, to implement ESEA as they see fit. The federal government must collect and make publicly available the information states report to show what the results of those efforts are. Further, parents should have access to this information to be able to choose the right fit for their child\u2014that is not, nor should it ever be, the responsibility of the U.S. government.\n\nBut detail and nuance is critical here. It\u2019s not enough to say the law should enable and empower the federal government to assess and report while setting free the states and their schools to determine the rest. That may sound right, but it does not advance the fix to this law. What\u2019s needed is a clearly determined annual assessment and measurement, along with transparency and public reporting, to ensure that meaningful progress remains non-negotiable. States must put in place concrete accountability metrics, and that means setting out real consequences for failure and real rewards or incentives for success.\n\nThe next couple of weeks of this debate will be telling, likely exposing the real intentions that both political parties harbor in this debate. All have laid out their \u201cpolicy stalls\u201d \u2013 we just need to see whether they will stand behind them. This law serves one, simple, undeniably bipartisan purpose: to help our children succeed. Common ground must be found, but the results must be real.\n\nHalaska was assistant secretary of Education under President George W. Bush and is the founder of HCM Strategists.
