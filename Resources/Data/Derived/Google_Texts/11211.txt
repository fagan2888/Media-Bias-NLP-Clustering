Clearing out some of the notices we got before the holidays…..

One of the things that came to our attention was a handy tool from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers estimates on how much you can expect to pay for health insurance, based on the state where you live.

The consultancy’s map, linked on the illustration at left, shows all 50 states and shades them according to price categories on silver plans — the second-lowest-cost insurance — for 27-year-olds and 50-year-olds. If you’re 27, you can expect to pay more than $260 a month in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Vermont, Indiana, Mississippi, Wyoming and Alaska. Cheaper insurance of less than $170 a month is available in Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Arizona, Oregon and Hawaii.

For 50-year-olds, the same group of states has the cheaper insurance but only in relative terms: less than $290 a month. The more expensive states — now more than $420 for this age group — shift a bit. Alaska, New Jersey, Indiana, Mississippi and Wyoming remain on the high end of the spectrum and are joined by Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arkansas.
