Estimating gets easier the smaller the number of marbles or paper clips even with a single glance, almost like identifying a smell with a single whiff. Scientists say their discovery of the specific parts of the brain responsible for so-called \u201cnumerosity\u201d act almost like a sixth sense.\n\n\u201cWhen we see a small number of items visually, we don\u2019t need to count them,\u201d Ben Harvey, of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, and lead author of the study, told NPR. \u201cWe just know how many there are straight away.\u201d\n\nPrevious research on monkeys found that certain areas of their brains became active when given the task of placing images in order according to the number of objects they contained. Their brain cells are organized in a way that suggests numbers were represented topographically, in almost the same ways that other senses are mapped in the brain. But until now, these areas of the brain that sense numbers weren\u2019t explored.\n\nNumerosity is different from numerical symbols, Harvey says. \u201cWe use symbolic numbers to represent numerosity and other aspects of magnitude, but the symbol itself is only a representation.\u201d\n\nHarvey and his team examined eight adult participants\u2019 brains using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a powerful brain-imaging technology. The participants were told to look at different patterns of dots that changed over time. They were able to model their human responses to those of the monkeys. Responses occurred in the parietal cortex, a part of the brain just above and behind the ears that has been associated with numerical thinking. They found that small quantities of dots were encoded by neurons closer to the midline of the brain, while neurons furthest from it responded to larger quantities, creating a map of how people estimate numbers.\n\n\u201cEvery individual brain is a complex and very different system,\u201d Harvey said in a statement. \u201cI was very surprised then that the map we report is in such a consistent location between our subjects, and that numerosity preferences always increased in the same direction along the cortex.\u201d\n\nAlthough accuracy worsened as the quantity of dots increased \u2014 Harvey says most people can accurately sense five dots \u2014 the patches in the brain responsible for these senses work similarly to the way the brain maps other senses, such as sight and touch. \u201cThere are maps on the brain that represent the surface of the skin \u2014 or the surface of the retina,\u201d Harvey told NPR. \u201cThese all reflect an organ. We found the first map for a cognitive function.\u201d\n\nSource: Harvey B, Klein B, Petridou N, et al. Topographic Representation of Numerosity in the Human Parietal Cortex.
