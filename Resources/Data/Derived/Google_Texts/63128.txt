A woman was killed and a toddler hurt in a crash Saturday afternoon in eastern Kansas.

It happened around 3:30 p.m. on Kansas Highway 268, about four miles west of Pomona in Osage County.

The Kansas Highway Patrol said a Ford Explorer was heading east on K-268 when it entered the south ditch for unknown reasons. The driver, 37-year-old Rochelle Rae Roach of Horton, overcorrected and the SUV veered into the north ditch and rolled.

Roach was pronounced dead at the scene. Reports state she was not wearing a seatbelt.

A two-year-old boy was taken to a Topeka hospital for treatment. His current condition is unknown.

Troopers are still investigating the crash.
