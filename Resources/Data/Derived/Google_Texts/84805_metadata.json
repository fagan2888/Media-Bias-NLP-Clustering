Our annual report discloses any income received from grants covering a variety of areas, of which, a very small proportion comes from the EU for non-news research and development projects.\u201d\n\nBut the BBC News channel is not the only way in which the corporation pushes an agenda \u2013 with the BBC Two documentary about President Obama as the most recent example of editorially questionable, externally-funded work.\n\nThe fact that the four part documentary series is set to air so close to President Obama\u2019s visit to the UK to campaign for European Union membership will no doubt raise concerns amongst Eurosceptic campaigners. Episode one, entitled \u201c100 days\u201d aired on March 17th, while episode two is set to air on March 30th, about the Obamacare healthcare reforms.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Screw It Up\u201d, the third episode, is about the wars in the Gulf, with episode four still to be disclosed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The BBC has produced an uncritical documentary about the presidency of U.S. President Barack Obama, with funding from the European Union.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The BBC has produced an uncritical documentary about the presidency of U.S. President Barack Obama, with funding from the European Union.", "title": "BBC Produces Obama Documentary Funded By The European Union Just Weeks Ahead Of Pro-EU Campaign Speech", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/GettyImages-515570350.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-03-21T03:02:04-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/03/20/bbc-produces-obama-documentary-funded-by-the-european-union/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The BBC has produced an uncritical documentary about the presidency of U.S. President Barack Obama, with funding from the European Union.", "creator": "@raheemkassam", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/GettyImages-515570350.png", "title": "BBC Produces Obama Documentary Funded By The European Union Just Weeks Ahead Of Pro-EU Campaign Speech", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "European Union", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-03-20T18:16:17-07:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/raheemjkassam", "section": "Breitbart London", "modified_time": "2016-03-21T03:02:04-07:00", "tag": "European Union", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "But that impartiality will be called into question yet again as Breitbart London reveals that the BBC has produced a documentary series about President Obama with the help of European Union funds.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has produced an uncritical documentary about the presidency of U.S. President Barack Obama, with funding from the European Union (EU) which in turn gets its cash from the British and European tax payers.\nLast year, the Telegraph quoted a BBC spokesman who said: \u201cBBC News protects its impartiality by not permitting any external funding, which includes EU grants.\nThe fact that the four part documentary series is set to air so close to President Obama\u2019s visit to the UK to campaign for European Union membership will no doubt raise concerns amongst Eurosceptic campaigners.\nCreative Europe uses UK and European tax payer money \u2013 \u20ac1.46 billion over the next four years \u2013 \u201cto support European projects\u201d, according to its website."}
