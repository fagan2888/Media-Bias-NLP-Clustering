Well, the Arby\u2019s national headquarters issued an apology, and the police department considered the case closed. The incident occurred last week when Sgt. Jennifer Martin was refused service at the local Arby\u2019s. On September 4, the food chain fired the manager and suspended the clerk (via Sun Sentinel):\n\nArby\u2019s has fired the manager and indefinitely suspended a clerk two days after a Pembroke Pines police officer said she was denied service at the restaurant because she was a cop. The dismissal of Angel Mirabal, 22, and suspension of Kenneth Davenport, 19, were confirmed Thursday evening by Arby\u2019s spokesman Jason Rollins in an email. The two men were working at the restaurant, 11755 Pines Blvd., when Sgt. Jennifer Martin said she was told by Mirabal that Davenport refused to ring up her order after accepting her credit card. Davenport said the comment from Mirabal was an attempt at a joke that backfired.\n\nThe article added that Mirabel couldn\u2019t be reached for comment. Davenport said he doesn\u2019t hate cops.\n\n\u201cWe don't hate anybody. We're just trying to get people out of the drive-thru,\u201d he said.\n\nThe initial report had Davenport\u2019s grandfather saying how the 19-year-old was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d doing drive-thru duty, and didn\u2019t even know Sgt. Martin was a police officer when he ordered. He also corroborated that Mirabel meant to joke around about refusing the officer service. It obviously wasn\u2019t funny.\n\nArby\u2019s CEO, Paul Brown, offered law enforcement in the Miami area a free combo meal (CBS Miami):", "article_metadata": {"description": "pink slips and suspensions .05/27/2016 9:05:31AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "pink slips and suspensions", "title": "- About That Arby's That Refused Service To A Police Officer", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/06/about-that-arbys-that-refused-service-to-a-police-officer-n2048562", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/164/23c5a489-b2ce-4e32-8fb3-67f1706c423e@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "pink slips and suspensions", "title": "- About That Arby's That Refused Service To A Police Officer", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2015/09/06/about-that-arbys-that-refused-service-to-a-police-officer-n2048562", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/164/23c5a489-b2ce-4e32-8fb3-67f1706c423e@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "About That Arby's That Refused Service To A Police Officer, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Jennifer Martin was refused service at the local Arby\u2019s.\nHe also corroborated that Mirabel meant to joke around about refusing the officer service.\nSo, remember that Arby\u2019s that reportedly refused to serve a police officer in Pembroke Pines, Florida?\nJennifer Martin said she was told by Mirabal that Davenport refused to ring up her order after accepting her credit card.\nWell, the Arby\u2019s national headquarters issued an apology, and the police department considered the case closed."}
