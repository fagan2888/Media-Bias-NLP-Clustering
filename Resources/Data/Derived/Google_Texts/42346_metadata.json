The bye week allowed the Steelers to not only get healthy, but gave the coaching staff two weeks to plan for Geno Smith and the Jets.\n\nOffensively, the addition of Levi Brown could be just the first change coach Mike Tomlin makes along the line. One reporter speculated that tackle Mike Adams could move to left guard in the event Ramon Foster misses time with a pectoral strain.\n\nDefensively, safety Troy Polamalu is a bright spot on a unit that has yet to force a turnover through four games. The veteran is healthy again and playing well as the Steelers look to rebound after giving up 74 combined points in losses to Chicago and Minnesota.\n\nThose headlines and more in today's Steelers news roundup:\n\nLevi Brown getting adjusted to offense (Steelers.com)\n\nSteelers notebook: Bye week, injuries and more (Steelers.com)\n\nLevi Brown hopes he can help his new team (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette)\n\nJerricho Cotchery gets more chances (Post-Gazette)\n\nSteelers, Dan Rooney partner with Obama administration on Affordable Care Act (Post-Gazette)\n\nRyan Clark says Steelers will make it to NFL's postseason (Pittsburgh Tribune-Review)\n\nSteelers players, family honor memory of L.C.
