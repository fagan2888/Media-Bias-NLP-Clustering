Baby Oliver turns 1 tomorrow. I know, I can’t believe it either. People argue about global warming, but at this point I’m not sure anyone can doubt global quickening because the years are passing much faster than they used to. By my estimation, 2015 lasted only nine months, and I’m quite sure 2016 already skipped completely over February and March.

I’ve joked about Oliver being a perfect baby, but he really is awesome. The boy was legitimately sleeping through the night by six weeks. Not that I minded six months of 1 a.m. Netflix viewing with Linus, but I enjoyed sleeping at 1 a.m. so much more. Oliver took bottles like a champ, didn’t flinch when we switched him to formula and eats anything we chop up and put on his plate. And not to get too graphic, but even Oliver’s diapers are, well, I mean they’re still gross, but not as gross as I’ve seen. Remember more than once I had to cut Linus out of a onesie and was minutes away from calling the Hazmat team.
