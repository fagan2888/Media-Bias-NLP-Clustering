A Congressional bill to override an automatic enrollment provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has received the endorsement of a new coalition of hundreds of businesses opposed to the provision.

The offensive provision: Section 1511 of the 2010 health care law, which amends the Fair Labor Standards Act by inserting Section 18A, “Automatic Enrollment for Employees of Large Employers.” This requires that employers with 200 or more full-time employees automatically enroll their full-time employees in health care coverage by their 91st day of employment, unless the employee had opted out prior to the deadline.
