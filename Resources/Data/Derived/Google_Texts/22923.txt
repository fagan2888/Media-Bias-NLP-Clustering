The deadline to sign up for health insurance is today. If you forgot to sign up there might be a price to pay.

"The affordable care act can affect you in your tax return because if you are not covered by health care you could owe a penalty" says Rachel Lard.

The penalty has gone up significantly since last year.

Lard says,"for 2014 the penalty is $95 per adult or up to one percent of your income, whichever is greater. For 2015 that penalty is going up to $325 per adult and 2% of your income, whichever is greater."

Rachel Lard with Jackson Hewitt says there are some who qualify for exemptions like income versus your family size.

"When you file a tax return and you do not have health coverage you can qualify for some exemptions. You can also visit healthcare.gov and there are some exemptions that they will let you apply for, but there is some that you can apply for on the tax return" says Lard.

If you have questions, seek professional help to find out what you are eligible for.

Lard said "people just come in and are ready to pay the penalty. They don't understand there are some exemptions you can qualify for. A lot of people don't understand it and so we are having to educate them on what it means, what it means to get covered and where to go to get covered."

You have until midnight on Sunday February 15th to sign up for health insurance on healthcare.gov.
