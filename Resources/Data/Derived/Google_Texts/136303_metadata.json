And, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, your blood pressure naturally increases with age, raising your risk of health problems from stroke to heart disease and diabetes.\n\nBut there is a silver lining \u2013 at least for men with higher fitness levels, a new study finds.\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, found that men who maintained higher levels of fitness tended to develop high blood pressure significantly later than less-fit men.\n\n\u201cWe think improving fitness can slow the natural increased trend of systolic blood pressure with aging,\u201d says Dr. Xuemei Sui, an assistant professor at the Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina and one of the study\u2019s coauthors.\n\nSui and her colleagues\u2019 data suggest the systolic blood pressure (the top number) of men with higher fitness levels reaches prehypertension \u2013 the level between normal and high blood pressure \u2013 at a much later age, on average: at 54, compared to an average of 46 in less fit men.\n\nThe research team analyzed medical exam records of nearly 14,000 men, ranging in age from 20 to 90, who were followed over a 36-year period. The research team divided the men into three equal groups of fitness: low (the bottom one-third), moderate, and high (the upper one-third).\n\nAside from the delay in the development of high blood pressure, the study also found that men in the higher fitness category had other more favorable health outcomes compared to those in the lower groups, including lower body mass index scores, percent of body fat, and cholesterol. These findings, Sui says, aren\u2019t surprising. What was surprising, she says, was the significant delay in hypertension.\n\n\n\nSo, what should the men out there do?\n\n\u201cPhysical activity is the primary determinant of fitness level,\u201d Sui says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study finds that on average, fitter men tend to develop high blood pressure eight years later than less fit men.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A new study finds that on average, fitter men tend to develop high blood pressure eight years later than less fit men.", "title": "Why To Exercise Today, For Men: High Blood Pressure Hits Much Later", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/why-to-exercise-today-76", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2012/08/blood-pressure-620x563.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/09/why-to-exercise-today-76", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2012/08/blood-pressure-620x563.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Why To Exercise Today, For Men: High Blood Pressure Hits Much Later"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-15", "date": "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 15:39:19 -0400", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf82c\"", "article_summary": "Why To Exercise Today, For Men: High Blood Pressure Hits Much LaterBy Alvin TranGuest contributorOne out of every three American adults has high blood pressure.\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, found that men who maintained higher levels of fitness tended to develop high blood pressure significantly later than less-fit men.\nBut there is a silver lining \u2013 at least for men with higher fitness levels, a new study finds.\nSui and her colleagues\u2019 data suggest the systolic blood pressure (the top number) of men with higher fitness levels reaches prehypertension \u2013 the level between normal and high blood pressure \u2013 at a much later age, on average: at 54, compared to an average of 46 in less fit men.\nAnd, whether you\u2019re a man or a woman, your blood pressure naturally increases with age, raising your risk of health problems from stroke to heart disease and diabetes."}
