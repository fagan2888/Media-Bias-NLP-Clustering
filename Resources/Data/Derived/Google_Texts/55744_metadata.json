Provide something that every American needs: food. Create a great deal of excitement and anticipation about the launch.\n\nWhen Savor opened its doors in late September \u2014 exactly one week before the Health Insurance Marketplace began open enrollment \u2014 many would-be diners found themselves in an unhappy situation: They couldn\u2019t get a table.\n\nThe situation persists.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing wrong with Savor\u2019s website or reservations system. It\u2019s just a hot restaurant, plain and simple. Saturday-night dinners can get completely booked a week in advance. Even prime-time dinner on Tuesday can be a challenge if your table isn\u2019t reserved well in advance.\n\nHow frustrating! Everyone who takes a stroll in the park can see right into it; architect Tom Phifer\u2019s design is like a beautiful glass box.\n\nThe bar, a glowing, kidney-shaped island, is usually well-populated in the evening with fashionably dressed patrons sipping safe, well-mixed craft cocktails.\n\nWhat to eat with them? Dainty little fritters of lobster and Comt\u00e9 cheese on a smear of r\u00e9moulade make appealing bar snacks \u2014 or starters. A small slab of braised pork belly, dressed up with a wee bit of radicchio and watercress salad and shaved pear, gets a nice tang from sherry vinegar and pickled mustard seeds. That\u2019s more like a one-person first course, harder to share.\n\nWere you forward-looking enough to book a table? You\u2019ll be led past the bar, then along a booth-lined corridor with views of the park and its prettily lighted trees on one side and an open kitchen on the other. Maybe you\u2019ll land there, or maybe you\u2019ll be seated in the main dining room. Should you be shown to a banquette, prepare to feel like a little kid all evening: They\u2019re an inch or two too low in relation to the tables.\n\nLobster puffs notwithstanding, the menu isn\u2019t exactly teeming with exciting gastropub taste sensations. Overcooked deviled eggs came to the table crusted on top; clearly they\u2019d been left sitting too long. Even if they\u2019d been more carefully attended to, the bit of pepper relish on the plate and scattering of spiced pecan brittle couldn\u2019t have lifted them out of their mediocrity. Meatballs fashioned from beef and pork came in a puttanesca-like sauce that clashed with the tender orbs, so tasty on their own. \u201cCrispy\u201d shrimp and calamari in a sticky chile glaze was desperately ordinary (and not crispy). A weirdly tiny wedge salad was overwhelmed by toothachingly sweet \u201clacquered\u201d bacon.\n\nIf truth be told, the pretentiously written menu confounded me on every visit. The interesting dishes must be here somewhere, I kept thinking every time I scanned it. But only one dish called out to me \u2014 something called \u201chigh marbled pork loin: crispy pork Milanese with wild arugula and caper salad.\u201d Highly marbled? Who knows \u2014 it was a well-executed Milanese, though, crisply fried and flavorful, topped with a nicely dressed arugula salad.\n\nOtherwise, there\u2019s a quartet of small scallops, aggressively seared when I sampled them, on a likable ragout of big butter beans and pork belly with baby kale swirled in. A fillet of salmon that had been bourbon-cured then lightly smoked was then roasted a few minutes too long, served with a dollop of celery-root pur\u00e9e and garnished with parsnip chips and bits of fennel-apple-cranberry chutney whose flavor did not get along with the poor salmon.\n\nA grilled flatiron steak was nicely cooked, but smothered in a not-very-nice, super-sweet sorghum and chipotle glaze; a decent braised short rib sat on a bed of chewy macaroni and cheese. What was that weird sweet stuff on top of the short rib? Smoked pecan gremolata. At Savor, random strange touches too often sabotage what might otherwise be reasonably successful dishes. Certain flavors and ingredients have affinities for each other and somehow chef John Coleman, whose last position was as executive chef at the Ritz-Carlton Dallas, hasn\u2019t figured that out.\n\nThe one-page wine list is marginally less confounding than the menu. The few bottles that piqued my interest \u2014 like a 2011 Le Pigeoulet en Provence syrah blend from the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, or a 2008 Museum Real Reserva from Cigales in Spain, were mostly over\n\n$50, which seems ridiculous in a restaurant where main courses\n\naverage half that.\n\nLunch turned up a couple of nice surprises, including a delightful salad of chopped romaine, sliced radishes, haricots verts and ripe avocado that would have been perfect had it not been hijacked by sharp-tasting green olives. And a sandwich came with really good fries.\n\nBut the sandwich \u2014 shaved smoked turkey with melted cheese \u2014 was thrown off by an apple-fennel chutney, which clashed with crunchy slices of Roma tomato. The red quinoa in another salad had terrific flavor and texture, but it was so loaded with dried fruits and nuts that after a few bites, it started tasting like trail mix.\n\nThe dessert menu has a cute conceit: The sweets are small, and $3 each, three for $8, six for $16 or 10 for $24. Pastry chef Julie Vorce has a heavy hand with sugar, and her pastry shells could be more tender. But I was charmed by her pop tart, a flaky turnover filled with apple, goat cheese and honey.\n\nJust as I want the United States to have a world-class health care system, I want Klyde Warren Park to have a really good restaurant. Fortunately, Savor has a lot going for it, starting with its gorgeous bones and fabulous setting. The service is attentive, relaxed and generally professional. Chef Coleman has excellent technique and some good ideas; the kitchen seems solid. I can\u2019t help but wonder how the menu might change if he sat down with a few friends, ordered from the menu and had his sous-chef cook for him.\n\nFollow Leslie Brenner on Twitter at @lesbren.\n\nSavor (2 stars)\n\nPrice: $$$ (lunch starters $8 to $14, salads and sandwiches $10 to $17, main courses $15 to $21; dinner starters and salads $8 to $17, main courses $19 to $28; mini-desserts $3 apiece, three for $8, six for $16 or 10 for $24; brunch dishes $7 to $21)\n\nService: Attentive, warm and relaxed\n\nAmbience: The glimmering dining room, a glass box with views of Klyde Warren Park from every table, is a fashionable meeting place.\n\nNoise level: Tolerable, despite all the hard surfaces\n\nLocation: 2000 Woodall Rodgers Freeway, Dallas; 214-306-5597; savor-relish.com\n\nHours: Sunday-Thursday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday-Saturday 11 a.m. to midnight\n\nReservations: Accepted\n\nCredit cards: All major\n\nWheelchair accessible: Yes\n\nAlcohol: Full bar.
