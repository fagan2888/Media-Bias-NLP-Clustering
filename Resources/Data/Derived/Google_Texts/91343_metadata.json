(WANE) \u2013 Companies have been sending out prescription benefit cards during open enrollment for health insurance, causing some concerns for consumers about the legitimacy of them and how the consumers\u2019 information was obtained.\n\nUniScript is one of many companies offering prescription benefit cards that claims to give up to 75 percent discount on certain medicines. According to the company\u2019s website, if you received a card in the mail, you can take it to a pharmacy and receive an automatic discount on your prescription without signing up or paying for the service.\n\nNewsChannel 15 spoke with a customer service representative about how the company obtains consumers\u2019 information. The representative said they receive information from third party vendors consumers have signed up with or from a friend or family member of a consumer with the intention of them benefiting from using the service.\n\nMarjorie Stephens, Better Business Bureau of northern Indiana president and CEO, said the company has received an \u201cF\u201d rating because of the pattern of complaints that have come in about UniScript.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re concerned that people are looking for information, fishing for information,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cThey are just very concerned because they really don\u2019t quite understand this company and what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nAccording to the BBB\u2019s website, here\u2019s the reasoning for the \u201cF\u201d rating for UniScript: BBB files indicate a pattern of complaints concerning company mailings sent to consumers and business practices/privacy policies of the company. Complaints are coming into BBB alleging issues with receiving unsolicited mailings from Script Relief LLC (or from one of its brand/subsidiary names containing prescription discount cards. Receipt of these cards is raising concern from consumers who are worried about potential identity theft, healthcare fraud, or that their personal information is being collected and distributed for unknown purposes. Some consumers tell BBB that documentation received from the company mimics official government notices by using a brand name such as United States Prescription Discounts, along with terms phrases such as \u201cForm #\u201d or \u201cResident Code\u201d, as well as a Washington D.C. return mailing address. All of these factors contribute to some consumers reporting that they thought this is an official program of the U.S. government, or part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUniScript has replied to and resolved most of the complaints as stated in the website. The last complaint that was filed against the company was Aug. 19, 2014.\n\nNewsChannel 15 wanted to know how UniScript makes money off these prescription benefit cards, but we were given a vague response.\n\n\u201cWe receive a fee from the pharmaceutical companies that was mentioned prior, we received that fee and that\u2019s how we\u2019re able to stay afloat,\u201d said a customer service representative.\n\nWe did reach out to Walgreens and CVS to see if they accept these cards.\n\nCVS\u2019 spokesperson, Mike DeAngelis, released this statement: \u201cWe accept many different prescription discount card programs, including Uniscript. It is important to stress that these cards are not insurance. They are for discounts off the retail prices of prescription medication.\u201d\n\nWalgreens\u2019 spokesperson, Phil Caruso, issued the following statement: \u201cWe accept many different prescription discount card programs, including Uniscript. They are for discounts off the retail prices of prescription medication.\u201d\n\nStephens said if you\u2019re unsure about these types of benefit cards, contact the BBB or your insurance company.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consumers are concerned that companies issuing prescription benefit cards have their personal information and unsure if their information may be used by third party vendors.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wane", "og": {"site_name": "WANE", "description": "Consumers are concerned that companies issuing prescription benefit cards have their personal information and unsure if their information may be used by third party vendors.", "title": "Consumers concerned over Rx benefit cards", "url": "http://wane.com/2014/12/02/consumers-concerned-over-rx-benefit-cards/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/pharmacy-cards.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Consumers are concerned that companies issuing prescription benefit cards have their personal information and unsure if their information may be used by third party vendors.", "creator": "@wane15", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwane.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/pharmacy-cards.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Consumers concerned over Rx benefit cards", "site": "wane15", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Fort Wayne News, Weather and Sports", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488222080", "fb": {"pages": 54012016429}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "WANE", "google-site-verification": "lNZPWZeGC4zNForuuJZt1-sG4pyZKEfDzOHjOenyArg", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wane15", "published_time": "2014-12-03T04:38:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-03T12:48:05+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wane.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2fd549580f5e4635901cf55d62e47240?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09c4\"", "article_summary": "(WANE) \u2013 Companies have been sending out prescription benefit cards during open enrollment for health insurance, causing some concerns for consumers about the legitimacy of them and how the consumers\u2019 information was obtained.\nNewsChannel 15 wanted to know how UniScript makes money off these prescription benefit cards, but we were given a vague response.\nUniScript is one of many companies offering prescription benefit cards that claims to give up to 75 percent discount on certain medicines.\nNewsChannel 15 spoke with a customer service representative about how the company obtains consumers\u2019 information.\nComplaints are coming into BBB alleging issues with receiving unsolicited mailings from Script Relief LLC (or from one of its brand/subsidiary names containing prescription discount cards."}
