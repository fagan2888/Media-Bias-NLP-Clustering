In addition, ICD-10 implementation will happen in October and with the AMA estimating costs for small practices running up to $226,000, it\u2019s not surprising that more physicians are working in hospitals or medical groups.\n\nAccenture\u2019s latest survey, \"Clinical care: The independent doctor will NOT see you now,\" reports that only one in three physicians will stay independent by the end of next year, down 10 percent from the company\u2019s 2012 report.\n\nAn estimated 71,000 physicians left their private practice for hospital employment between 2005 and 2013, with an additional 27,000 projected to leave by the end of 2016, according to Kaveh Safavi, global managing director of Accenture\u2019s health business.\n\n\u201cThe complexity of running an independent practice is growing but not the economics. What\u2019s changed in recent years is independent practices need more technology, an efficient revenue cycle and business model to generate enough profit to counterbalance overhead costs,\u201d Safavi said. He added that the attraction of solo practice twenty years ago was about autonomy, both clinical and business.\n\n\u201cAlthough self-employed doctors can still tweak their business model as they see fit, the clinical side of autonomy has been challenged by a certain level of standardization, so it remains no more prominent in solo practices than in large health systems,\" he said.\n\nSimilar data was reported in a 2014 survey by The Physicians Foundation. In that survey, only 17 percent of 20,000 physicians said they had a solo practice, down from 25 percent in 2012. Fifty-three percent were hospital or medical group employees, up from 44 percent in 2012.\n\nHowever, Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances for Merritt Hawkins, which conducted the survey, said physicians are also seeking employment at large clinics, retail medical locations (urgent care centers, stand-alone emergency care, ambulatory surgical centers, etc) and insurance companies are also hiring physicians. \u201cIt\u2019s a new world where people who never hired doctors before are now seeking them,\u201d said Mosley.\n\nIn addition, with the trend of large hospital systems merging, Mosley explained that the key is getting doctors aligned. \u201cIt used to be whoever had the most doctors wins, but now it\u2019s about having the right number of doctors engaging in the right behaviors in the right settings. Many of the older doctors are not used to working in a team environment and being paid based on patient satisfaction,\" he said.\n\nAnd the younger physicians, according to Mosley, are well trained and ready to work in a team environment, but want nothing to do with the business of medicine. \u201cThat correlates with wanting to be employed.\u201d\n\nReasons to Leave\n\nThe top three reasons cited for leaving private practice in the above surveys, in addition to a third survey conducted earlier this year by Jackson Healthcare, are high overhead and costs of maintaining a medical practice, reimbursement cuts, and too much focus on administrative tasks rather than patient care.\n\nPhysician overhead includes the costs of specialized labor. \u201cProfessional labor, which accounts for up to two-thirds of total costs, is the single most expensive component of healthcare,\u201d said Safavi.\n\nA 2013 article in Western Pennsylvania Healthcare News estimates that overhead is between 60 and 70 percent of practice charges thanks to increased costs for employee healthcare, reduced reimbursements, expensive technology and a more complicated billing process to third-party payers. \u201cWith all these changes, some physicians have taken a 50 percent cut in pay \u2013 or more,\u201d the article states.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates dropped this year, averaging a 21.2 percent reduction in Medicare reimbursements, according to DHHS and an average 42.8 percent reduction in Medicaid reimbursements for primary care physicians, according to an Urban Institute survey, according to a Forbes article. And a Physicians Foundation\u2019s \u201c2014 survey of American Physicians\u201d mentioned earlier in this article, found that 38 percent of doctors don\u2019t see Medicaid patients or limit those they do see.\n\nNot only do physicians say they have too much non-medical paperwork, but listed malpractice liability pressures, inadequate and inconsistent reimbursement, too many government regulations and reduced clinical autonomy as all factors contributing to discontentment.\n\nIn a 2012 Physicians Foundation survey, 68 percent of physicians described their morale as negative, but that number dropped to 44 percent in the group\u2019s 2014 survey. Mosley attributes this to younger physicians participating in the survey. \u201cIn our survey, 66 percent of physicians under age 45 were employed compared to only 26 percent aged 46 and older. It seems the doctors who are younger and employed are happier,\u201d Mosley concluded.\n\nAs the trends of hospital mergers and acquisitions continue, along with new consumer healthcare technologies and retail medical facilities, physicians will need to adapt to the changing times, and as Mosley commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a brand new world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nina Flanagan", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/5e/74/5e74d2d104bc61957608d7cec433bcea.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-finance,healthcare-practice-mgmt", "news_keywords": "Finance,Practice Management,Practice Mgmt", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "More physicians leaving independent practices", "pub_date": "aug 11, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-08-11T08:00:00", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Tuesday, August 11, 2015, 08:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-07-29T08:00:00", "teaser": "<p>A new survey points to reimbursement and overhead costs as the biggest reasons.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-08-11", "sailthru.description": "A new survey points to reimbursement and overhead costs as the biggest reasons.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "A new survey points to reimbursement and overhead costs as the biggest reasons.", "title": "More physicians leaving independent practices", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/more-physicians-leaving-independent-practices/403653/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Seattle_physician_with_patient_1999.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/fd/8c/fd8c9c2cc11bf888e8e4d52eb62cf763.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda713\"", "article_summary": "More physicians leaving independent practicesThe number of physicians in independent practice has been dwindling for the past several years due to the many regulatory challenges set into action via the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cThe complexity of running an independent practice is growing but not the economics.\nIn a 2012 Physicians Foundation survey, 68 percent of physicians described their morale as negative, but that number dropped to 44 percent in the group\u2019s 2014 survey.\nAccenture\u2019s latest survey, \"Clinical care: The independent doctor will NOT see you now,\" reports that only one in three physicians will stay independent by the end of next year, down 10 percent from the company\u2019s 2012 report.\nWhat\u2019s changed in recent years is independent practices need more technology, an efficient revenue cycle and business model to generate enough profit to counterbalance overhead costs,\u201d Safavi said."}
