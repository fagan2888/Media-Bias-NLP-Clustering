× Wisconsin insurance rates increase under health care law, but less than national average

MILWAUKEE — The U.S. Health and Human Services Department says the cost of its benchmark plan on HealthCare.gov will go up less in Wisconsin than the national average.

Silver plan rates will go up 4.7 percent here, compared with 7.5 percent nationally.

The rates came out Monday on the website established under President Barack Obama’s health care law. Next year’s sign-up session starts Sunday, and potential enrollees are now able to browse plans and prices.

Rates in some states climbed by double digits, but others saw a decline.

Insurers in many states had underpriced plans and are raising rates because of inflation and higher claims than expected.

Nationally, about 8 in 10 returning customers will be able to buy a plan for less than $100 a month, after tax credits.
