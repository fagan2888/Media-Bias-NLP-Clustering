A new ETMC Urgent Care opens Monday in Chapel Hill at 12295 Highway 64 East.

Earlier this year, ETMC launched urgent care services at ETMC South Broadway at 6210 S. Broadway and ETMC Lake Palestine at the corner of FM 344 and Highway 155 in Flint.

“Our patients are having a great response to our urgent care services because of the convenience; no appointment is necessary and urgent care is very fast and cost-efficient,” said Dr. Steven Cooley, medical director of urgent care. “We see patients with minor injuries and illnesses such as broken bones, lacerations, urinary tract infections, rashes, fevers, coughs, colds, headache, sore throat, earache or flu-like symptoms.”

ETMC is also planning to open urgent care clinics at the ETMC clinics in Bullard and Whitehouse, with other locations to follow soon. Clinic hours will be 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays.

On Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon, ETMC will hold an open house at the urgent care at Lake Palestine with discounted flu shots of $15 ( a $10 discount) for the first 50 guests. The first 100 guests will receive a free first-aid kit. Refreshments will be offered and guests can register to win an iPad mini.
