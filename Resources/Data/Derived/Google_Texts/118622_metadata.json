During the Sunday night premiere of her reality television show, Ms. Jenner showed little evidence that she is backing down from her conservative views.\n\nShe was on a bus tour with a group of transgender women when she said she didn\u2019t want to stop at the Democratic debate, The Daily Caller reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the last place I want to be,\u201d Ms. Jenner said. \u201cBut I\u2019m open. We need both sides and if we\u2019re unfortunate enough get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side. Although she won\u2019t be \u2014 she [couldn\u2019t] care less about women. She cares about herself.\u201d\n\nAfter her friends disagreed with her, Ms. Jenner argued that Republicans are \u201cworried about much bigger issues than the trans issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re $18.5 trillion in debt. I think what they don\u2019t realize is this country could collapse over this at some point and if our country collapses it doesn\u2019t make any difference if you\u2019re gay, trans, whatever,\u201d she said. \u201cRepublicans and the conservatives are not these horrible people out there trying to oppress people. I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re out to get us. Every conservative guy out there believes in everybody\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nMs. Jenner recently revealed in an interview with The Advocate that she is a fan of Ted Cruz and would love to become a \u201ctrans ambassador\u201d for the Republican presidential candidate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Caitlyn Jenner had some harsh words for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton during the second-season premiere of \"I Am Cait.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner had some harsh words for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton during the second-season premiere of \u201cI Am Cait.\u201d", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t care about women", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/7/caitlyn-jenner-hillary-clinton-doesnt-care-about-w/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/28/caitlyn__jenner-crash_suit.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/28/caitlyn__jenner-crash_suit.jpeg", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner had some harsh words for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton during the second-season premiere of \"I Am Cait.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t care about women"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Social Issues, Politics, Hillary Clinton, Caitlyn Jenner"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s the last place I want to be,\u201d Ms. Jenner said.\nShe was on a bus tour with a group of transgender women when she said she didn\u2019t want to stop at the Democratic debate, The Daily Caller reported.\nDuring the Sunday night premiere of her reality television show, Ms. Jenner showed little evidence that she is backing down from her conservative views.\nShe cares about herself.\u201dAfter her friends disagreed with her, Ms. Jenner argued that Republicans are \u201cworried about much bigger issues than the trans issues.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re $18.5 trillion in debt.\nWe need both sides and if we\u2019re unfortunate enough get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side."}
