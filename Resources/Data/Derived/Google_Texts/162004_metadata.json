(Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera) Wide reciever Michael Westbrook gave CU fans many reasons to cheer during his career, including hauling in the catch that was deemed 'The Miracle in Michigan'. (Camera file photo) Best ever? It's a question that can spark great debate among avid Colorado football fans \u2014 and one that has no clear answer. What is the best team in CU history? The logical answer, of course, is the 1990 national championship team. After all, it's the only national title team in the Buffs' proud history. But there are other strong candidates, and each has its compelling reasons why it could be seen as the best in CU history. Here are four teams generally considered as being among the best in the Buffs' 125 years of fielding football teams. We've kept it to the \"modern\" era for argument's sake: 1990 \u2014 (11-1-1, Big Eight champs, No. 1 in final AP poll) The only team in CU history to win a national title, these Buffs certainly have a right to stake their claim as the best in Buff history. They were talented, deep and won when they had to. They beat five ranked teams, including No. 3 Nebraska and No. 5 Notre Dame. But they didn't go undefeated, finishing 11-1-1, making them one of only two teams in recent history not to win two of its games and still claim a national title (the 2007 LSU national champs finished 12-2). The 1990 Buffs were also the recipients of some fortuitous breaks. That season included a controversial win over Stanford, the infamous fifth-down win in Missouri and an Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame made possible only because a clipping penalty nullified Rocket Ismail's punt return for a touchdown. Advertisement 1989 \u2014 (11-1, Big Eight champs, No. 4 in final AP poll) If the regular season were the only barometer, these Buffs would claim the title hands down. The '89 Buffs steamrolled almost everyone on their schedule, with a six-point win over Nebraska the only game decided by single digits. The next closest game was a 17-point victory over No. 21 Washington. The Buffs beat three ranked foes, including No. 3 Nebraska, and were as dominating of a team in the regular season as any Buff squad ever. But, that dream season came to an nightmare end in the Orange Bowl, when Notre Dame delivered a convincing 21-6 beating, dropping them to fourth in the final national polls. 1994 \u2014 (11-1, second in Big Eight, No. 3 in final AP poll) In terms of pure talent, it's hard to argue with the 1994 team. The roster included a Heisman Trophy winner (Rashaan Salaam), a Thorpe Award winner (Chris Hudson) and a Butkus Award runner-up (Ted Johnson). Four starters from the team went on to become first-round NFL draft picks, 18 starters earned spots on NFL regular-season rosters, nine Buffs were named first-team all-Big Eight and three were chosen as first-team All-Americans. But, those Buffs didn't even win the Big Eight, thanks to a 24-7 loss in Nebraska in which they were dominated in every facet of the game, dropping them from No. 2 in the nation to No. 7. A Fiesta Bowl win over Notre Dame put them at No. 3 to end the season. 1971 \u2014 (10-2, third in Big Eight, No. 3 in final AP poll) CU fans who don't believe football at Colorado began with the McCartney era say Eddie Crowder's 1971 squad at least belongs in the conversation of best CU team ever. Those Buffs did lose two games, finishing 10-2. But the losses came at Oklahoma and Nebraska, and Colorado did win at No. 9 LSU and No. 6 Ohio State. The final national rankings had Nebraska, Oklahoma and Colorado at 1-2-3 \u2014 the only time in college football history that one conference claimed the top three spots in the final poll. As for talent, the '71 Buffs had plenty, including such players as Cliff Branch, J.V. Cain, Charlie Davis, Bo Matthews, Herb Orvis, Cullen Bryant and John Stearns.

Memorable not because of championships \u2014 the 1994 Buffs finished second in the Big Eight to Nebraska, beat Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl and finished No. 3 in the nation \u2014 but memorable because of the wealth of storylines. Four starters from the team went on to become first-round NFL draft picks. Eighteen starters earned spots on NFL regular-season rosters. Nine Buffs were named first-team all-Big Eight, three were chosen as first-team All-Americans, and the roster included a Heisman Trophy winner (Rashaan Salaam), a Thorpe Award winner (Chris Hudson) and a Butkus Award runner-up (Ted Johnson). Twenty years later, it's almost impossible to fathom that kind of talent ever losing a game. It's why that year's 24-7 loss to Nebraska still ranks as one of the most disappointing losses in CU history \u2014 and why that game may be one of the most important crossroads in the history of CU football, one that changed the trajectory of the entire program and the athletic department. Along with the overwhelming amount of talent, there were other riveting storylines for those 11-1 Buffs: \u2022 Salaam's season, a year that included four consecutive 200-plus yard games, a 317-yard effort against Texas and a 259-yard effort against Iowa State in the season finale that gave him 2,055 yards for the season and clinched the Heisman. \u2022 The \"Miracle in Michigan\" \u2014 The game that ended with a 64-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass from Stewart to Michael Westbrook that produced a 27-26 win over Michigan in the Big House. It's still considered the most famous play in CU history and one of the most famous in college football history. \u2022 CU's pursuit of a second national title, one that saw Colorado reach No. 2 in the national rankings before being derailed by No. 3 Nebraska. And when the dust had cleared \u2014 when all those storylines had been written \u2014 there came a moment that overshadowed everything else. Minutes after the win over Iowa State, head coach Bill McCartney stunned the college football world by announcing his retirement. The man who took Colorado from the outhouse to the penthouse, the man who built CU football into a national power, said he would step down after CU's bowl game. Buff football has never been the same. Today, that 1994 team is called by some the best in CU history \u2014 even better than the 11-1-1 Buffs of 1990, who won a national title. It's a worthwhile debate. But underneath the question of \"best ever\" is a query that has haunted Buff fans for the past two decades, a \"what if?\" for the ages: What if the 1994 Buffs had beaten Nebraska? How would the course of history have changed for Colorado football? Understand it's a very big \"what if.\" The Buffs weren't just beaten in Nebraska in '94, they were thoroughly dominated. Nebraska had a 17-0 lead at the half, and by game's end, the Buffs' \"unstoppable\" offense was 0-for-11 on third-down conversions and 0-for-4 on fourth-down tries. NU defensive coordinator Charlie McBride's game plan was brilliant and the Buffs had no answer But for the sake of argument, let's say the Buffs did win that game. Let's say instead of trying to establish a run game \u2014 and playing into the heart of Nebraska's defense \u2014 Mac came out throwing deep and CU came home with a win. Then what? For starters, it's fair to assume the Buffs would have won another national title. Nebraska used the win over Colorado to move into No. 1 in the national polls and went on to claim its first national championship under Tom Osborne, defeating Miami 24-17 in the Orange Bowl. If the Buffs had followed the same road, they would have won their second national title in a five-year span, firmly stamping Colorado as one of the dominant programs of the 1990s. It's also fair to assume McCartney still would have retired. Mac left because of family concerns, a decision those close to him say he reached long before the season was over. A chance at another national title likely wouldn't have changed his mind \u2014 in fact it might have made the decision easier. But would Colorado still have hired young quarterbacks coach Rick Neuheisel, or would athletic director Bill Marolt have opened up a true national search, one guaranteed to lure the best and the brightest from every corner of the nation? CU associate A.D. David Plati believes Marolt still would have cast CU's lot with Neuheisel. CU did look at a half-dozen national candidates, but never seriously considered going outside the program. \"The intent of the department all along was to stay in-house and maintain continuity,\" Plati said. \"Recruiting was going great, we had momentum in all areas and the thought process was to not upset the apple cart.\" So would nothing have changed? Would CU's trajectory have followed a similar vein, with the only difference being another national title (and one less for Nebraska)? Maybe not. The argument here is that another national title would have set off a chain reaction that would have dramatically altered the future of the entire Colorado athletic department, the Big 12 and the Pac-10. In late December 1994, the Colorado Board of Regents considered an offer to join the Pac-10, even though CU had already committed to join the Big 12, which began play in 1996. At the time, many believed the regents were ready to accept the Pac-10 offer, but thanks to some last-minute lobbying from then-president Judith Albino, the regents voted 6-3 to keep their commitment to the Big 12. But the guess here is that vote would have changed had CU been preparing to play for a national title. Colorado would have been considered a truly premier football program \u2014 something the Pac-10 desperately needed \u2014 and lobbying from the West Coast no doubt would have been even more intense. The lure would have been hard to ignore. Colorado would have automatically become the marquee program in the Pac-10, something that was never going to be the case in the Big 12, where Nebraska and Texas were destined to dictate the conference's future. \"The chance at being national champions and moving to another conference would have made it a whole new ballgame,\" Plati said. \"I think it very possibly changes the regents' vote because it's a chance to automatically become the flagship program of a conference overnight. That was never going to be the case in the Big 12.\" It might have been an opportunity too good to pass up. \"I think if we'd gone, everything would have changed,\" Plati said. \"We went 20-4 over the next two seasons in the Big Eight. In the Pac-11, we very possibly win the conference in back-to-back years and play in the Rose Bowl. Our recruiting, especially in California, steps up even another notch. It sets the table for a long string of success.\" The chain reaction would have no doubt been interesting. Fundraising \u2014 which hit a high note after 1990 \u2014 likely would have received another big boost with Rose Bowl bids. Neuheisel's sudden departure for Washington after the 1998 season likely would not have occurred, and CU's future \u2014 a slow decline delayed briefly with a handful of solid seasons under Gary Barnett \u2014 may have been a much different trajectory. \"Obviously, it's all conjecture,\" Plati said. \"But if we'd moved to the Pac-10 that much earlier ... it's interesting to think about how much things would have changed.\" Indeed. It's a very big \"what if ...\" But in terms of the future of a program \u2014 and an entire athletic department \u2014 it's difficult to find another game that would have changed history so dramatically.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_26389192/94-loss-huskers-game-changer-cu", "sailthru.author": "By Neill Woelk \n \n  For BuffZone.com", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:26389192:view"}, "startDate": "2014-08-23T17:00:55-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Best ever?It's a question that can spark great debate among avid Colorado football fans \u2014 and one that has no clear answer.", "title": "'94 loss to Huskers game-changer for CU", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_26389192/94-loss-huskers-game-changer-cu", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0822/20140822__24DCS1994~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU & Other College Sports", "modificationDate": "2014-08-24T14:08:15-0600", "endDate": "2024-08-22T17:09:22-0600", "byline": "By Neill WoelkFor", "pubDate": "2014-08-23T13:27:05-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-08-23T17:00:55-0600", "sailthru.title": "'94 loss to Huskers game-changer for CU", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0822/20140822__24DCS1994~1_300.jpg", "description": "Best ever?It's a question that can spark great debate among avid Colorado football fans \u2014 and one that has no clear answer.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_26389192/94-loss-huskers-game-changer-cu", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Best ever?It's a question that can spark great debate among avid Colorado football fans \u2014 and one that has no clear answer.", "title": "'94 loss to Huskers game-changer for CU"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2014/0822/20140822__24DCS1994~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "It's still considered the most famous play in CU history and one of the most famous in college football history.\nBut there are other strong candidates, and each has its compelling reasons why it could be seen as the best in CU history.\nPrint Email Font Resize Font Resize CU & Other College Sports '94 loss to Huskers game-changer for CU Program's trajectory might have been very different had Buffs topped NU that seasonCoach Bill McCartney, who led the Buffs to their only national title, suddenly retired in 1994.\nIt's a question that can spark great debate among avid Colorado football fans \u2014 and one that has no clear answer.\nBut the guess here is that vote would have changed had CU been preparing to play for a national title."}
