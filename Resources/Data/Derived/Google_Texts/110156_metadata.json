The day after the election, Rush Limbaugh was celebrating his ability to articulately indict liberalism.\n\nAnd in between, on election day, Ben Sasse nailed 49 percent of the vote in a four-man race, racking up more than twice as many votes as the runner-up in his first run at public office.\n\nSo who is this guy who\u2019s been dubbed a rising star by both the National Review and FOX News, who would be one of the youngest U.S. Senators if elected in November as expected?\n\nAlthough immediately dubbed a carpetbagger by the Democrats, he is a Nebraska native. He grew up near Fremont, paying his dues doing that time-honored tradition of \u201cdetasseling corn and walking bean fields,\u201d as he often tells audiences. Saying you detasseled corn as a kid is a way to immediately inform Nebraskans that you are one of them. He has a scar on his forehead from a hayloft fall to prove it.\n\nBut Sasse isn\u2019t your average Nebraska boy. He was the high school valedictorian and was recruited to wrestle at Harvard, which he downplays with a self-deprecating one-liner about how he wasn\u2019t good enough to play football at the University of Nebraska.\n\n\u201cI went to Harvard not because I thought it was academically superior, but because it was athletically inferior,\u201d he said in January to the delight of Joe Scarborough when Sasse was on his MSNBC show.\n\nHe got his bachelor\u2019s degree at Harvard, was quarterback of the Oxford football team in England, got a master\u2019s from St. John\u2019s College and two master\u2019s degrees and a Ph.D. from Yale. He calls himself a policy nerd and autodidact (a self-taught person).\n\nHe says he\u2019s good at fixing things. His first job out of college was with the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm. After two weeks of training, he got a call saying he needed to get on a 6 a.m. flight to Minneapolis the next day, where he spent four months helping Northwest Airlines avoid bankruptcy by improving planes\u2019 turnaround time between flights.\n\nWhile he\u2019s been painted as a tea partyer, outsider and anti-establishment Republican, he spent time on the inside. From 2003 to 2005, he was chief of staff for the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Policy, where he worked on sharing intelligence between the FBI and CIA.\n\nThe Bush administration lured him back in 2007 to work as assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the fourth-ranking job in the department.\n\nWhen asked to explain how he\u2019s not a Washington insider by gotcha-man John Stossel, Sasse said he \u201cworked in Washington for about four years\u201d but is now raising his kids where he grew up.\n\nThe homefront\n\nMark Fahleson, former chairman of the state Republican Party, met Sasse when he went to U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry\u2019s swearing-in ceremony in 2005. Sasse was hired as his chief of staff to get the office up and running. He was fixing a printer when Fahleson walked in.\n\n\u201cWhen I first met him he was fixing broken things in Congress and now he\u2019s going back to fix more broken things in Congress,\u201d Fahleson said.\n\nThey stayed in touch. After 9/11, Sasse said he was more determined than ever to move his family back to Nebraska.\n\n\u201cI gotta make that happen,\u201d he\u2019d say to Fahleson.\n\nIn 2009, he got his chance. He received a distress call from the Lutheran college in his hometown, Midland University, where his father graduated and grandfather worked for 33 years. The school was on the edge of bankruptcy, and the board of directors first sought his advice, then asked him to take the helm.\n\nAt age 37, he took the job as president and became one of the youngest chief executives in higher education. He and his wife, Melissa, a Birmingham, Ala., native, already owned a lake house near Fremont, less than a mile from where Sasse grew up. He said she\u2019s since become a one-woman chamber of commerce, trying to recruit friends and family to move there.\n\nThey have three children, Corrie, 12, Alex, 10 and Breck, 3 \u2014 all of whom have been staples on the campaign trail, as the family went on the road in a big RV with Sasse signs splashed on the side. During the end of one debate, Sasse noted the whole family was sleeping in one bed, which involved a lot of kicking and bad breath.\n\nThey homeschool the girls, even on the campaign trail. Sasse will be in the middle of an interview and stop to make sure his daughter Corrie is doing her school work rather than reading fiction. The girls are required to read one article in the newspaper daily and write a one-page op-ed. Sasse makes the girls record their daily activities on time sheets.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s constantly teaching,\u201d said senior campaign adviser Jordan Gehrke, adding that Sasse constantly talks to his kids about the value of work.\n\nMost summer nights, the family gets on a boat, cranks up the country music and pulls the girls around on water skis.\n\n\u201cThe guy\u2019s one of the best dads I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Gehrke said.\n\nSasse schedules his days in half-hour increments, getting up at 4 a.m. every day to work out and read a couple of papers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the most disciplined people I\u2019ve ever seen in my life,\u201d Gehrke said.\n\nMelissa, who was valedictorian at the University of Alabama and teaches a couple of classes at Midland University, said she was not entirely on board when Fahleson launched a campaign to draft Sasse into running a year ago.\n\n\u201cI love our life in Fremont,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter a long walk, they decided to do it for the country. But first, they would test the waters in Fremont. His hometown cemented their decision by helping him raise a record amount of campaign cash in the first quarter.\n\n\u201cBen\u2019s always been interested in government and how things work,\u201d Melissa Sasse said.\n\nBut politics? Not so much. He was content with his job, where he shepherded a turnaround.\n\n\u201cHe truly was a reluctant candidate,\u201d Fahleson said.\n\nThe two had met countless times at a \u201csecret location\u201d between Fremont and Lincoln, where they\u2019d talk about the Huskers, public policy, religion and raising daughters. After serving as GOP chairman from 2009 to 2013, Fahleson said he was burned out on politics. He and his wife had an understanding that he was out of the game, with one caveat. If Sasse ever ran for office, he could help.\n\nSo Fahleson jumped back into politics by launching a campaign to draft his friend to run for the Senate. Why?\n\n\u201cI know he is a man of integrity,\u201d Fahleson says. \u201cI know he is intelligent and thoughtful. He understands why he\u2019s a conservative. Far too many Republicans I have worked with can read the talking points, but I can tell it\u2019s not in their hearts, or they don\u2019t understand why.\u201d\n\nIf Sasse wins, the family would not move to Washington, D.C., Melissa Sasse said.\n\nGehrke said Melissa Sasse is \u201cnot at all impressed by D.C.\u201d and he expects Sasse would continue his tradition of bringing a daughter or two with him to Washington, as he did in the past while on a national health care speaking circuit, where he has debated former presidential contender and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean.\n\nSasse\u2019s campaign was criticized for airing a TV ad featuring his daughters talking about his commitment to repealing Obamacare, with some accusing them of giving the girls talking points. But it\u2019s not hard to believe the campaign\u2019s claim that were filmed talking off the cuff, given they\u2019ve tagged along to countless Obamacare town hall meetings across the state, where Sasse drags out a 9-foot-high stack of Obamacare rules and regulations.\n\nThe 10-year-old will drop the word \u201chypothesis\u201d in casual conversation. Asked what her favorite part of the campaign was, she says going to the Sandhills and meeting a man who runs a \u201ccow-calf operation.\u201d On election night, Corrie Sasse put together the playlist for the watch party \u2014 all country music.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re super precocious and talk to their parents constantly,\u201d Gehrke said.\n\nSasse\u2019s father, a retired teacher, said his son always was a sharp, gifted, happy child who set goals.\n\n\u201cHe was just a good, good kid,\u201d Gary Sasse said on election night, where the jubilation began early after the AP called the race within an hour of the polls closing.\n\nHe called his son \u201cnormal\u201d \u2014 the same word his sister and Fahleson use to describe him. But \u201cunique\u201d was the word his stepmother, Jean, used to describe him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been different \u2014 driven,\u201d she said.\n\nHis dad said the only sign he might be interested in politics was when he worked as a page in Congress while in high school and as a tutor to the page program while in graduate school. And his favorite movie growing up was \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cRising star\u201d\n\nNow suddenly Rush Limbaugh is talking about Sasse, crediting him for \u201copenly indicting liberalism and the liberal path to decline.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to say,\u201d Limbaugh said on the show Wednesday. \u201cYou just don\u2019t find Republicans willing to say it anymore, but Ben Sasse did and he won.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh said there\u2019s a blueprint for \u201chuge Republican conservative victory\u201d but it\u2019s ignored, even impugned by the establishment Republican Party. He said when that message is properly articulated, \u201cit wins.\u201d\n\nAfter Sasse \u2014 who started his campaign 32 points behind the frontrunner with virtually no name recognition \u2014 was declared a major tea party winner, he was asked on FOX\u2019s morning show Thursday whether he\u2019s a mainstream Republican.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not always sure what mainstream Republican means,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many of these labels seem like they\u2019re driven by the national liberal media, whose favorite topic is Republicans fighting Republicans.\u201d\n\nHowever, he is prone to take on his fellow Republicans.\n\n\u201cIf \u2018mainstream Republican\u2019 means you\u2019re satisfied with the way Washington works right now, then the people in Nebraska \u2014 we don\u2019t believe in that,\u201d he told FOX. \u201cI\u2019m a very conservative guy, but we don\u2019t think the problem is just that the Democrats are in charge, we think that it\u2019s that too many Republicans want Washington, D.C., to be in charge.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Sasse is a tea partyer, Gehrke dodges the question and starts reiterating Sasse\u2019s talking points about how the problem isn\u2019t just that the Democrats are in charge of Washington and have bad ideas, but Republicans have no ideas. Pressed on the point, he said, \u201cI think he\u2019s somebody who\u2019s a full-spectrum conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too easy to label him as one thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a lot of things.\u201d\n\nBut Fahleson, an informal adviser to Sasse, is more definitive.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe him as tea party,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say he\u2019s one part Jack Kemp, one part Ronald Reagan and one part Russell Kirk.\u201d\n\nWhile some reporters have labeled Sasse \u201cThe Next Ted Cruz,\u201d he emulates Kemp, quoting him on election night, saying, \u201cWe may not get every vote, but we\u2019ll speak to every heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will represent the entire American family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will aim not just to win, but to be worthy of winning.\u201d\n\nFahleson said Sasse admired Kemp\u2019s positivity and desire for opportunity for all, his belief that America\u2019s better days were ahead. While he has a lot in common with Cruz, who endorsed him and made a crucial campaign appearance with him in western Nebraska, they have different styles, Fahleson said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in politics over two decades and he is without a doubt the strongest candidate I have ever had the pleasure of volunteering for,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the media was pitting the race as a bellwether for the tea party\u2019s strength, Gehrke was explaining in a memo that Sasse is just a phenomenal candidate with \u201cmovie-casting looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people have that \u2018it factor,\u2019 \u201d Fahleson said. \u201cBen\u2019s a different kind of candidate.\u201d\n\nThe other guy\n\nSome reporters seem to have forgotten Sasse still has an opponent. But in this bright red state, the other guy is expected to have an uphill battle. A Rasmussen poll has Sasse leading by 17 points.\n\nOn Thursday, while Sasse started the day with a FOX News interview, his Democratic opponent, David Domina, made an afternoon appearance at a Lincoln coffee shop.\n\nAside from the two campaign workers, four people showed up. One was a childhood friend he hadn\u2019t seen in years, another was a woman with three kids whose husband was going to be deported.\n\nBut Domina is no slouch. He\u2019s one of the most prominent trial lawyers in the state and has represented landowners fighting the Keystone XL oil pipeline, successfully getting Nebraska\u2019s pipeline siting law struck down by a district judge.\n\nAsked how he plans to beat the young upstart from Fremont, Domina answered with a question: \u201cIs he the most extreme candidate for public office in the state\u2019s history?\u201d\n\nNot according to his Republican opponents, who tried to portray him as soft on Obamacare and immigration. But Domina said Sasse would dismantle Social Security (by supporting privatization), refuse to pay veterans benefits (because he supported the government shutdown that disrupted their benefits) and wants to abolish the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too extreme,\u201d Domina said. \u201cI think I can beat him because I think he\u2019s too extreme.\u201d\n\nContact Deena Winter at deena@nebraskawatchdog.org.
