But at least it\u2019s also a country where you can then sue the heck out of everyone involved, and come away with major financial compensation.\n\nWe picked up this sorry tale in November: Report: N.M. Traffic Stop Turns Into Forced Enemas, Colonoscopy. To recap:\n\nThe New Mexico TV station KOB-TV Channel 4 reports that a man who was pulled over for failing to make a full stop at a stop sign was brought to a hospital and forcibly subjected to repeated anal probes, three enemas and ultimately a colonoscopy. A drug-sniffing dog indicated a possible odor of drugs on the car seat, and a police officer thought the man, David Eckert, was \u201cclenching his buttocks\u201d when he got out of the car, and wanted his anal cavity searched for drugs, KOB-TV reports. At a nearby emergency room, a doctor refused to do the search, calling it unethical; Eckert was brought to another hospital, where doctors apparently raised no such objections.\n\nNow for the update: The Los Angeles Times reports that though officials denied some claims in Eckert\u2019s suit, a settlement agreement will give him $1.6 million in damages.\n\n\u201cThe lawsuit continues against an assistant district attorney as well as hospital officials,\u201d the LA Times reports. It does not specify what happened with the $4,539 bill the hospital sent to Eckert for services rendered, but I\u2019m betting that\u2019s off. And as for Eckert, the Times reports, he \u201csaid that he was \u2018grateful to live in the United States.'\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Mexico man whom police and doctors subjected to forced enemas and a colonoscopy gets $1.6 million in damages.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "A New Mexico man whom police and doctors subjected to forced enemas and a colonoscopy gets $1.6 million in damages.", "title": "Follow-Up: $1.6M Damages For Forced Colonoscopy, Enemas", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/forced-enema-settlement", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2012/03/colonoscopy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/01/forced-enema-settlement", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2012/03/colonoscopy.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "Follow-Up: $1.6M Damages For Forced Colonoscopy, Enemas"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-20", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 09:29:45 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe0a\"", "article_summary": "We picked up this sorry tale in November: Report: N.M.
