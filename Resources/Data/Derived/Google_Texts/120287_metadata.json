She had planned with her doctor for a relaxed atmosphere with no drugs and, most importantly, no surgery.\n\nBut after her water broke in the hospital, her doctor said a C-section would be necessary because the circumstances were getting dangerous.\n\nSalas had a fever and her baby\u2019s head was against her back, a position that often results in longer labor. Her doctor told her a C-section was necessary due to these factors.\n\nA survey by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists showed 39 percent of Florida physicians stopped offering or performing vaginal births out of fear of lawsuits.\n\nDr. Christina Pe\u00f1a is an OBGYN at Kendall Regional Medical Center, which has the state\u2019s highest rate of C-sections \u2014 64 percent.\n\n\u201cDoctors here say, 'Let me not take that risk,' \u201d Says Pe\u00f1a. \u201c 'I don't want to have maybe a bad outcome happen.' \u201d\n\nBut there are risks to unnecessary C-sections, too: bleeding, infections and scar tissue.\n\nKendall Regional knows the problem and has changed its guidelines to avoid C-sections. Doctors and staff now meet on a monthly basis and -- except in an emergency -- can\u2019t induce any patient before 39 weeks.\n\nBut Dr. Salih Yasin, director of obstetrics and patient safety at Jackson Memorial Hospital, says some South Florida mothers ask for a C-section.\n\n\u201cThey feel that this would be less dramatic, no pain, no issues with their body,\u201d says Dr. Yasin.\n\nJamie Arratia, 38, gave birth to a baby girl in August--it was her second planned C-section. Seventeen years ago she had struggled with her first delivery during a natural birth.\n\n\u201cI was afraid of tearing something open or being stuck with the same predicament of my son which was five hours of pushing,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t want to go that route again if I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nArratia says she also planned a C-section this time to have her tubes tied.\n\nManny Fermin, director for the Healthy Start Coalition of Miami-Dade County, says the decision to perform a Cesarean is also influenced by time.\n\n\u201cIn a 10-hour block of time you don\u2019t know how long that lady is going to take before she gives birth... but you are there,\u201d says Fermin.\n\nHe says in the time it takes doctors to deliver one natural birth, they could do up to 10 C-sections.\n\nBut efficiency is not what some patients, like Salas, are thinking about.\n\nAccording to research from the National Partnership for Women and Families, more than half of mothers feel frightened during a C-section.\n\nWhen the nurses prepped Salas for her surgery, they tied her hands to the bed so she wouldn\u2019t touch her body as the doctor cut her open.\n\n\"The sensation was weird, it was like somebody was playing with my guts,\u201d Salas says.\n\nShe still had her hands tied when they placed the baby on her breasts.\n\n\u201cIt was not what I wanted,\u201d says Salas.\n\nAnd Dr. Pe\u00f1a says it's not what a lot of mothers want.\n\n\u201cThe patients I'm seeing now are really determined to do things as natural as possible,\u201d says Pe\u00f1a.\n\nThis year, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released new guidelines to prevent first time mothers from having a cesarean.\n\nThe big change: It wants doctors to give mothers more time during labor.\n\n\u201cWe need to be a little bit more patient. Not to call, \u201cOh the baby is stressed, let\u2019s jump to have a C-section,'\u201d says Dr. Yasin.\n\nNavigate the map to see Palm Beach County, Broward County, Miami-Dade County and Monroe County's C-section rates.
