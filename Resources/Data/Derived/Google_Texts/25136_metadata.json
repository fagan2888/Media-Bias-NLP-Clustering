Rand Paul is in step with his party on most issues. He\u2019s pro-life, a big backer of gun rights, a small-government conservative and he\u2019s an unabashed critic of President Obama and Hillary Clinton. And yet, Paul is again in the spotlight talking about his disagreements with his own party. For months, Paul has been focused on reducing criminal penalties for drugs. Last week, he blamed GOP hawks for the creation of ISIS. Now, he has succeeded in pulling off a one-man blockade of the Patriot Act.\n\n\n\nLike his other views, Paul\u2019s stand is no doubt sincere and he couldn\u2019t control the timing of the deadline. But even if he\u2019s not acting out of political calculation, Paul\u2019s obstruction is also no doubt necessary given his core supporters\u2019 views on the subject. Presumably, the current effort will cement his status as the real libertarian in the race. But how will that help him grow his stagnant 7 percent? Conservatives generally share Paul\u2019s concerns about over-broad surveillance, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they will like what he\u2019s doing. Even some voters disposed to like Paul are uneasy.\n\n\n\nPaul, who suggested some of his critics were hoping for a terrorist attack during the Patriot Act lapse as fodder for political attacks against him, clearly sees himself as a man locked in an epic struggle with wicked people. Paul could take credit for the changes that will be made once his procedural efforts expire, but instead he is casting himself in a similar, if less damaging, role that Ted Cruz filled during the 2013 ObamaCare government shutdown.\n\n\n\nAttacking him has become a cottage industry for hawks in general and neo-conservatives in particular. It\u2019s hard to imagine Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., debuting his long-shot bid today without Paul in the race, and Graham and others will do their best to keep Paul pinned down defending his national security stances. And like his father in his 2008 and 2012 runs, Paul will become a pi\u00f1ata for other second-tier candidates looking to grab a headline or demonstrate foreign policy bona fides.\n\n\n\nPaul can grab attention and he can be heard above the din of a crowded GOP field. But if he wants the GOP nomination, he will have to find a way to use those gifts to turn his fight back toward Democrats or he will become a marginal figure in fast fashion.\n\n\n\n2016 GOP Power Index: 1) Jeb Bush; 2) Scott Walker; 3) Marco Rubio; 4) Ted Cruz; 5) Carly Fiorina; 6) John Kasich [+2]; 7) Rand Paul [-1]; 8) Ben Carson [-1]; 9) Mike Huckabee; 10) Chris Christie\n\n\n\nOn the Radar - Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki\n\n\n\nWhat would you say? - Give us your take on the 2016 Power Index we will share the best and brightest with the whole class.

Instead of allowing Americans to collect full benefits at age 65, the former Florida governor and likely GOP presidential candidate suggested on Sunday that it should be pushed back to 68 or 70. \u2018I think it needs to be phased in over an extended period of time,\u2019 he said on CBS\u2019s \u2018Face the Nation.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is hard for me, to be honest with you, to \u2013 I have to do the Heisman on my brother that I love.

Scott Walker\u2019s rhetoric in the run-up to his likely presidential bid. But on a weekend swing here, he mixed his fighting words with some qualifiers. He\u2019s not for \u2018open-ended excursions,\u2019 he told GOP activists on a cruise on Lake Winnipesaukee. \u2018We don\u2019t need to get into open-ended, endless engagements,\u2019 he said at a banquet speech in Manchester. \u2018I don\u2019t think we should be the world's policeman,\u2019 he told his audience at the Snowshoe Club in Concord. \u2018I don\u2019t think we should go in everywhere.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nIowa\u2019s favorite - DMR: \u201cScott Walker\u2019s popularity streak in Iowa is real: He\u2019s seven percentage points ahead of his nearest competition in the presidential horse race here, chased by a tight pack of four in a clear top tier: Ben Carson, Rand Paul, Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Walker is in Atlanta today meeting with local party leaders.]\n\n\n\nRubio gets ready to rumble with Jeb - The always entertaining political state of Florida will not disappoint junkies this election cycle. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush loom over the other candidates in the Sunshine State leaving nothing but dark clouds for the rest of the field, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can skip Florida entirely (here\u2019s looking at you Scott Walker). Wash Ex\u2019s David Drucker writes that Tuesday\u2019s jobs forum, hosted by Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., is not just another Republican \u201ccattle call,\u201d but an important temperature taker in the most crucial 2016 state. It\u2019s also the first time the two former allies have shared a stage as rivals.\n\n\n\nCruz : \u2018Tom Brady was framed\u2019 - Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, squeezed in a campaign stop while in Massachusetts this weekend with his wife, Heidi, for her Harvard Business School reunion. The presidential contender attended a house party fundraiser, and drew enthusiastic applause when he said, \u201c[New England quarterback] Tom Brady was framed.

It\u2019s how Washington bureaucracy works.\u2019 \u2026 Fiorina used China as an example of how federal involvement in education hurts the country. \u2018China has put in place an education system that standardizes behavior,\u2019 she said. \u2018It is part of their regime\u2019s oppression.\u2019 What China has done is similar to Common Core in the United States, she said. \u2018Common Core, unfortunately, limits parents' choices,\u2019 Fiorina said. \u2018It will, over time, limit our children\u2019s options.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\n[Fiorina highlights her growing popularity in Iowa and other early primary states.

Just 15 percent viewed her favorably in the last Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics Iowa Poll, in January. That has jumped to 41 percent in the May 25-29 poll.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Fiorina heads back to California today for a four-day swing in the state, starting with a visit to Los Angeles.]\n\n\n\nKasich set for July launch - Gov.

He has said he wouldn\u2019t announce until after June 30th but before August\u2026kind of leaves one option, reports the Columbus Dispatch. Kasich\u2019s New Hampshire support from former Sen. John Sununu, R-N.H., also gives him solid support in a key early state.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic on the resources.

WATCH HERE.\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nAmericans once saw space exploration as a new frontier, the same optimistic, competitive concept that drove Old World explorers and New World settlers. But the rationale for space travel has taken a darker turn in recent years, focused increasingly on the need for a new home for our species. NASA\u2019s One-Year Mission is underway and when it concludes 10 months hence, scientists hope to have unlocked the secrets to long-distance space travel. New Yorker looks at the effort, which the magazine dubs \u201cProject Exodus,\u201d and the belief behind it: That humans may need to abandon Earth because of environmental degradation and exhausted resources. As Americans take an increasingly dim view of the future, have we developed a space program that matches a dystopian view?\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Those speeches put more than $1.6 million in the Democratic candidate's pocket. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and TD Bank were both primary sponsors of paid Clinton speeches in 2014 and early 2015\u2026Both banks have financial ties to TransCanada, the company behind the Keystone XL pipeline\u2026 Further, Gordon Giffin, a CIBC board member and onetime U.S. ambassador to Canada, is a former lobbyist for TransCanada and was a contributions bundler for Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign\u2026.\n\n\n\n[Hillary Clinton is in New York for a trio of fundraisers, one of which is hosted by former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer\u2019s, D-N.Y., ex-wife Silda Wall.]\n\n\n\nMore from HuffPo: \u201cWhile serving as secretary of state, Clinton said that she was \u2018inclined\u2019 to approve the pipeline. Since then, she has been mum on the issue, even as environmentalists -- with their major grassroots and money sway in the Democratic Party -- have made stopping the pipeline a priority\u2026. Whether the U.S. government will approve further construction of the pipeline was a hot topic in each of the Q&A sessions hosted by the bank executives. And at every turn, Clinton refused to answer.\u201d\n\n\n\nIowa Dems worry about electability - Though a Des Moines Register Iowa poll out this weekend shows Clinton maintaining a big lead over her rivals, 66 percent of Democratic caucus-goers worry recent scandals could hurt her in the general election.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s populist-identity rollout - WashEx\u2019s Byron York breaks down the message behind former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s presidential announcement: \u201cOn one hand, his speech [Saturday] was nearly all about economic populism. On the other, the event itself, apart from O\u2019Malley\u2019s address, was about identity politics. The combined effect was a presidential rollout that said the former Maryland governor can compete with any Democrat when it comes to taxing the rich and breaking up the big banks, and at the same time can outrun Hillary Clinton when it comes to gay marriage and immigration.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Ground game - O\u2019Malley, who was back in Iowa and New Hampshire this weekend, dismissed his poor numbers in key primary state polls. \u201c[P]eople there have seen 1 percent candidates before \u2013 get into the van, go from county to county to county and make their case about their better choices that they would offer the nation,\u201d he told ABC News, \u201cAnd suddenly become very well-known overnight when people make up their mind.\u201d]\n\n\n\nFifty Shades of Really Gray - The Hill: \u201cSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on Sunday that a controversial essay he penned in 1972 discusses topics similar to the popular erotic novel 50 Shades of Gray\u2026\u2018[W]hat it was dealing with was gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive,\u2019 Sanders [told NBC News].\u2019You know, something like 50 Shades of Gray, very poorly written 43 years ago,\u2019 he added.\u201d\n\n\n\nPacking them in - Sanders drew an overflow crowd on a campaign stop in Minneapolis. Minnesota Public Radio reported that thousands turned out to her the socialist icon.\n\n\n\n[Backs NSA bill - \u201cIt does not go as far as I would like it to go. I voted against the original PATRIOT Act and against the re-authorization of the PATRIOT Act\u2026. I am not comfortable with it, but we have to look at the best of bad situations.\u201d \u2013 Vt.

Instead, they found a group of asparagus harvesters. Police in the town of Ludwigslust said a man called their emergency number Saturday to report having seen \u201810 to 15 people armed with knives and sticks\u2019 on a local road. Within minutes, six police cars were on their way to the scene. Officers quickly discovered, however, that the group was asparagus harvesters walking along the road with their work tools as they went to take a lunch break. White asparagus is a popular delicacy in Germany and a ubiquitous sight on restaurant menus in late spring.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
