The vacancy rate for apartments in Los Angeles County, with 10 million people the nation\u2019s largest, is now 3.3 percent \u2014 lower than in New York City.\n\nThe tightest of these concentric circles, the City of Los Angeles, is about to hit its development limit. According to planner Greg Morrow, the city is now zoned to house at most 4.2 million people. The current population is 3.9 million.\n\nLos Angeles and its satellites \u2014 once the land of the American homeowner dream \u2014 now form the most stunted urban region in the country. There were 28,000 new housing starts in the L.A. Metro last year (pop. 13 million), versus 64,000 in Houston (pop. 2 million). There were fewer permits per capita in Los Angeles than in San Francisco.\n\nThis has become expensive for homeowners and tenants alike. The former spend 40 percent of their income on mortgage payments; the latter spend 48 percent of their income on rent. Both figures are the highest in the country.\n\nLos Angeles is not the only city with a regulation-induced housing shortage. As the cover story in this week\u2019s Economist attests, the problem is global: From Mumbai to the Bay Area, the magazine writes, \u201cthe value of housing is an ever-greater store of wealth.\u201d According to a recent argument by Matthew Rognlie, a doctoral student at Harvard, the increasing global returns to capital calculated by the French economist Thomas Piketty in his best-selling book \u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d can be explained almost entirely by housing wealth.\n\nWhat makes this so striking, in the case of Los Angeles (the city), is how much room there is. With slightly more than 8,000 people per square mile, L.A. is less than one-third as crowded as New York City and less than half as dense as San Francisco.\n\nAnd yet, L.A. is much, much closer to its residential capacity than the more compact and more populous NYC. Los Angeles has created a crisis of artificial scarcity; a burden for renters, a drain on economic growth, and an environmental disaster. The city has planned itself into a cage.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t always this way. According to Greg Morrow, a planner and professor, Los Angeles had a residential capacity of 10 million in 1960. In the years since, that has fallen by 60 percent, as the city turned over planning responsibilities to communities. Local control led to lower densities, larger minimum lots, parking requirements and setbacks.\n\nIn Morrow\u2019s dissertation, he neatly sums up the varied effects of four decades of community control. Poor, largely minority neighborhoods have borne the brunt of new construction. Affluent, largely white communities have effectively thrown up the gates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s planning apartheid,\u201d Morrow told me when we spoke last month. \u201cYou have essentially a minority of a minority of a minority who determine the housing policies for the vast majority of Angelenos.\u201d The first minority are homeowners; the second, those engaged in land use issues; the third, those who have the time and money to litigate.\n\n\u201cThey think downzoning will stop growth,\u201d Morrow said. \u201cIt won\u2019t stop people from coming to LA. It makes the lives of those who do come that much worse.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cCity of Quartz,\u201d the polemical and fascinating history of Los Angeles that turns 25 this year, Mike Davis devotes a chapter to the influence of what he called the \u201chomegrown revolution.\u201d\n\nDavis outlined three keys to understanding the homeowners\u2019 cabal in the city\u2019s single-family suburbs, which take up nearly 80 percent of the residential land here (vs. 25 percent in New York City and San Francisco).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Los Angeles used to be the promised land for America's homeowners.
