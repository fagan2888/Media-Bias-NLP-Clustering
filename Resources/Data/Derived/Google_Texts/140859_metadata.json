The document is pure status quo perpetuation \u2026 different from prior budgets only in its growth from the previous year.\n\nThere\u2019s almost nothing we like about it.\n\nAlmost \u2026\n\nBehold, Part 1.B Section 117.132 of the state budget. Which reads as follows \u2026\n\nNo state funds shall be expended to assist in the United States Refugee Resettlement Program unless the county council of the county where the resettlement is to occur approves the relocation.\n\nFor those of you who missed it, back in April this website blew the lid on a controversial refugee resettlement program in Spartanburg, S.C. Under this scheme, the United Nations picks refugees for \u201cresettlement\u201d in the United States \u2013 a process paid for by U.S. taxpayers under the auspices of heavily subsidized (usually uber-liberal) nonprofits.\n\nMany of these liberal groups masquerade as \u201cChristian\u201d charities, exploiting the social conservatives living in the Upstate region of the Palmetto State.\n\nOh \u2026 and speaking of exploitation, once federal tax dollars have paid for these resettlements (via the U.S. State Department), local governments are stuck with the costs of providing for these refugees.\n\nWe have consistently opposed the program \u2013 and increasingly, we\u2019re not alone.\n\nUnfortunately, the plan is supported by S.C. governor Nikki Haley \u2013 who is running it out of her scandal-scarred S.C. Department of Social Services (SCDSS). In fact Haley not only supports the program, she\u2019s reportedly authorized SCDSS to expand it in the coming fiscal year.\n\nHow is that possible, though? Has Spartanburg County approved the relocation?\n\nNo \u2026 in fact the local county council (membership/ email addresses here) has refused to take a vote on the matter.\n\nWait, though: According to the budget proviso, doesn\u2019t that mean \u201cno state funds shall be expended\u201d in support of the program?\n\nYes. Not a dime.\n\nUnfortunately, Haley\u2019s administration is ignoring this proviso.\n\n\u201cState money is already being spent on the refugees being resettled in Spartanburg,\u201d said Michelle Wiles, the activist who has filed a \u201ccease and desist\u201d letter with the U.S. State Department seeking to block the resettlement.\n\nWiles is working to get the Spartanburg County Council to take a vote on the proposed resettlement, but so far they have refused to do so.\n\nIn the meantime, State Department officials are arguing that any federal money passed through state agencies is not subject to the terms of the proviso \u2013 even though it\u2019s part of the state budget.\n\n\u201cThe state department said that no vote of the county council could stop the flow of money,\u201d S.C. Rep. Donna Hicks said.\n\nHicks has been one of the few state lawmakers to sound the alarm about the costly obligations associated with the resettlement. She\u2019s frustrated with the lack of leadership at the local level.\n\n\u201cThe county council doesn\u2019t want to be responsible,\u201d Hicks said.\n\nSpineless \u2026\n\nAs we\u2019ve said from the beginning of this saga, we explicitly reject the use of tax dollars \u2013 especially those routed through liberal foundations \u2013 to impose long-term obligations on South Carolina taxpayers. If faith-based organizations wish to host legal immigrants on their own dime, that\u2019s great \u2013 but their activities cannot be subsidized by government revenue. Nor can they be permitted to impose affirmative new obligations on already over-taxed citizens.\n\n\u201cFaith-based compassion is a wonderful thing, but just as one\u2019s religious beliefs shouldn\u2019t be imposed on another without consent \u2026 neither should taxpayer obligations based on those beliefs,\u201d we wrote.\n\nIndeed.\n\nIn addition to that, the rule of law matters. Or at least it should. State law forbids the implementation of this program without an affirmative vote of the county\u2019s elected representatives. Those representatives have refused to cast such a vote, meaning the program should be suspended until such time as they do.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/09/11/upstate-refugee-resettlement-violates-state-law/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/spartanburg-sc-downtown.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Upstate Refugee Resettlement Operating In Violation Of State Law"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8725\"", "article_summary": "For those of you who missed it, back in April this website blew the lid on a controversial refugee resettlement program in Spartanburg, S.C.\nWhich reads as follows \u2026No state funds shall be expended to assist in the United States Refugee Resettlement Program unless the county council of the county where the resettlement is to occur approves the relocation.\nIn the meantime, State Department officials are arguing that any federal money passed through state agencies is not subject to the terms of the proviso \u2013 even though it\u2019s part of the state budget.\nUnfortunately, the plan is supported by S.C. governor Nikki Haley \u2013 who is running it out of her scandal-scarred S.C.
