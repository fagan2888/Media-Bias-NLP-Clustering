She\u2019ll now be able to tell him justice has been served.\n\nOn Friday in Arapahoe County District Court, Almeda Sullivan, 52, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Donegan\u2019s son, 21-year-old Carter Higdon.\n\nHigdon died in October 2011 in Sullivan\u2019s Centennial home of a prescription drug overdose.\n\nThree other people connected to Sullivan also died of drug overdoses prior to Higdon\u2019s death.\n\nThe plea agreement presented Friday to District Court Judge Michelle Amico resulted in an 18-year prison sentence for Sullivan.\n\nDonegan addressed the court, reading from a prepared statement. She shared the happiest day of her life: Feb. 2, 1990, the day her son was born.\n\nShe recalled cradling him in a hospital room shortly after birth, looking into her child\u2019s eyes and promising she \u201cwould always be there for him \u2026 always love him.\u201d\n\nDonegan told the packed courtroom, which also included family of the other victims connected to Sullivan, about raising her son, a daredevil of a boy who enjoyed sports, being active and visiting the Colorado mountains.\n\nShe also shared the worst day of her life: Oct. 1, 2011, the day her son died.\n\n\u201cMy life, as I had come to know it, was over,\u201d Donegan said. \u201cMy child was dead. Nothing can prepare you for that.\u201d\n\nAfter Higdon\u2019s death, Arapahoe County sheriff\u2019s investigators watched Sullivan closely, eventually building a case against her in which they cited three other deaths.\n\nIn January 2008, Sierra Renee Cochran, 19, died at Sullivan\u2019s home after she accidently overdosed. Nine months later, Lindsey Jo Saidy, 28, and Martynas \u201cTez\u201d Simanskas, 20, died after overdosing on prescription medications they got from Sullivan, prosecutors said.\n\nAll died of overdoses of Opana, a narcotic painkiller similar to oxycodone. Sullivan was described in court as an addict who shared her love of the drug with others, especially younger people. She coached them on how to use the drug as well as supplying it.\n\nThe plea deal dismissed charges related to the other victims.\n\nSullivan, crying at times, apologized to Donegan and others in the courtroom, saying she \u201ccared so much\u201d for Higdon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry. I hope one day (Donegan) will be able to forgive me.\u201d\n\nAfter the emotional hearing, Donegan stood outside the courthouse and talked with the media.\n\n\u201cJustice has been served,\u201d Donegan said. \u201cI forgive her,\u201d she added. \u201cI am not going to hold hatred. There is no reason not to forgive her.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Almeda Sullivan pleads guilty in drug-overdose death of Centennial man", "title": "Almeda Sullivan pleads guilty in drug-overdose death of Centennial man", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/01/almeda-sullivan-pleads-guilty-in-drug-overdose-death-of-centennial-man/", "image": {"width": 235, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150501__20150502_A4_CD02SULLIVAN1p2.jpg", "height": 294}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150501__20150502_A4_CD02SULLIVAN1p2.jpg?w=1400", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-01T16:32:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T06:13:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "On Friday in Arapahoe County District Court, Almeda Sullivan, 52, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of Donegan\u2019s son, 21-year-old Carter Higdon.\nThree other people connected to Sullivan also died of drug overdoses prior to Higdon\u2019s death.\nShe also shared the worst day of her life: Oct. 1, 2011, the day her son died.\nI hope one day (Donegan) will be able to forgive me.\u201dAfter the emotional hearing, Donegan stood outside the courthouse and talked with the media.\nSullivan was described in court as an addict who shared her love of the drug with others, especially younger people."}
