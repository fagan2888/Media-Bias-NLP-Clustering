Faculty and students have expressed concern about how a law allowing people to carry concealed guns into buildings on Kansas college campuses will affect the classroom.

After July 1, 2017, campus buildings in Kansas have to allow concealed carry unless the building has adequate security. But Board of Regents chairman Kenny Wilk says universities won't be installing security at all of their 800-plus buildings.

Wilk says a possibility is installing security at selective buildings.

Michael Williams, incoming Kansas University Senate president told The Lawrence Journal-World there are concerns about the how weapons in the classroom will affect the open expression of ideas.

He says the University Senate Executive Committee also plans to form an ad hoc committee to explore options and recommendations.
