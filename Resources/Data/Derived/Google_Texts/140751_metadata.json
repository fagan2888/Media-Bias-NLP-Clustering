The average low temperature was the 11th-coldest.\n\nDan Huckaby, a National Weather Service meteorologist, said the area has had its share of wintry weather events the past decade, but arctic air masses have come more frequently this year. Arctic air tends to be dry, he said, allowing heat to escape at night without cloud cover.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really one of those things that happens with the weather,\u201d Huckaby said. \u201cOccasionally we get some arctic intrusions that come into Texas and give us some cold weather.\u201d\n\nBut the \u201cheat island\u201d in Dallas-Fort Worth makes it hard to break record low temperatures set before the area urbanized, Huckaby said. Outlying areas to the south and northwest, he said, have seen even more freezes.\n\nWe\u2019re not done with the cold just yet. A frigid front is expected to hit Dallas-Fort Worth sometime Sunday morning, with a winter weather advisory in effect from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Forecasts call for a fast dip in temperatures to the freezing mark, with a chance for freezing rain and sleet.\n\nNext up on the freeze-record chart is 1911-12 at No. 6 with 53.\n\nBut hey, at least we\u2019re not in Chicago, where up to six inches of snow could fall Saturday. The meteorological winter, according to the Chicago Tribune, was the third snowiest and third coldest for Chicagoans since 1871.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzAzL2RhbGxhcy1mb3J0LXdvcnRoLXNlZXMtbW9zdC1mcmVlemVzLWluLTMwLXllYXJzLTIwdGgtY29sZGVzdC13aW50ZXItb24tcmVjb3JkLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Andrew Scoggin", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Dallas-Fort Worth has had more freezes this winter than any other in the last 30 years, the National Weather Service said Friday.
