Both developed and emerging markets will increasingly adopt a home care model, as a result of different, yet equally relevant economic factors.\n\nHome care will become an increasingly important segment of global healthcare, driven by macroeconomic factors that are forcing an urgent need for greater efficiency by care providers. Home care practices will become a larger portion of standard care in both developed and emerging markets in the long term.\n\nHome Care To Drive Efficiency In Developed Markets\n\nChanges in healthcare are driven in part by socioeconomic factors, which threaten current practices but also serve to drive efficiencies. Ageing populations and the increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes are driving an increase in hospital admissions, which places further pressures on already resource-strained health systems. In addition, in US hospitals, patient admissions are rising due to the Affordable Care Act, which aims to provide health insurance to the majority of the US population.\n\nDiabetes is just one chronic illness that is over-burdening the US health system. The American Diabetes Association calculates that in 2012 (latest available data), 9.3% of the US population had diabetes (8.3% in 2011) and that the disease cost the US health system an estimated USD245bn. Additionally, 11.8mn people over the age of 65 were estimated to have diabetes in the US in 2012, equating to 25.9% of this patient population. As a result, BMI forecasts the burden of diabetes on the US health system to increase significantly over the long term, with the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost to the disease in those aged over 70 years estimated to rise from 532,641 in 2013 to 952,256 in 2030.\n\nChronic Diseases Put Pressure On US Health Care US Diabetes Burden Of Over 70s\n\nAdditionally, both developed and emerging regions face infrastructure problems. A lack of new health infrastructure places further strain on existing hospitals in the US, while in emerging regions, lack of infrastructure is apparent. However, health systems in emerging regions are investing heavily in infrastructure (for example, in July, the Chilean government unveiled plans to invest USD4bn into 61 new or existing hospitals over the next four years). Coversely, BMI's Infrastructure Key Projects Database lists only 14 healthcare infrastructure projects currently ongoing in the US. This lack of new resources to cater for rising patient demands means that hospitals must prioritise the care that they provide. Therefore, moving certain aspects of non-urgent care away from the hospital allows for the allocation of resources towards urgent care patients.\n\nMedical device and service manufacturers are recognising these resource constraints, and answering this need with innovations in home care. Technological advances mean that home care can be an effective and less costly healthcare delivery method than some current practices. For example, new minimally invasive techniques mean that surgeries and patient recovery times are shorter, equating earlier patient discharge times, which has a direct benefit on hospital resources. Once at home, further technological advances allow physicians to remotely monitor patients while they recover in their own home. Philips Healthcare is an innovator in this field; the company's telehealth services allow patients to monitor their vital statistics at home. Results are automatically sent to a website where they are monitored by the practitioner, who alerts the patient and care team when results fall outside pre-defined limits. This process is intended to improve clinical outcomes while reducing acute care hospitalisations.\n\nAs well as combating resource constraints, home care innovation is also driven by patient preference. A burgeoning desire by patients to proactively monitor and manage their health is facilitated by advances in home care, while also increasing patient convenience through the reduction of required hospital visits.\n\nBenefit Of Home Care In Emerging Regions\n\nWhile countries with developed health infrastructures face challenges that threaten to overburden the health system, emerging regions face challenges of their own, which can also directly benefit from home care services. In many emerging economies, as with developed markets, the demand for high quality healthcare is high, but hospitals require expansion and modernisation. Local governments are working to increase the availability and quality of care for their citizens; in June, the Kenyan government's Treasury Cabinet Secretary presented Kenya's KES1.8trn (USD20.57bn) budget for the 2014/2015 fiscal year, which began on July 1. For healthcare, a total of KES47.4bn (USD541mn) was allocated to the sector, focused on enhancing the quality and accessibility of healthcare services in the country. Therefore, we forecast healthcare spending to significantly increase in emerging markets, from USD1,877bn in 2013 to USD4,610bn in 2023.\n\nLaying Foundations For Improved Healthcare Healthcare Spending In Emerging Markets\n\nAs well as providing home care services in developed markets, Philips is also spearheading patient services in emerging regions with unmet healthcare needs. In March, the company began a pilot project in collaboration with Indonesian hospital group Bundamedik, the city government of Padang and the Indonesian Ministry of Health, to address the increasing concern of maternal mortality in the country. The one-year 'Mobile Obstetrical Monitoring' project will remotely monitor pregnant women for early high-risk identification via Philips' telehealth system. The Indonesian healthcare market is one of the least developed in Asia, with no comprehensive reimbursement coverage or private insurance schemes in place. There is a marked disparity in the standard of healthcare between rural and urban areas, and the market is characterised by a shortage of healthcare professionals.\n\nIndonesia, like many other developing nations with vast rural population profiles, can benefit significantly from innovations in telehealth. Philips has developed a prototype scalable telehealth platform that can be adapted to suit specific rural and urban needs, using a smartphone app. With this app, midwives can build a relevant health profile of pregnant women by collecting data from physical examinations and tests at local nursing clinics or even at the patient's home. This technology platform can be scaled to meet other healthcare needs, such as monitoring of patients with heart conditions or other chronic illnesses. Telehealth advances will be supported by increased uptake of 3G subscriptions in emerging regions, which we forecast to reach 2.14bn by 2018.\n\nOpportunity For Remote Care Growth Emerging Markets 3G Subscribers\n\nTelehealth, and subsequently home care, will also be favourably impacted by rapid growth in the telecoms sector of emerging markets. A number of emerging economies are investing heavily in telecoms infrastructure, and subsequently the use of smartphones in general populations is on the rise. With this infrastructure in place, medical device manufacturers can capitalise on these positive trends to meet currently unmet needs within healthcare.\n\nMeeting Global Health Delivery Needs\n\nHealth economics in both developed and emerging markets are set to drive growth in the home care sector, and medical device manufacturers can capitalise on growth opportunities. Philips is well positioned to capture growth in home care on a global scale, and we are likely to see the corporation's rival conglomerates follow suit. Siemens Healthcare, Toshiba Medical Systems and GE Healthcare have the resources to penetrate this currently unmet market opportunity, and are shifting their business models to place further emphasis on patient care services. However, BMI believes that smaller medical device developers will be key innovation drivers within the global home care sector. ResMed's Astral home life support ventilators; NxStage Medical's home haemodialysis system; and numerous developments in smartphone- and tablet-based health monitoring, will significantly aid home care advancements.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Home care will become an increasingly important segment of global healthcare, driven by the increasing engagement of consumers to proactively monitor and manage their health, and by pressures on global healthcare systems to deliver more efficient and affordable care.
