That means that in 2014, large employers will be nailing down their strategies for whether they will \u201cplay\u201d or \u201cpay.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmployers got this one-year reprieve, but in 2014 they absolutely need to decide whether it\u2019s in their best interests to offer the majority of their full-time employees affordable, minimum-value coverage, or pay the penalty for not doing so,\u201d says Julie Bunde, director of product management and product and market solutions at Bloomington-based HealthPartners.\n\nAccording to Greg Thurston, director of benefits at Edina-based Doherty Employer Services, more and more large employers are coming to the conclusion that continuing to offer health insurance under the ACA is a better option than paying the penalties.\n\nGreg Thurston of Doherty Employer Services Greg Thurston of Doherty Employer Services\n\nThurston cited data from the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans that found that the number of businesses that \u201cdefinitely will\u201d continue coverage for all full-time employees increased from 46 percent in 2012 to 69 percent in 2013. And for both years, a combined 4 percent of employers said they were unlikely to offer health insurance; the rest were at least \u201csomewhat likely\u201d to offer insurance.\n\nAnd Thurston believes that trend will continue into 2014 and beyond.\n\n\u201cEmployers have reviewed their situation and, if they are a large employer, they\u2019ve realized that the penalties are too great. They don\u2019t want to pay a non-deductible tax of $2,000 per employee,\u201d says Thurston. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re a small employer, even if you get rid of your plan in 2014, the reality is, some of your employees might not be eligible for subsidies, which means you\u2019re taking away a form of compensation from your employees, so they\u2019re still going to expect some sort of other increase to replace that.\u201d\n\nSmall employers won\u2019t be subject to \u201cplay or pay\u201d penalties, but they should monitor their headcounts through 2014, as it is next year\u2019s average full-time employee count that determines whether they\u2019re deemed a \u201clarge\u201d employer in 2015, and are thus subject to the penalties.\n\n\u201cSome employers might want to actively start managing that full-time employee number by hiring temps, or maybe more part-time employees,\u201d says Thurston.\n\nThere are three changes coming in 2014 that plans offered by employers of all sizes must abide by: no waiting periods in excess of 90 days, no pre-existing condition exclusions, and no annual dollar limits on essential health benefits\u2014which comprise 10 categories, ranging from emergency to mental health services. (If a company\u2019s current plan doesn\u2019t include these requisites, their carrier will apply the changes, which take effect January 1.)\n\nWhile many rules outlined above take effect January 1, another key date that employers are monitoring is March 31, when open enrollment closes on the new health exchanges.\n\nAccording to Thurston, new plan requirements, along with other changes introduced through the ACA, mean that it is essential for employers to have a clear and simple line of communication with employees in 2014\u2014particularly during open enrollment periods.\n\nJulie Bunde of HealthPartners Julie Bunde of HealthPartners\n\n\u201cPerhaps, as an employer, you\u2019ve had a significant rate increase after ACA. Well, employees are going to want to know why,\u201d explains Thurston. \u201cThey\u2019re hearing that Minnesota has low affordable rates, and that may be the case for a lot of employees, but the reality is that there are going to be some, with the community rates, where their premiums are going to go up, and maybe go up dramatically.\u201d\n\nAs a result of those premium increases, employers may need to increase deductibles or employees\u2019 out-of-pocket expenses, or move to a more limited network. And Thurston says the reasons for any of those changes need to be conveyed to employees to help address any worker confusion or frustration.\n\nFinally, proposed rules for reporting requirements\u2014which were just issued in September\u2014should be top of mind for large employers in 2014. The IRS will need to know which employees, if any, have been offered \"affordable\" coverage, and whether employers will need to pay any penalties for not offering coverage. Bunde says that because the proposed reporting rules just came out, employers are awaiting additional guidance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for businesses to understand that guidance will continue to come out and the law will change over time,\u201d says Bunde. \u201cSo employers just need to be prepared for more information coming out and potentially more changes throughout the next couple years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"document-title": "How Employers Should Prepare For 2014", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages02.net,tcbmag.com", "document-issearchable": "true", "document-description": "Health care experts say employers should be focused on communication with employees, monitoring headcounts, preparing for the \u201cplay or pay\u201d provision, and watching for more guidance on reporting requirements.", "og": {"url": "http://tcbmag.com/Industries/Health-Care/How-Employers-Should-Prepare-For-2014-And-Beyond/", "image": "http://tcbmag.com/CMSTemplates/TCB/Images/fb-twin-cities-business.png", "type": "article", "description": "Minnesota\u2019s leading provider of business news, insight, and analysis through a monthly magazine, twice-weekly e-newsletter, daily online news stories, events, and an annual business information guide.", "title": "How Employers Should Prepare For 2014"}, "document-image": "4bcb47d2-e3dc-469b-9bd3-25c500b97f5e", "fb": {"app_id": 385902024814671}, "keywords": "preparing for 2014, health care reform 2014, aca in 2014, planning for 2014, health care reform, greg thurston, how businesses prepare for health care reform, 2014 planning", "document-date": "11/20/2013 10:03:09 AM"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafde\"", "article_summary": "Finally, proposed rules for reporting requirements\u2014which were just issued in September\u2014should be top of mind for large employers in 2014.\n\u201cEmployers have reviewed their situation and, if they are a large employer, they\u2019ve realized that the penalties are too great.\n\u201cSo employers just need to be prepared for more information coming out and potentially more changes throughout the next couple years.\u201d\n\u201cSome employers might want to actively start managing that full-time employee number by hiring temps, or maybe more part-time employees,\u201d says Thurston.\nBunde says that because the proposed reporting rules just came out, employers are awaiting additional guidance."}
