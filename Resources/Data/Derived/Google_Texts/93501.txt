Healthcare costs and a lack of money top the list of Americans' financial problems, according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday.

Fourteen percent of adults named healthcare costs and a similar percentage picked low wages as the worst financial problems they face. Healthcare costs returned to the top of the list for the first time since ObamaCare was signed into law in 2010, Gallup said. .

Nine percent of adults said too much debt or not having enough money to pay off their debts is their most important financial issue.

Only 6 percent of people now say the high cost of living or inflation is their top problem, which is down from 13 percent in 2011.

Five percent said unemployment is their top problem, Gallup found. Two percent named Social Security as their top problem. Only 1 percent said the state of the economy or controlling spending is their main financial issue.

People earning $75,000 or more annually said healthcare costs, college expenses and retirement savings are their top problems.

The poll surveyed 804 adults between Jan. 5 and 8 with a 4 percentage point margin of error.
