DUBLIN, Nov. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/dz5lm9/us_market_for) has announced the addition of the "US Market for Point of Care Diagnostic Devices - 2016 (Forecasted to 2022)" report to their offering.

In 2015 Abbott Diagnostics pulled out ahead as the market leader overall, but was very closely followed by Roche Diagnostics. However, many other companies have an impact in this market including Alfa Wassermann, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory, Radiometer, Carolina Liquid Chemistry and Elitech Group to name a few.

The market for point-of-care (POC) testing includes clinical chemistry, blood gas, urinalysis and blood glucose segments. Analyzers for this market come in the form of either handheld instruments or compact benchtop systems that are placed in critical care units of hospitals or in POLs and individual clinics. Reagents are available in the form of cartridges, test strips or discs.



The implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and its emphasis on preventative and outcomes-based health care will provide an impetus to POC testing, because the immediate availability of results during patient visits enables physicians and other health care providers to deliver appropriate and timely care for patients, thereby reducing delays and avoiding redundancies.



Further, as the individual physician clinics continue to consolidate to form group practice networks and as awareness grows about the long term cost-savings of in-house testing vis-a-vis outsourcing to reference labs, the unit sales of POC analyzers and reagents is expected to see a steady growth.
