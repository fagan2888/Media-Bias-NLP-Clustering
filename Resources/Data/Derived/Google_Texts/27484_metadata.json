Most companies will be allowed to raise rates, but by less than they originally requested.\n\nOne company, ConnectiCare Benefits \u2013 which sells plans through the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, Access Health CT \u2013 must lower its rates an average of 1.3 percent, while insurer HealthyCT was directed to raise its rates by more than the company sought after the insurance department determined its proposed rates were inadequate.\n\nConnectiCare sells plans through three separately licensed companies, each of which has a separate risk pool and rate request.\n\nThe weighted average rate change among individual market plans \u2013 based on the market share of each company \u2013 is an overall 3.5 percent increase.\n\nThe extent to which an individual customer\u2019s premium changes next year will be based on the person\u2019s specific plan and whether he or she receives federal subsidies to discount the cost of coverage. For those who get subsidies, the approved rate changes won\u2019t translate directly into premium changes.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/08/anthem-individual-rates-to-rise-2-4-percent-connecticares-by-8-5-percent/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, 2016 insurance rates, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, connecticare, Golden Rule, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/08/anthem-individual-rates-to-rise-2-4-percent-connecticares-by-8-5-percent/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Premiums for the 55,000 people who buy Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield health plans through the state\u2019s individual market will rise by an average of 2.4 percent next year, while ConnectiCare Insurance Company\u2019s 34,400 customers will see an average rate hike of 8.5 percent.", "title": "Anthem individual rates to rise 2.4%, ConnectiCare\u2019s by 8.5%", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/08/anthem-individual-rates-to-rise-2-4-percent-connecticares-by-8-5-percent/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/09/anthem-connecticare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/09/08/anthem-individual-rates-to-rise-2-4-percent-connecticares-by-8-5-percent/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe40b6\"", "article_summary": "The weighted average rate change among individual market plans \u2013 based on the market share of each company \u2013 is an overall 3.5 percent increase.\nFor those who get subsidies, the approved rate changes won\u2019t translate directly into premium changes.\nBoth companies sought higher increases, but the Connecticut Insurance Department deemed their proposed rates excessive and required the companies to revise their proposals.\nMost companies will be allowed to raise rates, but by less than they originally requested.\nOther rate changes for 2016 individual-market plans \u2013 which cover about 167,000 people in the state \u2013 were finalized last month."}
