The impact pushed the car about 100 feet down the freeway, he said.\n\n\u201cFor some reason the woman of the stalled vehicle had gotten out of her vehicle was standing or walking on the freeway and was struck four or more times,\u201d Graves said.\n\nThe woman's body was found about 300 feet from her vehicle, DPS said.\n\nAll of the vehicles who hit the woman stopped. The drivers were being interviewed by troopers.\n\n\"We don\u2019t know if the woman thought she was on the shoulder or why she stopped her car in the middle of the freeway,\" Graves said.\n\nTroopers said impairment is not suspected on the part of these drivers.\n\nGraves said it\u2019s possible more than four vehicles hit the woman.\n\n\u201cOfficers have determined that the driver of the stalled car was the single occupant of the car,\u201d Graves said.\n\nNo one else was injured.\n\nEarly on, Graves alerted his twitter followers with this message:\n\nWestbound 101 closed due to car pedestrian fatal collision# pic.twitter.com/33pA3HWMkn \u2014 Bart Graves, PIO (@dps_pio_graves) December 19, 2015\n\n\"We would recommend people avoid Loop 101 in the area of Tatum.
