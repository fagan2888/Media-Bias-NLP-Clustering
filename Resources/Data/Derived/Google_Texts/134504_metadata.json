The real culprits are the five Bible-thumping conservatives on the Supreme Court. They inspired this controversy with their inflammatory decision last year in the Hobby Lobby case. Ad Policy\n\nThe Supreme justices ruled then that corporate owners possess religious convictions entitled to First Amendment protection against intrusions by the federal government. That case was about birth control and Obamacare\u2019s mandated healthcare coverage. But the Court\u2019s half-baked logic excited the imagination of right-wing activists and lawyers.\n\nIf employers can reject the birth-control pills for their employees by citing their religious objections to contraception, do employers also have a right to refuse serving gay couples because they abhor same-sex marriages? Conservatives set out to initiate state laws and law suits designed to provoke more constitutional conflicts between church and state\u2014cases that can wind up before the Supreme Court and will be decided by the same right-wing majority that issued the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\nHowever, one citizen\u2019s religious convictions may look like old-fashioned bigotry to other citizens who suffer the consequences. Alex Luchenitser of Americans United for Separation of Church and State wonders if the Supreme Court has opened the door to \u201ca new era of inequality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHobby Lobby,\u201d he wrote in the Harvard Law and Policy Review, \u201cis a sweeping decision that threatens to turn the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) into a law that, instead of protecting religious freedom, allows religious believers to force their faith on others in a variety of ways.\u201d\n\nBefore the recent uproar occurred, Luchenitser had predicted it. Hobby Lobby\u201cmay trigger a drastic uptick in claims for religious exemptions,\u201d he said, though plaintiffs in the most publicized cases (like the photographer who refused to do wedding pictures for a gay couple) have so far lost in court.\n\nThe Hobby Lobbydecision \u201cmay particularly impact LGBT cases,\u201c he explained. Because there is no federal law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT citizens, so most of the new cases will originate at the state level under state laws. Complaints that gain traction can eventually wind up in federal courts.\n\nPresident Obama, for example, issued an executive order telling federal contractors they must not discriminate against gays and lesbians. \u201cIt will not be surprising if religiously affiliated federal contractors rely on Hobby Lobby to argue for an exemption to the prohibition against anti-LGBT discrimination,\u201d Luchenitser wrote.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hobby_lobby_protest_bible_ap_img_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "William Greider", "description": "SCOTUS' reckless Hobby Lobby decision has excited the imagination of the right wing.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "SCOTUS' reckless Hobby Lobby decision has excited the imagination of the right wing.", "title": "Theocracy Versus Democracy", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/theocracy-versus-democracy/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hobby_lobby_protest_bible_ap_img_0.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1100}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T11:09:27+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "SCOTUS' reckless Hobby Lobby decision has excited the imagination of the right wing.", "title": "Theocracy Versus Democracy", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/theocracy-versus-democracy/", "image": {"height": 1100, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hobby_lobby_protest_bible_ap_img_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hobby_lobby_protest_bible_ap_img_0-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "April 3rd, 2015", "sailthru.title": "Theocracy Versus Democracy", "keywords": "the nation, william greider, scotus, hobby lobby, obama, lgbt, religion, christianity, indiana", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 117294, "sailthru.tags": "Gender and Sexuality,Religion,Supreme Court,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "indiana", "published_time": "2015-04-03T17:50:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T11:09:27+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/cdelbyck/"}, "sailthru.description": "How the reckless Hobby Lobby\u00a0decision has excited the imagination of the right wing.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hobby_lobby_protest_bible_ap_img_0-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They inspired this controversy with their inflammatory decision last year in the Hobby Lobby case.\nHowever, one citizen\u2019s religious convictions may look like old-fashioned bigotry to other citizens who suffer the consequences.\nThe real culprits are the five Bible-thumping conservatives on the Supreme Court.\nBecause there is no federal law prohibiting discrimination against LGBT citizens, so most of the new cases will originate at the state level under state laws.\n\u201cIt will not be surprising if religiously affiliated federal contractors rely on Hobby Lobby to argue for an exemption to the prohibition against anti-LGBT discrimination,\u201d Luchenitser wrote."}
