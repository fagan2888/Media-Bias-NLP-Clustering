Mercer, professor and associate dean of the UNLV School of Allied Health Sciences. \u201cI see wellness types of careers as very viable and resistant to economy change.\u201d\n\nJob possibilities for those with kinesiology degrees can include recreation administrators, fitness instructors, massage therapists, personal trainers and physical therapy technicians. The number of full- and part-time students in the program went from 544 in 2005 to 1,002 in 2015, Mercer said. He has seen a similar trend at higher-education institutions across the country.\n\nOne reason might be aging baby boomers, said Mercer, while another likely is the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nShawn Gerstenberger, dean of the UNLV School of Community Health Sciences, agreed. He co-authored a 2014 report titled \u201cEmployment and Economic Development in Southern Nevada,\u201d which detailed industries in the area that grew during the recession. He said it showed that, through the recession, health care jobs continued to increase steadily even during the worst economic times in the last 15 years.\n\nThat increase is expected to continue. In the valley, other anticipated fast-growing occupations, charted from 2012-20, include construction laborer jobs, expected to increase 25.1 percent. That\u2019s in contrast with when the economy lagged, and fewer and fewer houses were being constructed in Las Vegas, causing enrollment in UNLV\u2019s construction management program to decline, said Carl Reiber, senior vice provost.\n\n\u201cWhen the economy started to go south, those jobs started to disappear,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the economy is starting to heat back up again, that program is now expanding.\u201d\n\nTIME FOR A CHANGE\n\nResidents who work in industries where jobs are waning or who are otherwise unhappy with their current professions often seek another line of work, according to local job coaches. American job satisfaction has ranged between about 42.6 percent and 48.3 percent annually from 2008-14, according to The Conference Board\u2019s \u201cJob Satisfaction: 2015 Edition: A Lot More Jobs \u2014 A Little More Satisfaction.\u201d\n\nEither way, those who make a career switch must be well-prepared, job coaches say.\n\n\u201cOne of the main things when people are changing a career is to not look for another job in another field without some intense introspection,\u201d said PJ Sheldon, a local career coach and author of \u201cYou\u2019re Hired!\u201d and \u201cCareer Strategies for Success.\u201d\n\nSheldon often conducts career workshops at the Green Valley Library in Henderson. She said people changing careers must be prepared to start at the bottom in their new profession.\n\n\u201cBecause you most likely are not going to have any working experience in this new field, you need to have the mindset that you may need to spend money and time to learn new skills,\u201d she said.\n\nThat may involve going back to school, according to Denise Cook, president of THI Counseling, a Las Vegas career consulting firm. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the skills or the knowledge they need, they need to make the determination \u2026 is school something that will add value to their future career prospects?\u201d\n\nAn evaluation of prior personal and work experiences can help determine a future career path, Cook said.\n\n\u201cWhat they want to do \u2026 is find things they did in the past that they loved to do,\u201d she said, \u201cand then also think of those things that they really hated doing. Make a list of those things, and map it out. Then they need to take an assessment in the market in which they reside and look at the jobs available presently and in the near future.\u201d\n\nCook also suggested doing volunteer work, which can help job-seekers build relationships with potential employers and also enable them to take the skills they learn elsewhere. Networking and spreading the word about being on the job market also helps, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat you know is important, but Las Vegas is a market about who you know,\u201d Cook said. \u201cWho you know can make or break employment prospects for you.\u201d\n\nSheldon said that once job-seekers gain employment in their new professions, they need to be prepared to stay put for at least a year.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give up,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cStick it out for at least a year, and you\u2019ll find the longer you\u2019re in it, the easier it gets, and it may lead to something better.\u201d\n\nTIME SPENT IN UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASES WITH AGE\n\nSwitching careers or otherwise, time spent in unemployment increases with age, according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. Numbers nationally from January 2016, for instance, show that the average duration of unemployment climbs from 19.7 weeks for ages 20 to 24 to 37.4 weeks for those 65 or older. Those who are ages 45 to 54 spend an average duration of 37.4 weeks out of work.\n\nStill, regaining employment often is up to the job-seeker, regardless of age, Sheldon said.\n\n\u201cWhat I tell people is that age is only a number, so you need to act and dress as a go-getter and not a has-been,\u201d she said. \u201cThen they (older job-seekers) need to make sure they know the latest trends, procedures, practices and skills for their field of work. Then it\u2019s critical to show enthusiasm during the interview and after you\u2019re hired. It\u2019s all in how you carry yourself.\u201d\n\nOlder job-seekers should show that they are open to learning new skills and that they are comfortable with technology, Cook added.\n\nValley resident Vahan Tafralian, 67, has experienced many ups and downs in the field of sales and marketing since the 1970s. He agreed that attitude and willingness to learn goes a long way in regaining employment.\n\n\u201cYou have to have goals; you have to be proactive and listen to every message in your environment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in class until you graduate, and you graduate when you get the job. You\u2019re being forced to grow. The problem that I\u2019ve seen with people is, they don\u2019t want to reinvent themselves. Ninety percent of reinventing yourself is your attitude, your spirit.\u201d\n\nCook said her firm has been seeing younger workers, or millennials, \u201ccompletely going against what they decided to major in at college. They realize they don\u2019t get any intrinsic satisfaction out of those careers.\n\n\u201cWith millennials, it\u2019s a specific type of company culture they\u2019re looking for. They want significant community impact. They want to work with companies that care about the communities where they live \u2014 not only nonprofits. Millennials are attracted to employers that give back to the community.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the firm\u2019s older clients tend to be more concerned with stability and income, she said.\n\nWHERE TO GET HELP\n\nBoth younger and older residents who are seeking employment can turn to a number of local agencies that offer assistance, such as career coaching, job training and help with polishing resumes and interview strategies.\n\nPlaces to look for assistance include AARP Nevada, 5820 S. Eastern Ave. Suite 190; Workforce Connections\u2019 One Stop Career Center, 6330 W Charleston Blvd., Suite 190; and Nevada JobConnect, with locations at 3405 S. Maryland Parkway, 4500 E. Sunset Road, Suite 40, and 2827 Las Vegas Blvd. North.\n\nCook also suggests visiting Edx.org for those who are unable to go back to a traditional school due to scheduling conflicts or other commitments. The site offers online classes, some free.", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/neon-rebirth/the-right-track-shifting-career-paths-after-the-recession", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2172471"}, "author": "CASSANDRA KEENAN VIEW STAFF WRITER", "parsely-title": "On the right track: Shifting career paths after the recession", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "twitter": {"description": "Switching career paths might be a way to weather ups and downs in the job market, but those in the health sciences field seem to be able to stay put.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/neon-rebirth/the-right-track-shifting-career-paths-after-the-recession", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_1004658765-REINVENTION_0-24_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_VIEW-PREMIUM-16-web_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_VIEW-PREMIUM-15-web_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_1004658765-REINVENTION_0-23_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_1004658765-REINVENTION_0-14_0.jpg"}, "title": "On the right track: Shifting career paths after the recession", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=5900744", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=5900744", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_1004658765-REINVENTION_0-24_0.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Switching career paths might be a way to weather ups and downs in the job market, but those in the health sciences field seem to be able to stay put.", "title": "On the right track: Shifting career paths after the recession", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/neon-rebirth/the-right-track-shifting-career-paths-after-the-recession", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_1004658765-REINVENTION_0-24_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "CASSANDRA KEENAN VIEW STAFF WRITER", "parsely-section": "Neon Rebirth", "keywords": "Neon Rebirth,Neon Rebirth, Business,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-27T00:11:04-07:00"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2016-03-27T07:11:04Z", "parsely-tags": "Neon Rebirth,Neon Rebirth,Business", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "Switching career paths might be a way to weather ups and downs in the job market, but those in the health sciences field seem to be able to stay put."}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s something UNLV officials say they have witnessed for years, particularly with students enrolled in the kinesiology degree program, which prepares them for health sciences careers.\nSwitching career paths might be a way to weather ups and downs in the job market, but those in the health sciences field seem to be able to stay put.\nShawn Gerstenberger, dean of the UNLV School of Community Health Sciences, agreed.\nHe said it showed that, through the recession, health care jobs continued to increase steadily even during the worst economic times in the last 15 years.\nThat may involve going back to school, according to Denise Cook, president of THI Counseling, a Las Vegas career consulting firm."}
