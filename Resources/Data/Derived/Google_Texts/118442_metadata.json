Not in 2016 MORE, arguing that his policies hurt U.S. workers.\n\nAFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Trump is full of \u201cbaloney and bluster\u201d and has shown through his actions that he is an anti-union candidate who won't lend a hand to struggling workers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe is also a bigot,\u201d Trumka said in remarks to the Plasterers and Cement Workers union.\n\n\u201cFrom his anti-American proposal to ban Muslims to his horrendous comments about women and immigrants, Trump is running on hate,\" he said.\n\n\"It seems the only group he won\u2019t criticize is the KKK.\u201d\n\nTrumka has knocked the GOP field in the past but hadn't singled out Trump.\n\nTrumka again criticized Republican candidates for using \u201csome of the ugliest, most racist and destructive language I have heard in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, he said the Democratic candidates are having a \"substantive and vigorous debate about how best to raise wages.\"\n\nThe AFL-CIO has yet to endorse either Democratic candidate.\n\nWhile Trumka acknowledged the New York businessman is tapping into the anger of working people, he has no clear path to raising wages or otherwise helping American workers.\n\n\"When you look close, it\u2019s just hot air,\" Trumka.\n\nHe noted that Trump has said U.S. wages are already too high and that he backs \"right to work\" policies that prohibit labor contracts from requiring workers to join a union or pay dues.\n\nLast month, Trump said right to work is \"better for the people\" because it gives workers and businesses the choice of whether to support unions.\n\nTrumka also knocked Trump for providing financial support to Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a former GOP presidential hopeful who waged a fight against labor unions in his state.\n\nHe also noted that Trump is fighting union workers at his hotel in Las Vegas over negotiating a new contract.\n\n\u201cWe must come together to elect a president who will raise wages so working people can build better lives,\u201d Trumka said during his speech.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Donald Trump is full of \u201cbaloney and bluster.\"", "description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Donald Trump is full of \u201cbaloney and bluster.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Donald Trump is full of \u201cbaloney and bluster.\"", "title": "Union leader Trumka calls Trump 'a bigot'", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/271669-afl-cios-trumka-calls-trump-a-bigot", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/richardtrumka_051215gn1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-03T15:42:19-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-03T15:42-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/271669-afl-cios-trumka-calls-trump-a-bigot", "dcterms.date": "2016-03-03T14:59-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Richard Trumka, AFL\u2013CIO,Donald Trump,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-03T14:59:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-03T15:42:19-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/271669-afl-cios-trumka-calls-trump-a-bigot", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said Donald Trump is full of \u201cbaloney and bluster.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Union leader Trumka calls Trump 'a bigot'"}, "dcterms.title": "Union leader Trumka calls Trump 'a bigot'"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENT\u201cHe is also a bigot,\u201d Trumka said in remarks to the Plasterers and Cement Workers union.\nHe also noted that Trump is fighting union workers at his hotel in Las Vegas over negotiating a new contract.\nA top labor union leader on Thursday leveled harsh criticism against Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald TrumpWhy superdelegates shouldn't support Sanders Young Turks host offers million for Trump, Sanders debate An all-female ticket?\n\u201cWe must come together to elect a president who will raise wages so working people can build better lives,\u201d Trumka said during his speech.\nTrumka also knocked Trump for providing financial support to Wisconsin Gov."}
