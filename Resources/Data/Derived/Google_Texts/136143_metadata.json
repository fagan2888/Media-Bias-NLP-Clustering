The boys and girls also learn words from the local Arawak language, which was in part rebuilt with help from linguists, and still exists in varying forms among other native groups in the hemisphere.\n\nNow, a group of academics and educators hope to expand the Taino education program to other public schools around the U.S. territory in an effort to teach children this little known part of the territory\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know your roots, you don\u2019t know yourself,\u201d said anthropologist Carlalynne Yarey Melendez, director of the Taino cultural organization that runs the educational program. \u201cThere are so many communities and schools that want the classes, but I can\u2019t keep up with the demand.\u201d\n\nPuerto Ricans\u2019 interest in the territory\u2019s indigenous past has grown in recent years, with 42,000 of the 3.7 million people then living on the island identifying themselves as at least partially Taino in the 2010 Census.\n\nBut even though that\u2019s just a little more than 1 percent, Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature is considering a proposal to declare Melendez\u2019s Naguake organization to be the island\u2019s first indigenous-based community. The designation would allow it to receive federal funds under a program that aids native groups, and expand the program to other towns.\n\n\u201cAs one of our elders said at one time, \u2018Just as they wrote us off the books, we will write ourselves back in,'\u201d said Tai Pelli, a liaison officer for the New York-based United Confederation of Taino People.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Puerto Rico, a push to revive indigenous culture", "title": "In Puerto Rico, a push to revive indigenous culture", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In Puerto Rico, a push to revive indigenous culture", "title": "In Puerto Rico, a push to revive indigenous culture", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/20/in_puerto_rico_a_push_to_revive_indigenous_culture/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/puerto-rico-taino-heritage.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Puerto Rico, a push to revive indigenous culture", "title": "In Puerto Rico, a push to revive indigenous culture", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/puerto-rico-taino-heritage.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Danica Coto", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But even though that\u2019s just a little more than 1 percent, Puerto Rico\u2019s legislature is considering a proposal to declare Melendez\u2019s Naguake organization to be the island\u2019s first indigenous-based community.\nThe designation would allow it to receive federal funds under a program that aids native groups, and expand the program to other towns.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSAN LORENZO, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 In Puerto Rico\u2019s misty, bamboo-studded mountains, elementary school students are studying a nearly extinct language, beating on drums and growing native crops like cassava and sweet potato as they learn about the indigenous people who lived on the island before Christopher Columbus.\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t know your roots, you don\u2019t know yourself,\u201d said anthropologist Carlalynne Yarey Melendez, director of the Taino cultural organization that runs the educational program.\nThe children in four towns in the island\u2019s southeast corner play a ceremonial ball game that was called batey by the native Tainos, who were all but wiped out during colonial times."}
