John Kasich (R-OH) said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) does not have the experience necessary to be president of the United States.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nJon Karl asked, \u201cLet me ask you over the weekend, we saw this article in The New York Times saying that Hillary Clinton\u2019s folks fear that Marco Rubio would be their toughest competition, because it would represent a generation clash, the past and the future. You were there in the \u201990s, if that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t you kind of represent the past here?\u201d\n\nKasich answered, \u201cYou know, what we need is for in a president is somebody who has deep experience, knowledge of foreign affairs and the ability to be an executive, to made decisions and have a bottom line. Look, I love Marco Rubio, terrific guy. You know they\u2019re all out there plugging away and doing a good job. But at the end of the day, we need someone who has deep experience, executive experience, made decisions where there is a bottom line, who has a deep knowledge of foreign affairs. It\u2019s pretty clear that America\u2019s position in the world is being questioned. And all of this business about young and old, Ronald Reagan was an older dude and I think he did pretty well because he had the experience and that is what really matters when you are talking about president of the Untied States.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kasich Slams Rubio for Lack of Experience", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kasich Slams Rubio for Lack of Experience", "title": "Kasich Criticizes Rubio for Lack of Experience - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Kasich.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/24/kasich-criticizes-rubio-for-lack-of-experience/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kasich Slams Rubio for Lack of Experience", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/Kasich.jpg", "title": "Kasich Criticizes Rubio for Lack of Experience - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "John Kasich, Marco Rubio,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Gov Kasich", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Marco Rubio", "published_time": "2015-05-24T08:01:05-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "John Kasich (R-OH) said Sen.
