Legislators finally got a crack at some of the major contractors who worked on Healthcare.gov, the federal government\u2019s troubled online health insurance marketplace, during a long hearing. And the contractors were quick to point the finger right back at the government. One thing everyone agrees on is that the healthcare exchanges are a mess. The larger question is who\u2019s responsible?\n\nIn the world of complex government contracts, overseeing an effort the size of the Obamacare often falls to what's known as a lead systems integrator. Think of a general contractor on a house -- managing the painters, plumbers and electricians. In the case of Healthcare.gov, it was a very complicated house with some 55 contractors.\n\n\u201cIt appears that, in this particular case, the Obamacare case, the notion was we\u2019re going to do the contract integration in-house,\u201d says Paul Light, professor of public service at New York University.\n\nBy in-house, he means at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cI am hearing repeatedly and repeatedly that this, the bottom line here is, CMS is responsible for this failure,\u201d Rep. Renee Ellmers, Republican from North Carolina, said at today\u2019s hearing.\n\nThere have been lots of questions about why the government didn\u2019t bring in some A-List integration firm to begin with. That used to happen, says Stan Soloway, who represents government contractors at the Professional Services Council. Then came Deepwater, in the early 2000s. The massive Coast Guard modernization program was initially overseen by private firms.\n\n\u201cIt was not terribly successful, and a lot of people have pointed to the use of the lead systems integrator as the root cause of the problem,\u201d says Soloway, although he says that\u2019s not clear.\n\nBut if the government wants that job?\n\n\u201cThe first thing they\u2019re going to need to do is buy some more people,\u201d says Trevor Brown, who teaches public affairs at the Ohio State University. \u201cThey\u2019re going to need to recruit, hire, train and retain systems engineers, program managers, integrators to perform these functions.\u201d\n\nAnd Brown says competing for those talented folks has become harder. Not only can they make a lot more in the private sector -- they don\u2019t have to worry about shutdowns and furloughs.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2013/10/24/health-care/obamacare-what-we-have-here-failure-integrate", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/boehnerobamacare.jpg?itok=mGwoeAM3", "type": "article", "description": "After problems with the Coast Guard's massive Deepwater acquisition program, the federal government has moved away from hiring outside systems integrators, opting to coordinate big projects in-house.", "title": "Obamacare: What we have here is a failure to integrate"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "oBG/UkC28xjqTYd+M2n7b7xzDBD8izNvqmS/KrxQ/XjHFVYWwWvGlNYE61Dp1LkdfgxxPvKHj2GJCrnmexhJ2A==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1bae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe first thing they\u2019re going to need to do is buy some more people,\u201d says Trevor Brown, who teaches public affairs at the Ohio State University.\n\u201cI am hearing repeatedly and repeatedly that this, the bottom line here is, CMS is responsible for this failure,\u201d Rep.
