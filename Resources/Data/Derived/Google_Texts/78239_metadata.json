Like last year, Obama framed the issue in terms of energy independence. In 2013 he urged Congress to put aside politics and craft bipartisan solutions while warning that if they did not, \u201cI will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\u201d\n\nRELATED: State of the Union: Obama Vows to Step Up on Climate Change if Congress Doesn't\n\nIn the intervening year, Obama has laid out a climate-change plan, tightened coal-plant emissions regulations complete with deadline, and created a federal-state task force that must come up with adaptation strategies.\n\nRELATED: Obama Taps Tribes to Assist in Adapting to Climate Change\n\nThis year, Obama focused on his administration\u2019s accomplishments in his discussion of climate change.\n\n\u201cTaken together, our energy policy is creating jobs and leading to a cleaner, safer planet,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOver the past eight years, the United States has reduced our total carbon pollution more than any other nation on Earth. But we have to act with more urgency\u2014because a changing climate is already harming western communities struggling with drought, and coastal cities dealing with floods.\u201d\n\nRELATED: California Governor Declares Drought Emergency\n\nObama went on to say that cleaning up our energy act \u201cwon\u2019t happen overnight\u201d and \u201cwill require tough choices.\u201d He made it clear that the question was not whether his administration addresses climate change, but how, and highlighted the new standards for coal plant carbon emissions that his administration has set. He also touched on the increasing use of solar power in the U.S. and the need to invest in sustainable energy in general, the underlying assumption being that climate change is a given.\n\n\u201cThe debate is settled,\u201d Obama said. \u201cClimate change is a fact. And when our children\u2019s children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world, with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say yes, we did.\u201d\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline was not mentioned, but as PRI\u2019s The World pointed out, that was most likely because the decision at this point is entirely up to Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nOverall, Obama emphasized executive orders as a way to get things done in the absence of cooperation from Congress. That came into play in the environmental realm with his promise to balance job growth with conservation and to move away from oil and more toward natural gas as a \"bridge\" between fossil fuels and renewable energy such as solar.\n\n\u201cMy administration will keep working with the [natural gas] industry to sustain production and job growth while strengthening protection of our air, our water, and our communities,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd while we\u2019re at it, I\u2019ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.\u201d\n\nRELATED: President Obama\u2019s 2014 State of the Union Address", "article_metadata": {"description": "Climate change adaptation was the subtext of President Barack Obama\u2019s references to environmental issues in his State of the Union speech on January 28, woven into talk ofPresident Barack Obama gave passing mention to climate change in his State of the Union address.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/29/climate-change-gets-passing-mention-state-union-address-153314", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/obama_climate_speech_2013-ap_photocharles_dharapak.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Climate Change Gets Passing Mention in State of the Union Address"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-29T10:30-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Climate Change Gets Passing Mention in State of the Union Address"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/29/climate-change-gets-passing-mention-state-union-address-153314", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "State of the Union, Climate Change, Global Warming, President Barack Obama", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Climate Change Gets Passing Mention in State of the Union Address"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9e8\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Obama Taps Tribes to Assist in Adapting to Climate ChangeThis year, Obama focused on his administration\u2019s accomplishments in his discussion of climate change.\nClimate change took up seven paragraphs in last year\u2019s State of the Union address, as Public Radio International\u2019s The World noted, but got barely a passing mention this year, with no new proposals put forth.\n\u201cClimate change is a fact.\n\u201cAnd while we\u2019re at it, I\u2019ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.\u201dRELATED: President Obama\u2019s 2014 State of the Union Address\nHe also touched on the increasing use of solar power in the U.S. and the need to invest in sustainable energy in general, the underlying assumption being that climate change is a given."}
