The efforts are judged in 10 categories, with a winner announced later in the week, laying claim to nothing more than a year\u2019s worth of bragging rights.\n\nThe enormous effort is largely made by Rio\u2019s poorest citizens \u2014 the samba schools are mostly located in impoverished neighborhoods, and armies of volunteers from nearby slums spend nine months or more sewing, sweating practicing the samba songs and dance moves, all for an 80-minute presentation before well-imbibed spectators.\n\n\u201cSamba is the root that binds Brazilian culture,\u201d said Nanny Kammura, a 35-year-old kindergarten teacher and mother who transforms into a \u201cpassista\u201d samba dance specialist for the Mocidade school when the big party rolls around each year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here honoring that culture, our roots. It\u2019s ours, it\u2019s Brazilian,\u201d she said just before her school began its parade, during which she wore an enormous green feather headdress and minuscule sequined silver top and bikini bottom. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a party. But it\u2019s also us honoring our history and ensuring that samba will never die.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazil keeps up Carnival pace of parties, parades", "title": "Brazil keeps up Carnival pace of parties, parades", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Brazil keeps up Carnival pace of parties, parades", "title": "Brazil keeps up Carnival pace of parties, parades", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/04/brazil_keeps_up_carnival_pace_of_parties_parades/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/brazil-carnival.jpeg14-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brazil keeps up Carnival pace of parties, parades", "title": "Brazil keeps up Carnival pace of parties, parades", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/brazil-carnival.jpeg14-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bradley Brooks", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The annual spectacle pits the city\u2019s 12 best samba schools against one another in ornate parades that include over 2,500 participants each and cost more than $3 million to produce.\nIt\u2019s ours, it\u2019s Brazilian,\u201d she said just before her school began its parade, during which she wore an enormous green feather headdress and minuscule sequined silver top and bikini bottom.\nBut it\u2019s also us honoring our history and ensuring that samba will never die.\u201d\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Extraterrestrial toucan birds, neon green spacemen waving Brazilian flags and legions of scantily clad women and men dancing a furious samba opened the final round of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s extravagant Carnival parades Monday night.\nThe efforts are judged in 10 categories, with a winner announced later in the week, laying claim to nothing more than a year\u2019s worth of bragging rights."}
