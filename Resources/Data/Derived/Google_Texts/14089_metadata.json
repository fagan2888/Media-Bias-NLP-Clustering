After Schofield allowed pressure that led to quarterback Brock Osweiler\u2019s second interception, Tyler Polumbus came in for Schofield for the rest of the game.\n\n\u201cWe play this game because we want to play football, and I haven\u2019t been playing football for a while,\u201d Polumbus said. \u201cIt was fun. I was fired up. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a knock on Mike. I certainly enjoyed the opportunity.\u201d\n\nDeMarcus Ware injured.\n\nBroncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware had his first sack since Nov. 8 but couldn\u2019t finish the game. He left with a left knee injury. Ware missed five games this season with a structural issue in his back. Teammates believe Ware should be in position to play in the postseason, benefiting, like safety Darian Stewart (hamstring), from the bye week.\n\nDarian Stewart aggravates hamstring injury.\n\nSafety Darian Stewart reinjured his hamstring breaking up a pass intended for San Diego Chargers tight end Antonio Gates in the first quarter. Stewart was visibly upset, throwing his helmet off in frustration before walking to the bench. He was listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d to return but never did after being downgraded to \u201cout\u201d early in the third quarter.\n\nAfter the game Stewart, said he thought he was 100 percent leading up to the game, but hamstrings are notoriously tricky injuries to recover from.\n\n\u201cI was scared for a minute,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI have two weeks to recover, so I\u2019ll be back then. I have strength in it. It\u2019s just something I have to keep an eye on.\u201d\n\nStewart practiced in full the week leading up to Sunday\u2019s game after missing the Broncos\u2019 Dec. 20 loss at Pittsburgh because of the injury.\n\nLimited linebacker.\n\nBrandon Marshall started Sunday after suffering a sprained right ankle against Cincinnati, but he didn\u2019t stay in the game long. Marshall saw a few snaps in the first quarter but did not get any game action after that.\n\n\u201cIt just wasn\u2019t right. I knew if I continued to play, I would hurt the team,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nTodd Davis got the bulk of snaps in Marshall\u2019s place. Marshall said he plans to be ready to play after the bye week.\n\nGary Kubiak\u2019s historic W.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 victory gave coach Gary Kubiak a spot in the team\u2019s history books.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 12 victories this season tied him with Red Miller (1977) for the most by a Broncos coach in his first year with the team. And it made Kubiak one of only three coaches, joining Miller (1977) and John Fox (2011), to win a divisional title in his first season.\n\nThe Broncos clinched their fifth consecutive AFC West title and their 15th all time.\n\nDanny Trevathan: teeth of D.\n\nLinebacker Danny Trevathan couldn\u2019t forget his last meeting with the Chargers, on Dec. 6. He intercepted Philip Rivers, racing for a touchdown, leaving the Broncos 5-0 when the defense scores. Trevathan also suffered a concussion on a hit that cost him two upper back teeth on the right side of his mouth. he swallowed one and spit out the other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just teeth, man,\u201d Trevathan said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was a big deal until DeMarcus (Ware) told me I was bleeding. It\u2019s fine now. They put some bone in there.\u201d\n\nWith Marshall (ankle) limited, Trevathan finished with 10 tackles.\n\nFootnotes.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 split personality didn\u2019t divide by halves, but by quarters Sunday. After compiling 237 yards and six first-quarter first downs, the Broncos gained 42 yards in the second quarter. . Tight end Owen Daniels (offense), defensive end Vance Walker (defense) and cornerback Kayvon Webster (special teams) were selected as game-day captains for the Broncos.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tyler Polumbus makes most of chance; DeMarcus Ware, Darian Stewart injured", "title": "Tyler Polumbus makes most of chance; DeMarcus Ware, Darian Stewart injured", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/03/tyler-polumbus-makes-most-of-chance-demarcus-ware-darian-stewart-injured/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__Tyler-Polumbusp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160103__Tyler-Polumbusp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-03T22:12:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:48:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Danny Trevathan: teeth of D.Linebacker Danny Trevathan couldn\u2019t forget his last meeting with the Chargers, on Dec. 6.\nAfter the game Stewart, said he thought he was 100 percent leading up to the game, but hamstrings are notoriously tricky injuries to recover from.\nBroncos right offensive tackle Michael Schofield has had trouble giving up sacks left and right.\n\u201cWe play this game because we want to play football, and I haven\u2019t been playing football for a while,\u201d Polumbus said.\nTeammates believe Ware should be in position to play in the postseason, benefiting, like safety Darian Stewart (hamstring), from the bye week."}
