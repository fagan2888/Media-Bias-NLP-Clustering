Our healthcare is a horror show . . . Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry . . . because our country is a mess.\u201d\n\nThere are two Republican parties right now. One is angry, pessimistic, often nativist, and winning in the polls. The other is optimistic, inclusive, reformist \u2014 and losing.\n\nCandidates who make anger an explicit part of their messages \u2014 Trump, Ted Cruz and, increasingly, Marco Rubio \u2014 are doing well. Candidates who have tried to offer a sunnier vision \u2014 Ben Carson, John Kasich and Jeb Bush, who promised to campaign with \u201cjoy in his heart\u201d \u2014 are sinking.\n\nThe angriest candidates appear to be doing the best of all. Last week, the NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll asked Republican primary voters whom they preferred in a three-way choice among Trump, Cruz and Rubio; Trump drew 40 percent, Cruz 31 percent, Rubio only 26 percent.\n\nThe dyspeptic mood among GOP voters isn't a new discovery. Pollsters \u2014 and reporters at campaign rallies \u2014 have been stumbling across it for more than a year.\n\n\u201cRepublican primary voters are angry and unhappy with the direction of the country, the leadership and performance of the Congress, and especially with President Obama,\u201d pollster Peter D. Hart reported after talking with GOP voters in Indianapolis last year. \u201cThese people have done a better job of figuring out what they are against rather than what they are for.\u201d\n\nWhat's new is the stampede of candidates to reflect that anger, guided partly by Trump's example.\n\nIn terms of issues, the debate has been framed mostly around illegal immigration, fear of terrorism and trade policy. But in a brilliant essay last week in National Review, conservative writer Yuval Levin argued that voters' anxiety has a much deeper cause: their loss of confidence in traditional politics as a way to solve the country's problems.\n\n\u201cIt's a debate about how to handle the public's collapsing faith in the establishment \u2014 that is, in our political elite and our core governing institutions,\u201d Levin wrote. All the leading GOP candidates \u201cdescribe the hollowing out and decay of America's elite, its core institutions and its political leadership.\u201d\n\nTrump, he noted, derides the leaders of both parties as \u201cstupid people.\u201d Cruz charges that they have been co-opted by monied interests in Washington. Rubio, more restrained, merely criticizes them as \u201canachronistic and stuck in the past.\u201d\n\nThe case of Rubio is instructive: He began the campaign as an optimistic reformer \u2014 but when the voters' mood became clear, he switched sides.\n\nLast summer, Rubio said Trump's message wasn't positive enough to win the presidency. \u201cI think our nominee is going to be someone that embraces the future,\u201d he said. He called for broadening the GOP's appeal to minorities, and proposed \u201creform conservative\u201d ideas including an expanded tax credit for the working poor.\n\nBut in recent weeks, Rubio's rhetoric has grown darker \u2014 more like Trump's. \u201cAs I travel the country,\u201d he said in last week's debate, \u201cpeople say what I feel. This country is changing. It feels different. We feel like we're being left behind and left out.\u201d\n\nHe also toughened his position on immigration reform, again moving closer to Trump. Because of the threat from Islamic State, he said, \u201cThe entire system of legal immigration must now be reexamined for security first and foremost.\u201d\n\nTo be fair, Rubio's optimism hasn't been entirely extinguished. It's still possible to \u201cturn this country around,\u201d he said, \u201cif you elect me.\u201d\n\nAlthough \u201creform conservatives,\u201d who sought to remake the GOP message to focus on poverty and inclusiveness, have virtually disappeared from the campaign, they haven't died out entirely. They still have a champion in House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, R-Wis.), who said he wants Congress to work on innovative conservative ideas \u2014 so that when the party chooses a nominee, a positive program will be ready.\n\n\u201cWe want to be an inspiring, inclusive, majority party,\u201d Ryan said at a conference on poverty. \u201cWe are not just an opposition party; we are a proposition party.\u201d\n\nAnd a leading conservative thinker, Arthur C. Brooks of the American Enterprise Institute, argued that broadening the party's message was not only the right thing to do, but a political necessity.\n\n\u201cWe know that if conservatives capture the traits that are typically associated with liberals, empathy and compassion, that fact will swing independent, persuadable voters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's not something that can win; it's the only thing that will.\u201d\n\nThat may be wishful thinking. The GOP campaign has turned into a scramble for what Trump called the mantle of anger. And the angriest man appears to be winning.\n\nTribune Content Agency\n\nDoyle McManus is a columnist for the Los Angeles Times.\n\ndoyle.mcmanus@latimes.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Republicans race to claim the mantle of anger", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Tribune Content Agency", "author": "Tribune Content Agency", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Early in last week's pyrotechnic debate among Republican presidential candidates, Donald Trump was confronted with the charge that he's made the GOP sound too angry.", "title": "Republicans race to claim the mantle of anger", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-donald-trump-ted-cruz-anger-20160118-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-569d477b/turbine/ct-donald-trump-ted-cruz-anger-20160118", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, mantle of anger, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, illegal immigration, terrorism, Paul Ryan", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/85617417", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-01-18", "Description": "In the Republican presidential race, the angriest candidates -- Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and increasingly Marco Rubio -- seem to be doing the best of all.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, mantle of anger, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, illegal immigration, terrorism, Paul Ryan"}, "article_summary": "The GOP campaign has turned into a scramble for what Trump called the mantle of anger.\nCandidates who make anger an explicit part of their messages \u2014 Trump, Ted Cruz and, increasingly, Marco Rubio \u2014 are doing well.\nThe dyspeptic mood among GOP voters isn't a new discovery.\nLast week, the NBC-Wall Street Journal Poll asked Republican primary voters whom they preferred in a three-way choice among Trump, Cruz and Rubio; Trump drew 40 percent, Cruz 31 percent, Rubio only 26 percent.\n\u201cI will gladly accept the mantle of anger,\u201d he said."}
