Ron Wyden (Ore.), the top Democrat on Senate Finance, is seeking some changes and Ryan said he is working with him on those issues but wouldn't provide specifics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in active discussions with our counterparts over in the Senate and I\u2019m optimistic about those,\u201d Ryan said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get going pretty fast here,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Ryan acknowledged that there are plenty of issues that need to be addressed on trade from questions about currency manipulation to more transparency for Congress.\n\nHe noted, for example, that greater access for the United States into the Japanese auto and agriculture markets would help the trade argument on Capitol Hill and quell some of those currency manipulation concerns.\n\n\"The countries we have agreements with, we have a manufacturing surplus with,\" Ryan said.\n\n\"If you look at the countries we do not have agreements with, we have a big trade deficit with, so getting agreements is good for our workers, it's good for manufacturing it's good for agriculture.\"\n\nHe said he shares some of the president's same apprehensions about what might happen if currency manipulation provisions are added to the TPP.\n\nCongress and the Obama administration must work together to seek the best way to move forward, Ryan said.\n\nRyan also suggested that he is working on language that would be part of the TPA that would provide lawmakers with more and better access to the negotiating texts of the trade deals.\n\nThe issue has been a sticking point among lawmakers in both parties who say they want a more intimate look into how the TPP is shaking out.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A top Republican said Wednesday that he expects Congress to pass trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation this spring.", "description": "A top Republican said Wednesday that he expects Congress to pass trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation this spring.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Vicki Needham", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A top Republican said Wednesday that he expects Congress to pass trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation this spring.", "title": "Ryan predicts passage of bipartisan trade promotion authority bill", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/231809-ryan-predicts-passage-of-bipartisan-trade-promotion-authority-bill", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-04T19:38:13-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-04T19:38-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/231809-ryan-predicts-passage-of-bipartisan-trade-promotion-authority-bill", "dcterms.date": "2015-02-04T19:36-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Vicki Needham", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Fast track, Orrin Hatch, Pat Tiberi, Dave Camp, Max Baucus, President Obama, Ron Wyden,Paul Ryan,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-04T19:36:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-04T19:38:13-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/231809-ryan-predicts-passage-of-bipartisan-trade-promotion-authority-bill", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A top Republican said Wednesday that he expects Congress to pass trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation this spring.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ryan predicts passage of bipartisan trade promotion authority bill"}, "dcterms.title": "Ryan predicts passage of bipartisan trade promotion authority bill"}, "article_summary": "As far as timing, Ryan wouldn't provide specifics of when a fast-track bill would be ready to debut.\nA top Republican said Wednesday that he expects Congress to pass trade promotion authority (TPA) legislation this spring.\nRyan said he \"wouldn\u2019t begin to try\" to pass TPA with just Republicans votes because \"I want it to be bipartisan.\"\nADVERTISEMENTTo that end, Ryan and Rep.
