Diagnostic tests show this phenomenon perhaps most clearly, as a positive test result suddenly seems like a life-ending piece of news. But a quick refresher of what the test really says may help calm your nerves.\n\nAll tests come with two capabilities, specificity and sensitivity. Specificity refers to how well the test avoids false positives \u2014 that is, it avoids diagnosing healthy people as sick. Sensitivity, meanwhile, refers to how well it picks up disease that is actually there. You want your tests to have high percentages of both. If you\u2019re sick, you want the test to come back positive, and if you\u2019re well you want it to come back negative.\n\nBut things aren\u2019t so simple. The so-called positive and negative predictive values of a given test \u2014 the chance you have the disease, based on the result \u2014 are determined by the difference between how many people in a given study have the disease versus how many people in the general population actually have it. In other words, the number of people with the disease exists as a separate factor from the test\u2019s specificity and sensitivity.\n\n\u201cIf the people studied when a test is developed are sick, then the positive predictive values and negative predictive values only have meaning if we use the test on populations who are sick,\u201d explains Dr. Aaron Carroll, professor of pediatrics at Indiana University. The reason people shouldn\u2019t freak out over positive test results is that positive predictive values also lump healthy people into the mix.\n\nFor example, one study of mammograms found over 95 percent of people whose test came back positive did not have breast cancer. The test\u2019s specificity and sensitivity were good, but it was testing mostly healthy people and only a small percentage of sick people. As a result, the chance a positive test result actually meant cancer was only 4.4 percent \u2014 hardly cause for a freak-out.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "positive, results, lab, tests, shouldnt, alarm, you, what, numbers, really, mean", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "If a test comes back positive, it's easy to jump to the worst-case scenario.
