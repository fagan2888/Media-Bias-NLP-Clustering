His predictions, which government agencies used to make critical projections about the heath care plan, have not held up, according to an analysis.\n\nAlthough President Obama has downplayed Gruber's role in crafting the Affordable Care Act, White House logs show he visited 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. more than a dozen times and was paid $400,000 for his work on the project. That followed several years of work with the state of Massachusetts, where a universal health care system implemented under former Gov. Mitt Romney has been hailed as the model for ObamaCare.\n\nSince the passage of ObamaCare, eight states including Vermont and North Carolina gave Gruber's firm six-figure contracts to create computer models, crunch numbers and analyze data to help them implement the law. But those two states have now canned Gruber and canceled the deals in the wake of a spate of videos showing the loose-lipped academic saying the law was written in an intentionally obtuse manner and crediting \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d with helping pass the law.\n\n\u201cGruber\u2019s comment that it was all right to mislead people to get to a desired outcome that he favored led our auditors to determine he had at least the appearance of an independence impairment,\u201d Bill Holmes, a spokesman for the North Carolina Auditor\u2019s office, told WRAL Thursday.\n\nBut despite Gruber's damaging comments, it had been widely assumed that he knew what he was talking about when it came to the nuts and bolts of the plan.\n\n\n\n\u201cI hope his modeling is better than his political communication skills,\u201d Democratic strategist Joe Trippi said on The Kelly File Monday.\n\nAnalysis of Gruber's predictions by the conservative think tank Manhattan Institute and others casts doubt on his ability to project how the controversial law, which was signed into law in 2010, but only took wide effect last year after a long series of political and legal challenges, would play out.\n\n\n\nGruber Prediction: Premiums will go down\n\n\u201cWhat we know for sure the bill will do is that it will lower the cost of buying non-group health insurance,\u201d Gruber told the Washington Post in November 2009.\n\n\n\nPremiums rose due to ObamaCare by an average of 49 percent, according to a county-by-county analysis done by the Manhattan Institute, proving critics and insurance companies, who had said Gruber\u2019s models were deeply flawed, correct.\n\n\n\n\u201c[ObamaCare] will result in individual market premiums increasing, not decreasing, as stated in the Gruber paper,\u201d insurance company Wellpoint wrote in a 2009 paper.\n\n\n\nGruber had simply failed to consider key factors in the plan that Wellpoint correctly predicted would add \"between 20 percent and 80 percent to the cost of premiums under reform.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Gruber's analysis assumed everyone would qualify for ObamaCare subsidies, the company determined. Gruber\u2019s prediction before the Senate in 2009, that ObamaCare would guarantee \u201csizeable premium savings for [the] young\" and that a family with income of $38,000 \"would save, on average, $8,550,\" also failed to pan out, according to the Manhattan Institute analysis.\n\n[image]\n\n\u201cRomneyCare\u201d estimates off\n\nGruber\u2019s flawed modeling dates back to his efforts to help design a universal health care law for Massachusetts, later dubbed \u201cRomneyCare\u201d by some, according to the Manhattan Institute.\n\n\n\n\u201cJonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to an essential econometric model,\u201d Romney said in a speech upon passing the law.\n\n\n\nAlthough it is unclear exactly which predictions Gruber\u2019s model was responsible for, a number of RomneyCare predictions were off. The first one was a prediction that the average health care plan under RomneyCare would cost $200. It ended up costing $380. At the time, Gruber explained it this way:\n\n\n\n\u201cYou know, we are suggesting a more comprehensive policy than the governor had originally anticipated, I think, when he said $200,\u201d Gruber told American Public Media.\n\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by the libertarian CATO Institute, other RomneyCare predictions were wrong as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cGains in coverage have been overstated by nearly 50 percent, while costs have been understated by at least one-third,\u201d the report concluded.\n\n\n\nOne prediction Gruber got right\n\nIn 2009, when President Obama repeatedly said \u201cif you like your plan, you can keep your plan,\u201d Gruber commented ominously on the promise.\n\n\n\n\"With or without reform, that won't be true,\" Gruber Told the Associated Press in June 2009. \"[Obama\u2019s] point is that the government is not going to force you to give up what you have, but that's not to say other circumstances won't make that happen.\"\n\n\n\nThe author, Maxim Lott, can
