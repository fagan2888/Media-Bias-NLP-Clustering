They proved it Saturday. T.J. Oshie of the National Hockey League\u2019s St. Louis Blues was the heralded competitor in a 3-2 overtime victory over host nation Russia, and it bears describing just how incredible this young man\u2019s performance was.\n\nOshie was tapped to shoot over, and over, and over in the game\u2019s deciding shootout, after the two sides battled to a 2-2 stalemate through three periods and one 5-minute, sudden-death overtime session of play. The shootout format is simple: one shooter matches up against the other team\u2019s goaltender three times, and whichever side scores more wins. If both teams wind up tied after the three exchanges, it goes to sudden death \u2014 score and match, or fail and match, it goes on; fail to score and the other team does, it\u2019s over. The United States and the Russians exchanged shots a ridiculous eight times.\n\nOshie took six of the Americans\u2019 shots.\n\nYou hear hockey commentators say that converting above 50 percent of shootout attempts is superb; T.J. hit 4 of 6, 67 percent, small sample size be damned, against a goaltender, Sergei Bobrovsky, who hasn\u2019t even hit his prime and was awarded the trophy for best at his position in the NHL last year. On the two Oshie missed, he flat-out beat Bobrovsky. Once to the forehand side, once to the back, and he had an open net both times. (A little more difficult on the latter, courtesy of proximity and a world-class stick save.) This also occurred at the Olympic games. Not just on the road, but across an ocean, in a nation where hockey is as inherent as vodka, and a nation where the quality of hockey is decidedly *better* than vodka. These guys are good. And their fans were hostile, because antecedents in mind, the United States beat the Soviet Union in the biggest upset in the history of the Winter Olympics 34 years ago, and the countries were fighting proxy wars against each other 10 minutes ago in the scale of world chronology.\n\nT.J. Oshie: not just The Dude. America\u2019s dude.\n\nAdditional credit goes to the U.S. goaltender, Jonathan Quick, who lived up to his last name with some sharp saves during the dramatic stretch.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch some of the replay over at NBCOlympics.com.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Hockey slots behind football, baseball and basketball as fan favorites in American team sports, but with a fiercely contested Olympic game on the ice this morning, hopefully we all can appreciate it a bit more.", "title": "Hey, so T.J.
