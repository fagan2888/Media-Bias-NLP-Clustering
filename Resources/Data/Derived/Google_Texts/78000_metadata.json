I mean, what\u2019s not to love about a pagan holiday involving carved produce, telling scary stories, and free candy? It\u2019s like it was created with us in mind.\n\nWe really get into it. NDNs are out here making full blown head-to-toe costumes from scratch. A relative once made an entire fancy dance outfit out of Budweiser boxes, bustle included. Tribal casinos and community centers put on costume contests and masquerade powwows. Carloads of cousins make trips to haunted house and corn mazes. We go Trick-Or-Treating, and every Rez has that one elder whose entire lawn becomes a montage to All Hallow\u2019s Eve a month ahead of time, complete with inflatable ghosts, floating skeletons, and Styrofoam tombstones.\n\nIt\u2019s my favorite holiday, too\u2014even more than the average bear because I consider myself somewhat of a Horror aficionado. Alas, it hasn\u2019t been easy to hold onto my Halloween spirit. Thanks to glaring cultural appropriation, rampant redface and ugly, inaccurate, homogenized clich\u00e9 caricatures of Natives, the Struggle is Real.\n\nCase and Point: It shouldn\u2019t surprise you that since I like horror movies, I\u2019m a fan of Eli Roth. Wait, let me correct that. WAS a fan. Like every other Native who isn\u2019t living under a rock, I heard the hubbub about his latest project, \u201cThe Green Inferno.\u201d Native activists, upset over his negative depiction of Indigenous people, were up in arms, brandishing figurative online torches ready to chase down Roth like he was the Frankenstein monster.\n\n\u201cBoycott!\u201d They shouted.\n\nNormally, I\u2019d be amenable to such an outcry. But I like Eli. Eli and I go way back. Cabin Fever and Hostel were gory, blood-soaked masterpieces.\n\nSo with my reusable plastic popcorn bucket in tow, I went.\n\nInitial gag-worthy moments like the film\u2019s hipster white savior declaring \u201cHave you ever fantasized about saving a dying Tribe?\u201d (to which I responded, \u201cSave this,\u201d with a little one fingered salute to the screen) paled in comparison to the barrage of damaging imagery about Indigenous people that followed.\n\nHe painted the Native people red, literally. This fabricated Tribe of, dare I say, redsk*ns, didn\u2019t have a Chief or medicine person. It\u2019s limb-severing, eyeball-chomping leaders were what appeared to be stereotypical Hollywood contrived witch doctors. Huh? Did I travel back in time to 1955? Where\u2019s Marty McFly and Doc Brown at? Great Scott!\n\nEnter every played out, hostile, degrading savage trope imaginable. We\u2019re naked. We\u2019re stupid. We\u2019re inarticulate. We\u2019re either hapless victims incapable of defending ourselves, or wild flesh-eating cannibals. This is what The Green Inferno would have you believe. The film even manages to use genital mutilation to glorify white women while simultaneously fetishizing Indigenous virgins.\n\nI felt like a local outcast who got invited to prom by Mr. Popular, only to have a bucket of pig\u2019s blood dumped on her head in front of the entire school.\n\nEli Roth\u2019s false representation of who Native people are exemplifies everything that\u2019s wrong appropriation, mascots, redface, and wearing Indian costumes. When I go to the Halloween section of stores and see fake headdresses, plastic tomahawks, and skimpy buckskin bikinis alongside werewolf and zombie masks, it\u2019s disheartening.\n\nIs this what society thinks we are? That we\u2019re monsters? Figments of the imagination? Kith and kin to Dracula and the Wicked Witch of the West? Talk about dehumanizing. News flash: we\u2019re not extinct and the \u2018Indian\u2019 costumes people are wearing are insulting, offensive, horribly inaccurate, and further cultural genocide. You\u2019re committing erasure of over 566 unique and beautiful Indigenous Nations and we are the original titleholders of these lands.\n\nPocahottie costumes are the worst. Real Native women are out here running Indian country, playing for the WNBA and winning Mrs. Universe pageants while bratty sorority girls and thirst-trapping celebrities are bouncing around in plastic breastplates made in China, faux leather panties and warbonnets meant to be kept sacred and reserved for those Native leaders who\u2019ve earned each feather through great acts of valor. Being an attention whore doesn\u2019t excuse encouraging the hypersexualization of Native women when 1 in 3 are the survivors of rape and the sexual trafficking of Indigenous girls continues unchecked.\n\nI can\u2019t lie. Sometimes I\u2019m tempted to snatch headdresses right off their heads, and I know I\u2019m not the only one. Call it righteous anger, or a reckoning.\n\nIf you ever get too comfortable in your Native skin, let\u2019s not forget that Halloween is sandwiched between a holiday that honors a greedy, lost, European slave trader who\u2019s largely responsible for the annihilation of millions of Indigenous people (Columbus Day) and another based on a heartwarming myth that should be called Thanks-taking instead of Thanksgiving.\n\nNatives have been disrespected for way too long, so watch us make Halloween our own, Columbus Day fall to Indigenous People\u2019s Day, and Thanksgiving become a day when real history is acknowledged and children are educated about it, while Natives hold feasts of harvest with all of their extended family. This is it, The Return of the Living NDN.\n\nRuth Hopkins (Sisseton Wahpeton & Mdewakanton Dakota, Hunkpapa Lakota) is a writer, blogger, biologist, activist and judge.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rez Natives love us some Halloween.
