A year later, she married him.\n\nNot when he saw no point in college, going directly into his family\u2019s Hobby Lobby craft store business. Green, now 50, rose up from assembling picture frames for \u201cbubble gum money\u201d at age 7 through every job, including cleaning toilets, to president of the $3.3 billion national chain, one of the nation\u2019s largest private companies.\n\nAnd certainly not now when, he says, the U.S. government is challenging his unshakeable Christian faith and his religious liberty.\n\nNext week (March 25) Green\u2019s path leads straight up the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court to witness oral arguments in the case Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius.\n\nThat\u2019s Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The department included all Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception among services required for insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHobby Lobby has provided insurance with contraception coverage for years, paying for 16 of the FDA-approved forms, from barrier methods to pills that prevent fertilization. Not covered: intrauterine devices and morning-after pills such as Plan B. Those, the FDA acknowledges, could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb.\n\nBlocking implantation would \u201cterminate life\u201d says Green. \u201cWe won\u2019t pay for any abortive products. We believe life begins at conception.\u201d\n\nWhile scores of faith-based organizations and private business owners have filed suit seeking exemption from the mandate, Hobby Lobby has become the standard-bearer for religious opposition. The potentially landmark case is a First Amendment battle testing whether a private corporation can have freedom of religion rights and, if so, whether the government has a \u201ccompelling interest\u201d in overriding such rights.\n\nThe justices will wade through thickets of questions: Can a company pick and choose laws to obey, based on the personal beliefs of the owner? Is it the job of government to decide whether those beliefs are worthwhile and sincere, deeply and consistently held?\n\nSteve Green is a Southern Baptist, grandson and nephew of Pentecostal pastors, a Sunday school teacher for decades and leader of a business that has declared its Christian principles from opening day. Hobby Lobby stores are all closed Sundays \u201cto allow employees time for family & worship,\u201d the front door signs say.\n\nHe may be the ideal plaintiff \u201cfor such a time as this\u201d \u2014 the line from the Book of Esther that believers often call on for courage when standing on faith.\n\nJackie and Steve Green, side by side in a Washington hotel restaurant crowded with people in town for February\u2019s National Prayer Breakfast, remember another day when standing on faith carried them through a crisis.\n\nNearly 30 years ago, long before they were tagged as Oklahoma City billionaires, Steve Green\u2019s father, Hobby Lobby CEO David Green, brought the whole Green clan together to consider \u2014 and pray for \u2014 the company\u2019s survival. The 1985 Oklahoma oil bust had devastated the state economy. Hobby Lobby, never in the red before, was in deep trouble.\n\nDavid Green founded the company in 1972, the only one of six children who didn\u2019t become a pastor like their father in the Church of God of Prophecy denomination. After months of struggling alone to save the family business, he admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make this work.\u201d\n\nSteve Green was 21, his wife, 19 and pregnant with their first child. Married the year before, they had just bought their first home. Fear was not an option.\n\nThe whole family doubled down on work and on faith, \u201cshared the stewardship,\u201d they said, and never looked back. It turned out to be the only year Hobby Lobby ever lost money. Now, the company has 640 stores, with 70 more opening in 2014.\n\nSteve and Jackie Green, who met at a church camp as young teens, are a double-team interview. They have the same eyes, pale blue green. They share the same easy laugh, the same \u201cno regrets spirit,\u201d Jackie Green says.\n\nAfter all, not even a head-on collision could derail them.\n\nNot surprisingly, he had his driver\u2019s license suspended for speeding a few years later. (Who would know this was the same Steve Green who won the driver\u2019s ed award among 68 students in his Bethany High School graduating class?) But he gave up the lead-foot driving \u2014 and parachute jumping and later his pilot\u2019s license \u2014 as their family grew. The Greens have six children including a daughter, now 7, adopted from China.\n\nThe Hobby Lobby kingpin has little time for hobbies of his own. The family enjoys skiing and the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team. He became the chocolate chip cookie baker in the family when his wife didn\u2019t make them as often as he had a hunger for them.\n\nTheir family foundation\u2019s charitable gifts focus on gospel outreach efforts in the U.S. and abroad, contributing to the building of a dome for the Oklahoma State Capitol, and supporting social services such as the City Rescue Mission.\n\nThe mission is a 640-bed homeless shelter in Oklahoma City run by CEO and President Tom Jones. He was Steve Green\u2019s youth pastor who became a lifelong friend (and an eyewitness to the infamous collision).\n\nJones still recalls how impressed he was by the teenage Green in his youth class at Sunday school.\n\n\u201cAs a young man, when many others were just talking about everything from football to dating, his conversations were always centered around the importance of knowing and living by the truth of God\u2019s word as the way to move through life toward success.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018You need to share this!\u2019 and he was all, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m good.\u2019 So, finally, I just announced one day that he would be teaching the class. He\u2019s been teaching ever since,\u201d said Jones.\n\nAcross three decades, says Jones, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen Steve angry.\u201d He\u2019s also never seen Green turn away from a challenge, certainly not one where, said Jones, \u201che could be forced by the government to do something contrary to the word of God.\u201d\n\nFamily, faith and business were the sole centerpieces of Steve Green\u2019s life until the late 1990s when a professor with a passion for ancient manuscripts brought him the idea to build a collection of Bible texts. He\u2019s since written two books, \u201cFaith in America\u201d and \u201cThe Bible in America.\u201d\n\nNow, the Green\u2019s family foundation is building a Bible museum five blocks southwest of the U.S. Capitol to house an unparalleled collection of rare and ancient Scripture manuscripts: 40,000 biblical texts, artifacts and antiquities, from the most ancient manuscripts in Jesus \u201chousehold language\u201d to Torah scrolls that survived the Holocaust.\n\nIt\u2019s planned to open in 2017 and research to choose a name is underway. Just don\u2019t expect to see \u201cGreen\u201d in that name.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that the Bible is the hero of the museum, not me, or the Green family,\u201d he said last week, in a phone interview from Egypt. He was traveling to Jerusalem and Rome as well to discuss possible exhibition partnerships (and take a side trip to climb Mount Sinai).\n\nThe average American has four Bibles at home and rarely reads any of them. Steve Green has worked his way through his Bibles uncounted times.\n\nLately, it\u2019s the Book of Daniel that comes often to his mind. In Chapter 3, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego would rather face a fiery furnace than bow to an idol at the command of King Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nGreen said, \u201cThey told the king \u2018Our God is able to deliver us.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he faces the white-hot spotlight of the Supreme Court case, Steve Green said, \u201cGod has allowed us to take this stand. I don\u2019t want to be presumptuous to say this is God\u2019s will.\u201d\n\nIf the ruling goes against Hobby Lobby, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we will do but I am sure what we will not do,\u201d he said. He will say as the three men told the king, \u201ceven if God does not deliver us, we still cannot do this.\u201d (Daniel 3:16-18)\n\nOf more than 25,000 full-time and part-time Hobby Lobby employees, there are \u201c13,000 lives\u201d depending on their health plan, said Steve Green.\n\nAnd the \u201cgreatest misconception\u201d about the Green family and this case, he said emphatically, \u201cis that we are trying to impose our religion on these workers or others. Not at all! That would violate our religion to do that.\u201d\n\nYet through that religion, he said, they can face any court ruling with peace of mind.\n\n\u201cWe are just going to do what God would call us to do, what he teaches us is right and trust him to do what is out of our control.\u201d\n\nCopyright: For copyright information, please check with the distributor of this item, Religion News Service LLC.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "RNS-STEVE-GREEN, Kathleen Sebelius, Oklahoma City, United States, Oklahoma, North America, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, United States government, Religion, Hobbies, Religious issues, Social affairs, Social issues, Recreation and leisure, Lifestyle, National courts, National governments, Government and politics, Courts, Judiciary, Health care policy, Government policy", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Once Steve Green sets his path, there\u2019s no turning back.", "title": "Hobby Lobby\u2019s Steve Green stands on faith against Obamacare mandate", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/hobby-lobbys-steve-green-stands-on-faith-against-obamacare-mandate/2014/03/17/d17d0960-ae18-11e3-b8b3-44b1d1cd4c1f_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/hobby-lobbys-steve-green-stands-on-faith-against-obamacare-mandate/2014/03/17/d17d0960-ae18-11e3-b8b3-44b1d1cd4c1f_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "RNS-STEVE-GREEN, Kathleen Sebelius, Oklahoma City, United States, Oklahoma, North America, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, United States government, Religion, Hobbies, Religious issues, Social affairs, Social issues, Recreation and leisure, Lifestyle, National courts, National governments, Government and politics, Courts, Judiciary, Health care policy, Government policy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "d17d0960-ae18-11e3-b8b3-44b1d1cd4c1f", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "Once Steve Green sets his path, there\u2019s no turning back."}, "article_summary": "Not when he saw no point in college, going directly into his family\u2019s Hobby Lobby craft store business.\nOnce Steve Green sets his path, there\u2019s no turning back.\nHe was Steve Green\u2019s youth pastor who became a lifelong friend (and an eyewitness to the infamous collision).\n(Who would know this was the same Steve Green who won the driver\u2019s ed award among 68 students in his Bethany High School graduating class?)\nHobby Lobby has provided insurance with contraception coverage for years, paying for 16 of the FDA-approved forms, from barrier methods to pills that prevent fertilization."}
