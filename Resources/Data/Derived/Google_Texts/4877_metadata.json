Although his journey was long and difficult, Hernandez believes that everyone can do the same: \"Don\u2019t put it off. If you say you\u2019re going to run, do it today, not tomorrow,\" he told CNN.\n\nIt took learning that he was pre-diabetic at 16 years old to get Hernandez to do something about his weight problem. For years, the teen had been ignoring his weight issues and continuing to pile on the pounds. By the time Hernandez was in high school, he weighed 370 lbs. His life consisted of daily cheese burritos and hours of video games. Outside of the house, Hernandez was bullied in school for his weight.\n\n\u201cI tried my best to ignore it. But there were times when I just gave in and started crying,\u201d Hernandez explained to CNN. He decided to turn it all around when he learned about being pre-diabetic. \u201cI just knew that I had to do something about it, that I couldn\u2019t keep complaining over something that I had control over,\u201d Hernandez explains in the YouTube video on his weight journey. The day he learned of his health issue, Hernandez went for his first jog, and today, over two years later, he hasn\u2019t stopped yet.\n\nLong, Difficult Journey\n\nThe journey wasn\u2019t an easy one. At first, Hernandez couldn\u2019t jog more than half a mile without having to stop because he felt ill. He started walking before and after school, slowly building up his mileage. Eventually, Hernandez added running intervals into his daily walks, and after a few months, he could run an entire mile without needing a break.\n\n\u201cI really couldn\u2019t have done any of this without the love and support of my family and friends,\u201d Hernandez explained on YouTube. Together with his older brother, Mario Hernandez, the two rearranged their family\u2019s pantry. They got rid of the family\u2019s usual processed food and replaced it with healthier options. Eventually, the entire family got involved with the new healthy lifestyle. \u201cAs a family, we go outside more, walk a little more. It shows because we have a lot more energy,\u201d Mario told CNN. \u201cEven though other members haven\u2019t lost as much weight, maybe five pounds, you can see it in their faces.\u201d\n\nOnce Edgar accepted responsibility for his own weight, he was able to do something to change it. YouTube/Screenshot screenshot/YouTube\n\nLifestyle, Not Hobby\n\nToday, Hernandez weighs in at around 180 lbs. His waistline shrunk from 48 inches to 33 and he dons a size medium top, not his usual XL, CNN reported. Instead of playing video games, you will see Hernandez either at the gym lifting weights or on the streets of his suburban St. Louis neighborhood running. For Hernandez, running did more than change his pant-size. It gave the teen a second chance at living.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t even step out my door to get the mail before,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see the dark, sad side of me anymore. They see a bright, happy kid.\" The 18-year-old has already run a half-marathon and plans on completing a second one soon. He is enrolled at Southern Illinois University \u2013Edwardsville, where he will study exercise science in the fall. He leaves one message to those who also want to lose weight: \u201cYou can win your battle against obesity. It is possible. You can make excuses all you want, but in the end, you have to realize only you yourself can make a change.\u201d\n\nVisit Edgar Hernandez\u2019s Facebook page or on Twitter @RunWithEdgar to follow his journey.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "teen, loses, 200, pounds, 2, years, goes, pre, diabetic, distance, runner", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "An Illinois teenager went from being a 370-lb. at-risk diabetic to a fit 185-lb. distance runner in only two years.", "title": "200 Pounds In 2 Years: From Pre-Diabetes To Long-Distance Running", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-loses-200-pounds-2-years-goes-pre-diabetic-distance-runner-284736", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/edgar2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Illinois teenager went from being a 370-lb. at-risk diabetic to a fit 185-lb. distance runner in only two years.", "title": "200 Pounds In 2 Years: From Pre-Diabetes To Long-Distance Running", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/teen-loses-200-pounds-2-years-goes-pre-diabetic-distance-runner-284736", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/edgar2.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/05/27/edgar2.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-05-27T14:10:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-05-27T14:10:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "An Illinois teenager went from being a 370-lb. at-risk diabetic to a fit 185-lb. distance runner in only two years."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fa4\"", "article_summary": "In two years, 18-year-old Edgar Hernandez lost over 200 lbs.\nFor Hernandez, running did more than change his pant-size.\nFor years, the teen had been ignoring his weight issues and continuing to pile on the pounds.\nIt took learning that he was pre-diabetic at 16 years old to get Hernandez to do something about his weight problem.\nAlthough his journey was long and difficult, Hernandez believes that everyone can do the same: \"Don\u2019t put it off."}
