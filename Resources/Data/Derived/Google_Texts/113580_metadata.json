But in politics, it is always best to \u201cfollow the money.\u201d For 2014, lobbying expenditures by computer/Internet companies hit $139.5 million. The Left likes to talk about \u201cPeople Power\u201d, but Silicon Valley lobbying cash is \u201cCorporate Power.\u201d\n\nWhen FCC Chair Michael Powell, son of former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and the four other FCC Commissioners chose to classify the Internet as an \u201cinformation service\u201d in 2002, rather than a \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d the move was cheered for preventing the doubling of the billions in taxes charged each month for landline phones.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDespite virtually no Internet user complaints, the Left\u2019s consumer, civil rights, media reform groups (Consumers Union, Color of Change, Demand Progress, CREDO Action, the Future of Music Coalition and Free Press, among others) had spent years advocating the regulation of high-speed Internet service as the \u201cthe First Amendment of the Internet.\u201d\n\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler under the Obama Administration initially resisted regulating broadband providers as telecommunication common carriers under Title II of the Federal Communications Act of 1934. But \u201cafter the November election, the man who appointed Wheeler to the FCC intervened on behalf of the right response\u201d according to Seeking Alpha\u2019s Dana Blankenhorn.\u201d\n\nLess than a week after his Party was crushed in the 2014 election, President Obama hendorsed utility-style regulation as \u201cNet Neutrality.\u201d Organizing for Action, the group spun off from his re-election campaign, blasted a statement to supporters touting the news\u2013and included a donation link. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money for House Democrats, did the same, according to Politico.\n\nPresident Obama said, \u201cAn open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life. By lowering the cost of launching a new idea, igniting new political movements, and bringing communities closer together, it has been one of the most significant democratizing influences the world has ever known.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps the biggest \u201cdemocratizing influences\u201d that the President was referring to was the spectacularly enthusiastic lobbying \u201cSilicon Valley firms\u201d. In 2014, lobbying expenditures by computer/Internet companies hit $139.5 million to fund a total of 1,094 Registered Lobbyists. A quarter of industry funding came contributions from Google at $16,830,000; Facebook at $9,340,000; and Microsoft Corp at $8,330,000.\n\nIn a free society, every company has the right to have its concerns heard by our leaders. But the computer/Internet industry lobbying seems to have been especially effective, because 747, or 68.3 percent, of those lobbyists were \u201cRevolvers,\u201daccording to Open Secrets. This group passes through the \u201crevolving door\u201d that shuffles former federal employees into jobs as lobbyists, consultants and strategists, just as the door pulls former hired guns into government careers.\n\nThis substantial investment in Washington lobbying may also explain how the computer/Internet industry seemed to know exactly what was in the FCC\u2019s supposedly secret 332-page draft regulatory scheme. Breitbart News reported in \u201cNet Neutrality Passes: Everybody Equal, But Google Much More Equal\u201d that in the final days before the FCC vote, \u201cGoogle executives on Feb. 19 called aides to Wheeler and staffers for the FCC\u2019s two other Democratic commissioners\u2013Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel\u2013to make their case\u201d in support of Net Neutrality.\n\nMany legal experts are doubtful that the dubious Net Neutrality can sustain the type of legal challenges that are sure to be made by Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner Cable and Verizon after two earlier FCC attempts to regulate and tax the Internet like the old AT&T monopoly were crushed by federal courts.\n\nBut Court challenges take time. With $139.5 million lobbying budget, perhaps a thousand-plus computer/Internet registered lobbyists can be helpful.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Best \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d Silicon Valley Money Can Buy", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Best \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d Silicon Valley Money Can Buy", "title": "Best \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d Silicon Valley Money Can Buy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/google-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-02-28T22:21:54-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/01/best-net-neutrality-silicon-valley-money-can-buy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Best \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d Silicon Valley Money Can Buy", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/google-AP.jpg", "title": "Best \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d Silicon Valley Money Can Buy", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "cronyism, FCC, Federal Communications Act of 1934, lobbying, Net Neutrality, revolving door, Title II, Tom Wheeler,Big Government, Breitbart California, Net Neutrality,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-01T04:00:57-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-02-28T22:21:54-07:00", "tag": "Tom Wheeler", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Net Neutrality"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe181a\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe hard-Left publication The Nation and their allies advocated for the FCC\u2019s \u201cNet Neutrality\u201d passage to regulate and tax the Internet as \u201cPeople Power\u201c.\nBut in politics, it is always best to \u201cfollow the money.\u201d For 2014, lobbying expenditures by computer/Internet companies hit $139.5 million.\nPresident Obama said, \u201cAn open Internet is essential to the American economy, and increasingly to our very way of life.\nWith $139.5 million lobbying budget, perhaps a thousand-plus computer/Internet registered lobbyists can be helpful.\nIn 2014, lobbying expenditures by computer/Internet companies hit $139.5 million to fund a total of 1,094 Registered Lobbyists."}
