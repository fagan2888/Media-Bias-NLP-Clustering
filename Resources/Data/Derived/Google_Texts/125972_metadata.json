Never mind that she was a sprightly 30 years old. Despite the bauble on her finger, her hand looked scaly, she said, with a few sunspots dotting it.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw a picture, I thought, \u2018Oh, it doesn\u2019t look very smooth, plump and youthful,\u2019 \u201d said Valencis, a baker in Farmington, Connecticut. \u201cI wanted a hand makeover.\u201d\n\nDermatologists say they are seeing more newly engaged women come in with the selfie in mind.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, the rise in social media is a reason people are getting a ton of stuff done, not just to their hands,\u201d said Dr. David Bank, director of the Center for Dermatology in Mount Kisco, New York, who has been offering hand lifts since 2005 and has conducted studies on hand injectables.\n\nDr. Matthew Schulman, a Manhattan plastic surgeon, said he sees about eight patients a month specifically for hand treatments.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to see pictures of engagement rings, whether it\u2019s looking at their wish pic or sending photos to their friends to announce an engagement,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are becoming more aware of what their hands look like, much more than getting a manicure.\u201d\n\nAge spots, veins or a bony appearance (or, horrors, all three) have become an obsession for some women. In Valencis\u2019 quest for that perfect selfie of her diamond-adorned hand, she contracted for a series of six intense pulsed light (IPL) and chemical- peel treatments and two syringes of an injected gel substance called Juv\u00e9derm Voluma XC for a total of $3,000.\n\n\u201cOnce you see what your hand looks like on your computer or phone, you start to notice things you didn\u2019t think were a problem before,\u201d said Schulman, who injects dermal fillers into the skin in the back of the hands to diminish that bony or veiny look.\n\nHe also offers laser therapy, along with consultations with an aesthetician in his office.\n\nPlastic surgery is up in general. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, from 2012 to 2013 there was a 6.5 percent increase in the total number of cosmetic surgical procedures (for men and women), and a 21 percent increase in injectables like Radiesse, Juv\u00e9derm and Sculptra Aesthetic.\n\nAlthough the Society does not break down the numbers by body part, injectables are used primarily in the face and hands, said Dr. Michael Edwards, a Las Vegas board certified plastic surgeon, who is the organization\u2019s new president.\n\nDana Wood, the beauty director at Brides magazine, does not think hand lifts are money well spent.\n\n\u201cEspecially if they\u2019re young, I think there are so many better ways to spend your money than that,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, do they have their eight months of Suze Orman living expenses?\u201d\n\nJennifer Skrip disagrees. After she got engaged in March, Skrip, a 35-year-old teacher in Manhattan, said she worried that her hands looked a little too bony, with a bit of sun damage.\n\nSo she started treatments with an aesthetician in Schulman\u2019s office, for a peel and some IPL and possibly some injectables, that she expects will cost $1,000 to $2,000.\n\n\u201cI want my hands to look perfect for photos,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/hfwell24.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf61a\"", "article_summary": "Dana Wood, the beauty director at Brides magazine, does not think hand lifts are money well spent.\n\u201cI want my hands to look perfect for photos,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI wanted a hand makeover.\u201dDermatologists say they are seeing more newly engaged women come in with the selfie in mind.\nDespite the bauble on her finger, her hand looked scaly, she said, with a few sunspots dotting it.\nDr. Matthew Schulman, a Manhattan plastic surgeon, said he sees about eight patients a month specifically for hand treatments."}
