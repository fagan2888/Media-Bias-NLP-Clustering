This episode retells the story of Operation Red Wing, where a quick reaction force on a mission to recover the remains of a helicopter crash learns that there is a lone survivor they must now rescue. Driven by the standards of the Ranger Creed, these men push themselves to the limit, both mentally and physically, and persevere and complete the mission.\n\nThe episode's story connects with the director Peter Berg's last movie, \"Lone Survivor,\" which is based on the novel and first hand account of Marcus Luttrell.\n\nI had the opportunity of speaking with Marcus and Peter on Friday in regards to Operation Red Wing. I asked Marcus about what the viewer can look forward to in this week's episode.\n\n\"Sunday's episode is about the rescue,\" he said. \"I never say anything about it because I was the one getting rescued. It's not my place. I've only said thank you and talk about the guys from what I saw, from my perspective. But hell, they made it in the village. Those guys earned their stripes, that's for sure.\"\n\nI will release the full interview with Marcus Luttrell and Peter Berg on Saturday, which includes topics such as Operation Red Wing, Peter Berg's relationship with the SEAL community, and what life is like in the special forces.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sunday on the History Channel, episode two of the new special forces series \"Live to Tell\" airs at 10/9c.05/26/2016 10:52:29AM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Sunday on the History Channel, episode two of the new special forces series \"Live to Tell\" airs at 10/9c", "title": "New Special Forces Series \"Live to Tell\" Episode 2 Preview", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/01/15/live-to-tell-episode-2-preview-n2105356", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/15/20.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Sunday on the History Channel, episode two of the new special forces series \"Live to Tell\" airs at 10/9c", "title": "New Special Forces Series \"Live to Tell\" Episode 2 Preview", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/01/15/live-to-tell-episode-2-preview-n2105356", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/15/20.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "New Special Forces Series \"Live to Tell\" Episode 2 Preview, Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef8c\"", "article_summary": "Sunday on the History Channel, episode two of the new special forces series \"Live to Tell\" airs at 10/9c.\nI had the opportunity of speaking with Marcus and Peter on Friday in regards to Operation Red Wing.\nI will release the full interview with Marcus Luttrell and Peter Berg on Saturday, which includes topics such as Operation Red Wing, Peter Berg's relationship with the SEAL community, and what life is like in the special forces.\nThe episode's story connects with the director Peter Berg's last movie, \"Lone Survivor,\" which is based on the novel and first hand account of Marcus Luttrell.\nThis episode retells the story of Operation Red Wing, where a quick reaction force on a mission to recover the remains of a helicopter crash learns that there is a lone survivor they must now rescue."}
