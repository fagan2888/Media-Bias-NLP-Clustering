Its unemployment rate dropped 2.5 percentage points in October. MEL EVANS/ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nA troubled city hit by declining gambling revenues had some good employment news in October. Atlantic City-Hammonton, N.J., hammered by casino closures last year, had the largest unemployment rate decrease in October of any metropolitan area, the Labor Department said Monday.\n\nThe jobless rate declined 2.5 percentage points on the year, some positive news for a seaside resort that has seen four casinos close since January 2014, taking thousands of jobs with them. The community\u2019s share of the regional gambling market has declined precipitously as casinos in Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New York have opened.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality sector still accounts for 40,000 of the metropolitan area\u2019s 130,000 jobs. But despite the decline in the unemployment rate, Atlantic City still ranks near the bottom of the list, number 373 of 387 metropolitan areas.\n\n\u201cA lot of the damage in Atlantic City already occurred,\u201d said Bruce Bergman, an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for New York and New Jersey. The size of the city\u2019s labor force has also declined, he said, although the data doesn\u2019t detail whether shrinking manpower is due to demographic change or job seekers moving to other areas.\n\nAtlantic City\u2019s 7.7% unemployment rate was down from 10.2% in October last year but remains considerably higher than 4.8% nationwide. The figures are not seasonally adjusted.\n\nThe nearby New York-Newark-Jersey City area had the largest over-the-year increase in nonfarm payroll employment of the most populous urban areas in October, adding 157,100 jobs. Its unemployment rate fell to 4.6% from 5.9% in October 2014.\n\nAcross the country, employment winners over the past year were concentrated in California. San Francisco and San Rafael had the lowest unemployment rates among populous divisions, at 3.3%, while the largest decline in that category\u2019s jobless rate occurred in Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale.\n\nFargo and Bismarck, N.D., remained areas with the lowest unemployment rate last month at 1.8%. Yuma, Ariz., once again had the highest at 23.2%.\n\nRelated reading:\n\nThe October Jobs Report in 12 Charts\n\nThe November Jobs Report in 14 Charts\n\nWhere Are the Cities with Good Job Markets and Affordable Housing?", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Atlantic City-Hammonton, N.J., hammered by casino closures last year, had the largest unemployment rate decrease in October of any metropolitan area.", "title": "Atlantic City\u2019s Jobless Rate Fell Most in October.
