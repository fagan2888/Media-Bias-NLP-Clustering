In 2011, he served as opening act for Israeli pop star Aviv Gefen\u2019s 20th anniversary tour of his debut album It\u2019s Only the Moonlight. Since then, he has signed a record deal with Warner Music Germany, but on January 4, an unplugged show at Tel Aviv\u2019s Levontin 7 will reconnect him with Israeli audiences.\n\n\n\nBorn Mathithiahu Gavriel in 1986 in Tel Aviv, Mathia\u2019s life and work reflects the Israel-German cultural intersection that is lighting up in Berlin. There are currently anywhere from 5,000 to 20,000 Israelis now living in Berlin, depending on who\u2019s counted.\n\n\n\nThe recent exodus of Israelis to Germany\u2019s \u201cit\u201d city made headlines in The New York Times, The Guardian, Der Speigel and a slew of local and international media outlets following a controversial post of a comparatively low Berlin grocery bill on the \u201cOlim L\u2019Berlin\u201d Facebook page. Appealing to 2011\u2019s \u201csocial justice\u201d protesters, the post bragged how chocolate pudding in Germany costs only a shekel, compared to four shekels in Israel.\n\nBut for Mathia, living and working in Germany isn\u2019t a constant negotiation between Germany\u2019s dark past and the desire for a fulfilled, affordable life. Israelis\u2019 attraction to Germany, and vice versa, is about a reconciliation that comes from finding common ground through interesting art, culture and music, a desire to broaden one\u2019s world outlook, and everyday interactions in the big city.\u201cThis generation grew up with parents and grandparents being anti-Semitic and having close-minded thinking, and now it\u2019s time for these people to grow out of this thinking and learn from the past,\u201d Mathia said in a German-accented English at an interview at a Tel Aviv caf\u00e9, joined by his girlfriend and songwriting partner, Jenny Karr, who\u2019ll be performing onstage with him on January 4.Mathia catapulted to German fame when he placed third in Germany\u2019s X Factor singing contest. In biographical segments, he was introduced as being born in Tel Aviv, but the focus was first and foremost on the music \u2013 his ethereal voice, out-of-the-box renditions, and organic electro-pop style \u2013 and not his mixed Jewish-Germany identity.\u201cIt\u2019s more of a big deal here [in Israel] than it is there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut still, people are interested. It\u2019s different. I try to mention it whenever I can. Why not? This is where I come from. This is my roots.\u201dIn a television interview that aired in Israel, he mentioned that he would love to work with Aviv Gefen. Gefen, now a judge on Israel\u2019s The Voice singing contest, called him the next day.\u201cHe asked if I wanted to open a few shows in Germany, Poland, Switzerland and Austria. I said yes. I got on the bus in Berlin and we left East.\u201dSON OF a German mother and Israeli father, Mathia moved to northern Germany at age six and then to Berlin in 2006 after a stint in London, where he had started a band with fellow Israelis and British Jews.Mathia believes that cheaper rent and cost of living play a role in Berlin\u2019s attraction, but that it\u2019s the vibrant, vanguard nightlife and cultural scene in both Tel Aviv and Berlin that has sparked mutual fascination.\u201cPeople from Berlin love to go to Israel, to Tel Aviv. It\u2019s \u2018the\u2019 city. And what connects the two cities is the nightlife. In Germany you can party from Friday to Monday, nonstop. And all the art and all the music.\u201dHistorical consciousness of Germany\u2019s dark past and the Nazi slaughter of the Jews are ubiquitous in Berlin. Holocaust memorials have been installed in public squares, and golden memorial markers have been drilled into sidewalks where Jewish families had once prospered before being deported to concentration camps.\u201cBerlin is trying really hard to memorialize the history rather than cover it up,\u201d Mathia said, a fact which lends to Israelis\u2019 openness to the city.Karr, an American-born Jew, joined Mathia in Berlin two years ago from Los Angeles where she worked as a singer and songwriter with credits on albums of such divas as Celine Dion, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears.\u201cGermany is the last place I ever thought I\u2019d live, but then again, Berlin is it\u2019s own little bubble, like Tel Aviv is.\u201dShe has noticed a marked increase in Israelis living there.\u201cYou hear a lot of Hebrew in Berlin. Everywhere. Restaurants, trains.\u201dOnce in a while, she said, Germans will take a special interest in the Jewish state and seek to understand the culture and people that their ancestors had sought to obliterate. By and large, however, Israelis are treated the same as any European tourist or foreigner.\u201cThey don\u2019t care where you come from,\u201d she says.But most do care that Jews will no longer feel unwelcome.\u201cThey don\u2019t want history to repeat itself. That\u2019s our friends, anyway.\u201dAt Levontin, Mathia will be performing songs from his forthcoming debut album On the Run. But onstage at Levontin, he\u2019ll feel at home. \u201cIt\u2019s a homecoming in a big way,\u201d he says.Mathia and Jenny Karr: Live in Tel Aviv will take place at the Levontin 7, Tel Aviv, 10:15 pm, NIS 35.
