Yet Rob Rhinehart invented Soylent, which has been described as tasting like the liquid run-off from oatmeal, with higher aspirations in mind. His simple and affordable powder that is mixed into water contains \u201ceverything the healthy body needs\u201d and is meant to be \u201ca more efficient approach to nutrition,\u201d one that he hopes will \u201creduce the global disparity of health.\u201d\n\nCan those claims be backed? In a word, no. \"Scores of DIYers\" and the founders themselves have been living on Soylent for months (Wouldn\u2019t that office be a joy to work in!), \u201cand there is much evidence that is considerably healthier than a typical diet,\u201d but no statistically-significant scientific tests have been conducted and scant information, beside the personal, is presented on the website. What\u2019s in the powder? The list of ingredients includes maltodextrin (a type of carbohydrate), rice protein, oat flour, canola oil, fish oil, and soy. Its nutritional profile is based on the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine (IOM), though Rhinehart \u201cadded a couple extras and changed a few based on my testing.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration would regulate the nutritional drink as a dietary supplement; since none of its ingredients are new to the market, it would therefore be considered both legal and safe. Could a healthy person live exclusively on Soylent and maintain his or her health? That has never been tested and proven, though for most people, the better question is: Would you really want to?\n\nClearly, Rhinehart is one of those rare people who finds food tedious and, presumably, lacking in pleasure. \u201cIn my own life I resented the time, money, and effort the purchase, preparation, consumption, and clean-up of food was consuming,\u201d Rhinehart wrote for his blog. So he created the powdered drink, which contains no hormones, pesticides, or preservatives, in order to simplify his world. \u201cI almost forgot to mention, when everything going in to your body is diffused in to the bloodstream, you don't poop.\u201d Glad you mentioned that!\n\nSoylent should begin shipping on or around March 20 and those who pre-ordered (and anyone else) can judge for themselves whether it is a worthy replacement of regular food. For many people, the single remarkable aspect of this humble seeming drink is the fact that it has been backed by an impressive crowd-sourcing campaign in which Rhinehart managed to pull in a cool $2 million in preorders. Perhaps that should be expected from an alumnus of Y Combinator, a minimalist venture capital firm that provides seed money to start-ups. Ironically, Y Combinator\u2019s innovation in the field was hosting a weekly event at which highly successful digital entrepreneurs (Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg appears on the website) speak to guests who meet potential backers\u2026 over dinner.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "soylent, nutritional drink, food supplement, water, future food, nutritional requirements, health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Although the inventor of the all-in-one nutritional drink, Soylent, has been living off his product for months, no rigorous testing has been done to verify that it provides \"everything the healthy body needs,\" so can the crowd-funded drink back its claims?", "title": "Eat All A Healthy Body Needs For $9/Day", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-soylent-new-crowd-funded-nutritional-drink-back-its-claims-eat-all-healthy-body-needs-9day", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/18/soylent.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although the inventor of the all-in-one nutritional drink, Soylent, has been living off his product for months, no rigorous testing has been done to verify that it provides \"everything the healthy body needs,\" so can the crowd-funded drink back its claims?", "title": "Eat All A Healthy Body Needs For $9/Day", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/can-soylent-new-crowd-funded-nutritional-drink-back-its-claims-eat-all-healthy-body-needs-9day", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/18/soylent.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/18/soylent.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-18T17:17:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T11:53:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Although the inventor of the all-in-one nutritional drink, Soylent, has been living off his product for months, no rigorous testing has been done to verify that it provides \"everything the healthy body needs,\" so can the crowd-funded drink back its claims?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc648\"", "article_summary": "Although the inventor of Soylent has been living on his nutritional drink for months, no rigorous testing has been done to verify his claims that it provides \"everything the healthy body needs.\"\nYet Rob Rhinehart invented Soylent, which has been described as tasting like the liquid run-off from oatmeal, with higher aspirations in mind.\nHis simple and affordable powder that is mixed into water contains \u201ceverything the healthy body needs\u201d and is meant to be \u201ca more efficient approach to nutrition,\u201d one that he hopes will \u201creduce the global disparity of health.\u201dCan those claims be backed?\n\"Scores of DIYers\" and the founders themselves have been living on Soylent for months (Wouldn\u2019t that office be a joy to work in!\nCould a healthy person live exclusively on Soylent and maintain his or her health?"}
