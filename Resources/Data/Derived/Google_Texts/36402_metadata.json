Russian-instigated \"aggressors.\"\n\nReally? Where is his evidence?\n\nPerhaps someone will answer the following questions:\n\nWhy was MH17 diverted into a military conflict zone hundreds of kilometers north of its scheduled flight route between Amsterdam and Kuala Lumpur?\n\nWhy have the relevant voice recordings and radar records from Kiev air controller authorities mysteriously disappeared?\n\nWhere are the flight recorders and which agency/authority is charged with analyzing and disclosing their contents?\n\nWhy was Malaysia \u2014 the primary national entity investigating this atrocity \u2014 refused authority to become part of the Joint Inquiry Group until Dec. 2, more than four months after the incident?\n\nWhy should any one of the four \"inquiry group\" nations, including Ukraine, have veto authority to prohibit public revelation of its unredacted findings?\n\nWhy wasn't the International Civil Aviation Organization given primary control of the investigation? MH17 was a civilian commercial flight, not a military aircraft.\n\nWhy have the USA's mainstream media been curiously silent about the atrocity for nearly eight months?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth Russian and U.S. satellites were monitoring the shootdown region. Where are their data? Have they been suppressed for undisclosed reasons?\n\nThe Ukrainian \"revolution\" of February 2014 was unquestionably a U.S./NATO-orchestrated and financed coup d'etat. Was the MH17 shootdown part of a false flag operation designed to exacerbate the outrageous and unwarranted demonization of Russia and its leadership?\n\nAccording to Russian radar/satellite data, two Ukrainian Sukhoi-25 fighter aircraft were shadowing MH17 minutes before the shootdown. Is this allegation accurate or refutable?\n\nI'm anxiously awaiting responses to these questions.\n\nDave Morton lives in Longmont.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_27806949/dave-morton-few-questions-about-malaysia-airlines-flight", "modificationDate": "2015-03-28T21:44:57-0600", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Guest Opinions", "sailthru.author": "By Dave Morton", "description": "In his letter of March 8 (\"Standing with Elie Wiesel\"), Barry Meriash not only disregards Israel's nearly 40-plus years' possession of operational nuclear weapons (admitted publicly in 1976 by Carl Duckett, then CIA deputy director of science and technology), but he states unequivocally that Malaysian Flight MH17 was shot down by Ukrainian \"rebels\" \u2014 a.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27806949:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-28T21:44:33-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_27806949/dave-morton-few-questions-about-malaysia-airlines-flight", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "In his letter of March 8 (\"Standing with Elie Wiesel\"), Barry Meriash not only disregards Israel's nearly 40-plus years' possession of operational nuclear weapons (admitted publicly in 1976 by Carl Duckett, then CIA deputy director of science and technology), but he states unequivocally that Malaysian Flight MH17 was shot down by Ukrainian \"rebels\" \u2014 a.", "title": "Dave Morton: A few questions about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "In his letter of March 8 (\"Standing with Elie Wiesel\"), Barry Meriash not only disregards Israel's nearly 40-plus years' possession of operational nuclear weapons (admitted publicly in 1976 by Carl Duckett, then CIA deputy director of science and technology), but he states unequivocally that Malaysian Flight MH17 was shot down by Ukrainian \"rebels\" \u2014 a.", "title": "Dave Morton: A few questions about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_27806949/dave-morton-few-questions-about-malaysia-airlines-flight", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-28T21:44:33-0600", "endDate": "2025-03-28T18:46:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Dave Morton: A few questions about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Dave Morton", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2015-03-28T21:46:48-0600", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc15c\"", "article_summary": "Why should any one of the four \"inquiry group\" nations, including Ukraine, have veto authority to prohibit public revelation of its unredacted findings?\nWas the MH17 shootdown part of a false flag operation designed to exacerbate the outrageous and unwarranted demonization of Russia and its leadership?\nWhy was Malaysia \u2014 the primary national entity investigating this atrocity \u2014 refused authority to become part of the Joint Inquiry Group until Dec. 2, more than four months after the incident?\nWhere are the flight recorders and which agency/authority is charged with analyzing and disclosing their contents?\nAccording to Russian radar/satellite data, two Ukrainian Sukhoi-25 fighter aircraft were shadowing MH17 minutes before the shootdown."}
