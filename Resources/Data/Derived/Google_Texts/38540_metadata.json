Bush, has come under criticism by several GOP candidates, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, even though his own brother appointed him, over his decisions on Obamacare.And Roberts agreed that if he was an elected official, he \"certainly wouldn't have voted for the program that was under review,\" even if as a justice, he does decide if it was or wasn't enacted under the provisions of the Constitution.The confirmation process for justices is also showing party-line bias, Roberts said. Years ago, justices like Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsberg were almost unanimously confirmed, and his own proceedings were passed easily, he said.After that, other well-qualified nominees like Bush's choice of Samuel Alito, Jr. and President Barack Obama's nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were approved mainly along party lines.However, Roberts said the justices have a deep bond, even though they often disagree on cases.\"If you think about it: pick nine random people out of the room and throw them together and say, 'Okay, you'll work together for the next 25 years on some of the most important and divisive issues the country faces,'\" Roberts said. \"You do come to appreciate the good faith of the people with whom you work.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "justice, john roberts, supreme court", "pubdate": "2016-02-04T13:22:25", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "The Supreme Court is increasingly being seen as part of the political process because of partisan extremism, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr. said late Wednesday, complaining that people don't understand the court's true role.", "title": "Roberts: Partisan Extremism Affecting Public Perception of Supreme Court", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/justice-john-roberts-supreme-court/2016/02/04/id/712755/", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=0cd4bbf2-b5f3-49be-9c02-65bf358cd454&SiteName=Newsmax", "page_id": 85452072376}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/justice-john-roberts-supreme-court/2016/02/04/id/712755/", "title": "Roberts: Partisan Extremism Affecting Public Perception of Supreme Court", "description": "The Supreme Court is increasingly being seen as part of the political process because of partisan extremism, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr. said late Wednesday, complaining that people don't understand the court's true role.", "site": "Newsmax"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "epoch": 1454592145, "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "keywords": "justice, john roberts, supreme court", "article": {"section": "Newsfront", "published_time": "2016-02-04T13:22:25"}, "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/justice-john-roberts-supreme-court/2016/02/04/id/712755/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Roberts: Partisan Extremism Affecting Public Perception of Supreme Court"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court is increasingly being seen as part of the political process because of partisan extremism, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, Jr. said late Wednesday, complaining that people don't understand the court's true role.\n\"You do come to appreciate the good faith of the people with whom you work.\"\n\"If you think about it: pick nine random people out of the room and throw them together and say, 'Okay, you'll work together for the next 25 years on some of the most important and divisive issues the country faces,'\" Roberts said.\nYears ago, justices like Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsberg were almost unanimously confirmed, and his own proceedings were passed easily, he said.After that, other well-qualified nominees like Bush's choice of Samuel Alito, Jr. and President Barack Obama's nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, were approved mainly along party lines.However, Roberts said the justices have a deep bond, even though they often disagree on cases.\nJeb Bush, even though his own brother appointed him, over his decisions on Obamacare.And Roberts agreed that if he was an elected official, he \"certainly wouldn't have voted for the program that was under review,\" even if as a justice, he does decide if it was or wasn't enacted under the provisions of the Constitution.The confirmation process for justices is also showing party-line bias, Roberts said."}
