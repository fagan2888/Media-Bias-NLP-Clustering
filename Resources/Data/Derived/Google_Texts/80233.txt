The Arizona Department of Public Safety has released additional details about the fatal accident that closed Interstate 10 westbound for much of the day Sunday.

After being struck, the truck went to the left, partially into the dirt shoulder. The driver of the truck over-corrected to the left causing the truck to roll towards the right, coming to a rest upright in the right shoulder.

The Pontiac went left through the center median and came to rest next to the left eastbound lane, facing westbound.

The right front passenger of the Toyota, 20-year-old Rene Teasley, was transported to University of Arizona Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased.

A second passenger that was in the bed covered by a camper shell, a 13-year-old male, was ejected and was admitted to UAMC.

The driver, 48-year-old Michael Spicker of Vail, was also transported to UAMC and admitted.

The driver of the Pontiac was identified as 32-year-old David Molina of Tucson. He was not injured, and was arrested and booked into the Pima County jail for one count of manslaughter and one count of aggravated assault.
