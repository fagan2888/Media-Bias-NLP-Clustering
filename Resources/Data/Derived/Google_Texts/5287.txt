Washington (CNN) Sure, political groups all have different opinions on women's rights, Obamacare, ISIS and climate change ... but one thing can unite all sides -- the Star Wars franchise.

With "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" hitting theaters Friday, several political and government figures took to Twitter to have fun with the epic space series.

Even the White House had some fun, inviting some Star Wars characters -- R2-D2 and stormtroopers -- to participate in the press briefing while the movie was shown to children of military families.
