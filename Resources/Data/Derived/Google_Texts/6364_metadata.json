Volunteers also covered the Chevron Houston Marathon with the slogan \u201cRun that Next Mile with Health Insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a day when Texans will think about one of the nation's great leaders for social justice and change,\u201d Get Covered America said in a statement, \u201clocal volunteers will share the news that new health insurance options along with financial help to pay for it is available to thousands of uninsured Texans, representing a big step forward for health care justice.\u201d\n\nRead more after the jump.Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reinforced this message last week, urging that the sense of community inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr. Day be a time to reach out on the Affordable Care Act:\n\n\n\n\u201cAs we celebrate the inspirational life of Dr. King, please join us in this historic effort by helping your friends, neighbors, and loved ones get covered through the Marketplace\u2026 Dr. King memorably described inequality in health care as the 'most shocking and inhumane' form of injustice.

It underscores the importance of community events like these that provide direct outreach to often hard-to-reach groups to let them know that there are plans that will actually be affordable to them if they take the time to enroll.\n\nGet Covered America posted photos and stories from MLK Day events nationwide on Twitter, including events in Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the one below (and pictured at left) from Austin:\n\n@JBarbaBrown: Getting ready to hit the streets in Austin with @GetCoveredTX #GetCovered\n\nThough close to 500,000 Texans have applied for health insurance plans since October, there are millions more who are eligible and who now have less than 2.5 months to enroll.
