Under a private exchange, workers are given a subsidy to pick from a limited number of health plans and the insurer takes on the risk.\n\n\u201cEmployers are telling us they are losing confidence in their traditional approaches, like vendor changes or employee cost-sharing,\u201d which only deliver \u201cincremental\u201d improvement, Jim Winkler, Aon\u2019s chief innovation officer for health benefits, said in a telephone interview. \u201cEmployers are saying, \u2018I need to do something different.'\u201d\n\nHealth spending in the U.S. is expected to increase more than 6 percent this year and 6.2 percent annually from 2015-2022 as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act takes full effect and millions of Americans gain insurance, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nWalgreen, Sears\n\nWalgreen announced a shift last September to a private exchange run by Aon that serves 18 companies, including Sears Holding Corp. and Darden Restaurants Inc., and 600,000 employees. More than 20 insurers are participating in Aon\u2019s exchange this year, Maurissa Kanter, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. Most employers have access to five carriers, which each have five plans, giving their workers 25 options to pick from.\n\n\u201cWe expect it to grow pretty significantly\u201d in the next few years, Winkler said. \u201cWe have a lot of interest in it.\u201d\n\nEmployers may also be responding to workers who want more choice, said Paul Fronstin, director of health research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nWorkers looking at the new public insurance marketplaces created under the health overhaul known as Obamacare \u201cmay be asking their employers, \u2018Why can\u2019t we have more choice?'\u201d Fronstin said by telephone. \u201cPreviously, employers never really had that market place where employees could pick.\u201d\n\nEnding Coverage\n\nAon surveyed more than 1,230 U.S. employers with more than 10 million workers. They found that 5 percent of the companies surveyed may drop employee health-care coverage in the next three to five years, an increase from 1 percent now.\n\nUnder Obamacare, companies that don\u2019t offer coverage for their employees will be fined $2,000 per employee. Employers spend $6,000 per employee on average, so dropping coverage may seem like a good deal, but ultimately this is not a realistic option because of potential backlash from employees, said Fronstin.\n\n\u201cHistorically, employers have offered health benefits voluntarily to be competitive in the labor market,\u201d he said. \u201cWith unemployment being much lower than it was four years ago, employers are more hesitant to put exiting on the table.\u201d\n\nStill, some companies are ending coverage for part-time employees. The law doesn\u2019t require employers to provide health plans to part-time workers. About 38 percent of the companies surveyed by Aon said they would offer no benefits to part-time workers within the next three to five years.\n\nRetiree benefits are also being reworked. International Business Machines Corp. said last year that it would send 110,000 retirees to Towers Watson\u2019s Extend Health, the largest private Medicare exchange.\n\nThe Aon survey found that two-thirds of employers who wanted to make changes in retiree benefits were looking to follow IBM\u2019s lead.\n\nOnly 25 percent of large employers offer subsidized retiree health benefits, Aon said, down from about 50 percent in 2004.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Drew Armstrong in New York.
