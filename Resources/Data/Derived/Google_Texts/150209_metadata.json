Eating more fatty foods \u2014 in a low-carb diet \u2014 may now be the best way to prevent chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.\n\nDavid Ludwig, director of the Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, has joined a growing number of nutritionists dispeling the notion that good health comes from limiting fat and counting calories overall. Rather, obesity and related ailments are caused by high-carb diets that raise blood sugar levels and send insulin spikes throughout the body.\n\n\u201cWe intuitively know that 'eat less, exercise more' doesn\u2019t work,\" Ludwig says in an editorial. \"It\u2019s such simple advice that if it worked, my colleagues and I would be out of a job. The uncomfortable fact is that an exceedingly small number of people can lose a substantial amount of weight and keep it off following that advice.\u201d\n\nJournalist Nina Teicholz recommended the same low-carb, high-fat diet in her book, The Big Fat Suprise. \"Fat generally \u2014 and saturated fat specifically \u2014 came to be blamed for causing heart disease, obesity, and cancer,\" Teicholz wrote. \"Eventually this unfounded belief became ingrained as our national dogma. Saturated fat is really not bad for health. The most rigorous diet trials clearly show that a high-fat, low-carb diet is better for fighting obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.\"\n\nLikewise, Jonathan Bailor recommends the same newfound wisdom in his book, The Calorie Myth. \"Stop thinking about calorie quantity and look at food quality,\" Bailor told the Examiner. \"A calorie is not a calorie. Using calories as a guide to what you should eat is like using height to measure intelligence.\"\n\nLudwig says the world\u2019s obesity epidemic is largely the result of eating the wrong kinds of foods, echoing the kind of folk wisdom heard at any farmers\u2019 market in America \u2014 at least with regard to processed foods. \u201cWe have to forget the low-fat paradigm,\u201d Ludwig said. \u201cSome high-fat foods like avocado, nuts, and olive oil are among the healthiest foods we could possibly eat.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, Ludwig and like-minded scientists say overeating \u2014 otherwise known as gluttony \u2014 should be seen as a manifestation of obesity rather than a root cause.\n\nSource: Ludwig D, Friedman M.
