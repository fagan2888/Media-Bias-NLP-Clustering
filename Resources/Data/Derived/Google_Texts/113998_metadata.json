After about two years her dad adopted her to a Missouri family, changing her name and birth date to make it more difficult for her to be found by her mother.\n\nWhitaker-Shaw says when she was 14-years-old she met her dad, now deceased, and says he told her that her sister was killed in a car wreck. Kellett says her dad had a similar story, saying both her younger sister and mother were killed in a car wreck.\n\nBut here's how they found each other after years of failed attempts. Whittaker-Shaw's husband Joe, paid to get Troy's DNA entered into \"AncestryDNA.com.\" At first it was just to find out their heritage. But it just so happened that for years Tonya had her DNA in AncestryDNA in hopes of finding long lost family members. Tonya was about to give up when the DNA match was made. That was December 17th.\n\nSo Friday afternoon Kellett drove from Missouri to Eureka where she had a tearful reunion with her younger sister.\n\nWhittaker-Shaw says, \"This is the best Christmas present I'm ever going to have in my whole life.\"\n\nAs Kellett's car, driven by her daughter, pulled into Shaw's Eureka driveway, Troy ran to her long lost sister. She says, \"I just want to touch her. I want to make sure she's real.\"\n\nWith this reunion they now start catching up on the last 50 years.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Two sisters forcibly separated 50 years ago during a divorce reunited New Year's Day in Eureka.", "language": "english", "author": "Chris Frank", "og": {"description": "Two sisters forcibly separated 50 years ago during a divorce reunited New Year's Day in Eureka.", "title": "Sisters separated 50 years reunited in Eureka", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Sisters-separated-50-years-reunited-in-Eureka--364005021.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C28/4CD/C284CDC7FCA541E5BBAC390BC2358A42", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/93B/E2E/93BE2EA046C745729D16717A57B52657.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Two sisters forcibly separated 50 years ago during a divorce reunited New Year's Day in Eureka.", "title": "Sisters separated 50 years reunited in Eureka", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Sisters-separated-50-years-reunited-in-Eureka--364005021.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/eureka2.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Sisters separated 50 years reunited in Eureka", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sisters separated 50 years reunited"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f3d\"", "article_summary": "Two sisters, who were forcibly separated nearly 50 years ago when their parents were going through a divorce, are reuniting.\n53-year-old Tonya Kellett was taken by her father at age 4 from her Eureka home, away from her mother and 18-month-old sister Troy Whitaker-Shaw.\nSo Friday afternoon Kellett drove from Missouri to Eureka where she had a tearful reunion with her younger sister.\nAs Kellett's car, driven by her daughter, pulled into Shaw's Eureka driveway, Troy ran to her long lost sister.\nKellett says her dad had a similar story, saying both her younger sister and mother were killed in a car wreck."}
