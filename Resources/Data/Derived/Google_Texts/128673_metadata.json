In addition, Colbert dished about the plot of the new Star Wars movie, and skewered Ben Carson and Donald Trump.\n\nStephen Colbert started the Late Show off by coming out onto the stage of the Ed Sullivan Theater and dancing as Jon Batiste, the band leader of the house band, Stay Human, played his mellophone. The studio audience, who had been standing the entire time, kept chanting Colbert\u2019s first name, over and over again.\n\nColbert thanked his audience, and then he said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe, it\u2019s already fall of 2015, and we\u2019re counting down to the event that all civic-minded Americans need to take part in, and that\u2019s the new Star Wars movie.\u201d Colbert said that the trailer for it came out last week when he was on vacation, so he did not get the chance to talk about it then.\n\n\u201cThis was a real trailer with actual chunks of movie flavor crystals in it. Seeing the Millennium Falcon again, I got this combination of weeping and giggling, that I call \u2018geepling,\u2019 which is also, I believe, the name of one of the new Star Wars characters. And, how great was it to see Chewbacca reunited with Han Solo\u2019s grandfather \u2014 it was incredible.\u201d\n\nColbert continued talking about the movie, saying that he and J.J. Abrams were \u201cgood friends,\u201d but he said that Abrams has told him \u201cnothing, including what J.J. stands for and what his phone number is \u2014 very good friends.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert Dishes About the Plot of the Star Wars Movie\n\nColbert dished about what he thought that the entire plot of the new Star Wars movie will be, based upon only his having seen the trailer. He said, \u201cIt has been three decades since the telling of the first Trilogy. The dark and mysterious First Order has stepped into the power vacuum once held by the Empire, and the newly named Resistance fights in place of the Rebel Alliance, which has begun a tragic shift towards the Dark Side.\u201d\n\nColbert continued, saying that \u201cBut Jon Boyega\u2019s character is in a Storm Trooper suit, so it follows that the new hope has come from the very enemy we have been trained to hate. Remember, the Dark Side has never been exclusively tied to the Empire. The Force, itself, exists outside of mere temporal structures So, I predict, the Dark becomes Light, the Light becomes Dark, the very fabric of the Force is stretched to its limit as a new generation emerges to tear down the false distinctions of the past and unite all of us, old and new, Moisture farmers and Nerd Herders, Stars and Wars, once and for all, bringing peace to the galaxy. Yes, indeed!\u201d\n\nHe went on, saying, \u201cThe only problem is now I\u2019ve spoiled the movie for myself, and I really wanted to see it. Luckily, we have a good show for you tonight.\u201d He said that his guests will be actress Julianna Margulies from The Good Wife, who recently got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nColbert said, \u201cThat\u2019s good news, for the one guy in Hollywood who still walks.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert said that his second guest will be bestselling author, Jonathan Franzen. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like Twitter,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cSo, if you don\u2019t either, show your support with the hashtag, #ImaFranzen. Then, we will have music by Alabama Shakes. Their new album is called Sound & Color. I\u2019ve been a fan of both of those things since I was a baby. If they dangle a shiny set of keys in front of me, I\u2019m good for the evening.\u201d\n\nColbert said, \u201cScientists looking for a cure for baldness have successfully regrown hair on lab rats. So, great new, bald men \u2014 now you can wear a lab rat on your head.\u201d\n\nJon Batiste and Stay Human played Colbert to his desk. The studio audience chanted Colbert\u2019s first name over and over again, and he said, \u201cLike a lot of New Yorkers, I\u2019m tired and a little pissed off this morning.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert Talks About Donald Trump Looking Like a Golden Calf\n\nColbert talked about the last Republican debate. He said that he was \u201cexcited about the retired neurosurgeon, and current tired person, Ben Carson, who is surging in the polls, ahead 26 percent of Republican Primary Voters, to Donald Trump\u2019s 22 percent. The other 52 percent, of course, is going to the other 52 candidates.\u201d\n\nThen, Colbert said, \u201cCarson\u2019s strongest support comes from Evangelical Christians, a group that Donald Trump has had a lot of trouble with getting. Apparently, a lot of people who read the Bible don\u2019t want to follow someone who looks so much like a golden calf.\n\n\u201cPlus,\u201d Stephen Colbert said, \u201cWhile Trump has spent months turning off people with his loud and outrageous comments, Carson\u2019s outrageous comments have been quieter.\u201d He played a clip of Carson talking about ObamaCare.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is\u2026 really I think the worst thing to happen to this nation since slavery,\u201d Carson said.\n\nIn another clip, Carson said that \u201ca lot of people go into prison straight, and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d\n\nWolf Blitzer, from CNN asked Ben Carson about his take on guns, asking him if it was true what he said about the Holocaust and guns. Blitzer asked Carson, \u201cIf there had been guns in Germany, you are saying that there might not have been a Holocaust?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that the likelihood of Hitler being able to accomplish his goals would have been greatly diminished if the people had been armed.\u201d\n\nColbert said, \u201cYou can\u2019t argue with his logic. These days, a lot of people have guns, and where\u2019s Hitler? Dead!\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert then talked about Trump now questioning Carson\u2019s religion. Carson is a Seventh Day Adventist, and Trump is a Presbyterian. \u201cThat\u2019s down the middle of the road, folks, in all fairness. Now, Seventh Day Adventists, I just don\u2019t know about, I don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cSome people say this was an attack, as everything that Trump says about anyone is an attack; but, he clarified what he said.\u201d Colbert played audio of Trump saying, again, \u201cI just don\u2019t know about them, that particular religion. I didn\u2019t say anything bad about them, I just don\u2019t know about it.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert said, \u201cI\u2019ll take him at his word for it. It\u2019s like your aunt at Thanksgiving who has a couple too many cocktails, who says, \u2018I just don\u2019t know about these Jews.\u2019 She probably means \u2014 she probably means that she just has a deep-seated curiosity about their religion, and is very eager to learn what she \u2018just doesn\u2019t know\u2019 about them. I\u2019ll see you at Thanksgiving, Aunt Rita.\u201d\n\nColbert said, \u201cDonald did attack Ben Carson on something that he holds more sacred to someone\u2019s religion \u2014 their level of \u2018pep.'\u201d Colbert played another audio clip of Trump, this time saying \u201cBen Carson is super-low energy, right? Super-low energy!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, super-high energy is the number one prerequisite to being a good president. Who can forget President Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Work-out tape, \u2018The Abs-solutionist of Steel.'\u201d He showed an old-fashioned looking poster of Lincoln wearing gym shorts and showing off his rock-hard abs.\n\n\u201cLook at those stove-pipe shorts!\u201d Colbert joked. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s smuggling something in those shorts! He\u2019s the \u2018Rail Splitter!\u2019\n\nColbert continued, saying \u201cBut, Carson didn\u2019t take Trump\u2019s insult lying down. He half-way stood up.\u201d Colbert then played a clip of Carson saying \u201cAs a teenager, I would go after people with rocks, baseball bats, bricks and hammers. Of course, many people know the story of when I was 14 and tried to stab someone.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert mentioned that \u201cSure, 14 \u2014 that is when you\u2019re in your stabbing prime. when I was 14, I was on my high school\u2019s \u2018Stabbing Team.\u2019 Behind Colbert, was a black-and-white photo of him as a teenager, holding up a bloody knife.\n\n\u201cI gotta say, that\u2019s impressive. He managed to harness his youthful passion for stabbing someone in the stomach to use if for something more positive, stabbing people in the brain. Donald Trump better watch himself, or Dr. Carson will write him a prescription for 20ccs of \u2018Vitamin Knife.'\u201d\n\nFollowing another commercial break on the Late Show, host Stephen Colbert talked a bit more about Ben Carson pulling ahead of Trump in the most recent polls. He said that Trump was the first \u201cwhite male billionaire in history to be the underdog.\u201d He said that Trump really has been an underdog his entire life. In another video clip Colbert played, Trump said it has not been easy for him, \u201cMy father gave me a small loan of $1 million dollars. I had to pay him that back, with interest.\u201d Colbert said that Trump also thinks that \u201cthree is a small number of wives.\u201d\n\nMatt Lauer pointed out to Trump that $1 million dollars was a lot of money to most people. Trump told him, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d but he argued that it was not very much compared to what he made using the money.\n\n\u201cThese days, he\u2019s worth billions of dollars,\u201d Colbert said, \u201cso to him, a million dollars is garbage. So, let\u2019s talk this moment to say to him, \u2018Mr. Trump, you look like a million dollars!\u2019 Clearly, this is an inspiring story of a young man making good. A classic story of \u2018Riches to richer.\u2019 Donald was just a humble boy from the outer boroughs, and he wanted nothing more than to escape that provincial life and make his way in the Big City. But, his Old Man stood in his way, and said, quote, \u2018You don\u2019t want to go to Manhattan. That\u2019s not our territory.'\u201d\n\nColbert went on, saying, \u201cBut Donald dared to head out into a territory that he did not own. He dared to travel from Queens to Manhattan, leaving his old life blocks behind. The young Donald took pass across the stormy seas of the East River with nothing more than $1 million in his pocket and a shirt on his back. His other shirts were at the tailor\u2019s. And, like so many immigrants before him, when he cast his eyes on the Statue of Liberty, he thought, \u2018Eh, she\u2019s a six or a seven, maybe, if she had a bigger rack.\u2019 And, through hard work, perseverance, and an accountant well-versed in the loopholes of bankruptcy, he became the magnanimous billionaire we know and love today, a man who\u2019s proud to say that to him $1 million is \u2018a small amount of money.'\u201d\n\nThen, Stephen Colbert announce that tonight, he was \u201ctaking the liberty of writing a million dollar check from Donald Trump to the charity of my choice, the Harlem children\u2019s Fund. Oh, yeah \u2014 it\u2019s all filled out, even the memo line, \u2018It\u2019s no big deal.\u2019 Now, Mr. Trump, all you have to do is come here, sign it, and prove that $1 million really is a small amount of money \u2014 especially when it\u2019s helping other people get a start in Manhattan. Who knows? Maybe the kids you help may one day be so rich, they can one day blow their cash on a presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nAfter another break on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert introduced his first guest, actress Julianna Margulies. She came out wearing a nice-looking red-and-white dress. She said that she had a youth program, and she believed that there were young people there that night.\n\nColbert told her she \u201cwas wearing a beautiful dress.\u201d He added that he was \u201cwearing a suit, because legally, I can\u2019t be naked on the air.\u201d\n\nThey both then talked about The Good Wife, and the character that Margulies plays, Alicia. Colbert mentioned that she had a scandal last season, \u201cWhen,\u201d as Margulies mentioned, \u201cthe Democratic Committee threw her under the bus for voter fraud.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert asked her about \u201cBond Court,\u201d and how that played a part in last season and this season. she told him that \u201cBond Court was something we will have to take a look at seriously, and I didn\u2019t know about Bond Court until we started shooting this, and we started shooting the whole Bond Court series this July.\u201d She talked about the New York Times having written about \u201cjust how unjust Bond Court is.\u201d\n\nMargulies said, \u201cYou get just 10 minutes to plead your case, that\u2019s it, in Bond Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much of this have you had to learn?\u201d Colbert asked her. \u201cCould you go into court right now and plead a case, say, \u2018I object!'\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I could,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come on!\u201d Colbert said. \u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not! I hate to read the small print. I can\u2019t,\u201d she told Colbert.\n\nStephen Colbert said that he \u201ccame from a family of lawyers.\u201d He said, \u201cI kind of wanted to be a lawyer, until I found out, it\u2019s not just about saying \u2018I object!\u2019 all day long and saying things like, \u2018I\u2019m going to tear him a new one!\u2019 It\u2019s actually a lot of work and reading involved.\u201d\n\nMargulies told Colbert that her grandmother had been a lawyer, and had graduated in NYU Law School in 1924. She said that her grandmother had been among the first women admitted to the law school, and four of them had graduated. Margulies said, \u201cWhen she graduated, women were allowed to take the Bar, but they weren\u2019t allowed to join the Bar Association. she and a great-aunt formed the Woman\u2019s Bar Association in the Bronx. I always thought, \u2018I should be a lawyer.\u2019 She was a suffragette \u2014 she fought the fight, and walked the walk. But, when I found out about all the things you had to read, that\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert mentioned that the show, The Good Wife, is \u201cpart law, part politics.\u201d He talked about her husband in the show, who is about to declare for running for president.\n\nShe told Colbert that he is now going to run against Hillary for president. They talked about Hillary\u2019s emails, asking what time Parks and Rec and The Good Wife was on TV. Colbert asked her, \u201cWould you do that? Would you stand by your man?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean, if he slept with hookers?\u201d she said, \u201cIn a weird way, it might be better, because you don\u2019t fall in love with hookers.\u201d\n\nColbert told her, \u201cThat\u2019s a positive way of thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is, Alicia didn\u2019t really stand by him. She sees the gain that she has, in the court room and with the law firm. And, it\u2019s fun to watch Alicia fall to the bottom again, and see it escalate again. They give each other power.\u201d\n\nColbert said, \u201cAnd in a public situation like that, only the other person knows what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nMargulies talked more about what she loved about Hillary and President Obama apparently watching. She said that Obama had written her a letter. She said that they had \u201cdone a story on driverless cars. To her way of thinking, driverless cars should be used only by handicapped people.\n\nBack on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert then introduced author, Jonathan Franzen. Colbert asked him about \u201csprinting\u201d when he came out. Franzen said, \u201cI always sprint when I come out.\u201d\n\nThey talked about Franzen\u2019s book, Purity: A Novel, and Colbert said that he was \u201cone of those people who are serious writers. You say that you want \u2018a serious reader.\u2019 What are serious readers, people who enjoy the book but doesn\u2019t act like it?\u201d\n\nFranzen gave Colbert an example of when he had driven out of his way to meet with a \u201cserious reader,\u201d of his books who was in prison, and had been since he was 22, \u201cfor consensual sex with an underage boy, a 20-year sentence. And, he is somebody who..it\u2019s not good to be a gay guy in the Texas prison system.\u201d Franzen told Colbert that the man told him that reading books in the prison library helped him to stay sane. He said that was \u201ca serious reader.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert said, \u201cIt sounds as if when you mention serious readers, it is one who has a serious need.\u201d\n\nFranzen said, \u201cYes, exactly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, you don\u2019t have to be a snob to be a serious reader,\u201d Franzen said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that there is a God, but if there is a God, His book is doing very well,\u201d Colbert said. He asked Franzen if he cared about the state of the American reader, and how so few adults are now reading novels.\n\nFranzen told him that he had \u201cmistaken him for someone who cares about what people read and do.\u201d He admitted that he liked people to read his books, but he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell them what to do. They have so little free time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t like Twitter,\u201d Stephen Colbert said.\n\nFranzen said that was true, because he did not think many people could express worthwhile sentences and things to say using only 140 characters. Colbert took that as a challenge, and said, \u201cJonathan Franzen said it\u2019s hard to use the word \u2018although,\u2019 although I just did.\u201d\n\nOne hundred forty characters or less, I promise you,\u201d Colbert said. He said he had always thought that the worse name ever for a clown was \u201calthough.\u201d He said, If I tweeted that I liked the book, would you be okay with that? To my 10 million Followers?\u201d\n\nFranzen said that he would \u201cbe okay with that.\u201d Colbert asked him if he ever read any \u201ctrash literature.\u201d Franzen said he did, but he said, \u201cIt\u2019s called NFL Sunday,\u201d which is not exactly, technically, really \u201cliterature.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to read that anymore. It\u2019 available on television,\u201d Colbert said. He added, \u201cYou can take the day off,\u201d more frequently now, since he had become a successful author.\n\n\u201cI did that, basically, with the year 2002,\u201d Franzen said.\n\nColbert asked him how he wrote, or how often\u2026Franzen said he wrote only maybe a dozen words most mornings, but more later in the day. He said that other than that question, most of Colbert\u2019s other questions \u201chad been original and fresh.\u201d\n\nAfter more commercials, Stephen Colbert introduced the group, Alabama Shakes, performing the song Joe, for their latest album, Sound 7 Color. It was an AMAZING song, with an almost Gospel tone to it, as the lead singer put so much passion into the song, saying, \u201cI still ain\u2019t got what I want \u2019cause I ain\u2019t got you.\u201d\n\nThe Late Show ended with Franzen reading Stephen Colbert a \u201cGoodnight story.\u201d He called it, \u201cLittle Red Reading Hood.\u201d It was a pretty interesting short story, with the Wolf being a big company like Amazon.\n\nColbert was great on the Late Show, ripping into both Donald Trump and Ben Carson with barely concealed glee, joking about Star Wars, and other sacred cows. His two main guests, actress Juliana Margulies and author Jonathan Franzen, were entertaining, also. The musical artists, Alabama Shakes, closed out the Late Show with a fantastic song, Joe, off of Sound & Color, their latest album.\n\nBy John Samuels\n\nPhoto by\n\nShare On", "article_metadata": {"dc.description": "On the Late Show this Wednesday, host Stephen Colbert had, as his guests, actress Julianna Margulies from The Good Wife, author Jonathan Franzen, who discussed his", "description": "On the Late Show this Wednesday, host Stephen Colbert had, as his guests, actress Julianna Margulies from The Good Wife, author Jonathan Franzen, who discussed his", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "samuels-j", "og": {"site_name": "CDA News", "description": "On the Late Show this Wednesday, host Stephen Colbert had, as his guests, actress Julianna Margulies from The Good Wife, author Jonathan Franzen, who discussed his novel, Purity: A Novel, and music\u2026", "title": "Stephen Colbert Challenges Donald Trump to Donate $1 Million to Charity", "url": "https://cdanews.com/2015/10/stephen-colbert-challenges-donald-trump-to-donate-1-million-to-charity/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "https://cdanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stephen-Colbert-Challenges-Donald-Trump-to-Donate-1-Million-to-Charity-0001.jpg", "height": 420}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cdanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Stephen-Colbert-Challenges-Donald-Trump-to-Donate-1-Million-to-Charity-0001.jpg?w=640", "site": "@CDA_News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "5B44BCFD3782BE8B1C6B5492818689EF", "dc.publisher": "samuels-j", "dc.date.issued": "2015-10-29", "p": {"domain_verify": "97a56a86de72c5fbe8a77f7299771fe1"}, "dc.language": "en-US", "keywords": "alabama shakes,donald trump,jonathan franzen,julianna margulies,late show,stephen colbert", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-29T08:54:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T08:54:45+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "Stephen Colbert Challenges Donald Trump to Donate <squirrly /> Million to Charity"}, "article_summary": "In addition, Colbert dished about the plot of the new Star Wars movie, and skewered Ben Carson and Donald Trump.\n'\u201dThen, Stephen Colbert announce that tonight, he was \u201ctaking the liberty of writing a million dollar check from Donald Trump to the charity of my choice, the Harlem children\u2019s Fund.\nTrump told him, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d but he argued that it was not very much compared to what he made using the money.\nDonald Trump better watch himself, or Dr. Carson will write him a prescription for 20ccs of \u2018Vitamin Knife.\nShe told Colbert that he is now going to run against Hillary for president."}
