Eating is as much a normal biological function as menstruation.\n\nSecond, ever notice that very many public restrooms lock down the toilet paper in devices that make it difficult for people to steal the rolls?\n\nThat\u2019s because some people actually do steal toilet paper rolls.\n\nThink about tampons and pads for a second.\n\nHow do you distribute them for free in public restrooms without some ladies (well, Emily Post would probably say they aren\u2019t ladies if they are thieves) filling their purse with them?\n\nI suspect it is actually impossible to make tampons and pads free in many restrooms, because they\u2019d continuously be stolen.\n\nIf someone has invented a device that gets around this problem, please, someone email me at info@nationalcenter.org and tell me.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/resource/Tampon_Playtex_Sport.jpeg?fileId=26938458", "description": "I wrote on March 12 about the insane idea that public restrooms &ldquo;owe&rdquo; women fr...", "title": "Socialism in the Bathroom: Insane \"Free Tampons\" Movement Wants to Divert Tuition Funds to\u00a0Tampons - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "article_summary": "I wrote on March 12 about the insane idea that public restrooms \u201cowe\u201d women free tampons if they don\u2019t charge for toilet paper.\nI suspect it is actually impossible to make tampons and pads free in many restrooms, because they\u2019d continuously be stolen.\nSecond, ever notice that very many public restrooms lock down the toilet paper in devices that make it difficult for people to steal the rolls?\nSome go so far as to say universities should offer \"free\" tampons with student tuition money so homeless women can go on campuses to get tampons without paying -- as if tuition on most campuses isn't high enough already.\nThe logic, such as it is, is that if a toiletry item used by both genders (toilet paper) is provided free of charge, then ALL toiletry items used by either gender must be provided free of charge."}
