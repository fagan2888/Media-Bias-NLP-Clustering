INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) — LeBron James says he won’t allow his sore body to slow his drive toward another NBA Finals.

Beaten down by injuries and another grueling season, James has the Cavaliers one win from the Eastern Conference title. On Monday, a day after his 37 points, 18 rebounds and 13 assists lifted Cleveland to a Game 3 overtime victory against Atlanta, James was noticeably tired.

He wore a wrap on his right calf and the four-time league MVP says he’s been undergoing “round-the-clock” treatment.

James returned to Cleveland after four seasons with Miami and says leading the Cavs has been his biggest challenge. The Cavs are without Kevin Love for the playoffs and have played the past two games without All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving.

Coach David Blatt says Irving remains a game-time decision for Game 4.
