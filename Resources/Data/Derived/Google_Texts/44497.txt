UPDATE, 9:40 p.m.: With more than half the boxes fully counted, Stan Pickett retained his sizable lead over John Monaco and will become the next mayor of Mesquite.

“My lifelong commitment to this community in growing up here has really shown up,” Pickett said. “From my high school days through my 30 years of business in town to my 50-plus years of membership at the local church and my 10 years on council have all added to the statement of people that I think understand my leadership abilities.”

Other winners in the area included incumbent Mayors Jim Pruitt of Rockwall and Jim Phaup of Sunnyvale and Mesquite incumbent councilman Dennis Tarpley.

Original post: Over eight elections and more than a dozen years as a Mesquite elected official, Mayor John Monaco has become adept at predicting the number of voters that will turn out in his city’s election.

This year, however, he hesitated to make a prediction, calling the school district’s bond election a “wild card.” Mesquite ISD is asking voters for a record $280 million, mostly for facilities.

More than 3,200 early votes were cast in the city and Monaco finds himself trailing former council comrade Stan Pickett by nearly 15 percent.

School board incumbent Christina Hall is also trailing versus veteran educator Elaine Hornsby Whitlock. It looks as though the bond will cruise, though.

Also in Mesquite, incumbent Dennis Tarpley and 28-year-old Jeff Casper are leading Mesquite’s council races. And in neighboring Sunnyvale, Mayor Jim Phaup won early voting by nearly a 2-to-1 margin over Ronnie Henderson.
