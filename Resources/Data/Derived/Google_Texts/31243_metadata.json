Now that ACA is the law of the land regarding healthcare, all the insurers are scrambling to position themselves in the best possible way.\n\nAnd in this instance, it\u2019s buying up as much real estate (clients) as you can. While smaller insurers that have covered Medicaid patients are winning big in that part of the market, the bigger and growing share is Medicare.\n\nRemember, there are 76.5 million baby boomers that are retired or will be retiring \u2014 and qualifying for Medicare \u2014 over the next two decades. This is a major demographic shift in how the healthcare system operates and the big insurers believe that volume is what will keep them on top.\n\nThat\u2019s why we saw AET swallow HUM in late June.\n\nM&A Madness\n\nUntil that deal was inked, Cigna was actually trying to court Humana. But it wasn\u2019t to be.\n\nNow you have Cigna, UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Anthem (ANTM). UNH is the biggest healthcare insurance provider now, and the AET/HUM merger was made to stay competitive. Now, it looks like Anthem is going to make another attempt at Cigna.\n\nANTM has tried a couple of times to snare CI, but Cigna had its eye on another. In its offer made last month, Anthem offered a 35% premium on where CI stock was trading.\n\nCigna\u2019s options are somewhat limited here, especially if Anthem comes in with a offer equal to or greater than the one the laid out previously.\n\nIf CI doesn\u2019t want the deal, it is going to have to explain to shareholders how finding a small merger partner or two and risking it against consolidating major competitors is somehow better than joining with a major industry player and getting paid a 35% premium to do it.\n\nIt looks like the Big Five will soon become the Big Three, since just this week Cigna and Anthem were back at the table talking terms.\n\nThe thing is, CI stock has been selling off this week as the news accelerates. Perhaps the thinking is that Anthem doesn\u2019t need Cigna as much as Cigna needs Anthem.\n\nThe merger is close to a merger of equals, and still wouldn\u2019t come close to the size of UnitedHealth. But having been spurned so many times, it\u2019s likely that Anthem has other alternatives if CI balks again.\n\nBut at this point, Cigna\u2019s top alternative is off the table. That\u2019s a tough negotiating position to be in. For example, what happens if ANTM plays hardball and now lowers its offer? Can CI afford to hold out for a better deal?\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt the end of the day however, this is all inside pool. The worst-case scenario is someone buys Cigna at a premium, just not 35%. And then management is sent packing as a reward. As a CI stock holder, that\u2019s not something to lose sleep over.\n\nGiven Cigna\u2019s size and market strength, it is a prize worth having, and the only player that can step in and beat ANTM to the prize is UNH, which isn\u2019t likely.\n\nEven if a deal doesn\u2019t happen, CI is in great position to expand its presence in the in sector and can easily buy smaller firms gradually to build its base. And that may be a smarter long-term strategy. But shareholders, talking heads and dealmakers like the drama of big mergers, so that will be the story for now.\n\nBut for the future, CI is a good long-term deal now in a very exciting space.\n\nLouis Navellier is a renowned growth investor.
