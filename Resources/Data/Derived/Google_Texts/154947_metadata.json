After 125 years of faithful, selfless and professional service, we must now bid a tearful \u201cadieu\u201d to our beloved Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother.\n\nWho has had a greater impact on the history of Marshfield? In a nutshell, the sisters taught us how to truly bring healing to people. They accomplished this by the grace of God, as it was always their love for the Lord that fueled their ability to treat each person as if it were Jesus Christ himself. The sisters leave us with an amazing legacy: because they were close to God, the sisters treated both body and soul and their patients always knew and appreciated this; as people of principle, the sisters refused procedures that assault our dignity, thus eschewing things like abortion and vasectomies. Finally, the sisters were wholeheartedly committed to serving this community and that meant even the poor always had access to health care.\n\nWe now pray for Marshfield Clinic and its employees, that they be worthy successors of so noble a model of health care. In this time of change, we turn our gaze to our unchanging God \u2014 may he bless you sisters, one and all!\n\nRev. Sam Martin,\n\npastor of Christ the King in Spencer and St. John the Baptist in Marshfield\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mnhne.ws/1S0a2vE", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Local pastor prays that Marshfield Clinic and its employees can continue Sisters\u2019 work.", "og": {"site_name": "News-Herald Media", "description": "Local pastor prays that Marshfield Clinic and its employees can continue Sisters\u2019 work.", "title": "Sisters leave amazing health care legacy", "url": "http://www.marshfieldnewsherald.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/04/07/sisters-leave-amazing-health-care-legacy/82754430/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/marshfieldnewsherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local pastor prays that Marshfield Clinic and its employees can continue Sisters\u2019 work.", "title": "Sisters leave amazing health care legacy", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2dfc9b9b0f5fb55a29b652221b9891fbe8534a67/c=364-0-1637-1273&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/07/Marshfield/B9321665582Z.1_20160407144026_000_GESE0EIKD.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@mnherald", "site": "@mnherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883744842", "fb": {"app_id": 127108344020788}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "ministry, sisters, sorrowful, st. joseph's, saint joseph's, marshfield, hospital"}, "article_summary": "Finally, the sisters were wholeheartedly committed to serving this community and that meant even the poor always had access to health care.\nWe now pray for Marshfield Clinic and its employees, that they be worthy successors of so noble a model of health care.\nIn this time of change, we turn our gaze to our unchanging God \u2014 may he bless you sisters, one and all!\nThe sisters leave us with an amazing legacy: because they were close to God, the sisters treated both body and soul and their patients always knew and appreciated this; as people of principle, the sisters refused procedures that assault our dignity, thus eschewing things like abortion and vasectomies.\nSam Martin,pastor of Christ the King in Spencer and St. John the Baptist in MarshfieldRead or Share this story: http://mnhne.ws/1S0a2vE"}
