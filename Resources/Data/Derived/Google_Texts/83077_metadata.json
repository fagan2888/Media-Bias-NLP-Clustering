(AP) - New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo met with the relatives of New Yorkers killed by police Tuesday and said he is close to signing an executive order directing the attorney general\u2019s office to investigate such killings.\n\nThe Democrat said the appointment of a special prosecutor would alleviate concerns that local prosecutors are too tied to law enforcement to properly investigate and potentially prosecute killings by police.\n\n\u201cWe have seen it all across the country, where there is a lack of trust in the law enforcement system,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThe criminal justice system does not work without trust\u2026 If there are suspicious circumstances, and a police officer kills someone who is unarmed and not dangerous, the obvious question is why.\u201d\n\nAmong the relatives who met with Cuomo was Gwen Carr, whose son Eric Garner died last year in a police chokehold in Staten Island. No officers were indicted in the death. About 50 advocates and family members rallied Tuesday afternoon in front of Cuomo\u2019s Manhattan office.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here until everything we ask for is done because we don\u2019t want another killing by police,\u201d Carr said. She said she believed Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is \u201cvery capable\u201d to act as a special prosecutor and \u201cis better than what we have right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not for us, this is for all the families that come after us,\u201d said Constance Malcom, the mother of 18-year-old Ramarley Graham, who was shot and killed by an NYPD officer in the Bronx in 2012.\n\nCuomo initially said he planned to sign the executive order on Tuesday but Tuesday afternoon his spokeswoman said it was still being finalized and would be signed soon.\n\nProsecutors and police groups have criticized the idea of a special prosecutor as unnecessary. On Tuesday Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association, released a statement saying \u201cmany levels of oversight\u201d already exist.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that there will be pressure on a special prosecutor to indict an officer for the sake of public perception and that does not serve the ends of justice,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York Gov.
