But as need to allocate California\u2019s dwindling water resources intensified this year, it suddenly became necessary to justify the continued existence of some of the state\u2019s most endangered species. House Republicans in February attempted to override the Endangered Species Act in the interest of pumping more water out of the San Joaquin-Sacramento River Delta, calling the federally threatened delta smelt, which their bill would have doomed to extinction, a \u201cstupid little fish.\u201d\n\nConservation biologist Christopher Norment begs to disagree. \u201cThere is water enough in the desert if you live properly,\u201d he writes, and the real problem comes from the \u201cbulldozers and pipelines, pumps and wells, ditches and dams, lawns and lakes, fields of alfalfa and fields of houses, and the thousands and millions of people living a few miles or a few hundred miles away from the waters,\u201d \u2014 in short, from our tendency to live as though water were a limitless resource.\n\n\u201cRelicts of a Beautiful Sea\u201d is Norment\u2019s lyrical natural history of six Great Basin species \u2014 the Inyo Mountains slender salamander, the black toad and four types of pupfishes \u2014 that are dependent on water and yet live in a place where that resource is in alarmingly short supply. All are toeing the line of extinction, and are so rare that you\u2019ve probably never heard of them. But they\u2019re worth protecting, Norment argues, and the choice to do so doesn\u2019t have to come at the great expense some hard-line Republicans suggest.\n\nNorment spoke with Salon about the personal inspiration he takes from these resilient species, and about the reasons \u2014 beyond mere practicality \u2014 why preserving biodiversity continues to matter. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nI wanted to start with your approach. How did you choose to feature these six species? What it was about them that you found unique and book-worthy?\n\nTo go back just a little bit, my first job as a biologist way back in the \u201970s was working in the Death Valley area. I was focused there on large mammals. But when I was up in Death Valley, I really grew to love that portion of the American Southwest, the Mojave Desert, and when it came time for a sabbatical, I wanted to go back to that part of the world. So there was sort of this landscape aesthetic that was really important to me. But I also wanted to work on species that were really different from the ones that I typically worked on \u2014 I wanted to get away from birds and mammals. At the same time, I started hearing stories about the Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish and some of the role that it\u2019s played in conservation controversies in that part of the world. I\u2019ve also had a fascination with species that live on or in islands. So as I started working out there in 2009 and 2010, the species that I wanted to focus on just started adding themselves to the list.\n\nThe first one was the the Inyo Mountain slender salamander, and as I talk about in the book, I remember walking up into this heat-blasted canyon, and I knew that the species was supposed to be there because I\u2019d read some of the papers on it, but to actually flip a rock and find one of these creatures that is so dependent on water \u2026 I mean, there is a trickle of water there, and that\u2019s where they\u2019re restricted to. They just shouldn\u2019t be there. There are only two desert salamanders in the world, both of them are in the Mojave Desert, and it was just stunning to me. I was overwhelmed, in a sense, by it. And very curious about them, and so I started exploring that species.\n\nSo they told one story about the American Southwest and about water, and their sort of survival, if you will, but then there were other kinds of stories out there. Like there was a story of near-extinction in the case of the Owens pupfish and now the Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish. But there is also a story about how a seemingly insignificant species occurring in one very, very small part of the world can have very, very strong effects on development, on water use. I mean, the Devil\u2019s Hole pupfish \u2014 this tiny little creature that weighs about one raisin, half of a gram, and is about an inch and a half long \u2014 has dramatically affected how water is used in the Southwest. I mean, that\u2019s a very interesting, and to me, compelling, story.\n\nAnd the Salt Creek and Cottonball Marsh pupfishes are evolved from freshwater fish, and yet they live in environments that may be twice or even three times as salty as the ocean. You walk out on the salt pan on Death Valley, and you find fish out there. There\u2019s something to me that is just spectacular about it. I thought I was going to do a typical scientific research project, but I realized several things: first of all, logistically, given the fact that I\u2019m back in New York State, it would be very hard to do this kind of intensive research that would result in a series of technical papers. But also, there was something about their mystery that was very attractive to me, and I thought, \u201cThis is what I\u2019d like to focus on.\u201d I\u2019d like to focus on their stories, and tell their stories in a way that hopefully will draw other people into them, make them concerned about these species, and by extension, other little-known species, the ones that aren\u2019t the charismatic mega-vertebrates.\n\nThat problem you mention of allocating these limited water resources from humans in order to protect the pupfish is becoming more controversial as California\u2019s drought worsens. I\u2019m wondering, how did you even begin to draw that line? How do you decide how much we can afford to allocate to a species like that?\n\nWell first of all, as with so many problems in our world, I\u2019m very wary of false dichotomies. In other words, it\u2019s either the pupfish or it\u2019s the people. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever that easy. To me, what the pupfish and these other species are saying is, if we\u2019re going to persist in this environment, there\u2019s going to have to be wise water use on the part of people. And water use in that part of the world has often not been very wise. And it\u2019s gotten us into a lot of problems. So to me, theses species are a valuable resource, and they can tell us about how best to use water and how to use it in a way that is sustainable and that can hopefully nourish the people of California, the people of Nevada, the people of Arizona. But if we don\u2019t \u2014 if the drought continues, water levels keep going down in the Colorado River basin, groundwater keeps getting depleted in California, etc. \u2014 then, alright, we kill off these species, but we\u2019re still going to have the same problems, only we\u2019re not going to have these species that, to me, are valuable and worth protecting.\n\nSo I think there can be both: these species can persevere, and humans also can have their water. Maybe not as much as they want, but hopefully as much as they need. I really do believe that there\u2019s water enough in the desert if you use it properly. But it\u2019s going to take some shift in terms of how we think about water and its use. And I think actually Karen Piper made this point in her interview: she said that when we think about water, we don\u2019t think about it in terms of local or even regional carrying capacity. We think about it sort of almost at a much larger level, in other words, if Las Vegas doesn\u2019t have enough water that\u2019s available to it locally or even from the Colorado River, well, we\u2019ll just get it from somewhere else. We\u2019ll get it from northern Nevada, we\u2019ll go ahead and deplete their water resources, and on and on, well then maybe there\u2019s this Mississippi River, maybe there\u2019s a Great Lakes, maybe there\u2019s a Columbia River, etc. As Las Vegas had been developing, if they were thinking within the context of not depleting their local groundwater, and also not over-using the Colorado River, maybe they would be in a better situation than they are now.\n\nA lot of the situations you explore in your book examine these extremely local conflicts. I\u2019m thinking about Gary Giocomini, this person you write about who\u2019s grappling with the fact that he could be responsible personally for wiping a species off the planet.\n\nRight, and Giacomini\u2019s a rancher: he wants water for his cows, for alfalfa, whatever. But when you actually sit down and talk to people like him, it\u2019s not that they don\u2019t have a concern for those species and that they don\u2019t want them to persist. But of course they also want to make a living from the land. In the case of the Owens pupfish, I personally think that there\u2019s enough water for his cows and there\u2019s enough water for the fish. Maybe not quite as much water as Garry would want, maybe not quite as much water for the pupfish as I might want, but we can reach some kind of a compromise. Now it may not always be practical; there may be cases where it won\u2019t happen, but I think in a lot of cases it can.\n\nThere was that House Resolution last year, the Sacramento of San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act. And basically what it was doing was to preempt state and federal endangered species laws that protect the delta smelt. And my view, and a lot of people\u2019s views, is it would do nothing to alleviate California\u2019s long-term water shortages. It was opposed by the Obama administration, California\u2019s governor, state agencies, etc. Luckily it stalled in the Senate and has never become law, but to me, it\u2019s sort of the easy answer: let\u2019s blame the endangered species. Let\u2019s blame environmental laws for some of these issues.\n\nThere\u2019s an ideological factor there.\n\nRight. Oh yeah, I mean, drought is interpreted ideologically; it\u2019s the same way that climate change is interpreted ideologically. And so back in 2009, the Wall Street Journal talked about the \u201cgovernment-made drought,\u201d and if you go and look at the website of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources, they say basically the same thing. Humans don\u2019t like to think that certain aspects of nature are beyond their control. And what happens with precipitation in California and other parts of the arid West, well, we don\u2019t have a lot to say about it. I guess we have a lot to say about how we use the water, but we\u2019d better use it in a wise way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"There is water enough in the desert if you live properly,\" conservation biologist Christopher Norment tells Salon", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"There is water enough in the desert if you live properly,\" conservation biologist Christopher Norment tells Salon", "title": "California\u2019s war on endangered species: Why its most water-dependent creatures are worth saving", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/12/californias_war_on_endangered_species_why_its_most_water_dependent_creatures_are_worth_saving/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/california_wildfire.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"There is water enough in the desert if you live properly,\" conservation biologist Christopher Norment tells Salon", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/california_wildfire.jpg", "title": "California\u2019s war on endangered species: Why its most water-dependent creatures are worth saving", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "California\u2019s war on endangered species: Why its most water-dependent creatures are worth saving", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, California Drought, Conservation, endangered species, Endangered Species Act, House Republicans, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, wildlife", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc4a\"", "article_summary": "Topics: California Drought, Conservation, endangered species, Endangered Species Act, House Republicans, U.S.\nWe\u2019ll get it from northern Nevada, we\u2019ll go ahead and deplete their water resources, and on and on, well then maybe there\u2019s this Mississippi River, maybe there\u2019s a Great Lakes, maybe there\u2019s a Columbia River, etc.\nI really do believe that there\u2019s water enough in the desert if you use it properly.\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever that easy.\nAnd basically what it was doing was to preempt state and federal endangered species laws that protect the delta smelt."}
