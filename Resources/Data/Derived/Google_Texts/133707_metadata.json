(Photo: ~File photo) Story Highlights More than 1,400 residents sign petition opposing facility\n\nHILLSBOROUGH \u2013 The New Jersey Racing Commission has decided to release to the public the application to locate an off-track wagering (OTW) facility in a former Route 206 restaurant.\n\nThe application will be posted on the township\u2019s website once it is received, said Mayor Doug Tomson. That is expected early this week.\n\nAssemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R-District 16), a township resident, said the decision to allow public review of the application for an off-track wagering facility in the former Maestro 206 restaurant is in the best interest of the public.\n\nMore than 1,400 residents have signed a petition opposing the facility, which would be known as Favorites at Hillsborough and would be operated by the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association.\n\nCiattarelli and Tomson expressed concerns with the approval process at the commission\u2019s final public hearing last week at Hillsborough High School attended by more than 100 residents.\n\n\u201cWhile the public comment period has ended, the Racing Commission made the right decision to allow the public to review the developer's application,\u201d said Ciattarelli. \u201cThe OTW approval process has been more than frustrating and the lack of transparency has only added insult to injury.\u201d\n\nLast year, Ciattarelli introduced legislation that would reverse a section of law changed in 2011 that eliminates a municipality\u2019s right to have the final say on whether or not an off-track wagering business could operate within its borders.\n\nThe bill, co-sponsored by Ciattarelli\u2019s district colleagues, state Sen. Chrstopher \u201cKip\u201d Bateman and Assemblywoman Donna Simon, would restore the power of municipalities to reject a proposed off-track wagering facility, and to remove the five-year tax exemption, abatement or payment in-lieu-of taxes for privately operated off-track wagering facilities.\n\nThe bill has not advanced in the state Legislature.\n\n\u201cThe decision to release the application, though late in coming, is a positive development,\u201d Ciattarelli said. \u201cLike any other application that goes before a local land use board, citizens should be allowed to review this OTW application.\u201d\n\nTomson also said he was pleased that the application would be made public.\n\n\u201cHome rule empowers communities to have a say in what happens in their town and should be respected,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cPermitting an OTW facility to operate in Hillsborough, or any town, should be decided by the municipality, not the Racing Commission. This may work in some towns, but not necessarily in Hillsborough. I appreciate the commission disclosing the application so the public can examine it thoroughly.\u201d\n\nThe facility would have seating for about 174 patrons and have about 80 employees with 40 in the wagering operation and 40 in the restaurant business. The facility is expected to generate about $20 million in annual revenue.\n\nStaff Writer Mike Deak: 908-243-6607; mdeak@mycentraljersey.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1N2zdKm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The New Jersey Racing Commission has decided to release to the public an the application to locate an off-track wagering (OTW) facility in a former Route 206 restaurant in n Hillsborough.
