When there was variation or disagreement as to the translation, both were used.\n\nAfter finishing their respective assignments, the small groups presented their work to the larger group. It was a kind of editing session as young speakers typed the translations\u2014and their English equivalents\u2014projected on a screen. Now all first-speaker elders were able to discuss, confirm or modify a translated word.\n\nAll concurred that Red Lake immersion programs will use the \u201cdouble vowel\u201d system as developed and presented in the Nichols/Nyholm dictionary. The double vowel system is used at Ojibwemowin immersion schools, public schools, and colleges. It is the preferred spelling used in Ojibwemowin books.\n\nThe effort is part of the coming Head Start Immersion Classroom. Zack Mitteness will be the lead teacher along with Marcus Tyler. They will join guiding elders, Frances Miller and Elizabeth \u201cPug\u201d Kingbird. Elizabeth Strong is the program coordinator and Liz White is the family coordinator for the program. The first immersion Head Start school classroom will open this fall.\n\nThe group hopes to develop immersion school project partners, including a collaboration of skilled and fluent speaking community members. Partners would include the Red Lake School District, Head Start, and Red Lake Nation College.\n\nGuiding Elders, teachers and other staff have been observing and learning for some time at Niigaane Immersion School near Cass Lake, Minnesota. The Master Apprentice Program will work on strategies for learning the language.\n\n\u201cFluent speaking elders will be key,\u201d said Frances Miller. \u201cThey may need to be encouraged to share their knowledge, give advice, and participate in this important initiative.\u201d\n\nRed Lake Nation Language Revitalization Plan, Vision and Mission\n\nIt is our vision that within 10 years Red Lake will have a younger generation of fluent speakers that promote the language and culture in our communities and act as leaders for the next seven generations. It is our mission to promote this vision through an immersion school as well as through a variety of other initiatives.\n\nThe team meets monthly at various locations.
