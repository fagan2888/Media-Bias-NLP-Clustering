Ted Cruz (R) with Jake Tapper on Sunday\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) thinks a Donald Trump presidency would be \u201ca grave mistake.\u201d But, he reaffirmed Sunday, he would support him as the GOP presidential nominee anyway.\n\nOn CNN\u2019s State of the Union host Jake Tapper asked Cruz on Sunday about recent denunciations of Trump by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and other conservatives.\n\nCruz joined in on the attacks, blasting Trump for his historical support of Planned Parenthood and late-term abortion rights, his promise to \u201cstay neutral between Israel and the Palestinians,\u201d and his \u201clongtime support of expanding Obamacare into Bernie Sanders-style socialized medicine, putting the government in charge of your health care, putting government bureaucrats into a position to ration your care, especially that of seniors.\u201d\n\nNoting that like Cruz has suggested Trump presidency would be \u201ca grave mistake,\u201d host Jake Tapper asked if he would still support his rival should he win the nomination.\n\n\u201cI will support the Republican nominee. Period. The end,\u201d Cruz replied.\n\nWatch the video:\n\n\n\nStill, Cruz warned that Trump could be a total disaster. \u201cIf Donald becomes president, who the heck knows what he would do? Even Donald doesn\u2019t know what he would do. I think the challenges facing the nation, they\u2019re too grave to roll the dice.\u201d\n\nMoments later, Tapper asked Gov. John Kasich (R-OH) if he will also still back Trump as the nominee. Kasich responded that non-candidates don\u2019t understand what it is like to be in the arena and assured Tapper, \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m going to support that person who came through the arena and became the nominee.\u201d\n\nAll of the GOP candidates took a solemn oath to back their party\u2019s nominee, no matter who it is.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I will support the Republican nominee.
