But they could end up driving prices higher, some experts said.\n\nA.J. Loiacono, with the pharmacy benefit software company Truveris, recently gave a demo of his company\u2019s app OneRx to the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers.\n\nHe looked up the cost of a common antibiotic in the city.\n\n\u201cYou could see there is a wide disparity in the prices where it goes down from $20 to a high for $61,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we look at the map, Walgreens about two to three blocks away is the lowest price.\u201d\n\nOneRx is one of about a dozen apps that promises to help consumers get the best deals on prescription drugs. Beyond comparison shopping, the service also offer consumers retail discounts and coupons from drug makers. More than 3 million people use GoodRx, the largest of these apps every month.\n\n\u201cIt can be a useful tool, but it\u2019s a little bit more squishy that it might appear,\u201d said Lisa Gill, an editor at Consumer Reports.\n\nGill preached caution after dispatching a team of secret shoppers to test the reliability of the apps. Sometimes, she said, the apps were wrong about prices.\n\n\u201cThe apps might tell you that we can guarantee these prices, but it\u2019s not a promise,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother knock on this software is that it promotes drug maker coupons. Clearly, some consumers benefit because it\u2019s either the coupons or go without the drug.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s also like a wolf\u2019s in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d said Northwestern economist Leemore Dafny.\n\nShe said what makes coupons pernicious is that patients avoid their share of a pricey drug, but the insurer still pays its share. In other words, we consumers get around the blockade insurers set up \u2013 high co-pays \u2013 and drug makers are off to the bank.\n\n\u201cI assure you that pharmaceutical companies are not issuing these coupons because they are reducing revenue. Return on investment on these things is 4-6 times spending,\u201d she said.\n\nThe real problem, said Dafny, is coupons undermine insurers leverage to negotiate lower prices.\n\nAnd the more money insurers spend this year on these expensive drugs, the higher our premiums will be next year.\n\nAs this new drug app industry takes off, it likely means more coupons getting redeemed.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "application-name": "Marketplace from APM", "og": {"url": "http://www.marketplace.org/2015/11/12/health-care/promise-and-problems-drug-finding-apps", "image": "http://cms.marketplace.org/sites/default/files/styles/primary-image-900x500/public/prescription%20drugs.jpg?itok=3NDxOevc", "type": "article", "description": "They help consumers find lower prices, but there's more to it than that.", "title": "The promise and problems of drug-finding apps"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Marketplace"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/assets/mstile-70x70-797ef1ac7d8ffe040b98bab7140abf109b307280019c7d5c16c614ac6f66319d.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/assets/mstile-310x310-9380546aaae2d32ed4a1460d4ffac0ddd0197d240c08a97d9ba80e663f2f42e2.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/assets/mstile-310x150-11f7c8519056bc96bf2540c4b2aa8564178ebcae2594d3e8fb28d480f2c5cd8a.png", "csrf-token": "uwfi3WT5UGjhzdCZi8vmnQcYcF6khb+8W3Q3287+xDfURCD6FePPDfS3qbX3nm9l9ZFgmQYItNMrfUdWtIqeqw==", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/mstile-144x144-a9640051fbfb73c1de9771231343135b5f79295e3f98bb1cb87854aa6a74f8c8.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/assets/mstile-150x150-1d103d04b61aaa10bb165f225c46e694338b92918bc7a7ca2b99b54bdd1bbc0c.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That means more and more of us pay for prescription drugs out of our own pockets.\n\u201cThe apps might tell you that we can guarantee these prices, but it\u2019s not a promise,\u201d she said.\nOut-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs is increasing.\nA growing number of companies say one solution to spending less may be in the palm of our hands \u2013 smartphone apps that help find consumer find cheap prices.\nGill preached caution after dispatching a team of secret shoppers to test the reliability of the apps."}
