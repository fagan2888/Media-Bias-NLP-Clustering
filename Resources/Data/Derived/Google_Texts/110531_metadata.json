[This has] happened to me three times. It takes a toll on you trying to get your life back, to be in survival mode all the time.\u201d\n\nBankrupt cancer patients also may not have received adequate or timely treatment, Ramsey said, either because they couldn\u2019t afford it or because they refused it, not wanting to burden their families further. Previous studies have shown that in some cases, cancer patients in financial distress will refuse or miss treatment because of its high cost.\n\n\u201cThere may have been significant delays due to patients having to deal with the financial issues or even perhaps with the institutions that were treating them stopping due to them going into receivership,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t looked at this but it is certainly feasible. [Maybe] the centers are still offering therapy but the patients just stop coming because their bills are piling up and they say, \u2018My family\u2019s already devastated and any more treatment is going to put them further in the hole.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of stuff in between [bankruptcy and mortality] that we don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s why we want to do more research.\u201d\n\nWhile there are questions about what, exactly, led to patients\u2019 deaths, no research is necessary to understand how a cancer diagnosis could bankrupt someone.\n\nThe cost of cancer drugs has soared in the last decade; ditto for the out-of-pocket share patients are expected to pay. Insurance plans have become more expensive with higher premiums, higher deductibles and higher copays and cancer care often entails pricey surgeries, chemotherapy infusions, targeted treatments and weeks of radiation.\n\n\u201cPeople will rack up a quarter million dollars in bills in one year,\u201d he said, adding that even patients with insurance may find themselves overwhelmed by debt.\n\n\u201cI think the general public can\u2019t assume that insurance is going to cover everything anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cOr that they\u2019re going to come out the other end financially intact. I think most people should worry just a little bit, unless they\u2019re Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. A lot of people live paycheck to paycheck. They don\u2019t have those kinds of reserves.\u201d\n\nCycle of medical debt\n\nEven those with reserves have found themselves buried under debt.\n\nAfter weathering her first diagnosis (and its related financial hit) at age 29, Bernstein started socking money away as soon as she was back on her feet \u2013 just in case.\n\n\u201cInstead of buying a house and doing what all my peers were doing, something told me I needed to have an emergency fund,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd 11 years after the first diagnosis \u2013 boom! \u2013 I got the second one.\u201d\n\nThis time around, she had cancer in her other breast. At age 40, Bernstein started off on what she thought would be a routine lumpectomy and radiation regimen but was soon hit by complications, infections, an ER visit, a slew of follow-up appointments and, of course, all of the accompanying bills. To make matters worse, she wasn\u2019t able to work because of treatment side effects, a common scenario with young cancer patients.\n\n\u201cI thought, I\u2019ve done this before and I have the financial reserves, but radiation basically cut my legs off,\u201d she said. \u201cI lived upstairs in a building with no elevator and it was like climbing Mount Kilimanjaro every day. I wasn\u2019t able to work. The fatigue wouldn\u2019t dissipate.\u201d\n\nHer nest egg dwindled to nothing while she recovered and, eventually, started working again. But four years later in 2009, cancer came back. This time, she had to have a double mastectomy and chemo and began the process of breast reconstruction. But again, she ran into complications leading to more hospitalizations and even more debt.\n\n\u201cBy the time I was diagnosed for the third time, I\u2019d used up all of my money, all of my investments, all of my savings,\u201d she said. \u201cA year and a half after treatment, I couldn\u2019t afford my rent-controlled apartment anymore because I wasn\u2019t back on my feet enough to work. I had to move out and stay with friends and start rebuilding. I have bills that need to be paid off but I can\u2019t go into it or I\u2019ll likely have a panic attack. Basically, advocacy and the realization that I could [use this] ordeal \u2026 to help others is one of the very few things that has kept me \u2018alive\u2019 and fighting to rebuild my life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study conducted by Fred Hutch's HICOR group has found that the 3 percent of cancer patients who go bankrupt are more likely to die.
