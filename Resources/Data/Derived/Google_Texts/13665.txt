SANIBEL, Florida-

A man from Cape Coral has reportedly caught the largest “bottom fish” ever from a kayak in Sanibel.

According to the video description provided by Chew On This, the man in the kayak is Jon Black from the Crazy Lure Tackle Shop. The fish, a giant grouper, measured in at 83 inches long, over 73 inches in girth, and weighing an estimated 552 pounds.
