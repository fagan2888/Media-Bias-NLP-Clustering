CMS has not decided yet the amount of 2015 payments.\n\n\u201cThis affects 2014 and 2015 payments (whatever those will be). We don\u2019t have final numbers,\u201d Eich said.\n\nTo encourage health plan participation in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, federal officials created a temporary \"premium stabilization program\" and \"risk corridors\" in which all health insurers were taxed based on premiums. The collected funds would be disbursed to those plans posting losses to stabilize the market for the first few years of the exchange.\n\nConsumers Mutual posted multimillion financial losses in 2014 and has posted financial losses so far this year, sources told Crain's. Consumers Mutual declined to provide financial information until later November, when it must file with DIFS for 2014.\n\nIn May 2012, Consumers Mutual received a $72 million low-interest federal loan to form a new nonprofit cooperative mutual insurance company under the Affordable Care Act. Under the terms of the loan, it must be repaid by 2033 to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nConsumers was created after 15 county health plans in Michigan decided to contribute $10,000 each to fund the loan application for the cooperative with CMS. It is not clear who would be responsible for paying back any of the loans, after all the claims are paid by Consumers.\n\nA spokesman from DIFS declined comment on talks or the future of Consumers Mutual.\n\nIn 2013, Consumers, which was one of 24 federally funded cooperatives that received $2 billion in loans, was awarded its insurance license from the state insurance department.\n\nAt least eight of the cooperatives so far have shut down because of financial losses. They include co-ops in Kentucky, Colorado, Louisiana, New York, Nevada, Tennessee and Oregon.\n\nIn August, the HHS said 22 of the 23 cooperatives lost money in 2014 and many could have difficulty in repaying the federal loans.\n\nAt the time Consumers Mutual was chartered, Litos told Crain's that cooperatives like Consumers would serve as lower-cost alternatives to private health insurers on the various state and federally run exchanges.\n\nFederal officials also envisioned the co-ops as providing competition to private insurers in the case where few chose to participate in various states.\n\nIn Michigan, however, more than a dozen health insurers have signed up the past three years to offer insurance policies on the exchanges.\n\nIn 2016, 15 health insurers submitted applications to participate in the Michigan Health Insurance Exchange. Insurers offering individual plans are:\n\nAlliance Health and Life Insurance Co.\n\nBlue Care Network of Michigan\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan\n\nHarbor Health Plan\n\nHealth Alliance Plan\n\nHumana Medical Plan of Michigan\n\nMcLaren Health Plan Community\n\nMeridian Health Plan of Michigan\n\nMolina Healthcare of Michigan\n\nPhysicians Health Plan\n\nPriority Health\n\nPriority Health insurance Co.\n\nTotal Health Care USA\n\nUnited Healthcare Community Plan\n\nInsurers also offering small group plans are Blue Care, McLaren, Total and United Healthcare Life Insurance Co.\n\nBlue Cross also is offering multistate plans on the exchange.\n\nRelated Links", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Officials for East Lansing-based Consumers Mutual Insurance Co. of Michigan, which is not participating in the state health insurance exchange for 2016, are discussing the future of the co-op with state insurance officials as it faces financial challenges.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Detroit Business", "description": "Officials for East Lansing-based Consumers Mutual Insurance Co. of Michigan, which is not participating in the state health insurance exchange for 2016, are discussing the future of the co-op with state insurance officials as it faces financial challenges.", "title": "Consumers Mutual co-op could wind down operations", "url": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20151102/BLOG010/151109975/consumers-mutual-co-op-could-wind-down-operations", "image": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/cceimg?Site=CD&Module=330&Class=3301&Type=33011&Date=20120821&ID=2764913&MaxW=1400&MaxH=1400", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainsdetroit", "card": "summary", "account_id": 29209404}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b51218", "fb": {"app_id": 112806662066559}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "BLOG", "tag": "Health care reform", "published_time": "2015-11-02T12:15:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T15:43:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainsdetroit.com/section/blog010/jay-greene"}, "verify-v1": "qPvWKmNahUcs8XBgUi+fy3A5YH6uzhhairJpQFCqXMs=", "theme-color": "#b51218"}, "article_summary": "It appears that East Lansing-based Consumers Mutual Insurance of Michigan could wind down operations this year as it is not participating in the state health insurance exchange for 2016.\nConsumers Mutual posted multimillion financial losses in 2014 and has posted financial losses so far this year, sources told Crain's.\nIn May 2012, Consumers Mutual received a $72 million low-interest federal loan to form a new nonprofit cooperative mutual insurance company under the Affordable Care Act.\nBut officials of Consumers Mutual today are discussing several options that could determine its future status with the state Department of Insurance and Financial Services, said David Eich, marketing and public relations officer with Consumers Mutual.\nA spokesman from DIFS declined comment on talks or the future of Consumers Mutual."}
