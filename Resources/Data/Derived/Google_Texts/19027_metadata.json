That's why the Congressional Budget Office has always scored Obamacare as a net deficit reducer over time.\n\nBut Utah lawmakers, rejecting first the ACA and then Utah Gov. Gary Herbert's Healthy Utah alternative, were frozen with worry over how to pay for the program.\n\nIn order to drag the matter out for three years, the blockade in the Utah House had to willfully ignore two facts:\n\n1) Delaying Medicaid expansion, or some alternative, would leave tens of thousands of Utah residents without access to health care. The result would be \u2014 has been \u2014 unnecessary suffering and preventable deaths.\n\nIt does appear that one of those deaths, the loss of activist Carol Frisby to an untreated case of colon cancer, made an impression on lawmakers that the statistical argument never did.\n\n2) Accepting Medicaid expansion, or some alternative, could not be anything but a net financial benefit, both to government and to the state's overall economy.\n\nIt would relieve government of substantial costs for treating prison inmates, the mentally ill and those with substance abuse problems. It would be a huge boost to the state's large and growing health care sector \u2014 one part of the economy that can't be off-shored \u2014 slashing the amount of unpaid care given, creating jobs and multiplying though the economy in the same way that federal money spent on, say, Hill Air Force Base benefits all of Utah.\n\nThe Utah Hospital Association has long accepted the idea that it should help pay for health care access expansion. Doctors and the pharmacy industry, we are told, were less accommodating. But the greatly increased number of paying customers they will receive will far offset any new taxes or fees they might be assessed.\n\nThe Legislature should make this deal, speed through the numerous loose ends, expand access to health care, and start avoiding those avoidable deaths.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Of course Utah should tax hospitals, clinics and other health care providers for part of the revenue stream that will be necessary to pay for its version of Medicaid expansion into the future.
