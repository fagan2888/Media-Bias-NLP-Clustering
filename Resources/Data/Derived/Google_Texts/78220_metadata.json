New York is an exception. As a result of the state Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling in Aliessa v. Novello in 2001, PRUCOL residents qualify for Medicaid and a few other safety-net programs, according to the Empire Justice Center, a nonprofit law firm.\n\nIn 2010, there were around 625,000 immigrants living without documentation in New York state, according to the Pew Research Center. Upward of 250,000 of these could qualify for the state\u2019s Medicaid program as a result of the president\u2019s recent move on immigration, and the additional cost of insuring them would fall solely on New York state.\n\nNew York had 5.3 million residents enrolled in Medicaid in 2013.\n\nState Burden\n\nThe state is already receiving reimbursements from the federal government for its emergency Medicaid program, where the majority of recipients are immigrants who have entered illegally. In 2011, New York received $528 million for emergency Medicaid that treated 30,000 people, according to NPR.\n\nNew York state\u2019s Department of Health (DOH) has a budget of $17 billion for Medicaid for the 2015 fiscal year. If projected spending is expected to exceed that amount, the DOH will implement a \u201cMedicaid Savings Allocation Plan\u201d with the Division of the Budget to rein in spending, according to the DOH website.\n\nAsked about the potential impact the new immigration policy could have, a DOH spokesperson said that the DOH \u201cis reviewing the president\u2019s executive order.\u201d\n\nAlthough the state government accrued a $5 billion surplus this year, both Gov. Andrew Cuomo and State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver have said that the surplus should be spent on one-time projects like infrastructure.\n\nNew York workers who have immigrated illegally are still ineligible for the federal Medicaid program and \u201cObamacare.\u201d In September, 115,000 people lost their health coverage under Obamacare after they failed to provide proof of citizenship or immigration status.\n\nThe shift in immigration policy is also expected to boost enrollment in Obamacare by residents who were previously eligible, but were deterred that registration would put a family member at risk for deportation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Starting in 2015, as a result of President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, New York state\u2019s Medicaid program could add hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are living here illegally.", "og": {"site_name": "The Epoch Times", "description": "Starting in 2015, as a result of President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, New York state\u2019s Medicaid program could add hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are living here illegally.", "title": "Medicaid Eligibility Expands as a Result of New Immigration Policy", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2014/11/24/185352883-674x449.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-24T20:07:41-05:00", "url": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/1101803-medicaid-eligibility-expands-as-a-result-of-new-immigration-policy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Epoch Times", "description": "Starting in 2015, as a result of President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, New York state\u2019s Medicaid program could add hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are living here illegally.", "creator": "@zhou___", "image": {"src": "http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/eet-content/uploads/2014/11/24/185352883.jpg"}, "title": "Medicaid Eligibility Expands as a Result of New Immigration Policy", "site": "@EpochTimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "immigration law, New York, NY News", "fb": {"admins": 10205921529470972, "pages": 92239399265}, "date": "November 24, 2014 8:07 pm", "article": {"section": "NY News", "tag": "immigration law", "published_time": "2014-11-24T20:06:57-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-24T20:07:41-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK\u2014Starting in 2015, as a result of President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, New York state\u2019s Medicaid program could add hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are living here illegally.\nIn 2010, there were around 625,000 immigrants living without documentation in New York state, according to the Pew Research Center.\nNew York state\u2019s Department of Health (DOH) has a budget of $17 billion for Medicaid for the 2015 fiscal year.\nPRUCOL residents are rarely eligible for state Medicaid programs.\nUpward of 250,000 of these could qualify for the state\u2019s Medicaid program as a result of the president\u2019s recent move on immigration, and the additional cost of insuring them would fall solely on New York state."}
