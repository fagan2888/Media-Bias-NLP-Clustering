But finding anyone who\u2019s actually received or even seen such a gift is another matter.\n\nIn Badiraguato, the small mountain town that is part of Guzman\u2019s rags-to-crime riches mythology, none of the two dozen people interviewed by The Associated Press could point out evidence of his legendary largesse.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a single building producing jobs, a single piece of public works, a soccer field, a sewer, a school, water systems, a clinic or hospital, not a single one that you can say was built by drug traffickers or their money,\u201d Mayor Mario Valenzuela said.\n\nIf Guzman or his cartel had invested in their hometowns, he said, \u201cthey\u2019d look different: They would have paved roads or drainage systems, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGuzman\u2019s escape on July 11 from a prison near Mexico City has focused attention again on Badiraguato, the county seat of a township that includes the hamlet of La Tuna, where El Chapo\u2019s mother still lives.\n\nThe roads to La Tuna are still washed-out dirt tracks, and Badiraguato itself has none of the flashy accoutrements of money \u2014 luxury car dealerships, palatial mausoleums, acres of fancy, gated communities of new homes, or dozens of street money-changers offering cheap dollars \u2014 that are abundant in Culiacan, the state capital, 1 1/2 hours away. The town\u2019s big projects include a new balcony for the town hall that looks out over the sleepy square dominated by a 19th-century church, where residents seek shade from the punishing Sinaloa sun.\n\nTucked into the foothills where the coastal stretches of flat corn and tomato fields meet the imposing mountains of the Sierra Madre, Badiraguato remains mired in poverty, Valenzuela acknowledges that many of the township\u2019s residents make a living growing marijuana or opium poppies.\n\nGuzman grew up here, the son of a poor famer. His rise as a crime boss has been surrounded by mythology, a Hollywood version of an old-school Mafioso \u2014 ruthless, but yet honorable. Songs have been written in his honor and some locals extol him as a Robin Hood-type figure who is careful to leave innocents out of his deadly score-settlings.\n\n\u201cChapo Guzman isn\u2019t violent,\u201d Valenzuela said about a man accused of hundreds of murders. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t shoot it out with the government.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s unlike the reputation of the New Generation Jalisco cartel to the south, which is alleged to have brought down a military helicopter May 1 with a rocket-propelled missile. Or the Zetas, who\u2019ve fueled their notoriety in central Mexico with grisly beheadings and the hanging of bodies across public highways. Or Guerreros Unidos, the cartel alleged to have killed 43 college students last fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Escaped Mexican drug lord no saint, but lesser evil at home", "title": "Escaped Mexican drug lord no saint, but lesser evil at home", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Escaped Mexican drug lord no saint, but lesser evil at home", "title": "Escaped Mexican drug lord no saint, but lesser evil at home", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/escaped_mexican_drug_lord_no_saint_but_lesser_evil_at_home/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/mexico-drug-lords-hometown.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Escaped Mexican drug lord no saint, but lesser evil at home", "title": "Escaped Mexican drug lord no saint, but lesser evil at home", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/mexico-drug-lords-hometown.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Stevenson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc813\"", "article_summary": "Or the Zetas, who\u2019ve fueled their notoriety in central Mexico with grisly beheadings and the hanging of bodies across public highways.\nBut finding anyone who\u2019s actually received or even seen such a gift is another matter.\n\u201cChapo Guzman isn\u2019t violent,\u201d Valenzuela said about a man accused of hundreds of murders.\nHis rise as a crime boss has been surrounded by mythology, a Hollywood version of an old-school Mafioso \u2014 ruthless, but yet honorable.\nOr Guerreros Unidos, the cartel alleged to have killed 43 college students last fall."}
