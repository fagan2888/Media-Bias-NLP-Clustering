To the Editor:

The Times hit it right on the money with your Nov. 1 editorial “How Mergers Damage the Economy.” Federal officials have allowed too many already giant companies to get even bigger. The rest of us suffer with higher prices and fewer choices.

A case in point: the proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot currently under review by the Federal Trade Commission. For decades, big chains have been wiping out small stationery stores, and two years ago Office Depot swallowed Office Max.

If this latest deal goes through, there will be nothing left to merge. The United States will be left with just one office-supply superstore chain.

Our union has studied the proposed merger and we found that consumers will suffer, especially in low-income and minority communities with limited Internet access. And companies that buy office supplies — essentially every business in the country — will be held hostage to price increases, supply interruptions and other negative consequences of a nationwide monopoly.

The trend toward bigger mergers can and should be stopped. Blocking the Staples/Office Depot deal is the right place to start.
