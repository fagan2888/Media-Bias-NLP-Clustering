Four documentary projects incubated by the Tribeca Film Institute, along with a whole host of independently-produced documentaries broadcast as part of the PBS "POV" series, have received nominations for the 35th annual News and Documentary Awards. Organized by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, the News and Documentary Awards are the nonfiction equivalent to the Primetime and Daytime Emmy Award Shows.

PBS scored a total of 43 nominations across all categories -- including TFI All Access alumni Angad Singh Bhalla, whose project "Herman's House" was broadcast as part of the PBS independent documentary series "POV" and is now nominated in the category of "Outstanding Arts and Culture Programming." "Hollow: An Interactive Documentary," "Gideon's Army," and "The World Before Her," also made by TFI alumni, are up for awards this year as well.

Michael Apted's most recent installment in the "Up" documentary series, "56 Up," also received a nomination for Best Interview.
