Kenneth Orsburn's message tied in church history with Scripture about the identity of Christ.\n\nLay reader Charles Nutter recited prayers and scripture.\n\nThe service was part of an ancient Advent tradition, one that is still observed in many liturgical churches and a growing number of evangelical churches.\n\nAdvent emphasizes spiritual preparation for the birth of Christ up until Dec. 25, and then celebration for 12 days.\n\nIt is in sharp contrast to ChristmasAmerican-style, which typically begins about Thanksgiving, or earlier, and after a month of hectic shopping, eating and parties, ends with a Dec. 25 extravaganza of food and gifts.\n\nThe Advent season begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas \u0097 Dec. 1 this year.\n\nIn the Episcopal world, Advent looks different from church to church, but all of them observe some form of it, said the Rev. Irv Cutter, rector of St. John's Episcopal Church.\n\n\"We see value in taking a few weeks before Dec. 25 to prepare ourselves, holding off on the actual celebration of the birth of Christ,\" he said.\n\nMany liturgical churches do not sing Christmas carols until Christmas Day, instead singing hymns that focus on events that preceded the birth of Jesus, he said, like \"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel.\"\n\n\"Every year we hear Episcopalians say, 'Why can't we sing the Christmas hymns yet, we're hearing them everywhere else?' \" he said.\n\nAnd why not sing the Christmas carols early?\n\n\"Because it's not Christmas yet,\" Cutter said.\n\nA prominent element of the season is the Advent wreath that holds four candles. Each Sunday of Advent, another candle is lit. Some churches light the candles before the service, others make the candle-lighting part of the service.\n\n\"Mostof Americais getting frantic right now, getting anxious about shopping, travel plans, holiday parties, Christmas cards.\n\n\"That's a heavy burden on a lot ofpeople. Whenwe worshipin Advent, we set all that aside. Our hope is that the worship will inspire us to focus on Jesus, remember that he's going to return, and that we ought to prepare ourselves for that,\" Cutter said.\n\nBishop Mike Girlinghouse, who oversees the Arkansas-Oklahoma Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said that Lutherans take the Advent season \"very seriously.\"\n\nHe said he often hears church members say it is their favorite season of the church year, a time of anticipation and preparation for the coming birth of Christ.\n\n\"We don't have a lot of rules,\" he said, but for the most part, Lutheran churches do not sing Christmas carols during Advent.\n\n\"We light the Advent candles, we focus on promise and hope, and look at the prophecies about the coming of the Messiah. It is a season of preparation,\" he said.\n\nThe Rev. Jim Miller, co-pastor of First Presbyterian Church downtown, pointed out that the ecclesiastical year actually begins on the first Sunday of Advent.\n\nMiller said he came out of the Baptist tradition and did not grow up celebrating Advent.\n\n\"I've grown to appreciate the ecclesiastical year,\" he said, \"rehearsing once again God's mighty acts.\"\n\nHesaid Adventis a season to \"ponder if we have given Jesus any room in our lives, in any meaningful sense. That's the persistent question of Advent, preparation for the incoming Messiah ... to be available to the fuller presence of Christ in our lives.\"\n\nGirlinghouse said America's prevailing culture \"doesn't even think about Advent. Observing Advent makes us somewhat countercultural.\"\n\nMiller said, \"We're swimming against a very strong cultural tide. It's a rabid consumerism, a realization that Christmas is a time to make a lot of money.\"\n\nThe celebration of Christmas drops off on Dec. 25 in the popular culture, but it begins on Dec. 25 in the liturgical world and continues for 12 days, until Epiphany, which is Jan. 6.\n\nEastern Orthodoxy, the dominant form of the Christian faith in Russia, Greece and much of the East, observes a 40-day fast in preparation for Christmas, along with special services. It is generally called the Nativity Fast rather than Advent.\n\n\"It's a period of preparation. Fasting is letting go of things, making room for this huge event,\" the birth of Christ, said the Rev. George Eber, pastor of St. Antony's Orthodox Christian Church.\n\n\"This is the point at which ... God takes on human nature, mankind is united to Trinity,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "The Wednesday night Advent service at St. John's Episcopal Church was an intimate, quiet event with little music and no Christmas carols.", "title": "'Countercultural' Advent focuses on coming birth of Christ, not hectic season", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/religion/countercultural-advent-focuses-on-coming-birth-of-christ-not-hectic/article_a506e389-8d2d-58b7-a1f5-0ca639d06629.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/98/69850e82-e990-5cbf-a46b-d37b89ff2f03/52a2d67ea851b.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C332", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The Wednesday night Advent service at St. John's Episcopal Church was an intimate, quiet event with little music and no Christmas carols.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "advent,service,church,christmas,christ,birth,season,candle,dec,preparation,religion,local,news", "news_keywords": "advent,service,church,christmas,christ,birth,season,candle,dec,preparation,religion,local,news"}, "article_summary": "That's the persistent question of Advent, preparation for the incoming Messiah ... to be available to the fuller presence of Christ in our lives.\"\nAdvent emphasizes spiritual preparation for the birth of Christ up until Dec. 25, and then celebration for 12 days.\nThe Advent season begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas \u0097 Dec. 1 this year.\nBishop Mike Girlinghouse, who oversees the Arkansas-Oklahoma Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, said that Lutherans take the Advent season \"very seriously.\"\n\"We don't have a lot of rules,\" he said, but for the most part, Lutheran churches do not sing Christmas carols during Advent."}
