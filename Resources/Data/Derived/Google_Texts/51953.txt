With less than a week until one of Meridian's biggest races, organizers are getting ready to kick things off.

They tested out the giant finish line blimp Sunday for the Magnolia Marathon, previously known as the Leo Run to Remember. The race still goes to benefit Alzheimer's research, but with 250 runners last year, race timer Tim Irvine says they wanted more of a Mississippi feel.

"They're all here for the same thing, to mark Mississippi off their list," he says. "We felt like this would be another way to lure more of those people in if the race itself had a Mississippi identity. "

The Magnolia Marathon is set for Saturday at Northeast Park at 7 a.m.
