CBS-DFW, screenshot\n\nFour and a half months ago, Nina Pham, a nurse and patient quarantined with the Ebola virus, was joking around with the nursing staff at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Now she is preparing to sue.\n\nPham was the first person in the U.S. to contract the virus, after caring for a Liberian patient at the hospital. New allegations from Pham, together with her attorney Charla Aldous, say the infection likely stemmed from unsafe work conditions and a lack of training. After she got sick, the hospital continued to use her story as a boost for their public relations, the lawsuit contends.\n\n\u201cShe wants answers,\u201d said Aldous to CBS News. \u201cShe wants transparency.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until Pham\u2019s third day of training that she was finally given a hazmat suit to replace her double gloves and gowns as the first line of defense. Before then, nobody on the hospital staff had even said the word \u201cEbola,\u201d Aldous claims. And during her recovery, added Aldous, Texas Health repeatedly shared Pham\u2019s private medical records and \u201cused\u201d her illness as a way to build up their image.\n\n\u201cThey put it out into the news media that Nina Pham wants to tell you the following \u2013 which wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Aldous said. \u201cTo me it just shows a callus. It looks like that THR was more concerned about its image than about Nine Pham.\u201d\n\nWendell Watson, a Texas Health Resources spokesperson, released a statement in response. \u201cNina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nina, pham, nurse, ebola, suing, employer, texas, health, resources, poor, protection, against", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Since her October quarantine with Ebola, nurse Nina Pham now seeks compensation from her employer over lack of training.", "title": "Ebola Nurse Now Suing Employer For Unsafe Work Conditions [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/nina-pham-nurse-ebola-suing-employer-texas-health-resources-poor-protection-against-324000", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/03/02/ninapham.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Since her October quarantine with Ebola, nurse Nina Pham now seeks compensation from her employer over lack of training.", "title": "Ebola Nurse Now Suing Employer For Unsafe Work Conditions [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/nina-pham-nurse-ebola-suing-employer-texas-health-resources-poor-protection-against-324000", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/03/02/ninapham.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/02/ninapham.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-02T10:14:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-02T10:14:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Since her October quarantine with Ebola, nurse Nina Pham now seeks compensation from her employer over lack of training."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc834\"", "article_summary": "Since her October quarantine with Ebola, nurse Nina Pham now seeks compensation from her employer over lack of training.\n\u201cNina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time.\nCBS-DFW, screenshotFour and a half months ago, Nina Pham, a nurse and patient quarantined with the Ebola virus, was joking around with the nursing staff at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.\nAnd during her recovery, added Aldous, Texas Health repeatedly shared Pham\u2019s private medical records and \u201cused\u201d her illness as a way to build up their image.\n\u201cThey put it out into the news media that Nina Pham wants to tell you the following \u2013 which wasn\u2019t true,\u201d Aldous said."}
