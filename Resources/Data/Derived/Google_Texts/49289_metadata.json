The floods virtually cut Lyons in half and destroyed 100 homes.\n\nThe students examained the the entire housing process from site selection to planning and design.\n\nAlong the way, \u201cthe students learned a great deal about Lyons, its history and development, and the impact of the flood on the town\u2019s housing stock,\u201d said Andrew Rumbach, one of two professors who oversaw the project.\n\nRumbach emphasized that the students and the university were not paid by the town and that the study\u2019s conclusions were only recommendations.\n\n\u201cWe are not here to give you a recovery plan,\u201d said Rumbach.\n\nStudents interviewed residents, studied the town\u2019s own recovery work, and produced their own hypothetical solutions. Much of their conclusions were based on of a Housing Needs Assessment done by the town after the floods.\n\nThe students found that a variety of media including digital presentation and video story telling can help gauge the housing needs of residents. There is also a place for old-fashioned print surveys and and town hall meetings to weigh opinions.\n\nThe last things Lyons needs, said Rumbach, is a \u201ctop-down approach\u201d where long-term housing plans are dictated by officials.\n\n\u201cSite design could only occur through a robust public engagement process, not through a classroom of students in Denver,\u201dsaid Rumbach.\n\nIn all, the students and their professors recommended that enough replacement housing should be produced for 100 households.\n\nThe students also said that some form of government assistance will be needed to produce enough diverse housing to attact residents back to Lyons. \u201cIf it\u2019s left to the market, there is no way some people can come back to this community,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the students, Jenny Mcginnis, said doing on the ground work in Lyons helped her appreciate the scope of the destruction. \u201cIt\u2019s on thing to read about it, or see it on television. But to see it in person and look around and see someon\u2019s home that\u2019s been destroyed, that\u2019s when you want to do your best to help them,\u201d McGinnis said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU Denver students offer Lyons advice on its flood-recovery efforts", "title": "CU Denver students offer Lyons advice on its flood-recovery efforts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/02/cu-denver-students-offer-lyons-advice-on-its-flood-recovery-efforts/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140902_085530_Lyons-Flood-Recovery.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140902_085530_Lyons-Flood-Recovery.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-02T20:29:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:17:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdab\"", "article_summary": "Trustees thanked the students for their efforts and said their work will be used during the town\u2019s ongoing recovery efforts.\nThe students examained the the entire housing process from site selection to planning and design.\nLYONS \u2014 A massive and diverse public outreach effort during the long-term rebuilding of Lyons will help the town recover from the 2013 September flooding.\nStudents interviewed residents, studied the town\u2019s own recovery work, and produced their own hypothetical solutions.\nOne of the students, Jenny Mcginnis, said doing on the ground work in Lyons helped her appreciate the scope of the destruction."}
