John Lewis, D-Ga., fought unwaveringly for human rights and equality. Lewis was at times beaten and arrested, but he never lost the passion and will to fight for what he believes in.\n\nIn many ways, he\u2019s a living reminder of what this nation endured to take the steps that led to a better sense of equality when it came to human and civil rights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scars of and stains of racism and sexism is still deeply embedded in American society. We\u2019re not there yet.\u201d\n\nLewis spoke at the Greenwald Pavilion on Friday as part of the Aspen Institute\u2019s 2014 McCloskey Speaker Series. Elliot Gerson, executive vice president of the Aspen Institute, hosted the hourlong conversation.\n\nLewis was promoting his latest book, \u201cMarch,\u201d which he co-authored with Andrew Aydin, a congressional aide to Lewis. \u201cMarch\u201d is the first book in a trilogy, which Gerson described as a combination of personal memoirs, history and lessons in morality concerning the civil-rights movement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a read for anybody,\u201d Gerson said. \u201cI would strongly recommend it, and interestingly, it takes the form of a comic book. It\u2019s been on the New York Times best-seller list for 32 weeks.\u201d\n\nThey also discussed Lewis\u2019 personal history and several contemporary issues.\n\nLewis, 74, grew up in Alabama, where he was inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 and the words of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nHe became a recognized voice and leader during the civil rights movement and has continued to be a champion for human rights for more than 50 years.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard Dr. King speaking on the radio, I felt like he was speaking directly to me,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cLike he was saying, \u2019John Robert Lewis, you too can do something. You can make a contribution.\u2019\u201d\n\nLewis was 18 when he first met King, but he knew from that moment on that his life was about to change.\n\n\u201cI knew right then I couldn\u2019t turn back,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere was something about the man, his presence, what he said and the way he said it that inspired me. When you listened to Martin Luther King Jr., you had to move; you had to be committed and become dedicated to a cause, a movement.\u201d\n\nAs Lewis spoke in Aspen, his deep voice was mostly smooth and steady. But when a topic came up that he felt strongly about, he would raise his voice with intensity, reminding the audience why he was such a powerful public speaker.\n\nLewis talked about campaigning for the Kennedys, the loss of King and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968 and his becoming a leader of the nonviolent movement for equal rights.\n\n\u201cI learned if you\u2019re going to lead, you had to be a headlight, not a taillight,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI literally grew up during the sit-in demonstrations at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee, in the early 1960s. We studied the way of love and nonviolence and accepted it as a way of life.\u201d\n\nLewis shared his memories from \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d which recounts the attempted crossing of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on March 7, 1965, when more than 600 peaceful protesters were violently attacked by the Alabama State Patrol.\n\nLewis had his skull cracked and suffered a serious concussion, but the sacrifices from that day led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 getting signed by President Johnson.\n\nLewis said he hopes America\u2019s youth find ways to \u201cget in the way\u201d of current injustices and make a difference in today\u2019s society. When asked where the youth of America will find inspiration, Lewis said maybe it\u2019ll be somewhere like his book, \u201cMarch.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one reason we hope they\u2019ll read \u2018March,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they would be inspired; maybe they would learn. When I was 17, I read a comic book called \u2018Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019 It was 14 pages and sold for 10 cents. That book helped me. We need to educate every possible young person that they can make a contribution, they can get involved and they can change their environment. Just like the children in Birmingham and Selma, they, too, can do it.\u201d\n\nAydin said there\u2019s no doubt that Lewis remains as passionate as ever when it comes to pursuing something he believes in.\n\n\u201cHe never stops,\u201d Aydin said. \u201cI\u2019m 30 years old, and even I have problems keeping up. The issue of civil rights encompasses so many challenges that face our society today. It\u2019s not simply a black-and-white issue now. We\u2019re also talking about income equality, access to education, access to health care and even access to the Internet to apply for a job. There are so many pieces that are civil-rights issues. That\u2019s what\u2019s made the use of nonviolence so vital and important to this generation and why we\u2019re doing \u2018March,\u2019 so they can use those tools to effect change in those areas.\u201d\n\nmmclaughlin@aspentimes.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "For 60 years, U.S. Rep.
