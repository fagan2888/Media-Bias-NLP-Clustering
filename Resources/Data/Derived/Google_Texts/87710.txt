Administrators at a public school in Michigan are banning the word “Obamacare,” “twerking,” and “selfie” for the year 2014



Other words that made Lake Superior State University's (LSSU) “List of Words to be Banished from the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness,” included “twittersphere,” “hashtag,” and “mister Mom.”

According to the official website, the "[e]ditors of the list consider pet peeves from everyday speech, as well as from the news, fields of education, technology, advertising, politics and more. A committee makes a final cut in late December.”



The new words also included comments from those who nominated them as official entries.



David commented on the "selfie" entry, which included the most nominations this year, that the word is “lame."

“It's all about me, me, me," the entry states. "Put the smartphone away. Nobody cares about you."

Ben said Obamacare deserves to be on the list "[b]ecause President Obama's signature healthcare law is actually called the Affordable Care Act.”



“The term has been clearly overused and overblown by the media and by members of Congress," he added.



Lisa commented that twerking “has brought us to a new low in our lexicon,” while Jim said it’s “time to dance this one off the stage.”



LSSU, Michigan’s smallest public university, has published the tongue-in-cheek list of banished words annually since December 31, 1975, according to the school’s website.



The website claims to have received tens of thousands of nominations over the past four decades, and stated they are closing in on 1,000 total words added to the list.



Word submissions are open to the public and are taken on a rolling basis anytime throughout the year.
