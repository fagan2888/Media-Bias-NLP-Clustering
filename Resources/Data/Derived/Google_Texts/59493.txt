A Fort Walton Beach man is behind bars after he shot at his brother Saturday night.

According to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office, 25-year old Ernest Lee Powell, is also being charged with aggravated child abuse, possession of a weapon by a convicted felon, possession of marijuana, and tampering with evidence.

Investigators say Powell and his brother got into a verbal argument over feeding a child at the home, and the argument turned physical.

Powell bit his brother on the head and then went out to his car and got his handgun and shot one round; no one was hit.

Two children were in the car's back seat at the time and deputies say four others were playing near the front door.

A few minutes later, deputies made a traffic stop on a car Powell was riding in on North Beal Parkway.

They saw Powell get out of the passenger side door and throw a gun over a fence. They also found 13 grams of marijuana next to the vehicle.

The two children in the car say they saw Powell fire the gun at the victim.
