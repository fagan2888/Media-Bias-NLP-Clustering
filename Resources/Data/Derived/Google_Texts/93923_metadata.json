Because it\u2019s about style, use of language, etcetera? JON LOVETT, FORMER OBAMA SPEECH WRITER: I really like, I was very \u2014 the joke speeches is the most fun part of this. But the things I\u2019m the most proud of were the most serious speeches, I think. Health care, economic speeches. JON FAVREAU, FORMER OBAMA SPEECH WRITER: Lovett wrote the line about \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it.\u201d LOVETT: How dare you! [laughter] LOVETT: And you know what? It\u2019s still true! No.\n\nSo, basically, these clowns are laughing at the American people for believing that the president\u2019s health care law was going to be affordable. It\u2019s not. And it's certainly a serious one of the most, if not the most, important discussion within American households when it comes to crafting a home budget. More Americans are opting to remain uninsured because it\u2019s more economical for them\u2014that\u2019s failure. UnitedHealth, one of the largest health care providers in the country, pulled out of the Obamacare exchanges in two states after incurring horrific losses, and might pull out from the individual market altogether by 2017. The last remaining Obamacare exchanges are on the brink of collapse, and billions have been wasted as a result. In a recent CBO projection, Obamacare\u2019s enrollment numbers for 2016 are off by 24 million. Since the law went into effect, 9 million people (5 million employer-based, 4 million on individual plans) have lost their health insurance. I\u2019m sure they find this hilarious, bros.\n\nLast time I checked, laughing at millions of people who got their insurance gutted because you put to paper a bold-faced lie is sort of messed up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "These guys have jokes....05/27/2016 9:00:13AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "These guys have jokes...", "title": "Obama Speechwriters Laugh About 'You Can Keep It' Obamacare Lie", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/05/11/obama-speechwriters-laugh-about-you-can-keep-it-obamacare-lie-n2161286", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/5/10/25.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "These guys have jokes...", "title": "Obama Speechwriters Laugh About 'You Can Keep It' Obamacare Lie", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2016/05/11/obama-speechwriters-laugh-about-you-can-keep-it-obamacare-lie-n2161286", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/5/10/25.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama Speechwriters Laugh About 'You Can Keep It' Obamacare Lie , Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "JON LOVETT, FORMER OBAMA SPEECH WRITER: I really like, I was very \u2014 the joke speeches is the most fun part of this.\nJON FAVREAU, FORMER OBAMA SPEECH WRITER: Lovett wrote the line about \u201cIf you like your insurance, you can keep it.\u201d LOVETT: How dare you!\nSince the law went into effect, 9 million people (5 million employer-based, 4 million on individual plans) have lost their health insurance.\nBut the things I\u2019m the most proud of were the most serious speeches, I think.\nSo, basically, these clowns are laughing at the American people for believing that the president\u2019s health care law was going to be affordable."}
