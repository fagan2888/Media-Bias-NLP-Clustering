And since threadbare coverage is the only affordable option under Obamacare for many of these people, the law is giving them a whole set of grievances to get exercised about,\u201d he added.\n\nMmkay. Well, first, Medicaid is generally terrible. In fact, we can draw the conclusion that remaining uninsured is no different in terms of health outcome than being on the state-based, government-run insurance program. Now, Obamacare provider networks do resemble Medicaid, which is truly a problem, but to say that this is going prompt a desire for single-payer seems like quite a stretch.\n\nOh, and by the way, Medicare is broke and in dire need of reform. It\u2019s current trajectory is unsustainable. Adding tens of millions more to the program would only exacerbate the problem.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the disastrous rollout of Obamacare hasn\u2019t exactly helped the arguments for a government-run, single-payer healthcare system. For example, a recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say that healthcare isn\u2019t a government responsibility. That, by the way, is a record-high number.\n\nNevertheless, it\u2019s incredibly likely that Democrats are going to bring the healthcare topic back up in the national debate \u2014 presumably with a push for single-payer \u2014 at some point within in the next few years when Obamacare fails to meet its goals.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Gallup,Harry Reid,Leftists,Medicaid,Medicare,nationalized healthcare,Noam Scheiber,ObamaCare,poll,single-payer,Socialized Medicine,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "nationalized healthcare The New Republic is only repeating what several Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV), have said: Obamacare is a step in the direction of a single-payer healthcare system.
