BOLIVAR COUNTY, Miss. (WCBI) — Mississippi state troopers are investigating a Bolivar County wreck involving two New Albany residents.

It happened around 2:45 Sunday morning on Highway 446 near Skene.

Troopers say 23-year-old John Gunn of Olive Branch was heading east on the road, when he slammed into the back of 23-year-old Anna Claire Stokes’ Nissan Altima.

23-year-old James Waldrop was thrown from the car. The Altima then overturned several times, and came to rest upside down in a ditch.

First responders had to use the jaws of life to pull Stokes from her car.

She was then airlifted to the MED in Memphis with serious injuries.

Waldrop was treated and released at a nearby hospital.

Gunn wasn’t hurt.
