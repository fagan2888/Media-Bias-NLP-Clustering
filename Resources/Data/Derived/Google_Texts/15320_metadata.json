Scarlett Johansson, Aisha Tyler, and Gabrielle Union (all active in progressive politics) each recorded special phone messages to remind callers about Obamacare eligibility.\n\n\"We're grateful that Scarlett Johansson, Aisha Tyler, and Gabrielle Union are lending their voices to help make sure that Planned Parenthood patients learn about the law and how it will benefit them,\" Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said in a press release.\n\nThe recordings\u2014which are being used as hold messages\u2014can be heard when people call certain Planned Parenthood health centers, and they will be played by more in the near future. (Planned Parenthood operates roughly 750 health centers around the country.) The messages are part of the reproductive health organization's larger national campaign to help women get enrolled. Planned Parenthood provided Mother Jones with audio files of the three phone messages.\n\nJohansson:\n\nUnion:\n\nTyler:\n\nEach actress asks, \"Did you know you may be able to enroll in new, more affordable health insurance plans?\" and directs listeners to this website for more information.\n\nIn recent months, the Obama administration has also been active in celebrity outreach to help pitch the health care law, particularly to young Americans. In July, a cluster of Hollywood celebrities gathered at the White House for a chat on how they could help spread the word. In attendance\u2014along with producers and writers\u2014were big-name entertainers including Amy Poehler, Jennifer Hudson, Michael Cera, and Kal Penn. (Penn served stints as associate director for the Office of Public Engagement in the Obama administration and delivered this speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where Johansson also spoke.)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Scarlett Johansson, Aisha Tyler, and Gabrielle Union recorded phone messages for Planned Parenthood to remind people about Obamacare eligibility.", "title": "AUDIO: Scarlett Johansson Tries to Sell You on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/10/scarlett-johansson-aisha-tyler-gabrielle-union-planned-parenthood-obamacare", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/scarlett-johansson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/10/scarlett-johansson-aisha-tyler-gabrielle-union-planned-parenthood-obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/scarlett-johansson.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/scarlett-johansson.jpg"}, "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "AUDIO: Scarlett Johansson Tries to Sell You on Obamacare"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Film+and+TV,Health+Care", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeab5\"", "article_summary": "Scarlett Johansson, Aisha Tyler, and Gabrielle Union (all active in progressive politics) each recorded special phone messages to remind callers about Obamacare eligibility.\nThe recordings\u2014which are being used as hold messages\u2014can be heard when people call certain Planned Parenthood health centers, and they will be played by more in the near future.\nLast Friday, Planned Parenthood announced that they had enlisted three actresses to help them inform Americans about details of the Affordable Care Act.\nPlanned Parenthood provided Mother Jones with audio files of the three phone messages.\n(Planned Parenthood operates roughly 750 health centers around the country.)"}
