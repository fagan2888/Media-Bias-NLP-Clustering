Now ask how much it has affected employers who already provided health benefits.\n\n\"For us, it's been fairly minimal,\" said Molly Schissler, vice president of human resources at North Shore Bank, which employs about 480 people.\n\nWithout question, the law remade the market for insurance sold to individuals and small businesses, and one result was higher premiums for many of them. But most people \u2014 roughly 150 million \u2014 are covered by health plans from an employer.\n\nThe law was designed to limit changes, at least in the short term, on most of those health plans.\n\n\"I don't see many employers getting all worked up about the ACA,\" said Brian Jensen, a benefit consultant with NorthCoast Consultants. \"For the vast majority of people, it didn't affect them one iota.\"\n\nEmployers are paying a small tax on their health plans. They no longer can have lifetime limits on benefits, and they have to offer coverage for employees' children up to the age of 26. And their plans have to cover a package of basic benefits.\n\nBut most of the requirements have minimal costs, and most employers already offered health plans that covered the required benefits.\n\n\"I don't think it has affected me positively or negatively,\" said Mike Katz, president of Molded Dimensions, which employs about 90 people in Port Washington.\n\nFor certain, complying with the law was a minor headache.\n\n\"I spent a lot of energy on this,\" said Katz, co-owner of the company with his wife, Linda, its chief executive officer. \"I know too much. I know more than I want to know.\"\n\nJohn Barlament, a partner in the employee benefits group at Quarles & Brady, refers to the \"compliance burden\" imposed on employers by the law.\n\n\"They just had a lot more to do,\" he said.\n\nThe thousands of pages of regulations spawned by the law also came out over several years, and at times the proposed rules would run hundreds of pages.\n\n\"Things have calmed down because we have final rules for most of the ACA provisions,\" Barlament said.\n\nOne potentially significant change \u2014 the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost health benefits \u2014 has yet to take effect.\n\nBut Barlament has not seen any employers who stopped offering health benefits \u2014 a common prediction that proved wrong.\n\n\"There haven't been radical changes to employer-sponsored plans,\" he said.\n\nNor has the law led to a significant spike in part-time employees.\n\nThe fear was that employers would cut workers' hours to less than 30 hours a week, the cutoff to avoid the requirement that any employer with 50 or more employees offer health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nFor certain, businesses with a large number of low-wage workers, such as restaurants and retailers, were affected by that requirement.\n\nBut an estimated 96% of employers with 100 or more employees offered health benefits in 2015, according to an annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.\n\nThe law did prompt about 21% of the employers to offer health benefits to employees previously not eligible, according to the survey.\n\nNone of this means the Affordable Care Act will be held up as model legislation.\n\nKatz of Molded Dimensions criticizes the law for not doing more to address the underlying costs and misaligned incentives in the U.S. health care system.\n\nThe company's cost of providing health benefits has doubled in the past 15 years, he said, while deductibles increased tenfold to $2,000.\n\nThere also is the continuing uncertainty surrounding the law: At least two of the Republican presidential candidates have vowed to repeal it.\n\n\"The whole election definitely could change things,\" Barlament said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "For workplace health plans, Obamacare's impact is 'fairly minimal'", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/business/for-workplace-health-plans-obamacares-impact-is-fairly-minimal-b99701138z1-376396981.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99701138z.1_20160420112924_000_g2qf71fr.1-0.jpg", "height": 1404}, "type": "article", "description": "The law remade the market for health insurance sold to individuals and small businesses, and one result for them was higher premiums.
