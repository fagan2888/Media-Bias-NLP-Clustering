Walker talks about the need to nominate someone who is not from Washington and implicitly compares Rubio to Barack Obama. Rubio suggests that there is \u201cno way\u201d a governor like Walker is prepared to deal with global crises facing the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDozens of interviews on the ground in the early states, backed up by recent polling, find many Republicans torn between Walker and Rubio.\n\nA Public Policy Polling survey this week shows Walker and Rubio in first and second place in Iowa. \u201cThe key to Walker\u2019s success is that he\u2019s winning both among voters who are most concerned about electability in the general election and among voters who are most concerned with having the most conservative candidate,\u201d the Democratic firm said in a release explaining the numbers. Rubio and Walker tied in the poll for being the most frequent second choice of voters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really interesting matchup,\u201d said Jack Whitver, an uncommitted state senator who hosted Rubio at his home here for an ice cream social this weekend.\n\nRubio and Walker differ in many ways\u2014a blue-collar Midwesterner who shops at Kohl\u2019s; the son of Cuban immigrants who is married to a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader \u2013 but they are trying to woo an overlapping group of voters. There is a large bloc of establishment-minded activists who do not want to support Jeb Bush for the nomination out of dynasty and electability concerns, and there is a swath of deeply-conservative voters who love guys like Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee but won\u2019t support them because they want a nominee who they believe can win the general election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we characterize our opponent as a relic of the 20th century and then nominate a relic of the 20th century,\u201d said Bob Brownell, a county supervisor in Iowa\u2019s Polk County, which includes Des Moines. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be Rubio or Walker in my mind. Walker has that executive experience; Marco doesn\u2019t have that, but what he does have is a 21st century perspective.\u201d\n\nWalker, 47, and Rubio, 43, are also each presenting themselves as next-generation candidates.\n\n\u201cOf the leftovers from last time, I still like Huckabee and Santorum. Of the new faces, I like Walker and Rubio,\u201d said Doug Brown, 69, a retired product engineer who spent his career at John Deere in Iowa.\n\nBrown caucused for Santorum in 2012 and is now uncommitted. He praised Walker\u2019s \u201caccomplishments\u201d and \u201cproven record.\u201d In the next breath, he praised Rubio\u2019s rhetorical abilities. \u201cHe seems to have a good understanding of what\u2019s wrong with the country and how to fix it,\u201d Brown said, stressing that he\u2019s undecided.\n\nAttendees at a Manchester, New Hampshire, house party for Rubio the weekend before echoed the some points. \u201cI\u2019m probably between Scott Walker and Marco Rubio,\u201d said John Cebrowski, a former state representative from Bedford. \u201cWe need fresh ideas and both have them \u2026 This is not a dynasty. We\u2019re not talking about the Romanovs or the Windsors. We need some freshness.\u201d\n\nRick Kimberley, a corn and soybean farmer from north of Des Moines who caucused for Romney in 2012, floated the idea that Rubio and Walker would be great running mates \u2014 sort of like in 1992, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore together offered a youthful contrast to George H.W. Bush.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not predicting right now which one\u2019s going to come out on top,\u201d said Kimberley, 60.\n\nMany point to stylistic similarities.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re conservative, but reasonable and measured in tone for the most part,\u201d said Jamie Burnett, an uncommitted GOP strategist in New Hampshire.\n\nThe two candidates rarely take each other on directly in public, but their comments seem closely tailored to emphasize their relative strengths and the other\u2019s weaknesses.\n\nRubio constantly invokes his seats on the Senate Foreign Affairs and Intelligence committees to argue that he would be ready on his first day as president to tackle ISIS and other global threats. He told the Des Moines Register editorial board on Saturday there is \u201cno way\u201d a governor could be equipped with the world as tumultuous as it is.\n\n\u201cGovernors can certainly read about foreign policy, and take briefings and meet with experts, but there is no way they\u2019ll be ready on Day One to manage U.S. foreign policy,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nA few hours later, Walker fired back. \u201cI think he\u2019s questioning how Ronald Reagan was ready,\u201d he told reporters after an appearance at the Machine Shed restaurant. \u201cGovernors innately have the ability to lead. We are required every day to use our cabinet to make decisions, not just give speeches; not to just travel to foreign places, but to ultimately make decisions.\u201d\n\nOn Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show recently, Walker noted explicitly that Obama also sat on the Foreign Affairs committee before he was elected president.\n\nThe posturing is breaking through and sparking discussion at the activist level.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some discussion as to which of those two categories of experience is best suited to take on the presidency and more particularly to take on Hillary Clinton,\u201d said New Hampshire Republican Ray Chadwick, who previously chaired the Hillsborough County GOP.\n\nOn the issues front, the biggest dividing line between the two candidates is immigration. Rubio co-sponsored the 2013 Senate bill that included a pathway to citizenship. Walker has changed his position to take a hard line against immigration.\n\nAt a five-hour cattle call for social conservatives at a church in Waukee Saturday night, Rubio went first and Walker went last. Rubio did not mention immigration during his speech. Walker made a point of criticizing even lawful immigration on the grounds that it drives down the wages of workers who are already here. This puts him to the right of even someone like Cruz.\n\nThe further to the right that Walker continues to tack in order to compete for the Religious Right and to win over people who might otherwise support Huckabee, Santorum or Cruz in the low-turnout caucuses, the bigger the opening he leaves for Rubio to establish himself as the bridge candidate.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both trying to pitch themselves as candidates who will be agreeable to all factions of the party,\u201d said University of New Hampshire political scientist Dante Scala. \u201cThey\u2019re both trying to pull off the same trick.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky balancing act. Brownell, the Polk County supervisor, said he\u2019s leaning to Rubio over Walker, partly because \u201che\u2019s in the right place completely when it comes to immigration,\u201d a reminder that not every Republican is against reform.\n\nThe two candidates heavily emphasize that they are electable, but their pitch is quite different.\n\nRubio leans on his Hispanic roots and his allies argue that he could more easily carry Sun Belt states like Florida and Nevada. He says his family epitomizes the American Dream. \u201cI didn\u2019t read about it in a book,\u201d he says.\n\nWalker also employs his own strain of identity politics, arguing during his latest swing through Iowa that he could carry the state in a general election. \u201cFor a Republican to win the presidency, the pathway is through the Midwest,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need states like Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio \u2026 Having a good, common-sense reform-minded governor from the Midwest wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing.\u201d\n\nCate Martel contributed to this report from Manchester, N.H.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Florida senator and the Wisconsin governor are fighting for the same space.", "title": "In early horse race, Rubio threatens Walker", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/in-early-horse-race-marco-rubio-threatens-scott-walker-117529.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/30/043015_rubiowalker_polillo_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,Scott Walker,Marco Rubio 2016,Jeb Bush,Marco Rubio,Elections 2016,Scott Walker 2016,Jeb Bush 2016", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Florida senator and the Wisconsin governor are fighting for the same space.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A Public Policy Polling survey this week shows Walker and Rubio in first and second place in Iowa.\nStory Continued BelowDozens of interviews on the ground in the early states, backed up by recent polling, find many Republicans torn between Walker and Rubio.\nWalker talks about the need to nominate someone who is not from Washington and implicitly compares Rubio to Barack Obama.\nRubio and Walker tied in the poll for being the most frequent second choice of voters.\nRubio suggests that there is \u201cno way\u201d a governor like Walker is prepared to deal with global crises facing the United States."}
