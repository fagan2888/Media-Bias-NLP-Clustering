The government has abandoned him, he feels. Local coal mines have laid him off so many times he opened a T-shirt store to make a living. Big-city media treat him and his neighbors like know-nothings. His remaining hope: Donald Trump will become president and use his business skills to bring jobs to this Appalachian mountain county. \u201cHey, in this county, things are going downhill. People are getting laid off. People are leaving,\u201d says the 39-year-old former miner. \u201cIf Trump don\u2019t get it, it will be another blow.\u201d\n\nBenjamin Lowy for The Wall Street Journal\n\nMr. Trump won Buchanan County with 69.7% of the vote in the March 1 Republican primary, the highest percentage vote he has collected in any U.S. county so far. A close look at the white, working-class enclave, which is in Virginia\u2019s southwest, provides a clearer picture of why Mr. Trump inspires supporters and poses problems for anti-Trump GOP strategists. Voters here say Mr. Trump understands their frustration and will fight the Washington establishment on their behalf. In an area awash in uncertainty\u2014Will mines remain open? Will the river flood? Must the young leave to find work?\u2014he is a reassuring presence, someone who has visited their living rooms for years via television. Bob Davis and Rebecca Ballhaus report.\n\nCAROL E. LEE: U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONS IN FOCUS THIS WEEK\n\nPresident Barack Obama arrives in Saudi Arabia this week at a low point in relations between Washington and Riyadh that are likely only to be set on a different course by whoever is elected to the White House in November. U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia have already been strained by Mr. Obama\u2019s diplomatic outreach to Iran. Their relationship is growing more complicated as oil prices drop. Read Carol E. Lee\u2019s full post in Washington Wire.\n\nWSJ STORIES YOU SHOULDN\u2019T MISS\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES\n\nBOTH PARTIES\u2019 PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNERS INCREASINGLY UNPOPULAR: Both parties\u2019 presidential front-runners are growing increasingly unpopular, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, with Hillary Clinton showing an especially steep decline over the past month. Among voters in both parties, 56% hold a negative view of Mrs. Clinton and 32% hold a positive view. That 24-point gap is almost twice as wide as in a Journal/NBC poll last month, when 51% viewed her negatively and 38% positively, a 13-point gap. GOP front-runner Donald Trump continues to be the candidate in either party viewed most negatively, with 65% of registered voters viewing him unfavorably and 24% favorably, a 41-point difference. Unlike with Mrs. Clinton, those numbers haven\u2019t changed much over the past month. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trump\u2019s nearest competitor for the Republican nomination, has an image problem of his own. Nearly half of voters see him in a negative light, while 26% view him positively. Janet Hook reports.\n\nPlus: GOP voters reject the idea of convention delegates choosing a nominee who hasn\u2019t run in primaries, polling found \u2026 The GOP presidential primary remains as unsettled as ever \u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager on Sunday declined to apologize for an encounter with a reporter that led to a battery charge in Florida \u2026 This year\u2019s presidential campaign at times seems more like a schoolyard brawl than a genteel debate-society competition, but there\u2019s one thing the down-and-dirty tone won\u2019t change: the Ivy League\u2019s dominance among president-producing schools.\n\nDEMOCRATS EYE NOVEMBER WITHOUT A CLEAR FOE: With growing uncertainty about who will emerge as the GOP presidential nominee, Democrats are assembling opposition playbooks against Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz or a Republican-to-be-named-later. Early in the campaign, they mined the backgrounds of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. At another point, they turned their attention to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and research of Ohio Gov. John Kasich is continuing. Still, they can\u2019t entertain every \u201cwhite-knight theory\u201d that anti-Trump Republicans are floating in anticipation of a contested GOP convention in Cleveland in July. \u201cIf Ted Cruz is the nominee, we\u2019ll be ready. If Donald Trump is the nominee, we\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Justin Barasky, communications director for Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \u201cWe\u2019re very well prepared for at least five potential Republican candidates.\u2026You can\u2019t prepare for 100 people.\u201d Colleen McCain Nelson reports.\n\nPlus: The Democratic presidential candidates returned to the campaign trail Sunday in New York City for a two-day sprint to Tuesday\u2019s primary here, with Mrs. Clinton and Bernie Sanders exchanging tough words across town.\n\nTRUMP\u2019S EDGE ON TWITTER CUTS BOTH WAYS: Republican front-runner Donald Trump has used Twitter to engage the public more aggressively than his rivals, and the potential pitfalls of that tactic are increasingly visible. The New York businessman\u2019s broad appeal across the political spectrum, coupled with his approach to citing supportive tweets, has given him a sizable advantage over his opponents on the social media platform: Mr. Trump boasts 7.6 million followers, compared with 1.05 million for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, his chief rival for the GOP nomination, and just 288,000 followers for Ohio Gov John Kasich. Mr. Trump is also ahead of Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton, with an audience of 5.93 million followers, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with 1.97 million. Mr. Trump has also adopted a signature style on Twitter: Instead of using the platform\u2019s retweet button when another user expresses excitement for a rally or offers compliments for a televised interview, Mr. Trump frames the tweets in quotes, sometimes adding a short expression of \u201cgreat!\u201d or \u201cthank you!\u201d He then sends the tweet from his own account, bringing attention to a wide range of users, not all of whom are known to the candidate.

His surrogates and allies have often gone farther than the candidate himself in attacking Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Ronald Brownstein writes that critics of the 1994 crime bill forget that the legislation was a bipartisan effort addressing a genuine need. \u201cThe bill followed years of elevated violence that had many cities reeling.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Posts\u2019s Chris Cillizza says Donald Trump\u2019s lates moves, like stressing the idea that the whole process is \u201crigged\u201d against him, may help him clinch the GOP nomination. \u201cHe has struggled of late because he became the very clear front-runner and didn\u2019t really have anything or anyone to run against. Now that he can rail against the rigged system, he is right back in his messaging wheelhouse,\u201d he writes.\n\nMILESTONE\n\n$777 million: Big U.S. banks added $777 million to loan reserves last quarter, a sharp increase from the prior period.\n\nFEEDBACK: The Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter is The Wall Street Journal\u2019s morning rundown of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation, defense and more.\n\nSend your tips, feedback and suggestions for recommended reading to editor Kate Milani at kate.milani@wsj.com.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Today on the campaign trail and more of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation and defense.", "title": "Capital Journal Daybreak:  Today on the Campaign Trail, More", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/18/capital-journal-the-place-that-wants-donald-trump-most-both-parties-presidential-front-runners-increasingly-unpopular-poll/", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NH315_WNCAPI_P_20160328151053.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Capital Journal Daybreak:  Today on the Campaign Trail, More", "description": "Today on the campaign trail and more of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation and defense.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Kate Milani", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Today on the campaign trail and more of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation and defense.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2016-04-18T12:24:04-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/18/capital-journal-the-place-that-wants-donald-trump-most-both-parties-presidential-front-runners-increasingly-unpopular-poll/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-62701", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Today on the campaign trail and more of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation and defense.", "title": "Capital Journal Daybreak:  Today on the Campaign Trail, More", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/18/capital-journal-the-place-that-wants-donald-trump-most-both-parties-presidential-front-runners-increasingly-unpopular-poll/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "//si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NH315_WNCAPI_P_20160328151053.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-62701", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-04-18T12:43:21-04:00"}, "article_summary": "His remaining hope: Donald Trump will become president and use his business skills to bring jobs to this Appalachian mountain county.\nVoters here say Mr. Trump understands their frustration and will fight the Washington establishment on their behalf.\nFEEDBACK: The Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter is The Wall Street Journal\u2019s morning rundown of the biggest news stories and exclusive features from Washington on politics, policy, financial regulation, defense and more.\nIf Donald Trump is the nominee, we\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Justin Barasky, communications director for Priorities USA Action, a super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\nGOP front-runner Donald Trump continues to be the candidate in either party viewed most negatively, with 65% of registered voters viewing him unfavorably and 24% favorably, a 41-point difference."}
