They weren\u2019t in the case in North Korea and it isn\u2019t the case now \u2014 Iran\u2019s been giving the [International Atomic Energy Agency] the run around for years about its past activities,\u201d the Post reported.\n\nIsrael\u2019s biggest worry with the deal now facing the P5+1 is the \u201csunset clause,\u201d the Post reported.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve not dismantled the infrastructure, you\u2019ve basically tried to put limits that you think are going to be monitored by inspectors and intelligence,\u201d the Israeli official said, to the Post. \u201cAnd then after this period of time, Iran is basically free to do whatever it wants.\u201d\n\nThe White House says that\u2019s not true \u2014 that \u201cfollowing successful implementation of the final step of the comprehensive solution for its duration, the Iranian nuclear program will be treated in the same manner as that of any non-nuclear weapon state party to the [Non-Proliferation Treaty] \u2014 with an emphasis on non-nuclear weapon,\u201d in an email to the Post.\n\nBut Israel might take stronger steps now, the Post reported.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has actually sought to take military force against Iran several times since 2009 \u2014 and even asked for the OK from his cabinet in 2011, the Post said.\n\nThe Associated Press, meanwhile, reported that the United States is seeking to extend the deadline for talks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The deadline for the P5+1 powers and Iran to reach a deal on nuclear power is Monday, but Israel \u2014 hardly confident \u2014 is starting to talk about a preemptive strike as the only logical solution.", "Author": "Cheryl K.
