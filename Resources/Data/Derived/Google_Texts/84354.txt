After a tough first year, Arizonaâ€™s member-operated health insurance co-op is attracting droves of new members.

According to figures provided by the co-op, Meritus, the nonprofit insurer now covers 56,000 Arizonans, 28 percent of the total covered by plans on the federal exchange created by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in Arizona.
