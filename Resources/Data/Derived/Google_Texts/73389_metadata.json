Next, Coburn and teammate Jenny Simpson \u2014 both of whom are University of Colorado Boulder graduates and now represent New Balance \u2014 will return from Europe this week for some training before going overseas once more for a final late-summer push.\n\nCoburn set the American record in the steeplechase during the Glasgow Diamond League meet on July 12, running 9:11.42 to beat Simpson\u2019s previous record, set in 2009 when she was still a student at CU Boulder. Coburn expects to compete in a few more Diamond League races before the season is out, and hopes to end it representing North America in the Continental Cup in Morocco in the steeplechase, she said in an interview last week.\n\nSimpson, like her teammate, also spent the weekend going shorter to help boost her speed. She competed in an 800 at the Madrid IAAF World Challenge Meet in Spain, running 2:05.08, good for ninth place. Americans Charlene Lipsey was second in 2:00.91 and TaTavia Thomas was third in 2:00.95. At just .10 seconds short so far this season, Simpson is setting herself up to break the 1983 American record in the 1,500 set by fellow CU alumna Mary Slaney.\n\nDaniel Petty: dpetty@denverpost.com, 303-954-1081, twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "1500 meters,800 meters,Belgium,Diamond League Track,Emma Coburn,Glasgow Diamond League,Jenny Simpson,KBC Nacht Meet,Madrid IAAF World Challenge,New Balance,University of Colorado Boulder", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Emma Coburn ran 4:05 in the 1500 meters in a meet in Heusden, Belgium, while New Balance teammate Jenny Simpson ran 2:05 in an 800 meter race in Madrid.", "title": "Emma Coburn runs 1500 in 4:05 in Belgium; Jenny Simpson 2:05 in Madrid", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/07/20/emma-coburn-1500-meter-run-belgium-405/26515/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/07/emma-coburn-usa-outdoor-championships-2014.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Emma Coburn ran 4:05 in the 1500 meters in a meet in Heusden, Belgium, while New Balance teammate Jenny Simpson ran 2:05 in an 800 meter race in Madrid.", "creator": "@danielpetty", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2014/07/20/emma-coburn-1500-meter-run-belgium-405/26515/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2014/07/emma-coburn-usa-outdoor-championships-2014.jpg", "title": "Emma Coburn runs 1500 meters in 4:05 in Belgium; Jenny Simpson 2:05 in Madrid", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Emma Coburn ran 4:05 in the 1500 meters in a meet in Heusden, Belgium, while New Balance teammate Jenny Simpson ran 2:05 in an 800 meter race in Madrid."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3b1\"", "article_summary": "Emma Coburn continued her European racing season of success on Saturday, running 4 minutes, 5.29 seconds in the women\u2019s 1,500 meters at a small meet in Belgium.\nSimpson, like her teammate, also spent the weekend going shorter to help boost her speed.\nAt just .10 seconds short so far this season, Simpson is setting herself up to break the 1983 American record in the 1,500 set by fellow CU alumna Mary Slaney.\nNext, Coburn and teammate Jenny Simpson \u2014 both of whom are University of Colorado Boulder graduates and now represent New Balance \u2014 will return from Europe this week for some training before going overseas once more for a final late-summer push.\nShe competed in an 800 at the Madrid IAAF World Challenge Meet in Spain, running 2:05.08, good for ninth place."}
