(Photo: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nRe: \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have what it takes to make America great\u201d (Rabble Rouser, Aug. 31)\n\nAs long as we have people like the writer whining about making changes and telling it like it is, we\u2019ll have another four years of doing nothing.\n\nIf Donald Trump did only one thing of all his promises, he\u2019ll do more than President Barack Obama did in seven years!\n\nWe don\u2019t need another fancy talker in the White House; that has done nothing except set race relations back 20 years.\n\nThere is nobody running for president on the GOP side that can do any worse than Obama has done. By the way, the only thing he\u2019s done in seven years is Obamacare and that is a disaster, because there are millions of people who lost their insurance and millions more whose deductibles have doubled and they can\u2019t afford to go to the doctor.\n\nThe writer wants everything to be political correct! Baloney, it doesn\u2019t work. He says a hat that says \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d is silly.\n\nIf Trump does nothing else but build that wall in four years, that\u2019s good enough for me.\n\nAnyone who doesn\u2019t think Trump would be a better negotiator has their heads in the sand and doesn\u2019t want to face reality.\n\nRetired generals have stated in no uncertain terms that we can win the war against ISIS, but people like this writer don\u2019t want to listen.\n\nThe writer wants another four years of Obama. Help! I\u2019d take four or eight years of an outsider: Donald Trump, Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina.\n\nEarl Burak\n\nCollingswood\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1UHUrQl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "If Trump does nothing else but build that wall in four years, that\u2019s good enough for me.", "og": {"site_name": "Courier-Post", "description": "If Trump does nothing else but build that wall in four years, that\u2019s good enough for me.", "title": "LETTER: Trump can\u2019t be worse than Obama", "url": "http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/opinion/readers/2015/09/09/letter-trump-worse-obama/71969172/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courierpostonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If Trump does nothing else but build that wall in four years, that\u2019s good enough for me.", "title": "LETTER: Trump can\u2019t be worse than Obama", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/127a4240773028cee01cf32c0513c5ec1203dc39/c=788-0-3989-3201&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/09/CherryHill/B9318785539Z.1_20150909181809_000_GD4BSE46R.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@cpsj", "site": "@cpsj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=789840748", "fb": {"app_id": 175025579194557}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "donald trump, barack obama, carly fiorina, ben carson, election 2016"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4344\"", "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a rally against the Iran nuclear deal in Washington on Wednesday.\nIf Donald Trump did only one thing of all his promises, he\u2019ll do more than President Barack Obama did in seven years!\nI\u2019d take four or eight years of an outsider: Donald Trump, Ben Carson or Carly Fiorina.\nThere is nobody running for president on the GOP side that can do any worse than Obama has done.\nThe writer wants another four years of Obama."}
