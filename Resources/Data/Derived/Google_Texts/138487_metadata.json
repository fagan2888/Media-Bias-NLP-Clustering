Work with us on behalf of the values we share and for a great future that is ours to construct for ourselves and our children.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s speech was preceded by more than an hour of introduction speeches, including one from his son George P. Bush, who told the crowd, in Spanish, \u201cIn our family we don\u2019t just speak Spanish. We know the importance of the Latino community.\u201d Speaking directly to the Latinos in the audience, he continued, \u201cIn this campaign, you are very valuable.\u201d\n\nEven over the last six months, as he \u201cexplored\u201d a White House run, Jeb Bush has made courting the Latino vote a priority. He was one of only two likely candidates \u2014 out of a field of nearly 20 \u2014 to speak at the gathering of the nation\u2019s largest Hispanic Evangelical organization. He\u2019s released several videos in Spanish, praising \u201cimmigrants who arrive ready to work\u201d and \u201cthe great contributions of the Mexican-American community to our country.\u201d\n\nIn these ads and in speeches, he repeatedly references the influence of his wife Columba, who hails from Leon, Mexico. He even begins his biography on his official campaign website with the moment he met her, and has often called himself \u201cbi-cultural.\u201d His staff and advisors have sought to play up this image, enthusing to the press with remarks like, \u201cJeb knows what chilaquiles is\u201d and, \u201cA lot of people were calling him \u2018Jebcito.'\u201d\n\nYet on many key issues \u2014 from climate change to health care to the minimum wage \u2014 Bush\u2019s policies are in direct contradiction to what a majority of Latino voters want.\n\nA national poll conducted by the firm Latino Decisions found that 78 percent of US Latinos want to raise the federal minimum wage to at least $10.10 an hour \u2014 including 80 percent of Latino voters in Florida. Yet Bush has said he does not back such a raise, and wants the minimum wage to be determined by individual states, or preferably, the private sector.\n\nBush has also voiced skepticism on the science of climate change and said those who accept it are \u201carrogant.\u201d When he has acknowledged environmental problems, he has stressed that they are less important than the economy. Meanwhile, 82 percent of Latinos said they were somewhat or very concerned that human activity is causing the earth to get warmer. 77 percent said they would support the President taking executive action through the EPA to flight climate change, and 84 percent said it was important for the federal government to take measures to reduce carbon pollution.\n\nThough seen as his party\u2019s \u201cmoderate\u201d on immigration issues, Bush also has vowed to repeal President Obama\u2019s executive actions to give some undocumented children and their parents temporary relief from deportation \u2014 a policy 89 percent of Latinos support.\n\nThat disconnect was evident at Bush\u2019s announcement event, when a group of protesters revealed, mid-speech, shirts that spelled out letter-by-letter: \u201cLegal status is not enough.\u201d The phrase refers to Bush\u2019s mixed record on backing a path to citizenship for undocumented people as a component of comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nAs the protesters were led out of the building by security, Bush called out to them, \u201cThe next president of the United States will pass meaningful immigration reform so that [problem] will be solved, not by executive order.\u201d\n\nBush similarly opposes the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, though 77 percent of Latinos nationwide and 74 percent in Florida said they thought states should take federal money to expand Medicaid programs.\n\nAnd while slashing taxes for the wealthy and corporations while Governor of Florida is a point of pride for Bush, one he touted in his announcement speech, Latino Decisions found that 87 percent of Latinos wanted to see tax increases on the super wealthy, including 82 percent of Latino voters in Florida. Still, Jeb Bush has been hiring economic advisers who worked on President George W. Bush\u2019s massive tax cuts for the rich.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "On many key issues -- from climate change to health care to the minimum wage -- Bush's policies are in direct contradiction to what a majority of Latino voters want.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "On many key issues -- from climate change to health care to the minimum wage -- Bush's policies are in direct contradiction to what a majority of Latino voters want.", "title": "Jeb Bush Reaches For Latino Votes While Promoting Policies That Drive Them Away", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/06/15/3669688/jeb-bush-reaches-latino-votes-promoting-policies-drive-away/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jeb2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On many key issues -- from climate change to health care to the minimum wage -- Bush's policies are in direct contradiction to what a majority of Latino voters want.", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jeb2-321x214.jpg", "title": "Jeb Bush Reaches For Latino Votes While Promoting Policies That Drive Them Away", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jeb2.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jeb2.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-15T16:42:22+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4173\"", "article_summary": "Still, Jeb Bush has been hiring economic advisers who worked on President George W.
