He is expected to play in three games for the Rock Cats.\n\nMorneau, 34, suffered whiplash and a concussion after diving for a ball May 13 in Anaheim against the Angels. He also missed significant time in 2010 and 2011 with concussions.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Morneau took batting practice on the field for the first time since his injury.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to see the ball travel and be out with the boys,\u201d Morneau said. \u201cIt feels like another step in the process.\u201d\n\nMorneau said that his goal was to return to the Rockies this season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going through a regular routine this homestand. I\u2019ll see how it feels, then we\u2019ll see (what\u2019s next),\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be out here if I didn\u2019t think (I could return). That\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nThe Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season.\n\nMorneau won his first career batting title last season, leading the National League with a .319 batting average in his first year with the Rockies.\n\nMorneau played for the Rock Cats for parts of three seasons and helped the Rock Cats to the Eastern League Co-Championship in 2001. In 2002, he batted .298 with 31 doubles, 16 home runs and 80 RBIs at New Britain and was selected to play in the Major League Future\u2019s Game at Miller Park in Milwaukee. He began the 2003 season with the Rock Cats before eventually reaching the Major League\u2019s that same season.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Justin Morneau to begin rehab assignment for Rockies with Double-A New Britain", "title": "Justin Morneau to begin rehab assignment for Rockies with Double-A New Britain", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/28/justin-morneau-to-begin-rehab-assignment-for-rockies-with-double-a-new-britain/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__justin-morneau-rockies-injuryp1-1.jpg", "height": 446}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__justin-morneau-rockies-injuryp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-28T12:40:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T04:50:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Morneau played for the Rock Cats for parts of three seasons and helped the Rock Cats to the Eastern League Co-Championship in 2001.\nThe Rockies\u2019 first baseman, who\u2019s missed most of the season because of a neck injury and concussion symptoms, is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment with the Double-A New Britain Rock Cats Friday night.\nHe began the 2003 season with the Rock Cats before eventually reaching the Major League\u2019s that same season.\nThat\u2019s the point.\u201dThe Rockies have Morneau signed through this season, with a $9 million mutual option next season.\nHe is expected to play in three games for the Rock Cats."}
