Delicious food, soulful music and a time to relax with family and friends. Juneteenth looks like any normal festival, but it has a rich history.

"It is a celebration of the end of slavery," Meridian Juneteenth co-chair Craig Houston explains. "In 1865, General Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas to spread the word to people who didn't know that slaves had actually been free."

The Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Slaves were free. Since that time, people across the world have celebrated their freedom through Juneteenth. This is the 13th annual Juneteenth in Meridian, and organizers have put a lot of work into making sure there's plenty to do.

"I bought some cool shades, and we're playing with a remote control car," Chrishun Rutley says. "Come out here and have fun with us."

"This is a good place to come out and shop with us," Goodies and Food vendor Jackie Ludgood says. "We have all kind of items, we have games, we have a lot of kids here, vendors where you can come out and eat."

Having all these vendors on-hand is a big support to the local economy - helping business owners from right here in this area flourish.

"I'm here to support the festival because all the vendors here are from Lauderdale County," Eddie Gray Holt says. "They're from Meridian. So it's a way of promoting yourself, promoting your own community, creating money within your own community."

150 years later, Juneteenth has evolved, but the heart and the message remains the same: freedom.

The festivities last until midnight.
