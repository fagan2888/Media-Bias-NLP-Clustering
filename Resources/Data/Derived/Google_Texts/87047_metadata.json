Moylan III wants to represent the 17th Congressional District in order to make it and the United States better places to live.\n\n\u201cWe need to alter the trajectory our country is on,\u201d Moylan, 62, of Lake Wynonah, said during an interview Monday with The Republican-Herald Editorial Board.\n\nMoylan, a Republican, is challenging first-term Democratic incumbent Matt Cartwright for the 17th District seat in Tuesday\u2019s General Election.\n\nThe Democratic-leaning 17th District, which was significantly altered after the 2010 Census, includes all of Schuylkill and parts of Carbon, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Monroe and Northampton counties. Although Schuylkill is the only county fully within the 17th, much of the district\u2019s population is in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties.\n\nMoylan said the sanctity of human life is his major issue, noting that Cartwright has a ranking of 0 from pro-life groups and claiming his views are \u201cnot in line\u201d with the people of the 17th District.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I feel passionately about,\u201d Moylan, who also is director of the Simon Kramer Cancer Institute in New Philadelphia, said.\n\nHis pro-life stance extends to many fields, including the war against the terrorist group ISIS, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, which seeks to impose a dictatorship in that region and has beheaded three Western captives: two Americans and one Briton.\n\n\u201cUnless we control them in the Middle East, we\u2019ll be fighting them in Manhattan. Our way of life is being threatened,\u201d he said.\n\nMoylan said he believes we need to take stronger action against ISIS \u2014 which he also calls ISIL, Islamic State in the Levant \u2014 a general term for much of the Near East. He said that name reflects the area the group wants to control.\n\n\u201cThe war has been politicized. We\u2019re not letting our generals run the show,\u201d Moylan said. \u201cThis war won\u2019t be over until the last jihadist is killed.\u201d\n\nThe battle against Ebola is another one where American lives are on the line, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a deadly virus,\u201d Moylan said. \u201cI think it\u2019s being politicized. Turn it over to the doctors.\u201d\n\nA ban on travel from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the African countries where the disease is raging, should be considered, although the Obama administration is opposed to it, he said.\n\n\u201cI would rather err on the side of caution here,\u201d said Moylan, who labeled the Centers for Disease Control the \u201cCenter for Disease Confusion\u201d for its handling of the Ebola crisis.\n\nConcerning illegal immigration, Moylan said he opposes amnesty and believes the top priority should be securing the borders and ports.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great burden to the taxpayers,\u201d he said of illegal immigration.\n\nHe also said the military and/or the National Guard should be used to stop illegal immigration.\n\nConcerning the economy, Moylan said the 17th District is not doing as well as other regions and that it should base its future on energy, including its plentiful deposits of coal and natural gas.\n\n\u201cBring back coal,\u201d he said, adding that the Obama administration is fighting a war on coal. \u201cWe need relief from these onerous (Environmental Protection Agency) regulations. There are still a lot of miners in Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nMoylan also said the unemployment figures are deceptively low, since large numbers of people who are not working are not counted because they have stopped looking for a job.\n\n\u201cThe labor participation rate has changed,\u201d dropping from 66 percent of adults to 62 percent, he said.\n\nMoylan also said the national debt of more than $17 trillion is a huge concern.\n\n\u201cThis is a major problem that\u2019s going to destroy this nation,\u201d and more legislative votes should be based on whether the country can afford what is being proposed, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re addicted to this runaway spending.\u201d\n\nHe said that if the national debt were converted into a stack of dollar bills, it would reach 70,000 miles into space.\n\n\u201cThis is the president\u2019s new space program,\u201d Moylan said.\n\nHe said a Republican-controlled Senate, which many political pundits believe will occur as a result of Tuesday\u2019s election, would not be a bad thing.\n\n\u201cIt might be a good thing\u201d for the Senate to stand against Obama, Moylan said. He said many bills that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has passed are languishing in the Senate.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, must be repealed, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be turning over our health ... to the government,\u201d Moylan said. \u201cThe best medical system in the world could be destroyed.\u201d\n\nFailing that, he said, it should be modified significantly, and Moylan has proposed 12 ways to do that, including health savings accounts, the ability to shop across state lines and limitations on lawsuits.\n\nAnother clear difference between him and Cartwright, Moylan said, is the right to bear arms embodied in the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution says we can\u2019t infringe on that,\u201d Moylan said. \u201cIt\u2019s keeping us safe from tyrannical government. I\u2019m in favor of keeping our citizens safe. I\u2019m passionate about the Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nHe calls Cartwright \u201can enemy of gun owners\u2019 rights.\u201d\n\nThe election offers voters in Schuylkill County and the rest of the 17th District a chance to choose someone who will stand with them, Moylan said.\n\n\u201cThe people in the 17th District have a clear choice,\u201d he said.\n\nCandidate: Dr. David J.
