They have had high-profile successes for sure, such as the killing of Osama bin Laden and the rescue of Captain Richard Phillips, the American merchant mariner, from Somali pirates. They are arguably the best-trained solders in the world.\n\nRelated: Reporter\u2019s Execution Could Unleash U.S. Against ISIS\n\nAs DOD shifts from a large war model to a small one, these troops have been elevated in importance. This is reflected in the Pentagon\u2019s budget for next year: While the rest of DOD\u2019s budget is shrinking, funding for Special Operations is on the rise. DOD plans to add 4,000 \u2013 swelling their ranks to nearly 70,000 \u2013 and is getting a budget bump of 10 percent to $7.7 billion.\n\nWhile these troops are well trained and well funded, however, the success of their missions is not a guarantee. Most Special Operations missions are clandestine. But the Syria failure, combined with a second failure last year, shows that they are not invincible.\n\nAccording to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, bad intelligence caused the Foley rescue operation to fail. DOD had outdated information about where the hostages were being held.\n\nRelated: With Iraq in Ruins, ISIS Turns to Genocide\n\n\u201cThe fact is you all know intelligence doesn\u2019t come wrapped in a package with a bow,\u201d said Hagel at a Thursday news conference at the Pentagon. \u201cIt\u2019s a mosaic of many pictures of many factors. The enemy always has a say in everything.\u201d\n\nIn their second public failure last October, SEAL Team 6 - the team that killed bin Laden - was turned away from a Somali beach while attempting to capture a high-level leader of Al Shabaab, a group responsible for the attack on an upscale shopping mall in Kenya. In that instance, the SEALs were spotted before they could commence their operation \u2013 and faced heavier than expected resistance.\n\nLooking bluntly at these failures is not the same as suggesting that the special operators involved did their jobs poorly. But a review does show that in conducting the most difficult missions in all of the American military, failure is sometimes an outcome.\n\nHagel suggested as much Thursday. \"This operation, by the way, was flawless, but the hostages were not there,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Republicans: ISIS's Next Target Is America\n\nHagel also hinted at the limitations of using Special Operations. He said that ISIS had grown so sophisticated that small teams of highly trained soldiers would not be enough to defeat ISIS.\n\n\u201cISIL is as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess \u2013 they are tremendously well funded. This is beyond anything that we\u2019ve seen.\n\n\u201cSo we must prepare for everything,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the only way you do that is take a cold, steely, hard look at it and get ready.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The failure of the mission to rescue American hostages in Syria shows the limitations of Special Operations.", "title": "Failure to Rescue Foley Shows Special Ops Limitations", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/22/Failure-Rescue-Foley-Shows-Special-Ops-Limitations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_US_Special_Forces.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/22/Failure-Rescue-Foley-Shows-Special-Ops-Limitations", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06132014_US_Special_Forces.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The failure of the mission to rescue American hostages in Syria shows the limitations of Special Operations.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d45\"", "article_summary": "Related: Republicans: ISIS's Next Target Is AmericaHagel also hinted at the limitations of using Special Operations.\nAccording to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, bad intelligence caused the Foley rescue operation to fail.\nMost Special Operations missions are clandestine.\nThis is reflected in the Pentagon\u2019s budget for next year: While the rest of DOD\u2019s budget is shrinking, funding for Special Operations is on the rise.\nBut the Syria failure, combined with a second failure last year, shows that they are not invincible."}
