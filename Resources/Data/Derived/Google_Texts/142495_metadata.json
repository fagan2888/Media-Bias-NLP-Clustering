Animal Welfare is involved in the investigation, but said misinformation and threats against its officers are making things difficult.\n\nThe video is graphic and may be difficult to watch.\n\nAnimal Welfare Director Julie Bank said this is a case of dogs that attacked each other in a backyard and the homeowner is cooperating.\n\nThe video was shared thousands of times over the weekend, showing three pit bulls attacking a fourth pit bull.\n\nAnimal Welfare and Oklahoma City police investigated. They found the homeowner's son and several teens at the home, but not the homeowner.\n\nAccording to the report, \u201cThe dog was inside the garage, lying on a dirty blanket\u2026there was an overwhelming smell of infection and feces.\u201d It also said, \u201cThe dog was hot to the touch and was covered in an ooze.\u201d\n\nPolice and Animal Welfare took the injured dog from the home for medical treatment on Friday. The dog is now doing well and had minor injuries.\n\n\u201cWe promise you that we are doing right by these animals,\u201d Bank said.\n\nAccording to the report, police were not able to make contact with the homeowner until Saturday. The owner was given four citations, but the agency cannot reveal why just yet.\n\nNow the agency is dealing with people online who are threatening animal welfare officers and even sharing officers' personal information as a way to pressure the agency to do more to the homeowner.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it's very easy to sit behind a computer and type bad messages,\u201d Bank told News 9.\n\nAnimal Control told News 9 they were at the home several times on Friday when the video was reported, but had to follow certain procedures before taking the dog.\n\nBank said the agency's officers cannot charge into a home if they want a case to stick.\n\n\u201cYou really just can't come in like a renegade because of an allegation and invade someone's property or take someone's property in the case of an animal,\u201d Bank explained.\n\nAllegations were also made that the homeowner was keeping puppies inside a hot garage. Bank said those claims were unfounded.\n\n\u201cDon't start pointing fingers and accusing, we want you to assume that we are caring as you are,\u201d Bank added.\n\nBecause this is an open investigation, we could not get video of the dog, but we were allowed to see him off-camera. He was running around and eating, with medicine on his bite marks on his head and back.\n\nAnimal welfare will keep the dog until the case is closed. According to the report, charges are pending.\n\nThe pet owner did not want to talk to News 9, but said the remaining three pit bulls that were not seized are no longer on his property.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Animal Welfare is involved in the investigation, but said misinformation and threats against its officers are making things difficult.", "author": "Lacie Lowry", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/29325948/okc-animal-welfare-officers-threatened-during-investigation-into-dog-fight-video", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8072014_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Animal Welfare is involved in the investigation, but said misinformation and threats against its officers are making things difficult.", "title": "OKC Animal Welfare Officers Threatened During Investigation Into Dog Fight Video"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/8072014_G.jpg", "description": "Animal Welfare is involved in the investigation, but said misinformation and threats against its officers are making things difficult.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Animal Welfare Officers Threatened During Investigation Into Dog Fight Video"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-animal-welfare-officers-threatened-during-investigation-into-dog-fight-video", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/06/15", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs, animal welfare, dogs, fighting, each other, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS09", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs, animal welfare, dogs, fighting, each other, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "article_summary": "The investigation is ongoing into a viral video showing Oklahoma City dogs attacking each other.\nAnimal Welfare is involved in the investigation, but said misinformation and threats against its officers are making things difficult.\nAnimal Welfare and Oklahoma City police investigated.\nNow the agency is dealing with people online who are threatening animal welfare officers and even sharing officers' personal information as a way to pressure the agency to do more to the homeowner.\nAnimal Welfare Director Julie Bank said this is a case of dogs that attacked each other in a backyard and the homeowner is cooperating."}
