NEW YORK CITY, New York — GOP presidential candidate and billionaire Donald Trump talked about his upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live and was asked to do an impression of fellow GOP candidate Jeb Bush, during a press conference on Tuesday.

“I don’t want to do that. I don’t like showing a person sleeping at a podium,” Trump said to dozens of reporters at a press conference in Trump Tower. The reporters gasped and chuckled at Trump’s joke.

Trump has long been critical of Bush – saying he’s too low energy to be President of the United States.

“I think it’s going to be very hard,” Trump said, when asked if Bush could make a comeback with his presidential campaign.

Bush reportedly relaunched his campaign earlier this week with a book tour and slogan, ‘Jeb Can Fix It.”

“We need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track,” Trump said. “You can’t do that when you don’t have that.”

Trump added that fellow GOP candidates Dr. Ben Carson and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) don’t have energy either.

“[Jeb] lacks the quality [of energy] that you need,” he added. “Ben Carson does not have that energy.”

He said a leader needs energy to “straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade-deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money.”

“We have a president right now that doesn’t have energy. I mean you think Obama has energy? He has no energy and he’s been a horrible president,” he declared.

“Certainly, Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion,” Trump repeated.
