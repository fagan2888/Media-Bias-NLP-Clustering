Called \u201cModel to Monument (M2M): Creating Work for Public Spaces,\u201d the program is in the fourth year of a five-year partnership with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\nA collaborative work by the artists will be installed in Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, in addition to the seven on view in Riverside Park.\n\nSculptures installed in the park last year included works by Japanese artists Reina Kubota and Yasumitsu Morito, Anna Kuchel Rabinowitz, Sherwin Banfield and Be\u00f1at Iglesias Lopez.
