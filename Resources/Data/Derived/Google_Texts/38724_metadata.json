But the arts are more than just the movie of the week. And today, thanks to public/private partnerships and grants from funding agencies such as the National Endowment for the Arts, some rural communities have the opportunity to participate in partnerships in creative placemaking that help to preserve cultural heritage as well as establish centers for access to the arts.\n\nThe arts are essential not only in their contribution to our quality of life, but also in their enrichment of our cultural engagement. However, support for the arts is tough business. When a community\u2019s demands for social services, public safety, education and basic infrastructure compete fiercely for limited public funds, the cultural and arts initiatives are often considered unnecessary.\n\nThis is even more apparent in rural Colorado. Urban locales, because of their very natures, tend to fare better in support for the arts, in large part because of their population density. There is help for the arts in rural communities, thought, through programs such as those developed by the NEA. This year, a couple of Colorado\u2019s high plains communities will receive significant and welcome support through the NEA\u2019s \u201cOur Town\u201d program, which benefits arts programs in small communities.\n\nThe NEA recently awarded a $25,000 \u201cOur Town\u201d grant to Colorado\u2019s M12, an interdisciplinary arts group based in Byers, for its \u201cAction on the Plains: Contemporary Art in Rural Environments.\u201d Action on the Plains is an artist-in-residence program in Colorado\u2019s Washington and Arapahoe Counties, and is the result of a partnership between M12 and the Office of Washington County Colorado Commissioners.\n\nThe arts \u2014 and public funding for the arts \u2014 are part of what distinguishes a society. I\u2019ve visited and lived in countries where the arts are a privilege of the elite, and where access to art and culture is both geographically and financially restrictive for those outside established cultural centers. Not only do these people lack a basic enjoyment of artistic expression, they are also deprived of entree into their own cultural histories.\n\nI don\u2019t want to see this happen here, and my concern is not all that far-fetched. With my own close ties to rural Colorado, I am keenly aware that some communities removed from large metro areas experience of a sense of exclusion, an out-of-sight out-of-mind frustration at their inability to access many sources of substantial funding for the arts. Public/private partnerships and collaborations between nonprofit and local government organizations are key to turning this deficit around.\n\nSuch partnerships in rural locales, however, continue to face significant challenges such as assembling adequate financing and ensuring program sustainability. In my hometown of Monte Vista, for example, attempts were suspended in February to establish a community center for the arts (in the same theater where the movie of the week was my local entertainment) because of conflicts between supporters and the city over ongoing maintenance of the venue.\n\nhe fate of this project remains uncertain.\n\nOut on Colorado\u2019s high plains, though, another effort at creative placemaking in rural communities is getting a significant boost. M12 will use its \u201cOur Town\u201d grant money to extend experiential art-making in and around the towns of Byers and Last Chance, selecting creative practitioners who work in an ever-expanding international dialogue about art practices in rural environments, an \u201cinterconnectivity\u201d between the artists, the citizens, and the landscapes.\n\nPrograms such as Action on the Plains, which are rooted in less urban places, produce notable work that values the identities of Colorado\u2019s often underserved rural communities, and they lay the foundation to challenge an urban-centric view of art.\n\nSupport and development of the arts in Colorado\u2019s small towns is no easy task, and we can\u2019t do it alone. Assistance from programs such as NEA\u2019s \u201cOur Town\u201d grants, and partnerships such Action on the Plains are crucial in creative placemaking, partnerships that ensure the sustainability of the arts and promote the unique cultural identities of Colorado\u2019s rural communities.\n\nAndrea W.
