QUALIFIED FOR THE U.S. WOMEN'S OPEN, SHE MISSED THE CUT FOR THE FINAL ROUNDS BUT SHE IS CLEARLY A YOUNG WOMAN TO WATCH. AND SO IS TAYLOR TOWNSEND, SHE'S AN 18-YEAR-OLD TENNIS PRODIGY GETTING READY TO PLAY THIS WEEK AT WIMBLEDON AND SHE'S BECOMING A ROLE MODEL FOR YOUNG WOMEN BECAUSE OF COMMENTS ABOUT HER IMAGE THAT SHE REFUSED TO LET STOP HER. WE GET HER STORY TONIGHT FROM NBC'S ERICA HILL. >> Reporter: 18-YEAR-OLD TAYLOR TOWNSEND IS READY. >> I'M SO EXCITED. I LOVE THE GRASS. I LOVE WIMBLEDON. I LOVE THE ALL ENGLAND CLUP. >> Reporter: WHILE SHE HAS SEEN VICTORY AT WIMBLEDON AS A JUNIOR, THIS WILL BE HER FIRST TIME ON THE GRASS AS A PROFESSIONAL. THOUGH AFTER SHER SHOWING AT THE FRENCH OPEN IS ANY INDICATION, IT WON'T BE HER LAST. >> I SHOCKED MYSELF AT THE FRENCH, TO BE HONEST. JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T FULLY BELIEVE THAT I BELONG IN THE CIRCUIT. >> Reporter: A LEFTY WHO LOVES TO PLAY THE NET, TOWNSEND MADE IT TO THIRD ROUND AT ROLAND GARROS BY DEFEATING HER OPPONENT AND THEN RANKED NUMBER 20 IN THE WORLD. >> SHE HAS EVERYTHING POSSIBLE THAT YOU WOULD WANT IN A TENNIS PLAYER. I MEAN SHE CAN DO ANYTHING ON THE COURT. >> Reporter: TOWNSEND'S SUCCESS AS A PRO ALSO HELPED TO PROVE SHE HAD COME A LONG WAY FROM THE SUMMER OF 2012 WHEN THE USTA REFUSED TO PAY FOR HER TRAVEL TO THE U.S. OPEN UNTIL SHE GOT IN BETTER SHAPE RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A MORE DIPLOMATIC WAY OF SAYING THE TEAM NEEDED TO SLIM DOWN. >> WHETHER YOU HEARD THAT, WHAT DID IT MEAN TO YOU? >> I WAS DISAPPOINTED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I FELT AS THOUGH IT GAVE ME MORE DRIVE. >> Reporter: INSTEAD OF SWELLING ON THE SNUB, SHE PUSHED HERSELF HARDER AND EMBRACING HER BODY AND HER GOALS. AFTER PAYING HER WAY TO THE OPEN, SHE PROVED A POWERFUL POINT ON THE COURT, WINNING THE DOUBLE'S TITLE AND FINISHING 2012 RANKED NUMBER ONE JUNIOR IN THE WORLD. DID IT MAKE THAT VICTORY AT THE OPEN A LITTLE SWEETER AND THAT NUMBER ONE RANKING? >> OH, YEAH. >> Reporter: TOWNSEND'S TALL LENT, DRIVE, AND THE WAY SHE HANDLED HERSELF BROUGHT PLENTY OF BIG NAMES INTO HER CORNER INCLUDING CURRENT COACH FORMER TOP PRO ZINA GARRISON. >> THIS HAS GIVEN HER SOMETHING TO HOLD ON AND GRASP. WHEN SHE GETS THE TWEAK AND SHE IS STAYING THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR BODY IMAGE, IT WILL MAKE HER BETTER. >> Reporter: TOWNSEND IS SPREADING HER MESSAGE.
