Shaking up Washington . . . somehow. Replacing Obamacare with . . . something. The new big idea \u2014 Donald Trump\u2019s call to close loopholes on hedge fund managers \u2014 scratches a populist itch, but won\u2019t bring fundamental change.\n\nBut I know of a tax proposal that could. It has to do with food. And it\u2019s laid out in a piece that ran last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, by three Boston-area experts in nutrition and economics. They call for an across-the-board tax, in the range of 10 to 30 percent, on processed foods \u2014 basically, anything that comes with a nutrition label \u2014 plus fast food and large chain restaurants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey\u2019d use the proceeds to subsidize food that is actually good for us: fruits, nuts, beans, seafood. The ultimate goal: to make it cheaper for an inner-city mother to buy her kids apples than potato chips.\n\n\u201cThere are very few simple things that could completely alter the medical and economic challenges the country faces,\u201d said Dr. David Ludwig, the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital child obesity expert who coauthored the piece.\n\nSimple, of course, is not the same as easy. In Massachusetts, we can\u2019t even get our act together to eliminate a tax break on sugar-sweetened beverages. That\u2019s partly because of a powerful beverage lobby, but it\u2019s also because of a powerful idea: that people should be able to choose what they eat without the nanny state reaching into their pantries.\n\nBut that\u2019s where Ludwig says we need a reality check: The government is deeply involved in food policy already. We spend $20 billion per year to subsidize corn, wheat, and soybeans \u2014 overwhelmingly used for products like cheap animal feed, processed snacks, and high fructose corn syrup.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re dumping cheap junk food, massive amounts, into the food supply,\u201d Ludwig said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the current price of food doesn\u2019t reflect the real cost. By 2030, we\u2019re due to spend $1 trillion per year on obesity-related diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Diet now leads to more preventable illnesses than tobacco. And we\u2019re comfortable with taxing tobacco to the hilt. As Ludwig points out, you\u2019re still free to buy cigarettes. You\u2019re just paying in advance for the lung cancer you might get.\n\nMeanwhile, our current approach to the obesity crisis \u2014 reminding people to eat healthy and exercise \u2014 only goes so far. There are too many distractions and perverse incentives, marketing dollars used to lead teenagers to soda and kids to sugared cereals, supermarket practices that put junk foods front and center on the shelves.\n\n\u201cIn 100 or 200 years, they will look at us the way that we look at the Romans and think, \u2018How could they live like that?\u2019 \u201d said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard economist who coauthored the piece. (The third author is Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, a cardiologist who is dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science at Tufts.)\n\nSo far, their proposal has gotten little traction. It\u2019s too simple, too broad, too insurmountable, it seems, to anyone with a passing knowledge of Washington lobbying interests.\n\nLudwig says he needs a coalition: medical and public health professionals; budget hawks; advocates for children and the poor; businesses fearful of soaring health insurance premiums.\n\nHe also sees a ray of hope in Donald Trump \u2014 not the candidate so much as what his popularity represents. In a time of political paralysis, Ludwig suggests, there\u2019s room for radical thinking \u2014 an incentive for boldness, as a way to break through. Everyone is looking for a non-absurd candidate with an eye-catching, meaningful idea.\n\nSo to the hordes in New Hampshire: Who\u2019s willing to take this one on?\n\nJoanna Weiss can be reached at weiss@globe.com.
