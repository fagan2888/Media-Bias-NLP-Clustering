Accountable care organizations share data and try to figure out the most effective, least costly ways to provide health care.\n\n\u201cYou are looking at an aggregate of hundreds of thousands of lives. You can look at truly where the best practices are,\u201d Rai said. \u201cThe intent is to lower costs and improve quality.\u201d\n\nRai emphasized they would be sharing aggregate data, not individual patient records.\n\nThe ACO also can contract with insurance providers as one entity, which means members of the individual networks can use physicians and hospitals throughout the network and the network can cut costs to members.\n\nIntegrated Health Network is based in Brookfield and its members include Agnesian Healthcare, Columbia St. Mary\u2019s, Froedtert Health, Medical College of Wisconsin, Ministry Health Care and Wheaton St. Franciscan Healthcare. Medical College of Wisconsin has a campus at St. Norbert College in De Pere, which Rai said will provide opportunities for even better connections with the network.\n\n\u201cIHN has the infrastructure in place for its members to truly collaborate on improving quality and efficiency,\u201d said Therese Pandl, president and CEO of HSHS\u2019s Eastern Wisconsin Division. \u201cBeing part of an established alliance that is already working with health insurers will help us prepare for coming changes in health care delivery to the benefit of our patients and our communities.\u201d\n\nHospital Sisters Health System\u2019s headquarters is in Springfield, Ill. Its facilities in Wisconsin include St. Vincent Hospital and St. Mary\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, both in Green Bay; St. Clare Memorial Hospital, Oconto Falls; St. Nicholas Hospital, Sheboygan; Sacred Heart Hospital, Eau Claire; and St. Joseph\u2019s Hospital and HSHS Medical Group, both in Chippewa Falls. Hospital Sisters also is a partner in Prevea Health, the remainder of which is owned by its physicians.\n\nPrevea include more than 300 primary- and specialty-care physicians, 20 health centers and 27 employer-based clinics in Northeastern Wisconsin, Prevea, Hospital Sisters and Dean Health Plan jointly own Prevea360 Health Plan.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1Djyvrn", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin allows health systems to share best practices", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin allows health systems to share best practices", "title": "Prevea, HSHS join network to improve quality of care", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/money/2014/12/11/prevea-hshs-join-network-improve-quality-care/20276101/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin allows health systems to share best practices", "title": "Prevea, HSHS join network to improve quality of care", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/826e52df9949940762197f7c6f47648930e943b5/c=0-282-1637-1919&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/12/11/B9315464306Z.1_20141211195618_000_G5L9CRPDV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "article": {"author": "Richard Ryman - Press-Gazette"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd26a9\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Rai (Photo: File/Press-Gazette Media)Buy PhotoHospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) and Prevea Health agreed to join Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin, a network of independent health care systems and the Medical College of Wisconsin.\nAccountable care organizations share data and try to figure out the most effective, least costly ways to provide health care.\nHospital Sisters also is a partner in Prevea Health, the remainder of which is owned by its physicians.\nPrevea include more than 300 primary- and specialty-care physicians, 20 health centers and 27 employer-based clinics in Northeastern Wisconsin, Prevea, Hospital Sisters and Dean Health Plan jointly own Prevea360 Health Plan.\nIntegrated Health Network is based in Brookfield and its members include Agnesian Healthcare, Columbia St. Mary\u2019s, Froedtert Health, Medical College of Wisconsin, Ministry Health Care and Wheaton St. Franciscan Healthcare."}
