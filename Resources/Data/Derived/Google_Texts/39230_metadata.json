According to Sue Greenberg, the executive director of Volunteer Lawyers and Accountants for the Arts, artists are particularly prone to these pains.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re basically self-employed and many of them have relatively low incomes or they work someplace where they have part-time employment and (health insurance) is not covered, so compared to the rest of the population there are more artists that haven\u2019t been covered,\u201d said Greenberg.\n\nLike many multiple job-holders, artists, musicians and actors are frequently without access to work-place provided health insurance and without the knowledge base to navigate health-insurance options mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Artists' incomes are also prone to fluctuate from year to year based on shows, exhibits and subsequent sales, Greenberg said, changing eligibility within the ACA structure.\n\nSo Volunteer Lawyers and Accountants for the Arts launched an information and aid campaign aimed at getting as many St. Louis artists insured as possible. The group is hosting informational sessions and workshops at the Regional Arts Commission aimed to help artists understand and select health insurance that\u2019s best for them. The organization\u2019s even taken to twitter to find support from leaders in the arts community.\n\nLisa Melandri, director of the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, was quick to support the program. She agrees with Greenberg\u2019s assessment that artists often work in circumstances that leave them without easy access to health insurance.\n\n\u201cJust because you are working and thinking and creating things outside the bounds of what we think of as normal workplaces, you shouldn\u2019t be suffering for that by not having health insurance,\u201d Melandri said.\n\nAccording to a representative for the Missouri Foundation for Health, statistics aren\u2019t available that cover the number of uninsured artists in the region or the percentage of artists affected by insurance-related issues. Yet \u201cnearly half of all local artists earn less than $25,000 a year, according to a 2012 Regional Arts Commission survey released in 2013.\u201d This places artists firmly in the camp of Missourians most likely to be employed but uninsured.\n\nArtist and curator Denise Schilling runs the Fontbonne University Fine Arts Gallery and teaches at multiple St. Louis colleges. She used the VLAA services to better understand her health insurance options. Schilling has three part-time jobs and lost insurance she had through her husband\u2019s work when they divorced. Schilling said the workshops help.\n\n\u201cI was able to get a very good health plan, actually I think it\u2019s better than the one I was able to get with my husband\u2019s plan.\u201d\n\nArtist Nicole Cooper attended one VLAA session but didn\u2019t use the organization to choose her insurance. Yet Cooper said she felt the session left her a more discerning insurance consumer.\n\n\u201cThey made it really helpful for me to understand my options,\u201d she said.\n\nThe VLAA will be holding informational meetings, workshops and personally tailored help sessions through the open enrollment period\u2019s end in January.\n\nThe work is supported in partnership with Saint Louis University\u2019s Law School students and Cover Missouri, an organization aimed at providing information and helping reduce the number of uninsured Missourians.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts & Culture", "description": "Navigating health insurance can be a headache for almost anyone who cobbles together multiple part-time jobs or works freelance.
