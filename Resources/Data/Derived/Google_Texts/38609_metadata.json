( LEWIS GEYER )\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: The Times-Call's series Take Two revisits people we have written about in the past year. Take Two stories will run on Mondays.\n\nLongmont community activist Dan Benavidez says he's been humbled by the positive reactions he's heard from readers of his book that was published last spring.\n\nThe book, \"For All the Wrong Reasons,\" recounts Benavidez's personal experiences as a Latino man in a frequently racist world, including his some of the discrimination he encountered after arriving in Longmont in the early 1960s.\n\n\"It's a memoir,\" Benavidez said recently. \"These are my memories.\"\n\nBut Benavidez said his book's review of his personal growth since childhood also underscores the positive changes he's seen -- and that others credit him with helping foster -- in this city.\n\nBenavidez has said a catalyzing moment for him and for Longmont came in August 1980, after a rookie police officer shot and killed two unarmed young Latino men on Main Street during a traffic stop gone bad.\n\nAt the urging of civic leaders, Benavidez led a peaceful march on city hall, an event and approach his contemporaries have said probably prevented the community from erupting into violence and chaos.\n\nThat put Benavidez on a path to activism that included service as a Longmont City Council member.\n\nHe's served on the Longmont Police Department's Latino Advisory Council and as a volunteer for the Longmont Community Justice Partnership. Now, he is vice president of Eco-Cycle's board of directors and a member of the Longmont House Development Corporation board.\n\nOne of the points of his book, he said, is that \"our community, all of us, came together to set that path, to break the barriers\" between the white-majority population and the Latinos that long had been in their midst.\n\n\"We did it,\" Benavidez said of the Longmont leaders and other concerned residents. \"And I mean 'We.'\n\n\"I've had people from other communities tell me,\" after they read his book, that \"Longmont is a special place,\" he said.\n\nBenavidez said he's heard from readers in other countries who've told him that his experiences resonate with their own.\n\n\"For All the Wrong Reasons,\" framed as a set of recollections Benavidez shared with his late mother, ends just before she died in 1996.\n\nHe said he left \"volumes of stuff\" from his youth and adult years out of the volume, as well as stories about the years since his mother's death, but that he may follow up with other books.\n\nBenavidez received one of Boulder County CareConnect's \"2013 Longmont Legends\" award in September. That organization, which serves seniors and adults with disabilities, recognized Benavidez as this year's \"Legendary Volunteer.\"\n\nJohn Fryar can be reached at 303-684-5211 or jfryar@times-call.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_24731019/dan-benavidez-humbled-by-readers-reactions-all", "modificationDate": "2013-12-15T23:48:17-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1215/20131215__16tcatak-1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By John Fryar   Longmont Times-Call", "description": "Longmont community activist Dan Benavidez says he's been humbled by the positive reactions he's heard from readers of his book that was published last spring.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:24731019:view"}, "startDate": "2013-12-15T23:44:29-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_24731019/dan-benavidez-humbled-by-readers-reactions-all", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1215/20131215__16tcatak-1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Longmont community activist Dan Benavidez says he's been humbled by the positive reactions he's heard from readers of his book that was published last spring.", "title": "Dan Benavidez: 'I'm humbled' by readers' reactions to 'For all the Wrong Reasons'"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Longmont community activist Dan Benavidez says he's been humbled by the positive reactions he's heard from readers of his book that was published last spring.", "title": "Dan Benavidez: 'I'm humbled' by readers' reactions to 'For all the Wrong Reasons'", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_24731019/dan-benavidez-humbled-by-readers-reactions-all", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1215/20131215__16tcatak-1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-15T23:44:29-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2023-12-15T21:57:51-0700", "sailthru.title": "Dan Benavidez: 'I'm humbled' by readers' reactions to 'For all the Wrong Reasons'", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By John Fryar", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2013/1215/20131215__16tcatak-1.jpg", "pubDate": "2013-12-15T23:48:25-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad99\"", "article_summary": "Dan Benavidez, with his book, \"For All the Wrong Reasons,\" says he may write another book about his life since 1996.\nLongmont community activist Dan Benavidez says he's been humbled by the positive reactions he's heard from readers of his book that was published last spring.\n\"For All the Wrong Reasons,\" framed as a set of recollections Benavidez shared with his late mother, ends just before she died in 1996.\nBenavidez said he's heard from readers in other countries who've told him that his experiences resonate with their own.\nHe's served on the Longmont Police Department's Latino Advisory Council and as a volunteer for the Longmont Community Justice Partnership."}
