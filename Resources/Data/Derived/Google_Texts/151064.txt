Bloomfield, IA

An amazing act of sportsmanship - led to a disqualification!

"No one from our school had ever won a district champ. To tell you the truth I had tears of joy when I finished. It had all paid off this one moment," Davis County High School senior Zach Hougland said.

It's a moment that didn't last long. While Zach Hougland was hanging out near the finish line, he spotted a rival runner - Garrett Hinson of Mediapolis - going down.

"Breathing extremely hard. Didn't want to see that - pictured myself in his shoes. I yelled, 'Is anyone gonna help him?', so I just jumped in and started walking beside him, so I gave him my hand and gave him a push to the finish line and he finished on his own," Hougland said.

He never imagined what would come next - a disqualification. The rule states no runner can help or receive aid from another runner. Despite pleas from fans and coaches, the officials held firm.

"All that work for nothing. I was devastated," Hougland said.

The Iowa High School Athletic Association uses its rules from a national federation. Bud Legg of the ISAA says he can't change Saturday's ruling, it was the proper call, and his hands are tied. Legg added that any future rule change would have to come from the national federation that sets the rules.

The good news? Zach's team still qualified for state - barely, and he'll get his chance at a medal Saturday in Fort Dodge. And that runner that he helped will be there cheering for his new friend.

"He risked his chances at state for helping, a pretty crazy thing for him to do. He's a pretty good guy for doing that. That's amazing," Hinson said.
