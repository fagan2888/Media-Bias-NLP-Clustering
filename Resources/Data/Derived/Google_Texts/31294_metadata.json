Donald Trump is still the Republican front-runner. Sen. Marco Rubio is, for now, the establishment\u2019s best (only?) hope. And Sen. Ted Cruz is the guy who looks best positioned to win.\n\nYes, you heard that right.\n\nCruz (R-Tex.), as of today, has the most direct route to the Republican presidential nomination \u2014 assuming that the past history of GOP nomination fights works as a broad predictor of where the 2016 race is headed.\n\nLet me elaborate.\n\nRelated: Why Ted Cruz Is Surging in the Polls\n\n1. Cruz is positioned as the most conservative candidate in the race. Although Trump gets all the attention for his over-the-top statements, Cruz has staked out a position on the far right on virtually every major hot-button issue, including immigration, Obamacare, national security and the fight against the Islamic State militant group. And, tonally, Cruz comes across as aggressively and unapologetically conservative \u2014 a less controversial and more electable version of real estate magnate Trump.\n\n\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News November poll showed that Cruz\u2019s numbers are in the stratosphere among voters who identify themselves as \u201cvery\u201d conservative; 69 percent had a favorable opinion of him while just 21 percent regarded him in an unfavorable light.\n\nIn a Republican primary \u2014 particularly one in which the GOP electorate is mad at everyone (including those in their own party) for an alleged lack of commitment to conservative principles \u2014 being the guy all the way on the ideological right is a very, very good thing.\n\n2. Cruz has raised the second-most money in the Republican race. Bet you didn\u2019t know that! Yes, former Florida governor Jeb Bush is by far and away the fundraising leader in the race. Not only did we know that would be the case, but we also now know that it has done him, roughly, zero good. Cruz\u2019s money, on the other hand, is \u2014 or at least was \u2014 unexpected.\n\nRelated: Ted Cruz: 20 Things You Didn\u2019t Know About Him\n\nCruz\u2019s $65 million raised is all the more impressive because, unlike Bush, who raised the vast majority of his money with the support of his Right to Rise super PAC, Cruz has a relatively even balance between the funds raised for his campaign committee ($26.5 million) and those collected by a universe of supportive super PACs ($38 million). Having so much money in his campaign account means that Cruz will get more bang for his buck, because candidates get the lowest unit rate on TV ad buying while super PACs have to pay full freight for their airtime.\n\nCruz\u2019s money is also what separates him from other candidates who secured the mantle of \u201cmost conservative candidate in the primary.\u201d Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former senator from Pennsylvania Rick Santorum won the Iowa caucuses during past campaigns \u2014 more on Cruz and Iowa below \u2014 but they were unable to capitalize on that win or sustain their support because they had so little money.\n\nCruz is the best-case scenario for those who want to see a movement conservative nominated: He\u2019s of the conservative movement but has the fundraising ability of an establishment Republican.\n\n3. Cruz is the Iowa front-runner. Recent history makes clear that you need to win one of the first three states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina \u2014 to have a realistic chance of being the party\u2019s nominee. (Remember how well former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani\u2019s \u201cwait until Florida\u201d strategy worked in 2008? Thought so.)\n\nRelated: Cruz to Trump: You\u2019ll Lose, and I\u2019ll Take Your Voters\n\nCruz is emerging rapidly as the favorite in Iowa\u2019s caucuses. Three polls released in the past five days put Cruz at the front of the pack in Iowa \u2014 including the influential (and almost always right) Des Moines Register survey, which had the senator from Texas 10 points clear of Trump.\n\nWinning Iowa would give Cruz momentum going into New Hampshire \u2014 where he currently sits at third \u2014 and into South Carolina, a state, like Iowa, whose Republican primary electorate is quite socially conservative.\n\n4. The calendar beyond the Big 3 favors Cruz. Winning one of the first three states is almost certainly the way a candidate makes it to March. But assuming Cruz can win Iowa (at least), the calendar starts to look very favorable to him beyond February. On March 1, what\u2019s being referred to as the \u201cSEC primary\u201d takes place; Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas will vote on that first Tuesday in March.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to handicap how those states might play out because of how much the first three states in the past have influenced who stays in the race and what their poll numbers look like. Still, Cruz\u2019s profile as the one true constitutional conservative in the race, coupled with his Southern roots and his fundraising, should make for an attractive package for voters going to the polls that day.\n\nThe next big primary day is two weeks later, on March 15, when Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio vote. There are less obvious wins in those states for Cruz, but he would almost certainly run well in North Carolina and Missouri under any circumstance and might do well in the other three states depending on who else was left in the contest.\n\nRelated: Trump Gets Ready to Rumble with Ted Cruz\n\nYes, Cruz has weaknesses \u2014 most notably that he has shown little ability to appeal beyond his conservative base and that he is far less likable than, say, Rubio, if it comes down to a one-on-one fight between the two. Rubio of Florida is also trying to make an issue of Cruz\u2019s immigration stance \u2014 insisting that Cruz has less of a hard line on the issue than he lets on.\n\nBut Trump (being Trump) and Rubio (what early state does he win?) also have problems. And Cruz\u2019s strengths are considerable, particularly when you consider how these races typically play out.\n\nCruz has begun his ascent up the early state and national polls at just about the right time. (The race will go into deep freeze from around next week through the beginning of 2016.) His campaign is perfectly positioned to make him the last man standing.
