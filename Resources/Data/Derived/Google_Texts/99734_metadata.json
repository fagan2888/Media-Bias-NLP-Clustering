Ted Cruz, and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nThat country, it will come as little surprise to anyone who has followed the long-distance flirtation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, is Russia.\n\nRelated: Only the Best? Why Trump Is Shaking Up His Campaign\n\nIn fact, it wasn\u2019t even close. The Russian people surveyed by YouGov supported Trump over Clinton by a margin of 21 percent. For reference, Trump\u2019s next-best showing in the poll was in China, where he lost to Clinton by 12 points -- a 33-percentage point swing.\n\nMexico, unsurprisingly given Trump\u2019s antagonistic stance toward the US\u2019s southern neighbor, was the most likely to prefer Clinton to Trump, with a margin of 54 percent. However, north of the border Clinton didn\u2019t do nearly as well. Canadians gave her the nod over the former reality television star by only 17 points.\n\nRelated: Let the Games Begin -- Republicans Begin Fight Over Convention Rules\n\nThat Trump should do well in Russia is no doubt due in part to Putin\u2019s favorable public remarks about him. The Russian president has praised Trump\u2019s business acumen and touted him as the clear leader in the race to be the next president.\n\nTrump, for his part, ate it up, and has frequently noted that Putin referred to him as \u201cbrilliant\u201d last year. He also appeared to defend the Russian strongman against allegations that a suspicious number of journalists have turned up dead in Russia during Putin\u2019s rule.\n\nTrump insists that as president, he would form a strong bond with Putin, and uses the Russian leader\u2019s comments as proof. However, there\u2019s a fairly persuasive argument that in talking up a brash billionaire, Putin is just returning to his KGB roots with a little light trolling of the US establishment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "That country, it will come as little surprise to anyone who has followed the long-distance flirtation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, is Russia.", "title": "There\u2019s Only One Country That Isn\u2019t Worried About a Trump Presidency", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/19/There-s-Only-One-Country-Isn-t-Worried-About-Trump-Presidency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04192016_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/19/There-s-Only-One-Country-Isn-t-Worried-About-Trump-Presidency", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04192016_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "That country, it will come as little surprise to anyone who has followed the long-distance flirtation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, is Russia.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "That country, it will come as little surprise to anyone who has followed the long-distance flirtation between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, is Russia.\nThe Russian president has praised Trump\u2019s business acumen and touted him as the clear leader in the race to be the next president.\nTrump insists that as president, he would form a strong bond with Putin, and uses the Russian leader\u2019s comments as proof.\nThe Russian people surveyed by YouGov supported Trump over Clinton by a margin of 21 percent.\nTrump, for his part, ate it up, and has frequently noted that Putin referred to him as \u201cbrilliant\u201d last year."}
