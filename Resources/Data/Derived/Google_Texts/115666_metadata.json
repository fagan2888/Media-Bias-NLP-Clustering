And attorneys behind the latest complaint say further legal action is coming.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed the complaint with the state licensing agency after Genesys Hospital in the city of Grand Blanc refused on multiple occasions to grant Jessica Mann, 37, a tubal ligation that she requested. Her doctor recommended the procedure on the grounds that further pregnancies would pose unsustainable risks to her system because of she has a life-threatening brain tumor.\n\nThe hospital \u2014 affiliated with Missouri-based Catholic health care organization Ascension Health \u2014 rejected Mann\u2019s requests, ACLU Michigan attorney Brooke Tucker told Al Jazeera. The hospital said it did so because it abides by The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, written by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Tucker said. Those directives prohibit various sterilization, abortion and end-of-life services that the bishops have determined do not comport with Roman Catholic doctrine.\n\n\u201cAs a Catholic health care system, we follow the ethical and religious directives of the church. Beyond that, we can\u2019t comment on this patient\u2019s particular case,\" said Genesys spokeswoman Cindy Ficorelli.\n\nMann is due in two days, Tucker said.\n\n\u201cHer insurance doesn\u2019t make it easy for her to pick up and go to another hospital,\u201d she added. Without a referral, Mann will need to pay \u201ctens of thousands of dollars out of pocket\u201d to go to a facility that will perform a tubal ligation, which Tucker said would be safest to perform during the planned cesarean-section birth of her expected child.\n\nTucker said she hopes the complaint will \u201cinspire [Gensys] to reconsider their position.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is also designed \u2014 like other pending ACLU actions \u2014 to address the issue of Catholic health care institutions refusing to provide certain procedures.\n\nMary-Kay Barbieri, a vocal opponent of Catholic hospital mergers with secular institutions, said in an earlier interview with Al Jazeera that many non-Catholic hospitals merged or partnered with Catholic institutions after small rural hospitals struggled to contend with quality standards mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Some of those secular institutions stopped providing reproductive procedures after joining efforts with the cash-flush Catholic institutions, she added.\n\nCases like Mann\u2019s are \u201cincreasingly becoming a larger issue, just because there are more Catholic hospitals and more patients are obtaining care from them,\u201d Tucker said. After previous lawsuits, she said, she received requests to represent several other women. \u201cThis will not be the last legal action taken to protect pregnant women,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we hope someone will step in to give women the care they deserve.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU is also representing a group of women suing Trinity Health, one of the largest Catholic hospital groups in the nation, for allegedly refusing women reproductive health care procedures. In a separate action, the ACLU is appealing a July federal court ruling against Tamesha Means, who sued Mercy Health Partners \u2014 a Trinity affiliate \u2014 for allegedly repeatedly turning her away while she was miscarrying.\n\nTucker said Catholic hospitals refusing certain procedures is part of a broader attempt by various entities in the country to deny women the health care they want and need.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen outside of the Catholic hospital context is legislators inserting themselves into a doctor\u2019s office and seeing them make decisions that should be between doctors and patients. Now a private body is inserting itself into a doctor\u2019s office with no other purpose than to promote their own religious beliefs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospital won't tie tubes of woman with brain tumor; ACLU says it's taking on more Catholic hospitals on similar issues", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/14/michigan-aclu-takes-on-catholic-hospital-for-refusing-tube-tying.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/14/michigan-aclu-takes-on-catholic-hospital-for-refusing-tube-tying/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Pregnancy_antidepressants_060215.1444865958852.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "Hospital won't tie tubes of woman with brain tumor; ACLU says it's taking on more Catholic hospitals on similar issues", "title": "Michigan ACLU takes on Catholic hospital for refusing tube tying"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 23:39:44 GMT", "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/14/michigan-aclu-takes-on-catholic-hospital-for-refusing-tube-tying/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.Pregnancy_antidepressants_060215.1444865958852.jpg", "description": "Hospital won\u2019t tie tubes of woman with brain tumor; ACLU says it\u2019s taking on more Catholic hospitals on similar issues", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Michigan ACLU takes on Catholic hospital for refusing tube tying"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Women's Rights, Michigan, Catholic Church, Health, Abortion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3215\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAs a Catholic health care system, we follow the ethical and religious directives of the church.\nThe hospital \u2014 affiliated with Missouri-based Catholic health care organization Ascension Health \u2014 rejected Mann\u2019s requests, ACLU Michigan attorney Brooke Tucker told Al Jazeera.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen outside of the Catholic hospital context is legislators inserting themselves into a doctor\u2019s office and seeing them make decisions that should be between doctors and patients.\nThe hospital said it did so because it abides by The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services, written by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Tucker said.\nSome of those secular institutions stopped providing reproductive procedures after joining efforts with the cash-flush Catholic institutions, she added."}
